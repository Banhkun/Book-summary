## Chapter 3: Defining a Vision

The first component of the EOS™ is your vision. Most entrepreneurs have a vision for their company, which they assume everyone else can see as well as they can. But many times, others in the organization _don’t_ see it—and when people are confused, they go in different directions and visions can’t be realized.

**To get traction—the ability to execute, or make the company’s vision a reality—you need**

**to clearly define and communicate your vision**.

To create a vision, determine the following:

  1. Your defining values
  2. Your company’s main focus
  3. Your 10-year goal
  4. Your marketing strategy
  5. Your three-year goal
  6. Your one-year goal
  7. Your quarterly priorities
  8. Your issues



If you prefer, you can download the Vision/Traction Organizer V/TO tool free to fill in your answers.

### 1) Your Defining Values

**Creating a vision starts with defining three to seven core values that serve as guiding principles for your company**. They define your culture and who you are. When your core values are clear and compelling, you’ll attract people who share them and discourage those who don’t from sticking around.

You build a culture around your core values by letting them guide you when you hire, fire, review, and reward people. In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras write that successful companies defined their core values early in their development and built a culture around them.

In contrast, most businesses lack clarity about where they’re going, which hinders their growth.

#### How to Determine Your Core Values

Here are four steps to determine your company’s core values:

**Step 1** : Think of three people in your company who stand out as star performers.

**Step 2** : List the characteristics these people embody. What do they do or what values do they exemplify—for example, working hard, serving customers, and acting with integrity or imagination.

**Step 3** : Your core values are among the characteristics you listed. Combine similar values and narrow the list.

**Step 4** : Decide which three to seven values define your company. Examples are: service, results, or cutting-edge knowledge. Think about them for a month or so, then finalize them.

**Communicate them to your employees in a compelling way**. Write a speech that backs up each value with stories and examples of people in your company applying the value. Present the speech at a company-wide meeting. Also, explain the values and examples when you interview job candidates—and ask them about ways they have applied those values in their previous work. You’ll make better hires if you determine whether candidates share your values before you evaluate their skills.

When your core values are part of the common language in your organization, they’ll become a way of life.

### 2) Your Company’s Main Focus

The second step in defining your vision is determining your company's main focus. When talking about their main focus, businesses use different terms for it, including mission, core business, and “sweet spot.” Your core focus is the job your company excels at. It should get your time and resources.

It’s the responsibility of your leadership team to establish your company’s core focus and make sure nothing distracts from it. When you clarify your focus, you may discover that you need to streamline the business, eliminating unrelated product lines, positions, or even divisions that don’t fit. While this is painful, it strengthens the company in the long run.

#### How to Determine Your Focus

**To determine your core focus, you need to know two things: your company’s reason for being and its niche**. Here are some ways to think about these components.

**1) Why does your company exist?** What’s its purpose or mission? The answer doesn’t have to be unique to your business; when you answer the niche question, you’ll be looking for what’s unique or differentiates your business from others.

To define your purpose or mission, strive for an answer that:

  * Is no more than seven words
  * Is simple
  * Is bold
  * Resonates emotionally
  * Involves everyone in the company
  * Doesn’t involve money
  * Is broader than a goal



An example of a purpose or mission would be “to improve the quality of life in our town.”

**2) What’s Your Niche?** What specifically do you do that fulfills your mission? The answer should be simple and useful in making decisions about how to spend time and resources. Examples of niches include: popcorn (Orville Redenbacher) and solving complex real estate problems (a real estate company).

Here are some examples of both mission and niche, which together define a company’s core focus:

  * A paving company: being the best (mission), quality asphalt paving (niche)
  * A construction firm: exceeding expectations (mission), completing every aspect of a project (niche)
  * A laser printer company: building a great company, with great people and results (mission), simplifying companies’ printing environments (niche)



As you concentrate your company’s efforts on its core focus (purpose and niche), you’ll see increased success and profits as a result of building on what you do best. It’s like playing golf: a golf club has a “sweet spot” that, if lined up with the ball, sends the ball farther and straighter, improving your score. Your company’s core focus is its sweet spot—if you stick with it, your business will get the best results.

### 3) Your 10-Year Goal

Companies need long-term goals so they know where they’re heading and whether they’re on or off course. In _Built to Last_ , Collins and Porras write that successful companies stand out in setting big, bold, long-term goals, which the authors referred to as BHAGs: “big, hairy, audacious goals.” (Shortform note: for more information about BHAGS, read our summary of Good to Great by Jim Collins here.) When you have a big, attention-grabbing goal, you start doing things differently in the present to get there.

To make such a mental leap, focus on ends rather than means. Think of your long-term target as the “end.” Like an athlete making a long jump, focus on where you will land. When you orient your thinking this way, solutions come to you that wouldn’t otherwise.

Examples of big, bold goals include: “$10 million in revenue with 15% net income,” “5 billion gallons moved” (an oil company), and “25% of target market.”

#### How to Set a 10-Year Target

Identifying a 10-year target may take some time. Discuss with your leadership team where you want to take your company. The goal should be specific, measurable, and clear (with no gray areas).

Start by asking what the company’s revenue goal could be in 10 years. Once people start talking, firm up a target that everyone agrees on. The right target is one that generates energy throughout the company.

When your company is three years from achieving your 10-year goal, make it your three-year goal and set another 10-year target.

### 4) Your Marketing Strategy

One reason you need clarity about your core focus is so you can then focus your marketing strategy effectively. A focused strategy will increase your business, and be the basis for promotional material, messages, plans, and advertising.

**If you lack focus as a company (try to do too many different things), you’ll waste time and money on diffuse marketing messages** , printing, or consultants’ services that have little impact. For instance, if you try to do everything your customers want, it will be hard to keep up, you’ll get frustrated, and the business will be less profitable. A scattered approach may have worked in your company’s early stages, but to reach the next level of growth, you need focus.

**An effective marketing strategy has four parts** :

  1. Your target market and prospect list
  2. Your differentiators
  3. Your process
  4. Your guarantee



#### Your Target Market

Identifying your target market means defining your ideal customer. Your employees need a clear understanding of who you should (and should not) be doing business with and how.

Brainstorm with your leadership team on the following:

  * Geographic characteristics (where are your ideal customers)
  * Demographic characteristics (industry, size, type of business, job title; age, sex, income, profession)
  * Behavioral characteristics (what do they do, think, and need).



As an example of a target market, a laser printing company targets “IT directors in companies with 25 or more laser printers in Michigan and Ohio.”

Next, based on how you define your customer, create a list of prospects for your sales staff to pursue.

In the process, you may discover you have some existing customers who aren’t part of your target market. If they’re not profitable enough, you’ll need to shift your attention to better customers. By focusing on your best-prospects list—those bringing more profit with fewer hassles—you’ll turn sales around.

##### How to Create a Prospect List

Creating your list will involve: examining current prospect lists, getting referrals from clients, examining trade publications, and asking your salespeople for recommendations. Your list should include contact information for each name.

The next question is how to reach them. Most companies find that using referrals is the best method. Or you could use cold calls, direct mail, or a variety of other options appropriate to your business. Implementing a targeted approach will create a snowball effect where your sales effort is self-perpetuating. Generating new business will take less effort.

#### Your Differentiators

**As part of your marketing strategy, identify three qualities or differentiators that make your company stand out to your target customer**. (Sometimes these are referred to as uniques or your value proposition—basically, they’re what you have to offer customers)

Many businesses offer too many products or services in an effort to please everyone. As a result, they don’t stand out at anything. Your sales staff should be able to tell customers what you do better than anyone else and to look elsewhere if they want something different.

For example, Southwest Airlines’ three differentiators, under co-founder and CEO Herb Kelleher, were: the lowest fares, on-schedule flights, and having fun. This didn’t satisfy those who wanted additional services, but Kelleher famously stuck to the company’s core focus, telling dissatisfied passengers, in effect, “So long.” Stick to your differentiators and don’t apologize for them.

##### How to Choose Your Differentiators

Start by listing everything that makes your company, product or service, and people unique. Include your sales and marketing team in this exercise. Ask some of your key customers the same question. Narrow the list to the three qualities that are most important to you and your customers. None of your competitors should provide all three of these services or attributes the way you do.

For example, a property management firm focused on these differentiators: we offer personalized customer service and sales, we invest in our people, and we have an owner’s perspective.

#### Your ‘Proven Process’

In most companies, salespeople try to win over new customers by showing them a lot of numbers, visuals, and charts, which makes the salesperson sound the same as every other sales rep.

A more effective sales pitch focuses specifically on what your company does and how. You have a distinct way of delivering your product or service every time that produces a consistent result. It’s why your company is successful.

Define your “proven process” in up to seven steps, present it visually on a single sheet of paper, and give it a name, such as “The X Company Difference.” Presenting your process this way stands out and increases customer confidence in your ability to deliver. You can introduce it like this: “Here’s how we deliver great results for our customers. We have a proven process called …”

##### How to Create Your ‘Proven Process’

**Step 1** : Map out up to seven steps for delivering your service and give each step a name. For example, a financial services company listed the following process steps: Discovery, Solution Presentation 1, Competitive Bidding, Solution Presentation 2, Solution Implementation, Review and Service.

**Step 2** : Add up to five bullet points to each step for salespeople to use as talking points. In the previous example, the first step (Step 1—Discovery) listed the following subpoints: About Us, About You, Defining Your Objectives.

**Step 3** : Give your delivery process a name, like the “The X Company Difference” or “Our Proven Process.”

**Step 4** : Have a graphic designer illustrate your process and have it professionally printed.

#### Your Guarantee

Offering a guarantee as part of your marketing strategy is a way for you to differentiate yourself by calling attention to a service or quality shortcoming of your competitors.

For example, Federal Express emphasized its reliability and speed compared to others by guaranteeing overnight delivery: “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.” Similarly, Domino’s Pizza guaranteed fast delivery:: “30 minutes or it’s free.”

To come up with a guarantee for your company, think about what your customers count on you for.

You don’t absolutely need a guarantee, but you’ll be more successful if you offer one. You’re already missing business because of some area where you _don’t_ have the full confidence of potential customers. If you can get that confidence, you’ll increase your sales.

Besides increasing sales, having a guarantee puts everyone in your company on notice that they need to deliver. It also forces you and your leadership team to ensure the company has the necessary capability. Both of these strengthen your company.

##### How to Choose a Guarantee

It may take time to come up with the right guarantee for your company. **Start by identifying your target customer’s biggest concerns and frustrations**. Then develop several guarantees that will bring you more business by addressing these concerns.

Get feedback on your proposed guarantees from customers. Choose the most effective one that you can deliver—call it a pledge, commitment, or promise if you don’t like the word guarantee.

### 5) Your Three-Year Goal

Now that you know your values, focus, 10-year goal, and marketing strategy to get there, the next step in defining your vision is to create a mid-range or three-year target.

Having a picture for how things will look in three years has two benefits:

  * Your employees know where the company is going and can help make your vision a reality.
  * It makes the one-year planning process easier, because with an eye on the three-year goal, you can determine what you need to do in the next year to stay on track.



In writing your three-year goal, focus on measurables and bullet points, not details—on the end point rather than the potential hurdles.

#### How to Set a Three-Year Goal

  * Pick a date, preferably the end of a calendar year.
  * Determine what your annual revenue will be three years from now (one number, not a range). Your senior leaders need to be on board with the number.
  * Set a profit number.
  * Choose a key measurable (like number of large clients or quantity produced). For example, an oil company that supplies fuel to gas stations decided its measurable would be gallons delivered. A soup company decided to increase from 38 to 94 stores in three years.
  * Use bullet points to describe how the company will look (number of people, resources, office environment, systems, technology, product, clients).
  * Leaders should define their roles in that time frame, so everyone is aligned.



When the leadership team understands and agrees on all major points, share the three-year plan with employees.

### 6) Your One-Year Plan

Creating a one-year plan is the sixth step in defining your vision. The one-year plan, what has to happen this year, creates the traction for achieving your vision. Pick up to seven objectives for the year. When you have more than that, none stand out, your efforts are scattered, and you accomplish little. But when you focus on a few key things, you accomplish more.

#### How to Create a One-Year Plan

  * Set your future date. Set it within the calendar year regardless of where you are in the year. For instance, if you’re currently in July, set your future date as Dec. 31. After that, you can create a full one-year plan.
  * As with the three-year picture, set a revenue goal, profit goal, and a measurable consistent with your three-year measurable.
  * Choose up to seven priorities that should be completed this year to be on track to meet your three-year goal. They should be specific, measurable, and doable.
  * Budget for your one-year plan to ensure you have both the resources and a reasonable profit goal.



### 7) Your 90-Day Priorities

Once you have a one-year plan, determine your priorities (referred to in the book as “Rocks”) for the next 90 days. Like the one-year plan, your 90-day, or quarterly plan creates traction or keeps your company moving forward.

In many organizations, department heads have competing priorities. Having your leadership team determine priorities for each quarter gets everyone united. The right 90-day priorities put you on track for your one-year plan, which positions you to meet your three-year and 10-year targets. (Chapter 8 explains how to set priorities or “Rocks.”)

### 8) Your Issues

The last step in establishing a vision for your company is creating an issues list—**once you know your destination, you need to know what stands in the way**. You’ll always have issues—being clear on what they are is key to solving them

With your leadership team, discuss and list any obstacles and concerns you’re likely to encounter in pursuing your vision. Always maintain and continually update an issues list, as part of operating your business. Chapter 6 will address solving issues.

### Share Your Vision

With the completion of your vision, you have a basis for building and implementing the rest of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS™). Next, share your vision with employees so everyone is working toward the same goal. Communicate your vision with three company events:

1) A **kickoff meeting** at which you present your vision, using your core values speech and answering questions.

2) A **quarterly company status meeting** at which you share progress, review the vision, and share the priorities for the next quarter.

3) A **quarterly leadership meeting** to set both company priorities and priorities for each department to support the overall vision.

The meetings will give employees clear direction, which will enable them to make better decisions and enable you to “delegate and elevate.”

Employees typically need to hear the vision seven times before it sinks in, so it’s critical that you, as the leader, deliver a consistent message repeatedly. Expect to keep repeating your vision, as opposed to expecting employees to get it by the second or third time.

The next chapters deal with making your company’s vision a reality.
