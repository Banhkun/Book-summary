## Introduction

_Traction_ is a blueprint for business success for first-time entrepreneurs and those who’ve hit a ceiling in their business where hard work and determination are no longer enough for the business to survive and grow.

Business owner and consultant Gino Wickman explains how to structure your business using his Entrepreneurial Operating System to remove typical frustrations, so your business runs seamlessly and grows at a faster rate than you thought possible.

The system is based on practical experience, not theory. Numerous tools and templates lead business owners step by step through processes to create a structure and focus that strengthen and reenergize their organizations.

Most entrepreneurs experience one or more of the following frustrations:

  * **Lack of control** : You aren’t controlling your business, it’s controlling you. You’re putting in ever-longer hours yet barely keeping up with what’s happening in your company and market. 
  * **People** : You’re frustrated with your partners, employees, vendors, and customers. People don’t seem to hear what you say or follow through with action. No one’s on the same page.
  * **A growth ceiling** : Your business has hit a ceiling that you can’t seem to push through.
  * **You’re stuck** : Your business is spinning its wheels. The strategies and advice you’ve applied haven’t given you the traction to get going again.



Part of the problem is you’ve become so wrapped up in your business you’ve forgotten that it’s separate from you. To reach the next level, you need to build it into a self-sustaining entity, powered by an effective system rather than just your determination.

The Entrepreneurial Operating System or EOS™ builds or strengthens six key business components the author discovered while turning around his family’s company; he now teaches the system as an author and consultant. Clients using the system average 18% annual revenue growth.
