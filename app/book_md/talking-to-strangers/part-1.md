## Part 1: Two Puzzles

**There are two major puzzles about interacting with strangers that this book will attempt to answer:**

  1. Why can’t we identify when a stranger is lying to our face?
  2. Why does meeting a stranger face-to-face sometimes make it harder to make sense of that person than it would be without meeting them at all? 



This book will attempt to answer those questions, but first, let’s look at some examples of these puzzling patterns of human behavior.

### Puzzle 1 Example: Spies and the CIA

The CIA is supposed to be the most sophisticated intelligence agency in the world. But even some of the best CIA agents have failed to detect liars in their midst.

In 1987, two years before the fall of the Iron Curtain, Cuban intelligence officer Florentino “Tiny” Aspillaga grew disenchanted with Fidel Castro’s style of leadership. On June 6, he defected from his service in the Cuban government. Aspillaga drove to Vienna and immediately found his way to the American Embassy there. This is known in the spy trade as a _walk-in._ This particular walk-in was one of the most important in the Cold War.

#### Aspillaga’s Story

After his surprising appearance at the door of the U.S. Embassy, Aspillaga was taken to Germany for debriefing. He had one condition before giving up his information on Cuba: He wanted to meet the CIA agent known as “el Alpinista,” or the Mountain Climber. The Mountain Climber was highly regarded in the CIA for his impeccable and incorruptible tradecraft, so Aspillaga had always revered him.

El Alpinista was intrigued when he heard that a Cuban official had defected. He flew to Germany right away to meet with Aspillaga. There, Aspillaga revealed shocking news from behind the Iron Curtain: The CIA had over a dozen agents working as spies in Cuba at the time that had been turned into double agents working _against_ the United States. These double agents had been feeding the United States falsified information for years—all fabricated by the Cuban government.

The Latin American division of the CIA was shocked and horrified by the news. **They were supposed to be the most sophisticated intelligence agency in the world, but they had been made to look like fools.**

This was not the first time in the history of the CIA that something like this had happened. In East Germany, Aldrich Ames, one of the most senior officers in the Soviet Counterintelligence agency, was working as a double agent for the Soviet Union. And, even though the Mountain Climber later said he had always held a low opinion of Ames, he never suspected Ames as a traitor.

If the Mountain Climber, one of the best agents at one of the most selective agencies in the world, can’t pick out a liar among his own team of spies, **how can a person be expected to be able to catch a stranger in a lie?**

### Puzzle 2 Example: Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler

In 1938, Adolf Hitler announced his plan to invade the German-speaking side of Czechoslovakia. In response, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain decided to go to Germany and meet with Adolf Hitler face-to-face. He hoped to look Hitler in the eyes, get a sense of his true intentions, and measure Hitler’s capacity to be reasoned with. This was considered a daring move in the effort to avoid a world war, mostly because of how few diplomats had ever done such a thing.

On September 15, Chamberlain arrived at Hitler’s retreat in Berchtesgaden, Germany. There, Hitler said, in no uncertain terms, that he planned to invade Czechoslovakia and _only_ Czechoslovakia. The prime minister gave a long, hard look into Hitler’s eyes and determined that he was telling the truth. Upon arriving back to England, Chamberlain reassured the public that he was confident that he understood Hitler’s true intentions.

Chamberlain met with Hitler twice more after that. The two men spent hours together. Hitler even signed an agreement to keep the peace in Europe. Chamberlain made careful mental notes about everything that Hitler said and did. Once, when Chamberlain was nervous that Hitler’s “storm clouds were up,” he was only calmed by the fact that Hitler gave him a friendly handshake with both hands. That made him feel sure that Hitler was in a sound state of mind and meant to keep the peace. But Chamberlain couldn’t have been more wrong.

The mistakes Chamberlain made in his negotiations with Adolf Hitler are considered some of the most crucial mistakes of World War II. He completely misinterpreted Hitler’s intentions, with horrifying results. Chamberlain made the same assumptions with Adolf Hitler that most people make when meeting a stranger: **He believed that the observations he made from interacting with Hitler personally would be valuable, like the double-handed handshake.**

So why is it that Neville Chamberlain, one of the only diplomats to ever spend significant time with Hitler, was deceived about Hitler’s intentions? And why were other diplomats who never spent time with Hitler (like Winston Churchill) able to see the truth of Hitler’s intentions? That is Question Two, and it is a pattern of human behavior that many people have attempted to study and understand. Let’s look at another example.

### Puzzle 2 Example: Judges Vs. Artificial Intelligence

On a typical Thursday in Brooklyn, Judge Solomon was presiding over his courtroom. His primary responsibility for the day was arraignments. He had to see every defendant who had been arrested in the last 24 hours, look at their criminal history, listen to the testimony of both the prosecution and the defense, and then decide if the defendant would be offered bail and the chance to be released from custody. In short, Judge Solomon had to **look a perfect stranger in the eye, assess his character, and decide if he deserved his freedom._But does looking a person in the eye actually help you judge his nature?_**

A team from the University of Chicago, led by Sendhil Mullainathan, set out to answer that question. The experiment went like this:

  1. Mullainathan gathered the data of all 554,689 defendants that went through the NYC courts from 2008-2013. They found that 400,000 of those defendants had been released by the judges that presided over their arraignments. 
  2. Mullainathan built a computer with an artificial intelligence system. 
  3. The computer was fed the data of the same 554,689 cases. It then made its own list of the 400,000 defendants least likely to commit a crime while out on bail. 



#### The Results

  * **The defendants chosen by the computer were 25% less likely to commit a crime while waiting for trial than the defendants released by human judges.**
  * The computer flagged 1% of the defendants as “high risk,” not suited to be released. The human judges presiding over those cases released nearly half of that 1% high-risk subgroup. 
  * The defendants selected by the human judges as “high risk” were not consistent with the computer—in fact, they were from all different groups of risk likelihood, as predicted by the computer.



#### Translating the Results

**The computer was _much_ better than human judges at determining a defendant’s likelihood of committing another crime.** The study found that judges were not only setting their standards for release too low, but they were also actually mis-ranking many defendants completely.

It is important to note that the human judges that presided over these cases had three resources available to them when making their bail decision:

  1. The defendant’s record
  2. The testimony of the attorneys
  3. The judge’s own personal observations of the defendant standing before him. 



**Mullainthain’s computer _only_ had one of these three resources**—**the record of each defendant. Yet the machine still beat human judges when it came to making bail decisions._Why is it that meeting a defendant actually made the judge less likely to be able to gauge his trustworthiness?_** That’s a version of Puzzle Two.

### Word-Completion Task

The examples above were meant to illustrate the two puzzles—to show that there is a pattern in human behavior of

  1. The inability of otherwise intelligent people to decipher when a stranger is lying
  2. Becoming worse at judging a stranger once you’ve met him



**The problem at the heart of these two questions is that people assume that they can read others based on simple clues. But when it comes to strangers, nothing is as simple as it seems.**

The common word-completion task used by psychologists is a good example of this point. Take a look at the following set of words and fill in the blank letters. Do this as quickly as you can, without second-guessing your answers:

__ TER

TOU __

STR __ _

B __ T

__ NNER

Now, look at your list. Do you feel that your choices say something about who you are as a person? Do you think it’s significant if you completed the word TOUGH instead of the word TOUCH, for example?

Psychologist Emily Pronin and her team gave a group of people this exact same exercise some years ago. When asked if their choices were indicative of their personality, the people in the group said no. **They said that their own word completions were nothing but a random set of words.**

However, when Pronin gave the people in the group the word completions of other participants (strangers), they seemed to change their minds. They made assumptions about the other participants based on their word choices. For example, one participant accused another of being competitive, based on his completion of the words BEAT and WINNER.

None of these people seemed to be aware of how contradictory it is to call your own word completions random, yet make assumptions about others based on their word choices. This is an example of how strangers often misunderstand each other: A person assumes that he has insights about others, but doesn’t consider that the opposite could be true (that the stranger also has insight about him). **This person believes that he can see into the heart of a stranger based on his first impression, but would never expect a stranger to be able to do the same to him.**

The three main mistakes that people make when forming a first impression of a stranger are:

  1. Defaulting to believing the stranger will tell the truth.
  2. Assuming the stranger will be transparent.
  3. Neglecting to consider how the stranger’s context affects his behavior. 



This book will illustrate those three mistakes and how they relate to the two puzzles of interacting with strangers.
