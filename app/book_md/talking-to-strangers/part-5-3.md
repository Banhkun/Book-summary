## Part 5-3: Sandra Bland and Brian Encinia

**Sandra Bland’s arrest and subsequent suicide in jail is a tragic example of what can happen when two strangers use flawed strategies to try and understand each other.** After Bland’s suicide, Brian Encinia was fired on the grounds that he did not conduct himself with courtesy and patience, as required by the Texas State Trooper Manual. But the case is about much more than that.

Everything that happened between Brian Encinia and Sandra Bland happened because Encinia behaved exactly as he was trained to—by police officials and society as a whole.

### Brian Encinia’s Mistakes

#### Broken Default to Truth

At 4:27 p.m. on July 10, 2015, Brian Encinia noticed Sandra Bland go through a stop sign on campus. He was unable to legally pull her over at that time because the campus was outside his jurisdiction. So he drove up behind her to get a better look—to see if she had any signs of potential criminal intentions, like air fresheners or fast food wrappers. When Sandra Bland saw the police car behind her, she pulled over to let him pass. She unknowingly gave Encinia a lawful excuse to pull her over. She was pulled over for neglecting to signal her lane change.

When Encinia approached Bland’s vehicle, he saw a couple of small things that triggered him to doubt her:

  * She had Illinois license plates which caused him to question her reasons for being in town.
  * Bland had fast food wrappers in the car (because she had just driven all the way from Chicago to Texas).



Brian Encinia was taught, through his post-Kansas City police training, not to default to truth. He was taught to treat everyone like a suspect. And (because the cost of not defaulting to truth is to have mistrusting social interactions) Encinia was immediately scared of Sandra Bland because her license plate and food wrappers had already triggered his doubts.

#### Assumption of Total Transparency

When Brian Encinia approached Sandra Bland’s car on the passenger side, he immediately noticed that she was upset. Remember, Encinia was trained to assume transparency in people. So when Sandra Bland acted irritated and defensive, Encinia automatically began to assume the worst. In his testimony, Encinia said that he “immediately” knew that there was something “wrong” about Bland, based on her demeanor. He felt afraid that she was “aggressive,” and even suspected she might have a gun.

Sandra Bland was mismatched—she was an innocent driver who behaved in ways that Brian Encinia believed to indicate criminal intention. But he never stopped to consider that she was innocent, because his assumption of transparency was ingrained through his police training.

#### Neglect of Coupled Behaviors

In a single day on the job, Encinia often pulled over as many as 15 drivers in Prairie View, Texas for small infractions, like failure to signal a lane change. In fact, he had stopped three other drivers in the 30 minutes before he pulled over Sandra Bland. His post-Kansas City police training taught him that more stops would mean less crime. But remember, Sherman’s experiment showed that the needle-in-a-haystack approach only works when it is focused on particular contexts, like high-crime areas or gun ownership.

The area of Prairie View where Brian Encinia pulled Sandra Bland over was not a high-crime environment. Although Encinia said in his testimony that he had come across drugs and weapons in that area, his record shows that to be untrue. Lawrence Sherman himself was horrified that an officer would pull over a driver in that location, in the middle of the day, when the likelihood of crime was so low.

Likely, Encinia never stopped to think that the context of location and time could be coupled with the likelihood of crime, and he hadn’t been taught to think this way.

### Sandra Bland’s Context

There are several things about Sandra Bland’s context that affected her behavior in the interaction with Brian Encinia:

  * **Sandra Bland had a history of emotional instability:** Just a year before the incident with Encinia, Bland had attempted suicide after losing a baby. She had numerous scars on her arms, indicating that she often cut herself. 
  * **Bland had a negative history with police officers:** In her adult life, Sandra had at least 10 encounters with the police, including five traffic stops, which left her with $8,000 in fines. 
  * **Bland was in a completely new environment:** Sandra had just moved to a new state, started a new job, and enrolled in school. But, in the midst of this new beginning, she gets pulled over—which brings back memories of past encounters with the police. 



Without getting to know Sandra Bland, Brian Encinia had no way to know how much of an emotional crisis Bland was going through during their interaction and her following days in jail. And because he had the false confidence of someone who has been trained to assume transparency, Encinia assumed that her upset behavior was evidence of sinister intentions.

### Society’s Collective Mistakes

The death of Sandra Bland was not just a case of a bad police officer, or even a defective police department—**it was a collective failure of our society.** Everyone that Brian Encinia ever came across, in the police force or otherwise, operated with the same flawed strategies for making sense of strangers. Too few people have ever challenged those strategies or tried to replace them.

In our modern, seemingly borderless world, we have no choice but to interact with strangers. Yet we, as a society, are incompetent at making sense of the strangers we come across. _So what should we do about it?_

If our society is to avoid tragic interactions like that of Brian Encinia and Sandra Bland, we must learn to:

  * **Stop penalizing people for the human instinct to default to truth** (like the leadership team of Penn State University was penalized for not suspecting Sandusky sooner). 
  * **Remember that assuming honesty in another person is critical for human survival** (or you could end up like Harry Markopolos, too paranoid to have a meaningful social interaction). 
  * **Accept the limits of our ability to know the truth about another person**(like Mitchell and Jesson should have done when they failed to listen to Charles Morgan about the dangers of interrogating KSM). 
  * **Understand that there is no perfect strategy for interpreting a stranger’s thoughts and intentions**(even the CIA’s best agent can’t always identify a spy in his midst). 
  * **Be careful and attentive when speaking to a stranger**(don’t assume transparency or penalize mismatched individuals like Amanda Knox). 



**Most importantly, we must learn not to blame the stranger when an encounter goes awry, but to look into how our own instincts might have played a part, as well.**
