## Part 3-1: Why Do We Misinterpret Strangers?

Meeting a stranger can make it more challenging to make sense of that person than _not_ meeting him. That’s because people assume transparency in others.

**Transparency refers to the assumption that the way people present themselves outwardly (through behavior and demeanor) is an accurate and reliable representation of their inner feelings and intentions**. But that’s an unrealistic assumption to make when dealing with strangers.

Before we explore why we can’t assume others will be transparent, let’s look at how transparency works.

### Transparency and How It Works

**Facial expressions are one of the primary ways that we interpret a stranger’s feelings** (because we mistakenly assume that a person’s demeanor is an accurate representation of his feelings).

#### Coded Facial Actions

Psychologist Jennifer Fugate is an expert in the system of coding facial actions (referred to here as FACS). FACS assigns a name, or “action unit,” to each of the 43 possible muscle movements of the face. This action unit is used to notate and score people’s facial expressions like music is scored by notes on a page. For example:

  * The kind of soft, insincere-_seeming_ smile you would get from a flight attendant has a score of AU 12, based on the facial motions used to create that expression: Pulling up the corners of the lips, and leaving the rest of the face still. 
  * A genuine-_seeming_ smile has a score of AU 12 plus __ AU 6. The corners of the lips pull up _and_ the cheeks raise to crinkle the eyes. 



It is important to note that these smiles only _seem_ to be insincere or genuine based on how they look. People’s expressions are not always transparent, as discussed below.

**Transparency and _Friends_**

_Friends_ is one of the most successful and recognizable shows of all time—in part because the characters are completely transparent. To prove the connection between transparency and the success of _Friends,_ Jennifer Fugate watched the first scene of season five, episode 15 and performed a FACS analysis of each character’s expressions throughout.

At the beginning of the episode, Ross sees Chandler and Monica in a romantic moment. This is significant because Chandler is Ross’s best friend and Monica is Ross’s sister. Ross rushes to Monica’s apartment to bust in and stop them. He is frantic. Joey and Rachel come into the scene, while Chandler hides behind Monica to stay out of Ross’s warpath. Monica and Chandler announce that they are in love. Slowly, Ross comes around to being happy for them.

That might seem like a lot to keep up with, but _Friends_ is incredibly easy to follow. _Why is that?_ Because the characters are transparent, as Jennifer Fugate proved with her FACS reading of the scene.

##### The Results

  * In the moment that Ross sees Chandler and Monica embrace, his face reads: upper-lip raise, lower-lip depress, lips part, and jaw drop—all at the highest intensity rating. This is the stereotypical look of anger and disgust.
  * In the moment that Monica tells Ross she’s sorry for surprising him but that she’s in love with Chandler, her face reads: 1 + 2, which communicates classic sadness, then eyebrow raise, then the AU 12 flight attendant smile. This combines to express that she is sad to upset Ross, but happy to be with Chandler. 
  * In that same moment, Ross’s face reads: 1 + 2, classic sadness, then 1 + 12, the beginnings of happiness. His sadness has shifted into joy when he sees that Monica is happy. 



Fugate’s FACS reading proves that the actors in _Friends**portray every emotion their character goes through inwardly directly through their facial expressions—the characters are completely transparent**_. The show’s popularity is evidence that people _like_ dealing with transparent people (and characters). Transparency makes people and their stories easier to understand.

When we meet strangers, we tend to believe that they’ll be as transparent as the characters on _Friends_. This is the “ _Friends_ Fallacy.” It’s a fallacy because real life isn’t like an episode of _Friends_. In reality, strangers often aren’t transparent. So why do we assume they are?

### Is Assuming Transparency Beneficial?

In _The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals_ by Charles Darwin, Darwin argues that **it is beneficial to human survival that people are able to quickly and accurately communicate emotions to one another.**

The ability to smile, frown, and wrinkle the nose in disgust are some examples of how the human face evolved as a tool to represent internal feelings. This will probably strike you as a relatively obvious principle. After all, children everywhere naturally smile when they’re happy and frown when they’re sad, and that helps them get what they need to survive. So it seems reasonable to assume transparency.

But you should be careful not to assume that every stranger you come across will be transparent. **That assumption requires everyone you meet to express themselves in the same predictable ways**. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

#### Experiment: Transparency Across Different Cultures

Psychologist Carlos Crivelli spent years testing the limits of human transparency—he wanted to find out if people from entirely different cultures evolved to express the same emotions in the same ways. So in 2013, he teamed up with anthropologist Sergio Jarillo to conduct a social experiment in the remote Trobriands Islands.

Crivelli and Jarillo chose the Trobriands Islands because:

  * The population is incredibly small and isolated. Only 40,000 people live on the archipelago, all of whom are removed from the 21st- century lifestyle. Crivelli and Jarillo were confident that any patterns of human behavior that were consistent in places like Madrid _and_ the Trobriands could confidently be called universal behaviors. 
  * The Trobrianders have a rich and expressive language. They didn’t shy away from questions about nuances and emotional truths. This made them good subjects for a social experiment regarding human expression.



The experiment went like this:

  1. Crivelli and Jarillo showed school children in Madrid six photos of a person. Each photo conveyed a different expression: Happy, sad, scared, angry, disgusted, and neutral. 
  2. The children were asked to identify which picture went with which emotion. 
  3. Crivelli and Jarillo then went to the Trobriands Islands and showed the same photos to the people there. They asked the islanders to identify which picture went with which emotion.
  4. Crivelli and Jarillo examined the results of both groups to compare and contrast the difference of expression across the two groups. 



##### The Results

  * 100% of the Spanish school children accurately identified the photo with a happy expression, but **only 58% of the Trobrianders identified the same photo as happy**. (And the happy photo was the one that got the _most similar_ results between the two groups.)
  * The photo of what the Spanish children recognized as stereotypical fear was registered by the Trobrianders as a threatening expression. 
  * The photo that was meant to represent anger (with hard eyes, wrinkled brow, and tight lips) was completely confusing to the Trobrianders. 20% called it a happy face, 20% thought it was an expression of disgust, and 17% called it a sad face. In comparison, 91% of Spanish children correctly identified the photo as angry. 



Clearly, the residents of the Trobriands Islands have an entirely different way of expressing familiar emotions than young children in Madrid. In other words, **every human might experience the same emotions inwardly, but the way that emotion is expressed outwardly is very different from culture to culture.**

If someone from the Trobriands Islands was to encounter a child from Madrid, the assumption of transparency would make it very difficult for the two strangers to understand one another.

#### Experiment: Transparency Within a Culture

Cultures that express emotions differently aren’t the only roadblocks to transparency. German psychologists Achim Schützwohl and Rainer Reisenzein created an experiment to test how consistent someone’s expression is with how he is feeling inwardly—that is, to test **whether people are generally transparent.** The experiment went like this:

  * A participant is led down a long, very narrow hallway and into a dim room. 
  * The participant sits in the room, listens to a recording of a short story, and takes a memory test about it. 
  * While the participant is listening and being tested, a team disassembles the hallway outside the door to the room. They reset the scene outside the door as a wide-open area with green walls and a bright red chair. The participant’s best friend sits in the red chair with a serious expression and waits for the participant to come out of the testing room.
  * The participant exits the testing room, expecting to see the same hallway she walked through before. The participant is surprised to see herself in an entirely new setting. 
  * Schützwohl and Reisenzein read the participant’s facial expression with FACS. 
  * They then ask the participant to rate their level of surprise at the moment they came out of the testing room and saw the new scene. 



##### The Results

When the 60 participants that went through this experiment rated their feelings of surprise at the moment they exited the testing room, the average score among all participants was 8.14, out of 10. They were truly shocked.

Schützwohl and Reisenzein then asked each participant if he thought that level of surprise registered on his face. **Almost all of the participants were convinced that they made a transparent expression of surprise when exiting the testing room. But that wasn’t the case.** Upon reviewing the recording, Schützwohl and Reisenzein determined that only _5%_ of participants made the stereotypical expression of surprise (eyes widen, eyebrows raise, jaw drops).

The participants overestimated their own transparency—they reasoned that if they _felt_ surprised they must have also _looked_ surprised.

#### Transparency Is a Myth

Humans are not transparent—it’s all a myth. Because we have all watched the same TV shows, like _Friends_ , and read the same novels where a character’s “jaw drops in surprise,” we have been conditioned to believe that there is only one expression associated with any particular emotion. But that is unrealistic.

In reality, it takes getting to know someone well to be able to read their outward demeanor accurately. With a close friend, you come to understand their idiosyncratic expressions and what they mean to express. **But when you encounter a stranger, you often have to make assumptions based on their expressions because you don’t have any personal experience with that person.** But your assumptions are based on stereotypes, like Ross’s exaggerated facial expressions in _Friends_ , that are usually wrong.

> **Example:**
> 
> One day, George goes to take a shower. Suddenly, from the bathroom, he hears his wife scream. George runs to the kitchen and sees a man holding a knife to his wife’s throat. George is naked and wet from the shower, but he intimidatingly yells at the assailant, “Get out of here NOW.” The young man gets scared and flees the scene.
> 
> On the inside, George was absolutely terrified for his wife’s safety in that moment. But he didn’t show it on the outside. Maybe someone who knew him well would have been able to tell that George’s intimidating demeanor was his natural reaction to fear, but the assailant (a stranger) had no way to know that.
> 
> What did the assailant assume about George based on his intimidating expression—that he was dangerous, violent, cold, or something else completely? The intruder mistakenly assumed transparency (which was lucky for George and his wife).

#### Assuming Transparency Can Be Dangerous

The bail hearings described in the section _Judges vs. Artificial Intelligence_ are another exercise in transparency. Judges who look at their defendants make more mistakes in judging character than a computer that never sees the defendants at all. **Watching someone’s facial expressions is not a fail-proof way to see how that person is feeling.** Someone who is surprised might not show it, and someone who is dangerous might come across as stereotypically demure.

##### Patrick Dale Walker

A man named Patrick Dale Walker was arrested in Texas for trying to kill his girlfriend. The only reason he didn’t succeed in murdering her was that the gun jammed when he pulled the trigger. The judge presiding over the case set bail at $1 million, and Walker went to prison. But four days later, the judge lowered the bail to $25,000 and Walker was released.

The judge reasoned that four days in jail would be enough for Walker to “cool off.” He saw Walker as a polite young man with a clean record. Most important, he _saw_ that Walker was remorseful for what he had done. _But could he really see something like remorse in a stranger?_ Apparently not. Walker shot his girlfriend to death four months later.

In this case, seeing Walker made the judge worse at interpreting his intentions. **The information the judge thought he gleaned from observing Walker’s _seemingly_ remorseful behavior was actually misinformation, because Walker was not transparent. **

#### What Is the Solution?

It’s clear that looking at a stranger and assuming transparency has negative consequences. But what do we do with that information? Should judges have to sit behind a curtain when hearing their cases? That might make a certain part of the decision-making process easier, but it would also take away the humanity of the defendant. A judge needs to see the human whose freedom is on the line.

Transparency, just like truth default, is a flawed strategy for dealing with strangers. However, it is a necessary strategy. **Humanity would suffer if every social interaction was mistrusting and anonymous because social coordination is a necessary part of the human experience.** So, in an effort to keep our humanity, we make ourselves vulnerable to deception**.** That is the confusing paradox of dealing with strangers—we need to communicate, but we’re terrible at it.
