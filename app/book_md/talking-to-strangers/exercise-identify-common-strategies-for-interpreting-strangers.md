## Exercise: Identify Common Strategies for Interpreting Strangers

The most common strategies people use when interacting with strangers are default to truth, assumption of transparency, and neglect of coupled behaviors.

* * *

Think of a time that you’ve had a meaningful conversation with a stranger. What did you talk about? What impression or conclusions did you make about the stranger based on your conversation?

Now that you’ve learned the common strategies you were probably using to make draw those conclusions, try to go back and identify them. In other words, write down any times that you defaulted to truth, assumed transparency, or neglected to consider the context of that interaction.

In listing the (very human) mistakes you might have made during that interaction with a stranger, how did your impression of the stranger change? What complexities of that stranger’s character did you fail to see?
