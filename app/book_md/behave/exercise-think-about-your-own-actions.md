## Exercise: Think About Your Own Actions

Consider the ways “nurture” influences your behavior.

* * *

Recall something you did within the last week: one act that you remember clearly. This might be something you’re especially proud of, or, conversely, something that seemed out of character for you. Describe the action you’ve chosen.

What _cultural_ influences might have led you to that behavior? (Consider the common behaviors and beliefs of your in-group or religion.)

What _personal_ influences might have led you to that behavior? (Consider your experiences, morals, and state of mind at the time.)

Finally, what _environmental_ influences might have led you to that behavior? (Your physical environment, the people who were around you (if any), and how emotionally involved you were in the situation.)
