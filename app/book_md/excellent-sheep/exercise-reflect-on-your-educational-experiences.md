## Exercise: Reflect on Your Educational Experiences

 _Excellent Sheep_ explores how the education a student receives influences their opportunities, self-insight, and skillset. Take a moment now to reflect on how _your_ educational experience has impacted you and what hopes you have for future educational experiences.

* * *

What role has privilege, and/or a lack of privilege, played in your education? (Consider factors such as your social identity and your access to college preparation resources. For example, a student from a low-income family may feel the need to major in a field that would guarantee them a high-paying job after college.)

The author describes a high-quality education as one that encourages self-insight and helps students build a meaningful life. What’s an educational experience you’ve had that helped you develop self-insight and move towards your vision for a meaningful life? (Reflect on any experience you consider to have been educational. It could be an experience from formal schooling, such as a high school history class that encouraged cross-cultural understanding. Or, it could be an experience outside of schooling, such as learning compassion through coaching a basketball team.)

What are some educational experiences you could seek out in the future to further develop your self-insight and capacity for building a meaningful life? (For example, you could sign up for therapy or host a foreign exchange student.)
