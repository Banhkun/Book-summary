## Exercise: Visualize the Future

Everyone has things they wish they could change about themselves or their lives. Some people spend their whole lives thinking about those changes, or trying to make them—and sometimes, like Rita, they don’t even realize the progress they’ve made.

* * *

What’s something about yourself that you wish you could change?

What’s one thing you could do to start making that change?

What will your life look like after that change is made; or, in other words, how will you know that you’ve done it?

Thinking about how you’ll know when you’ve accomplished your goal, what progress have you already made (possibly without realizing it)?
