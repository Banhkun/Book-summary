## Part 2: Lori’s Patients and Problems

**Part 2 of the book reveals more of Lori’s backstory, and why the breakup sent her spiraling the way it did.** Lori’s deeper, hidden issues are paralleled by the issues of several patients she treats, which allows her to write in greater detail and from other perspectives about common problems people face.

This part begins with Lori at a weekly get-together with her colleagues. They’re discussing a particularly troublesome patient of Lori’s, a young woman named Becca who suffers from abandonment issues.

Their sessions invariably run in circles, with Becca completely unwilling to open up to Lori. Though they’ve been meeting for months, Becca has made no noticeable progress. However, when Lori asks Becca why she keeps coming back if she’s not seeing the results she wants, Becca accuses Lori of abandoning her just like everyone else.

Finally, Lori’s colleagues convince her to stop seeing Becca. Lori can’t help someone like Becca, who’s unwilling to examine herself.

Lori says that the most difficult kind of patients are the ones, like Becca, who keep coming but never change. Ironically, when she discusses these events with Wendell, he implies that **she is exactly the same kind of patient: She talks endlessly about her ex-boyfriend, never about her own issues, and therefore can’t make any progress.** This is a major turning point for Lori, when she’s able to see herself behaving exactly like Becca and realize that she needs to make some changes.

### The Pre-Confession Dream

One of Lori’s patients, a young woman named Holly, tells her about a dream she had where she took revenge on a girl who had ignored and pretended not to know her in high school, even though they had several classes together. Holly felt embarrassed and ostracized every time this other girl pretended not to know who she was—in her dream, Holly turned the tables and pretended not to know the other girl, as she was recounting all the classes they’d had together and all the years they’d known each other.

While Holly found the dream very satisfying, Lori sees it as a sort of pre-confession.**Dreams can often point to our deepest fears and worries, sometimes things that we aren’t aware of ourselves.** For example, Holly might be experiencing a deep-seated fear of embarrassment or feeling left out.

Shortly after that, Lori has a pre-confession dream of her own. She dreams that she’s going clothes shopping when she bumps into her ex, who’s looking for something for his new girlfriend. Lori asks how old the new girlfriend is, and she is pleased to hear that she’s turning 50—not only is she not the 25-year-old Lori had imagined, she’s actually even older than Lori.

Lori then catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and realizes that in this dream she is, indeed, very old; in her 80s or 90s at least. After she sees herself in the mirror, her ex asks her whether she’d ever finished writing her book. When she asks what book, he says he means the one about her death. Then Lori wakes up.

### The Unwritten Book

**Haunted by her dream, Lori admits to her therapist Wendell that there’s another problem she’s been avoiding: She’s contracted to write a book, and she has already accepted an advance for it, but she hasn’t been writing it.**

Lori sees herself not just as a therapist, but as a writer too—it’s a key part of her self-image and she can’t give it up. Her agent has warned her that if she doesn’t fulfill this contract, she probably won’t get another—that is, she won’t be a writer anymore. Also, Lori has already spent the advance money, which she would have to return if she breaks the contract.

The book Lori’s supposed to be writing is about happiness but, ironically, thinking about it now fills her with anxiety and guilt. Lori’s unable to write because she doesn’t feel a meaningful connection to the material—what she would be able to put into a book and cite research for would barely scratch the surface of what she wanted to say.

Lori had a previous offer—for a substantial amount of money—to write a book about helicopter parenting, which she turned down for the opposite reason; she felt the topic had been done to death, and the world didn’t need yet another book about helicopter parenting. However, now she feels that she made a mistake and should have written it, so she wouldn’t have needed to take on the happiness book. **In both cases, she couldn’t write the books because they didn’t feel meaningful.**

Lori feels trapped, but Wendell says he’s reminded of an old cartoon: a character behind bars, shaking them, apparently trying to escape, but there are no walls around him. The character hasn’t noticed that he’s not trapped, because he hasn’t looked for other ways out.

Wendell leads Lori through an exercise where she imagines herself as that character. She vividly pictures herself trapped in that cell, shaking the bars, begging to be let out. In Lori’s imagination, the cell represents her future possibilities, or the lack of them: No loving relationship, no ability to write the happiness book, no way to get out of writing it, no hope for anything but a stagnant, miserable life.

However, then Lori imagines herself looking to the side and seeing that there are no walls on this awful cell. She takes a few hesitant steps around the bars. She starts to walk, and then to run, and she notices that there are no prison guards chasing her. There never were any guards; she’s been free to leave all along, to find what she truly wants instead of staying trapped in a prison of her own making.

Lori immediately feels a great weight lift. This is the first major breakthrough in her treatment. However, both she and Wendell know that it’s only the first step—**she now understands that she’s the one trapping herself, but what she does with that insight is up to her.**

### Confronting Death

As mentioned earlier, one of Lori’s main concerns is that she’s now middle-aged. **While the end of her life is hopefully still far in the future, she’s subconsciously starting to think about it.** Two of her clients are also confronting death—however, they are facing it much more immediately and in very different circumstances. One of these is Julie, the cancer patient from Part 1.

Meanwhile, Julie has been working on her bucket list and decides that she wants to work as a cashier at Trader Joe’s. She sees how the cashiers are able to interact and connect with their customers; they make immediate, concrete improvements to the customers’ days by bagging their items and chatting with them. Both Lori and Julie’s husband think this idea is absurd, but Julie gets a weekend job at Trader Joe’s anyway.

One day while Lori is shopping, she winds up in Julie’s checkout line and finds that Julie is extremely happy there. **Lori wonders whether she and Julie’s husband had secretly been jealous of Julie’s certainty about what she wanted and her determination to do it even though others told her not to.**

#### Rita

The second patient confronting death is Rita, a woman in her late 60s. Rita’s profoundly unhappy with her life and the decisions she’s made. She’s divorced several times over, estranged from her children, and retired from a job she never liked. In their first session, she tells Lori that she thinks she’s past help, but wants to try one more time. She says that if her life hasn’t improved within a year, she’s planning to end it. Rita also confesses that hearing the happy family across the hall from her apartment makes her extremely angry.

Rita spends her days alone at home painting, napping, or watching TV. Her only regular contact comes from exercise classes at the local YMCA and the pedicures that she gets just to feel a human touch. Lori encourages her to try reaching out and making new connections. Rita starts using a dating app, but she says she’s disgusted by the bodies of the men in her age group. Rita seems to have a tendency to self-sabotage, always finding reasons why anything that might be good for her won’t work out.

Despite Rita’s struggles, Lori encourages her to keep trying to make connections, romantic or otherwise. However, privately, Lori isn’t sure what kind of new “family” Rita will be able to make for herself at this point. **This parallels Lori’s struggles in her own life and her uncertainty about finding a new romantic partner and creating a new family of her own.**

### Facing Relationship Problems

Two of Lori’s other patients mirror her relationship issues and inability to feel emotionally connected to her writing.

#### John

One of the patients is John, a workaholic TV industry executive. He has anger issues and explodes at the smallest provocation. He also thinks people are “idiots” and tends to push others away. In John’s sessions with Lori, he is pushy, insulting, and rude. He also breaks many of the “rules” of therapy, texting and emailing during his sessions and ordering food to be brought to the office. He blames his problems on everyone else, including his wife. His go-to explanation for everything is that he’s surrounded by idiots.

**In John, Lori sees a twisted reflection of the life she’d planned with her ex-boyfriend: He’s married, but he and his wife are clearly unhappy together.** In fact, his wife has talked about leaving due to his anger issues and lack of emotional availability. However, John does seem genuinely fond of his two daughters and his dog. Lori thinks that might be a gap in his emotional defenses that she can use to make progress with him.

At first Lori is frustrated with John, but after a few sessions she recognizes his pattern: **He blames others so that he doesn’t have to take responsibility for his own problems.** Even when he takes Lori’s advice by trying to pay attention to his wife and put his work down at the end of the day, he says he’s only doing it to appease his wife—then blames her for still being unhappy with him. During this time, Lori also learns that John lost his mother when he was only six years old. She believes that he never properly processed that loss, and it might be the reason for his emotional distancing.

After about six months of therapy, John comes in extremely upset and angry that his wife wanted to get their older daughter a cell phone. He can’t or won’t explain why this upsets him so much, but he keeps repeating that it’s stupid for a girl her age to have her own phone.

While ranting about how stupid the idea—and his wife—are, he lets slip the name Gabe. When Lori asks who Gabe is, John answers that Gabe is his son. He leaves the session immediately after. The next week John doesn’t show up for his session, and he calls shortly after his scheduled time to say he’s quitting therapy.

Lori doesn’t know exactly why John decided to leave, but she says she’s not ready to quit on him quite yet. This is the end of John’s involvement in this part of the book.

#### Charlotte

Charlotte, another patient of Lori’s, came to the clinic because she’d been feeling anxious, although nothing had happened to make her feel that way.

Charlotte tends to fall for unstable, emotionally unavailable men, even though she claims to want somebody who’s dependable and sincere. When she goes on a date with someone who has the qualities she claims to be looking for, she inevitably says that there was no connection.

**Lori believes that Charlotte subconsciously associates anxiety and instability with love, due to growing up in a household where her parents fought frequently.** When she’s with someone who doesn’t make her anxious, she interprets that as a lack of a “spark” between them.

There’s also her drinking problem, which she has tried—so far unsuccessfully—to address. During one of her sessions she tells Lori, apparently without realizing the irony in it, that she had gotten drunk the night before because she was mad at herself for skipping that night’s Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Perhaps the strangest thing about Charlotte is that she believes her real addiction isn’t to alcohol but to therapy. While many patients stay in touch with their therapists between sessions, especially if there’s a major development or a crisis, Charlotte seems to do so obsessively. She emails Lori about inconsequential things or sends her funny pictures several times a week. She’s also “quit” her treatment and come back to it several times, just like an alcoholic does with drinking.

She once came back to therapy after getting a DUI, totaling her car, and breaking her arm. Then she admitted that her real problem might be alcohol, not therapy. However, a year later, she was still drinking.

Lori thinks this “therapy addiction” may be a result of Charlotte’s simultaneous desire for, and fear of, genuine human connection. Because of those contradictory feelings, therapy is the perfect setting for someone like Charlotte—she gets to open up to someone whose job is to understand and talk to people, but at the end of the session, she always gets to leave.

**Lori has similar issues to Charlotte’s, though not to the same extent.** She constantly holds parts of herself back from Wendell, which impedes her recovery. She also got into her crisis in the first place because she was hurt by an emotionally unavailable man.
