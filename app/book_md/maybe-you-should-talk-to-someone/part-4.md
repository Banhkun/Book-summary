## Part 4: Healing and Moving Forward

**The fourth and final part of _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_ brings the stories of Lori’s patients, and Lori’s own treatment, to a close. **In this section**** Julie, Rita, and John all find what they’re looking for in their own ways. Lori, too, gains a better understanding of herself and what caused her to break down the way she did. While the work of healing is ongoing, they’ve all made great progress and have bright futures. The obvious exception is Julie; in her case, the progress and the future belong to her husband and other loved ones.

Charlotte is not heavily involved in this part, except to note that she’s also made significant progress and has begun using the tools she’s learned in treatment to see her through rough spots in her life. Aside from a single one-night relapse, she’s also stayed completely sober. She has another near-crisis where she considers leaving therapy, but she opts to stay in treatment with Lori. While there’s not much detail about her, it’s implied that her treatment is going well and that she’s going to be okay.

### Julie Finds Peace

Julie is staying in therapy until she dies, but a lot of that therapy is now spent sitting in comfortable silence. Julie feels safe in Lori’s office, away from other people and their feelings about her illness and approaching death.

Julie mentions that she’s hired a party planner to plan her funeral reception. While many people in her cancer support groups say that they don’t want people to be sad at their funerals, Julie rejects that idea. She likes the thought of celebrating her life, but also wants people to grieve her death. **She wants to know that she affected people; in other words, that she mattered.**

Some time later, Julie passes away—peacefully, in her home, as she’d wanted. Julie herself made the choice that it was time to go. She came to her final round of “Would You Rather,” and decided that she’d rather not lose any more of herself just to stay alive. She stopped eating and died a few days later.

#### The Funeral

Attending Julie’s funeral puts Lori in a difficult spot professionally. **For one thing, doctor-patient confidentiality doesn’t end at death, so Lori can’t say anything about their sessions, not even that she was Julie’s therapist.** That could be uncomfortable if anyone asks how they knew each other, leaving Lori to either lie or evade the question.

Furthermore, some people might feel that getting involved in a patient’s personal life—or death, as the case may be—is crossing a line professionally. **Recall from Part 1 that there is a powerful stigma around mental health issues, and many people feel uncomfortable around therapists.** As a result, usually therapists have to grieve on their own when a patient passes away, even though they may have known the deceased better than anyone else.

However, Lori promised Julie that she’d go. In spite of all the possible complications, she keeps her promise.

Julie’s funeral is attended by hundreds of people. When her husband gets up to speak, he says that Julie wanted to be sure he’d always have love in his life, and that she hoped he’d eventually remarry. She warned him to be honest with the women he dated as he was recovering from her death, but she also hoped that he would eventually find someone to love as deeply as they had loved each other. He returns the sentiment, saying that he hopes Julie finds someone to love wherever she is now.

**Leaving the funeral, Lori recalls that Julie had frequently asked if Lori would think about her. In other words, would a part of her survive in Lori?** Thinking about this, Lori ponders how at first she’d been worried that being Julie’s therapist would make her insensitive to others’ problems. She imagined herself talking with people having comparatively minor issues, like a spouse who doesn’t initiate sex, and comparing those problems to Julie’s cancer.

However, she found that just the opposite happened: Julie’s situation made Lori aware that everyone’s time is limited, and every hour counts. It was one more thing helping Lori to realize that she wants to be fully present in every moment, including—or perhaps especially—with her patients. Recall one of the fundamental concerns: mortality. The way to cope with mortality is not to ignore it, but to embrace it, and get as much out of life as you can.

**Even years later, Lori still thinks about Julie. The clearest evidence is that she’s a major character in _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_.**

### Rita Finds Love and Family

Rita has written a long letter to Myron going into great detail about her past: her abusive husband, how and why she failed to protect her children, and how her children still hate her for it. Rita originally wrote the letter because she was sure that Myron wouldn’t want to be with her once he knew the truth. **However, the letter also serves as Rita finally opening herself up completely, similar to how John finally lowered his defenses about his son Gabe.**

Rita brings this letter to a therapy session and reads it for Lori. While reading it is extremely painful for Rita, after she’s finished she seems calmer than Lori’s ever seen her. Lori asks whether the letter is really for Myron, or if it’s what Rita wants to say to her children. Though Rita doesn’t respond, she and Lori know that the answer is “both.”

Rita comes in for another session a few days after her birthday—the birthday on which she’d originally planned to kill herself. She and Lori celebrate together, and **though this isn’t the end of Rita’s treatment, she’s come a long way toward making peace with herself and her life.**

Rita also says that Myron finally responded to her letter after more than a week. It was hard for him to come to terms with this side of Rita, but now he thinks that maybe her difficult past is what makes her so interesting and so loving. Rita and Myron spent the night together after that, and have since become romantic partners.

**Sometimes Rita still regrets her past, or is tempted to retreat into her despair, but she draws on what she’s gained from therapy to see her through.** Rita continues reaching out to her children, no longer looking for forgiveness, but simply trying to make a connection and move forward as a family. Over time, three of her four children respond. The youngest is, so far, unable to move past his anger. Rita, her three children, and Myron become something of a disconnected, dysfunctional family, but much more of a family than she’s had in decades.

Though her life is far from perfect, Rita now seems to have everything she wanted when she first came into Lori’s office. **Most important of all, though she’ll always carry the pain of her mistakes and the knowledge that she can’t fix all of them, Rita is happy.** If Rita, who is much older than Lori, can fix her life and find happiness again, then there’s no reason at all why Lori can’t do the same.

### John Accepts That He May Never Have Closure

John mentions that he’s finally told his wife he’s been attending therapy. She was surprised and angry that he’d been seeing Lori without telling her. She also demanded to know whether he’d gone there to talk about Gabe, their dead son. John is confused and irritated by her reaction. Lori suggests that maybe she was upset because she’d spent so long wanting him to open up emotionally to her, and now she’s learned that he’s been opening up to someone else for months.

John also says that he and his family had finally talked about Gabe, then he starts crying again. He’s tried to keep going ever since Gabe died, locking up his feelings and working like a machine to take care of his family. **However, you can’t kill one emotion without killing all of them. By repressing his pain, John has also repressed his joy, and this is why he can’t connect with anyone and why people aggravate him so much.** Talking about Gabe has been painful for John, but not as much as _not_ discussing him had been.

John says that they need closure, a way to move on. However, Lori doesn’t think there’s any such thing. When people ask for closure, what they really want is to stop feeling.

People often think they can reach acceptance, the last step in the popular five stages of grief. However, those steps originally referred to terminally ill people learning to accept their own deaths, like Julie had to. **In fact, the idea of “acceptance” can be actively harmful to people who are grieving—they think there must be something wrong with them, since they haven’t been able to reach it.**

Later, John questions whether he and his wife are right for each other after all. They’ve made each other very unhappy, between John’s crushing work schedule and his wife never seeming satisfied with what he does as a husband and father. He wonders whether they only stayed married because they both wanted to hold the family together after Gabe’s death. Lori suggests instead that maybe each of them wanted to rediscover aspects of themselves that seemed to have disappeared along with their son. She thinks that maybe the two of them can fall in love with each other all over again.

#### The Mental Immune System

Aside from all of his problems, John has also had moments of happiness like he thought he would never experience again. When playing with his daughter Grace he felt—for a short time—as if everything were normal, like his son Gabe had never died. He brought this up with Lori because he felt that being happy again was somehow betraying Gabe’s memory—how could he ever be happy when his son was dead?

Lori tells John that, **just like the body has systems to protect itself and heal from disease and injury, the psyche can also strengthen itself after being damaged.** A Harvard study found that people regularly responded to difficult events, such as a divorce or the death of a loved one, better than they expected to. People who thought they would never feel joy again eventually went out and had fun, and people who thought they could never love again got into new relationships and rediscovered a level of intimacy they thought would be impossible.

**While things can never go back to how they were before Gabe’s death, it’s absolutely possible—and healthy—for John to recover and continue living his life.**

#### The Power of “Sometimes”

In a later session, John asks whether Lori thinks he’s a jerk. Lori is surprised by the question—it shows uncharacteristic self-awareness and vulnerability on John’s part. This could be a sign that John’s mental immune system is finally working to heal him, but she also wonders if it’s an overcorrection of his previous defense mechanism: Perhaps he’s gone from “I’m good, other people are bad” to “other people are good, I’m bad.”

She responds that she doesn’t think he’s a jerk, but that he sometimes acts like one to protect himself. It turns out that _sometimes_ is a key word for John. It allows him to get out of his black-and-white thought patterns: It’s not that he’s always a good person or a bad one, or that he should always be happy or always be grieving, but that everything—including happiness—comes and goes.

During this same session, John says that things are going better with his family, and that he and his wife have been referred to a couples therapist. Lori encourages this new direction for John and says that he can discuss anything he’s uncomfortable or unsure about in couples therapy with her.

**John’s attitude is notably different in this part: Opening up to Lori and his wife has lowered some of his defenses, allowing him to be more emotionally receptive and genuine.** Similarly, by opening up about her fears about uncertainty and death, Lori is able to finally confront them and move forward in her life.

### Lori’s Defense Mechanisms

While speaking with her therapist Wendell, Lori relates an incident where she and her son blew up at each other because each of them was angry at someone else. Lori had been angry at her mother over a conversation they’d had earlier, while her son had been angry about how some other kids had treated him. This is a classic example of _displacement_ , a defense mechanism where you shift your feelings about a person or situation to a safer target.

There are all kinds of defense mechanisms to deal with anxiety, anger, or distasteful urges. Everyone uses them, often without realizing that they’re doing so. For example, a smoker might say—and truly believe—that his breathing problems are because of allergies or the weather. That would be _denial_. These are some examples of _primitive_ mechanisms.

Most of the behaviors that Lori’s patients, and Lori herself, have shown were the results of various unhealthy defense mechanisms. John directed his anger and grief at everyone around him, and rationalized that his problems were everyone else’s fault. Charlotte was in denial about her drinking problem and her self-destructive pattern of falling for people who hurt her.

However, there are also healthy defense mechanisms, called _mature_ mechanisms. One classic example is _sublimation_ , where unhealthy or inappropriate feelings and urges are channeled into something constructive. For example, a man who wants to hurt people could get into boxing. Lori could be sublimating her own pain into her therapy work: helping others in order to come to terms with her own problems. Also, _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_ is, itself, an act of sublimation—turning her painful experiences into something creative.

### Lori Comes to Terms With Uncertainty

Remembering the incident with her mother, Lori can recognize now that she’s overbearing and controlling out of love. In fact, Lori sometimes acts the same way with her own child. She knows that eventually her son will leave for college or whatever his future holds, and she wishes both her mother and her son could stay around forever—even though that’s both impossible and unhealthy.

Related to her fears about losing her son are Lori’s ongoing concerns about her medical condition. One of her tests returned a marker for _Sjogren’s syndrome_ , an autoimmune condition, but she doesn’t show the most common symptoms of it. It could be the disease presenting unusually, or it could mean that Lori has something else. The continued uncertainty scares her, as does the thought that she might die young and leave her son alone.

Wendell asks Lori what she’d prefer: being a mother who’s never present because she’s worried about dying, or being a mother who knows her time might be limited and savors each moment with her son as a result. Obviously the second choice is the more desirable one, and Lori acknowledges that her illness has already had this kind of impact on her life. **It’s why she gave up on writing a book she didn’t care about, why she started dating again, and why she’s been reaching out to her mother, whom she used to find unbearable.**

In another session, Lori tells Wendell that she’s started writing another book. This new book will eventually become _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_. The book didn’t come from her agent; she was inspired to write it based on her recent experiences. Unlike the previous book that she couldn’t bring herself to write, Lori feels almost compelled to write this one. She and Wendell both agree that it’s meaningful to her.

Shortly after, the two of them start talking about bringing Lori’s treatment to an end. Lori isn’t quite ready to let go of Wendell, but she agrees that she doesn’t need the weekly therapy anymore. Even when doctor and patient agree that it’s time to end the treatment, therapy doesn’t stop abruptly. There’s a process called _termination_ where the two summarize what they’ve done together. They also have to make sure the patient has the right tools to keep making progress in his or her life.

Eventually, though, Lori has her final session with Wendell. She says that she doesn’t want to consider this goodbye, though—more like an extended pause in their ongoing conversation. She also says that someday, perhaps, she’ll need treatment again and will come back.

As she leaves Wendell’s office for the last time (for now), Lori notices that the nearest crosswalk signal is about to change so she can cross. However, instead of rushing to catch it, she takes a moment to just enjoy the feeling of the sun on her skin. **This final image shows how Lori, despite not knowing how much longer she may have to live, now has the ability to live in the moment and fully appreciate life.**
