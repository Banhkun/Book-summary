## Exercise: Reflect on Your Flower Diagram

The flower exercise helps you determine what you’d like to do for work.

* * *

Think about your current or most recent job. How well does it meet the criteria of each of your seven petals? Did/do you enjoy this job?

Imagine a job that meets the criteria on all seven of your petals. What would this job look like? (Don’t picture a specific existing job; imagine the organization’s purpose, what your duties would be, and so on.)
