## Exercise: Negotiate Salary and Benefits

It’s your right to negotiate salary and benefits.

* * *

Imagine you’re about to be offered a job. How would you anticipate what salary range the employer will offer? Consider conducting informational interviews, researching online, and so on.

What salary range will you counter with? Remember that the bottom of your range should be near the top of the employer’s.

To get a higher salary, you’ll have to justify why you deserve it. How would you do so?

What kind of benefits (life insurance, and so on) would you like to negotiate for?
