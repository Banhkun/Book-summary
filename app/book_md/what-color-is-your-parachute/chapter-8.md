## Chapter 8: What to Do When It’s Not Working

Let’s say you’ve tried everything in all the above chapters and you’re still not employed. Chapter 7 looks at what to do next.

### Manage Depression

Throughout the job-hunting process, it’s important to take care of yourself.**It’s normal to feel depressed or discouraged when you’re unemployed and job-searching** ⁠—one study found that the longer you’re unemployed, the more intense these feelings become. Additionally, the job-hunting process itself can intensify your negative feelings⁠—job hunting is a lot of mental work.

There are eleven ways to improve your mental health while you’re unemployed:

  1. **Sleep.** When you don’t get enough sleep, you feel sad. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if you’re sad because you don’t have a job or sad because you’re tired. If you’re feeling sad, try sleeping, and even if there’s some greater underlying reason for your unhappiness, you’ll probably feel at least a bit better.
  2. **Maintain our physical health.** Drink water, exercise, and eat properly (including vitamins).
  3. **Improve our surroundings.** A messy space can contribute to our feelings of sadness. Clean up your home and put things in their place.
  4. **Go outside.** Seeing nature will make you feel better.
  5. **Think about others.** There are always people in the world who are in a worse place than you are. Volunteer at an organization that helps people, such as a food bank or hospital.
  6. **Reconnect with your friends.** Your friends will be important to your job hunt, but more importantly, social interaction contributes to your happiness.
  7. **Go on staycations.** This encourages you to think about the opportunities you have, not focus on the ones you’ve lost.
  8. **Learn a new skill.** Read a book, watch or video, or take a class in something you’ve always wanted to learn. If you don’t have any ideas, learn about ideas themselves⁠—learn about the mind.
  9. **Unload your feelings.** Feelings are harder to manage internally. As soon as you say them aloud, they lose power. Just make sure that whomever you talk to about your feelings is discreet.
  10. **Hit something.** Punching a pillow or a punching bag is a good way to get rid of anger. Anger often contributes to sadness.
  11. **Be grateful.** Every day, make a list of what you’re grateful for. When we’re unemployed, we tend to focus on negatives such as what we’ve lost and what’s wrong with the world. Instead, focus on positives⁠—you may not have a job right now, but you have plenty of other important things.



### Additional Job-Hunting Advice

There are no job-hunting techniques that work 100% of the time. **If you’re not getting job offers, it may not be because you’re doing something wrong.** Sometimes, employers will have already decided on a candidate but have to go through the hiring process because the government or company insists that the position be advertised everywhere. In a situation like this, you’re not being turned down because you did something wrong; you’re simply caught up in an employer’s game.

It is possible, though, that there’s something more than sham interviews going on. If you’ve been job-hunting unsuccessfully for a long time, it’s time to consider: overcoming specific hurdles, hiring a career coach, or catering to the job market.

#### Overcome Two Hurdles

##### Bias

**Every single person in the world has something that will hurt their chances of being hired.** Whatever your issue is may turn off certain employers, because employers are people and they have biases, but it won’t turn off _all_ employers. While some employers will care more about what you can’t do than what you can, most employers care most about your skills. **If your issue doesn’t affect your ability to perform your skills, then it shouldn’t matter to employers.**

To remind yourself that there are lots of things you _can_ do, make two lists, one of skills you have and one of skills you don’t (or don’t have yet). Consult your flower or lists of skills such as this one of action verbs. When you’re finished, choose five things from the skills-you-have list that you love to do and then write out experiences that prove how you exercised that skill, ideally recently.

###### Specific Biases

Employers are forbidden by law from discriminating against certain groups of people, but they may do it anyway, whether consciously or not. **The best way to handle biases is to address them and focus on what you’re capable of.** Here are some common biases:

  * **Disability.** If you have a disability, the first thing to do is make sure you’re aware of all possible treatments and accommodations⁠—perhaps someone has invented a new strategy or technology that would help you work around your disability. For example, if you have low vision, you might be able to find resources in audio rather than print formats. Or, if there’s a particular job you want to do but can’t, consider similar jobs. For example, if you want to be a pilot but don’t have perfect vision, look at other careers associated with aviation such as building plane parts.
  * **Long-term unemployment.** If you’ve been unemployed for a long time and an employer asks you about this, tell her what you did or learned while you were unemployed. You can find a list of employers who hire people who have been unemployed for a long time from the government.
  * **Sexual identity, race, and religion.** It’s illegal to discriminate based on any of these factors, but some employers are prejudiced and will do it anyway. Talk to diversity or affinity groups if you run into this problem. These groups can help you with legal advice and provide empathy.
  * **Advanced age.** Some employers don’t want to hire people in “retirement age” because these people have a lot of experience and need to be paid more, and because, the employer presumes, they don’t actually want to be working, they’re just doing so out of necessity because their pensions didn’t work out. To get around this bias:
    * Seek out small companies that don’t have pension plans.
    * Be positive about your age. Don’t think of yourself as almost retired, think of yourself as being in a later stage of life.
    * Be energetic. It may be more difficult to find physical energy as you age, but you can always be excited about life.
    * Self-reflect. Having a life plan and multiple ways to describe yourself (recall your flower exercise) is attractive.
    * Be persistent. Even if you encounter employers with biases, keep job searching.
  * **Level of education.** Employers can be biased against education in two ways:
    * If you’re overeducated, employers worry that they’ll have to pay you more, you’ll expect quick promotions, or you’ll get bored. To mitigate this, be clear about why you want the position. It’s not uncommon for people to be promoted to management, only to discover they preferred their hands-on job and move back down. 
    * If you’re undereducated, employers worry you won’t be able to do the job. Many jobs ask that applicants possess a degree, and you can get around this by emphasizing that you have the same skills as someone with a degree. For example, you could use a portfolio to demonstrate what you can produce. You can also ask about on-the-job training.
  * **Veteran status.** Some employers worry that returning vets might have PTSD (only 20% do), and a recent survey suggested that 41% of returning vets feel that employers don’t respect their military skills and training. Avoid employers who are biased against vets.
  * **Ex-offenders.** If you’re an ex-offender, there are some resources available, and it’s important that you use agencies, connections, and networks. There are several online resources, such as Jails to Jobs and Help for Felons.
  * **Psychiatric patients.** You don’t have to tell an employer about mental illness unless you need an accommodation. Avoid jobs that might make you uncomfortable, and look into companies’ HR resources for wellness programs.



##### Shyness

Shyness is the second major impediment to a job hunt and affects a lot of us. Culturally, we’re trained not to be egotistical, so we sometimes tend too hard in the opposite direction. This can lead to coming across as ungrateful⁠—we don’t care about our skills and gifts. **You can find the balance by paying attention to others⁠—when you notice your own skills, also notice those of others.**

Career counselor John Crystal says that **the cure for shyness is having fun. This is because when you’re enthusiastic and excited about something, you forget to be shy.** Therefore, only have conversations and look for jobs you’re really excited about.

There’s a three-step process to curing shyness, started by John Crystal and finessed by Daniel Porot. It’s called PIE and involves practicing the three types of interviews: practice/pleasure, informational, and employment.

**Practice or pleasure interviews** are conversations with people about subjects you’re passionate about. To practice these, choose a topic that’s unrelated to work and try to talk with people you don’t know. For example, if you love to dance, try talking to a dance instructor. Questions will probably come naturally for you if you’re enthusiastic about a subject, but if they don’t, try asking how the person became involved with the topic, what they like most and least, who else you should talk to about it, and if they’ll introduce you to those people. You can bring a friend to a practice interview if you like.

**Informational interviews** are conversations with employees or experts who know a lot about the job or industry you’re interested in. See Chapter 3 for more details.

**Employment interviews** are conversations with employers, ideally, the people who will hire you rather than people who work in HR. For more detail on this kind of interview, see Chapter 4.

#### Hire a Career Coach

If you’ve followed all the above advice and you still haven’t found a job, you might want to consider getting some additional help from a career coach.

There are three kinds of career coaches:

  1. Good people who are good at their jobs.
  2. Good people who are bad at their jobs.
  3. Bad people who are trying to scam you. These bad counselors tend to be involved with executive counseling firms rather than working on their own. 



You can fairly easily avoid firms, but it’s more difficult to figure out who’s good and who’s bad at their job. Good and bad are also relative⁠—the coach who’s best for you isn’t necessarily the coach who’s best for your friend. Therefore, **you’re the only person who can decide which coach is the most compatible with you.** The author never recommends specific people and the list of coaches on his website should be treated as a reference, like the Yellow Pages, rather than as an endorsement of specific coaches.

There are three steps to finding your ideal career coach:

**1\. Track down three coaches.** If you want to meet face-to-face, restrict the search to your geographical area; if you prefer phone or video counseling, you can consider anyone anywhere in the world. (But keep in mind you may not have a coach’s full attention if you’re meeting virtually, because you can’t see what else they might be multitasking on while they’re speaking with you.) To find these three coaches, use the internet and ask people you know for recommendations.

**2\. Set an initial appointment with three potential coaches** and ask about the fee for the first appointment. Scammy firms nearly always offer the first appointment free so they can draw you in, but some individual counselors also offer a free initial consultation so that there’s no pressure on either of you to keep working together if you don’t click. In your initial meeting, ask about:

  * **Their program.** The goal of career counseling is for you to learn how to job-search yourself. If a counselor is planning to do all the work for you, that’s a bad sign.
  * **Their experience with counseling** , in years. You want a counselor who has lots of experience⁠—you don’t want to be a guinea pig as the counselor learns the industry. If a counselor is vague, defensive, or tries to answer by bringing up their credentials, it’s a red flag.
  * **Their certification and training.** Keep in mind that the field of career-coaching isn’t very well regulated and some certifications only involve a weekend’s worth of training. Certification tests don’t necessarily indicate expertise, but they do indicate that a coach has been tested on their knowledge.
  * **Their success rate.** If anyone tells you she has a 100% success rate, she’s almost certainly lying. Even the best coaches don’t usually place more than 86% of people. The success rate also depends on how hard individuals work⁠—if a coach mentions that success depends on you, that’s a good sign. You can also ask to speak to former clients. If a coach refuses, that’s another red flag.
  * **Their costs.** There are three methods of paying for career coaching:
    * **Free.** You can sometimes find free career coaching through an organization such as a church or library. Typically, this is group coaching rather than one-on-sessions. Group coaching can actually be more valuable than individual coaching because you can learn from what others are doing.
    * **By the hour.** Per hour costs range from $40-350/hour, typically around the same fees local psychologists or psychiatrists charge. 
    * **Upfront.** Beware the firm that charges you up-front⁠—once they have your money, they’re less motivated to continue helping you. Even if a contract has language around giving you your money back if you’re not satisfied, there’s probably a loophole. Not all firms are bad⁠—some charge upfront because this motivates you to work hard at their program to get your money’s worth. However, it’s impossible to tell why a company is charging upfront, so it’s safer to avoid any organization with an upfront payment model.
  * **Their contract,** if they have one. If you’re paying by the hour, usually you can stop the process at any time. If there is a contract, read it carefully⁠—a contact doesn’t guarantee a scam, but all scams use contracts.



**3\. Assess.** If you liked one of the coaches, sign up with them. If you didn’t, for any reason, find another three and repeat the process again.

#### Cater to the Job Market

Throughout this summary, the goal of the job-hunting process has been to learn about yourself and find out what you’d most like to do, and then find a job that matches. However, if you’re desperate, you can try catering to the job market.

To go this route, research projections/hot jobs, which are jobs that researchers think will see a lot of growth and new opportunities. Use the Occupational Outlook Handbook or other projection sites. The Handbook has a list of similar occupations, which can also be helpful if you don’t like or aren’t qualified for something on the hot list.
