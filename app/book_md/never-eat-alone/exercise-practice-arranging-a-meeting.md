## Exercise: Practice Arranging a Meeting

There are many steps in arranging a networking meeting, including choosing the meeting’s format and actually asking a contact to meet.

* * *

Think of a potential new contact you’d like to arrange a meeting with. Why do you want to connect with this person? What would you be able to offer them to keep your relationship reciprocal?

Based on your current knowledge of this person, what setting do you think would work best for an initial meeting? Why? (For example, would a coffee date work best, or a meeting in which you engage in a shared interest? Could you invite this person to a dinner party at your home?)

Imagine you’re preparing to call up or email the person to ask them to meet with you. Write a short script outlining what you would say or write. (Remember: When inviting someone to meet, always state what you can offer them as quickly as possible. Likewise, suggest a specific time, date, and place to meet.)
