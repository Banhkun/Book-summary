## Exercise: Analyze Your Follow-Up Technique

Following up with your contacts makes them feel appreciated and reminds them of your existence.

* * *

Think of a time when you met a new contact for the first time. What format did the meeting take? Why did you want to connect with this person?

Did you follow up with the contact after this first meeting? If so, what information did you include in your follow-up message, and when did you send it? How did your contact respond?

Imagine you had the chance to redo your first follow-up message (or send one, if you didnâ€™t do so originally). What might you do differently? (For instance, would you send the message sooner? Would you include extra information in the message, such as a reference to a topic of conversation, or an expression of gratitude?)
