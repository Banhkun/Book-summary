## Chapter 3: Research the People You Plan to Network With

Now that you’ve decided who you’re going to network with, there’s one final step to take before reaching out to these people: **trying to find out as much information about them as possible.** For instance, what precisely is their job role? What product or service does their employer provide? What are their hobbies and interests? What are their professional and personal goals? What are some of their recent career achievements?

Getting the answers to at least some of these questions will give you an advantage when you come to meet the person, for two reasons. First, you’ll be able to tailor the conversation to suit the person’s interests and experiences. For example, if you discover their career goals, you can ask insightful questions about how they plan to achieve them. Tailoring your conversations in this way has two benefits:

  1. **The person is more likely to enjoy the conversation if you discuss topics they care about** —and they’re more likely to want to speak to you again.
  2. **They’ll be flattered to discover that you’ve done your research about their background** —it shows that you genuinely care about getting to know them. When people feel cared for, their emotional connection to you grows stronger.



Second, conducting research helps you to figure out what you can offer potential contacts. For instance, if your research indicates that your target is seeking investment for their new business, you know that offering them money will go down well. If your contact is posting online about wanting to make new social connections, offering them friendship may be a good idea. As we explored in Chapter 1, ensuring you have something to give new contacts is a crucial element of successful networking.

### Where Can You Find Information About Potential Contacts?

**The simplest way to gather information about potential contacts is by looking at their online presence.** Specific websites to check include:

**#1: Google:** When you search your potential contact’s name, the results will likely include their social media profiles, making tracking down their online presence much easier. The results will also include recent news articles about the person, which may lead you to information about their latest achievements.

**#2: LinkedIn:** LinkedIn is often the place where people post about their professional achievements. Likewise, people’s profiles usually include their work history, which will give you an insight into their career trajectory so far. If possible, you should check which LinkedIn “groups” your potential contact has joined. You may learn more about the person’s professional or personal interests. For example, if a contact is a member of a group for aspiring CEOs, they’re probably interested in rising to the top of the corporate ladder.

**#3: Twitter:** First, check the personal profile of your potential contact. The content of their tweets will give you an indication of their interests, and who they interact with will show you what kinds of professional and personal connections they already have. Then, check the Twitter page of the person’s employer (if the company has one). Companies commonly share their latest news and achievements on Twitter—information you can use as a conversation-starter when you meet your potential new contact.

**#4: Company websites:** Besides checking the Twitter page of your contact’s employer, you should also look at their official website. In particular, read their recent PR materials. If your contact has done something remarkable at work—for example, making an important sale—their employer will likely have publicized it.

**Ferrazzi doesn’t recommend using Facebook to research potential contacts.** He sees this site as the most curated of all social media platforms, thus making it the least reliable source of information about people’s genuine interests.
