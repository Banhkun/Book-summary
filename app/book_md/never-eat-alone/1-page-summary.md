## 1-Page Summary

**In _Never Eat Alone_ , author and entrepreneur Keith Ferrazzi discusses how to develop fulfilling and mutually beneficial professional relationships: **in other words, how to network.**** He explores three distinct stages of the networking process: preparing to network, building a network, and maintaining a network.

### Prepare to Network

Before you start reaching out to people, take three steps to maximize the chances of your networking efforts being successful:

#### Step 1: Adopt the Right Attitude Toward Networking

You’ll find networking much easier if you internalize these four core beliefs about the process:

**Core Belief #1: All networking should be reciprocal.** If you take a lot from your connections without giving anything back, you’ll gain a reputation for being selfish and taking advantage of people.

**Core Belief #2: Goodwill isn’t finite.** Many professionals believe that they can only ask a contact for assistance a limited number of times before the person grows tired of being relied upon for help.**** However, this isn’t true.**** In fact, repeatedly asking someone for help _strengthens_ your relationship because it demonstrates how highly you value that person: You believe in their ability to help you.

**Core Belief #3: Networks should be created _before_ you need them. **Don’t wait to reach out to people in your field until you desperately need their help—for example, if you’ve just lost your job. They’ll be disinclined to help you because you’re a total stranger to them—why should they assist you? Instead, start to build your network long before your time of need. You’ll be able to spend months or years gaining your contacts’ trust and goodwill, making them much more likely to help you in the future.

**Core Belief #4: Audacity is key.** In a networking context, “audacity” means being bold enough to network with total strangers. If you limit yourself to networking only with people you’re already somewhat familiar with—for example, people who work at your company, or friends of friends—you shut yourself off from the opportunities and insights that strangers can provide.

#### Step #2: Decide Who to Network With

When deciding who to network with, there are four types of people who you should focus on:

**1) People who can help you to meet your goals.** For example, if your goal is to work at a particular company, connecting with its hiring managers may help you succeed. Make a comprehensive list of the people who can help you achieve your goals by creating a Relationship Action Plan, or RAP. This involves writing down:

  * Your long-term goal: something that you want to achieve within the next three years
  * At least one medium-term goal that will help you to achieve your long-term goal. This should be a goal that you can achieve within one year.
  * At least one short-term goal that will help you to achieve your medium-term goal. This should be a goal that you can achieve within three months.
  * Who you think you’ll need to network with to achieve each of the above goals 



**2) Mentors.** Mentors are experienced professionals who are willing to support your career development. They can provide many kinds of assistance, including advice on the experience and skills you’ll need to advance your career. You can find a mentor:

  * Through an official mentoring program at your workplace
  * By “unofficially” asking your manager or another high-level colleague to mentor you
  * By asking your parents or other older relatives if they can put you in contact with experienced professionals
  * By directly approaching business owners, store managers, and other prominent professionals who live in your area



**3) Super-connectors.** Super-connectors are people who have dozens, if not hundreds, of professional contacts—contacts you can ask to be introduced to. They often work in industries that require them to know lots of people. Examples of super-connectors include:

  * Headhunters, who know many hiring managers and jobseekers in the industry they cover
  * Fundraisers, who have long lists of wealthy contacts they can ask for donations
  * Journalists, who have contacts both in the media industry and in the industry that they write about (that’s how they get their story tips)



**4) Prominent people.** These individuals are leaders in their industry—for instance, CEOs of large corporations. Networking with them is useful for two reasons. First, you can probably learn a lot from them—they’re usually highly skilled and intelligent. Second, your connection with this prominent person gives you power by association, making it more likely that people approach _you_ with a request to network.

There are various ways to come into contact with a prominent person:

  * Become an industry leader yourself. You’ll be invited to the kinds of events where prominent people linger—for instance, awards ceremonies and exclusive conferences.
  * Become a prominent member of a professional organization that’s relevant to your field—for example, a member of the board. You then have a reason to approach industry leaders: to ask them to speak at your organization’s events.
  * Get involved with a charity or nonprofit as an activist or a board member. Many charities and nonprofits enlist prominent people to generate publicity for their cause. As a leading member of the organization, you may get to meet these individuals. 
  * Start playing golf, preferably at a high-class or elite club. Golf is the favorite sport of many prominent people—maybe you’ll bump into one on the course? 



#### Step #3: Research People You Plan to Meet Soon

Try to find out as much about potential new contacts as possible. For instance, what precisely is their job role? What are their hobbies and interests? What are some of their recent career achievements? Researching people before you meet them is beneficial for two reasons:

  1. **When you meet the person, you’ll be able to tailor the conversation to suit their interests.** For example, if you discover they like football, you can bring up a recent game. Your new contact is more likely to enjoy the conversation if you discuss topics they care about—and they’re more likely to want to speak to you again.
  2. **You may figure out what you can offer the person to keep your relationship reciprocal.** For instance, if your research indicates that your target is seeking investment for their new business, you know that offering them money will go down well. 



The easiest way to research a potential contact is to look at their online presence. Specific websites to look at include:

  * **Google:** The search results will include recent news articles about the person, which may lead you to information about their latest achievements.
  * **LinkedIn:** This is where people post about their professional achievements. Also, people’s profiles usually include their work history, which will give you an insight into their career trajectory so far.
  * **Twitter:** The content of the person’s tweets will give you an indication of their interests. Who they interact with will show you what kinds of people they’re already connected to.
  * **Company websites:** If your potential contact has done anything remarkable at work, you may find information about it in the PR section of their employer’s website. 



### Build Your Network

Once you’ve adequately prepared to network, your next step is to get out there and meet people—in other words, to **build your network.** Here are four strategies:

#### Strategy #1: Network by Arranging a Meeting

In the context of this strategy, “meeting” doesn’t necessarily mean a traditional business meeting. It simply means any situation in which you’ve invited a person to meet with you face-to-face. Here are four meeting scenarios that you could try:

  1. **Go for coffee.** The relaxed atmosphere of most coffee shops makes them the perfect setting for a casual meetup. 
  2. **Go for a meal.** Ferrazzi argues that food is an excellent icebreaker: Even if you and your contact can’t find anything else to talk about, you can discuss your meals’ quality.
  3. **Engage in a shared interest.** For example, if you both love baseball, go to a game together. Your contact will feel comfortable and relaxed when doing something they enjoy. This means they’re more likely to enjoy spending time with you. Likewise, when your contact discovers that the two of you have a shared interest, they’ll automatically feel that you have a “connection,” making your friendship easier to cultivate. 
  4. **Invite the person to a dinner party you’re hosting.** Making your new contact feel welcome in your home—and providing delicious food in the process—is an easy way to earn their esteem.



##### How to Arrange a Meeting

You can arrange a meeting with a new contact either by email or by phone. In either case, you can increase the chances of the person agreeing to meet with you by:

**1) Making the person aware of your existence _before_ you contact them. **For example, if you and your desired contact have a mutual friend, ask that friend to tell the contact you’re going to call them. Even more importantly, request that your friend say nice things about you. Their backing will give you more credibility in the eyes of your potential contact.

**2) Immediately stating what you have to offer.** Most professionals don’t have time for long phone conversations or to read long emails. Unless you grab their attention quickly by revealing what you can offer them, they’ll make an excuse to end the call, or will stop reading the email.

**3) Offering a specific invitation to meet.** Suggest a date, time, place, and type of meeting: “How about we meet for lunch next Tuesday at 12, at the bistro around the corner from your office?” People are more likely to follow through on concrete plans.

##### What to Talk About During the Meeting

Here are four things to talk about during networking meetings::

  1. **Shared interests:** As we’ve already noted, bonding with someone is easier if you have a shared interest. Not only will talking about this interest strengthen your connection, but you’ll also have fun as you both enthuse about the thing you love.
  2. **Interesting facts:** These could be interesting facts about yourself or about the world more broadly. Presenting intriguing information will help to keep your new contact engaged in your conversation.
  3. **What motivates your contact:** Finding out what motivates a person will help you to further establish what you should offer them. For instance, if they’re motivated by a desire for wealth, you can earn their approval by sending them high-paying job vacancies. 
  4. **What you have to offer.** You hopefully already indicated what you can offer your contact while you were arranging your meeting. Don’t be afraid to reiterate this point when you actually meet the person, to remind them why getting to know you is a good idea.



#### Strategy #2: Network at Conferences

**Conferences are great places to network because they’re full of people you already have something in common with:** You’re all interested in the conference’s theme. Here are some tips on how to make strong professional connections at conferences:

  * **Help to organize the conference.** You’ll gain “insider knowledge” of who’s attending the event, meaning you can research potential connections far in advance. 
  * **Speak at the conference.** When the attendees hear that you’re making a speech, they’ll immediately assume that you’re an important figure in your field. They’ll therefore be more receptive to your networking advances.
  * **Ask questions during talks.** If your question is insightful, you’ll pique people’s interest in you. 
  * **Organize an unofficial conference meetup with people you want to network with.** For instance, suggest a trip to the conference center’s bar to discuss the talks. This ensures that you get to spend time with the people you want to get to know.
  * **Make friends with a “big name” at the event** —for example, a speaker with an insightful discussion topic. These popular attendees are often introduced to dozens of people. If you’re lucky, your new friend will introduce _you_ to these people, who you can then network with.
  * **Come armed with interesting information.** For instance, research the best restaurants near the conference venue. Then, share this information regularly to gain a reputation for being “in the know.” Potential new contacts will approach you for information.
  * **Master the art of creating a strong connection with someone new in a short time.** You can do this by asking the person a couple of personal questions; revealing something vulnerable about yourself; and making it clear that you’re listening to the person, for instance, by asking questions about what they’ve said. 
  * **Only try to connect with three or four new people at each conference.** Try to network with any more people than this, and you’ll find yourself prematurely ending conversations so that you can move on to speaking to the next person. Such behavior is rude and won’t win you any new friends. 



#### Strategy #3: Network Using Social Media

**This strategy involves connecting with new people using social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.** There are two ways to do this:

**Method #1: Approach social media users directly.** First, decide which social media users you want to connect with—for example, professionals who work in your industry. Then, send these users a private message expressing your interest in getting to know them.

**Method #2: Inspire social media users to approach you.** Create compelling social media content that piques people’s interest and makes them want to get to know you. Types of compelling content include:

  * **Posts about what you have to offer:** for instance, your skills. These posts demonstrate why connecting with you is a good idea. 
  * **Posts with useful information:** for example, tips on how to succeed in your field. Social media users are more likely to engage with people who produce helpful content.
  * **Posts about your successes:** for instance, about a recent promotion. These posts attract users who want to bask in your positivity.
  * **Posts about your failures:** for example, about a business opportunity that came to nothing. Being honest about the harder parts of your life will earn social media users' respect and help them relate to you.
  * **Posts on controversial topics:** for instance, about a current political issue. These are often the posts that get the most attention, as social media users rush to either agree or argue with your perspective.
  * **Posts that are unique:** for instance, that take a format that nobody else has tried before. People are more likely to follow you if they can’t find content like yours anywhere else.****



**No matter what type of content you choose to create, make sure that it reflects your authentic personality.** If you present a “fake” version of yourself on social media and then go on to meet your followers in “real life,” they’ll be disappointed to discover that you’re a totally different person.

#### Strategy #4: Network Using Traditional Media

Getting coverage in a media outlet—for example, by publishing an opinion piece in a newspaper—exposes you to an audience of thousands or sometimes millions of people. Some of these readers will be so impressed by your ideas that they want to hear more about them. **They’ll reach out to you—and thus, a new connection is born.**

The simplest way to get media coverage is to follow these five steps:

  1. **Decide what type of content you want to pitch and what topic you want to write about.** For instance, you may want to write a lengthy opinion piece on a prescient social issue. To increase the chances that editors accept your idea, make it original—for example, approach an old issue from a new angle.
  2. **Decide which publication you’d like to feature in.** Start small—for instance, with a local newspaper. National media outlets are unlikely to accept a pitch from someone who’s had no previous media exposure. 
  3. **Write and send your pitch.** Describe your piece's main point, why you think that point is interesting, and why you’re the right person to write about it. Editors are busy people and will likely ignore any pitches that take a long time to read. 
  4. **Follow up with the publication.** A few days to a week after you send your pitch, email the editor to find out whether they plan to run your piece. If they do, start to draft the final article. If they don’t, be gracious: If you berate the editor for rejecting you, they won’t be open to working with you in the future.
  5. **Send the completed article to the publication.** Once it’s in print (or posted online), share it widely: for instance, post a link to it on social media. Getting media coverage is an impressive achievement that you shouldn’t be afraid to flaunt.



### Maintain Your Network

Once you’ve made professional connections, it’s important to put in the work to keep these relationships strong; otherwise, your new network will quickly crumble. **Regularly follow up with your contacts** and **look for ways to help them.**

#### Follow Up

**“Following up” with members of your professional network means regularly checking in with them, either by phone, by email, or in person.** The conversation or meeting may involve asking the contact for updates on their personal and professional life, and telling them what’s been going on with you. You may discuss commitments made in a previous meeting (for instance, discussing the details of an investment opportunity you’ve agreed to). Or, you may simply enjoy each other’s company.

Following up with your contacts is important for two reasons. First, **reaching out to people regularly shows that you care about them enough to want to keep your connection strong.** People are more likely to continue relationships that make them feel appreciated. Second, **if you fail to follow up with new contacts, they’ll forget about you.** Professionals meet dozens of new people each week. By following up with these contacts, you ensure your name sticks in their mind.

##### When and How Often to Follow Up

How often you should follow up with your contacts varies depending on how long you’ve known them and the closeness of your relationship:

  * **If you’ve just met a contact for the first time, follow up with them within 12 to 24 hours.** Send them a brief email or note that thanks them for meeting with you, reminds them of any commitments made, and suggests that you meet again in the future. This will create a good impression and encourage the contact to continue your relationship.
  * **Follow up with new contacts for a second time within a month of your first meeting.** Ideally, arrange your second meeting at this point. 
  * **If you’ve met a contact a few times but don’t feel like you’re close friends yet, follow up at least once a month until you’ve reached that stage.** You don’t have to _meet_ with the person every month—just contact them to ask how they are. 
  * **Once you’ve become close friends with a contact, you can get away with following up with them only quarterly.**
  * **If you’re not close to a contact and aren’t interested in deepening the relationship, follow up with them once a year.** This keeps them on your radar in case you need them for something (or they need you) but doesn’t require much effort.



**As your network grows, you’ll find it increasingly time-consuming to follow up with all of your professional contacts regularly.** To keep up with everyone, “never eat alone”: In other words, use every lunch break you have to meet up with your contacts.

#### Look for Ways to Help Your Contacts

Regularly offer your contacts help—whether that’s financial help, career advice, or emotional support. **The more you help a contact, the more they’ll appreciate you, and the more they’ll want to keep you in their life.** You can find ways to help your contacts by:

  * **Listening closely during conversations to see if they hint at needing anything.** For instance, if a contact mentions they’re looking for investors to support a new business venture, that’s your cue to offer funds (if you can). 
  * **Keeping up with your contacts’ social media to see if their posts indicate that they need something.** For instance, if a contact Tweets about going through a tough time, that’s a sign they need your emotional support. 
  * **Remembering people’s motivations, and looking for ways to fulfill them.** For instance, if you know that your contact is motivated by a wish to change the world for the better, send them a job posting for a role at a non-profit that would allow them to do this. They’ll appreciate your help in bringing them closer to achieving their dream.



**What if your contact doesn’t need anything specific, but you still want to get in their good books?** Ferrazzi argues that helping contacts with these three things will always please them, regardless of their motivations or circumstances:

  1. **Health:** for example, by recommending a doctor you trust to an unwell contact. Everyone wants to stay physically and mentally well so that they can reach their full potential. 
  2. **Wealth:** for example, by helping a contact to find a high-paying job. People want to have enough money to live comfortably and provide for their families.
  3. **Children:** for example, by offering to mentor a contact’s child. People’s children mean everything to them. If you help the child, the parents will hold you in high esteem.
