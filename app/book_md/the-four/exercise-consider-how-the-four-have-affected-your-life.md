## Exercise: Consider How the Four Have Affected Your Life

Galloway argues that the Four have had an outsized influence on our personal lives as well as on society at large. Consider how the Four have affected your own life, either directly or indirectly.

* * *

Galloway claims that the Four have eroded our privacy and undermined our opportunities for career advancement. Do you believe that these practices have affected you personally? If so, explain how.

Galloway claims that the Four have used their size and power to engage in myriad unfair and harmful practices, such as destroying jobs, avoiding taxes, eliminating competitors, undermining democracy, and contributing to the decline of the middle class. Do you believe that any of these practices have affected your life, either directly or indirectly? If so, identify the practice and explain how itâ€™s affected your life.
