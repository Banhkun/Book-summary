## Step 7: Increasing Your Income

In this chapter, you’ll explore how to align your time with your life’s purpose. This means maximizing your income so that you work less and dedicate time to other things.

We’ll cover 3 things:

  * The history of work
  * Redefining “work” and using the definition to understand how to spend your time
  * Maximizing your income



### A Brief Human History of Work

#### Work During Hunter-Gatherer Times

For the majority of human history, humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups. But hunting and gathering isn’t as time-consuming as you’d think.

Modern-day hunter-gatherers average just 15 hours of work per week, far below our “normal” 40. They often work for two days, then take two days off, with work, family time, and leisure blending together. **This shows that we need about three hours of work per day for basic survival.**

#### The Legacy of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Depression

Today, we accept the standard 40-hour workweek and think less of people who work part-time. But how did we come to fill our time with so much paid work?

First, the Industrial Revolution sped up the pace of work and shrunk leisure time. People who worked in factories worked long hours doing very repetitive tasks. In 1900, workers averaged 60 hours a week.

A movement emerged calling for a reduction in work time. As a result of this movement, the average workweek dropped to 35 hours. But the Great Depression reversed this progress. Suddenly, many people were jobless.

**Now, instead of valuing the right to leisure time, people valued the right to work.** People thought poorly of not having a job, or working less than full time, and viewed leisure time as a missed opportunity to contribute to the economy.

### Redefining Work

Our definitions of work vary because they’re drawn from media, culture, what our parents taught us, and other experiences. A common definition of work is that it’s what we need to do to survive, or “make a living.”

But this definition falls short for two reasons:

  * It ignores work we don’t get paid for.
  * It values paid work more than unpaid work, free time, and leisure.



Just like with money, we need a definition of work that holds true for everyone consistently: **Work is any activity you do that aligns with your values, purpose, and dreams.** By this definition, work can include both paid _and_ unpaid activities, freeing you to seek fulfillment beyond paid work.

#### Looking Beyond Pay

There are many reasons people like to work besides pay—they enjoy learning and mastering new skills, socializing with coworkers, and contributing to the community they live in. **But the primary benefit you get from paid work is pay; everything else you can get elsewhere.**

People consistently report four things apart from pay that make work satisfying:

  * interest in the work
  * helpful communication among coworkers
  * recognition
  * potential to advance into new roles



### How Redefining Work Benefits You

Broadening our definition of work to include paid and unpaid work allows you to do two things:

  * evaluate whether your work respects your values, purpose, and dreams
  * balance work you do and don’t want to do



#### Finding Your Calling

It’s possible that your greatest joy comes from work that doesn’t pay well, or at all. **Acknowledging that you may never get paid well for the work you want to do gives you freedom to pursue it without worrying about pay.** To do this, you may need to continue to work your paid job, but you can at least adjust your schedule. Viewing paid work as a ticket to make unpaid work possible helps you find meaning in dissatisfying work while being true to your purpose.

#### Aligning Work With Your Identity

If someone asks you, “what do you do?” you’re expected to answer with what you do for paid work. But if you make a living doing paid work that doesn’t mesh with how you see yourself, you can answer this question differently.

For example, if you’re a lawyer but you’ve realized that your true calling is as a teacher, you can say you’re a teacher, but that you’re currently practicing law in order to make a living. **This response allows others to see you how you see yourself—independent from your current work.**

### Step 7: Increase Your Income

To recap, the primary benefit of paid work is getting paid. In order to respect your time, you need to ensure your work pays you fairly for the skills you bring and the time you dedicate. This step is simply to look at your income and identify opportunities to maximize.

Here are ways to ensure you’re earning as much as possible for the life energy you invest in work:

  * **Ask for a raise.** Get paid more for the work you already do.
  * **Ask for increased vacation time.** Use time off to relax and do activities you enjoy.
  * **Ask to work fewer hours.** If you’re earning more money than you need, you can work fewer hours and still meet your needs.
  * **Find another job or jobs that will pay you more for fewer hours.**
