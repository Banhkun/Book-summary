## Exercise: Question Your Money Assumptions

Examine advice you’ve received about money.

* * *

Think of a message, lesson, or piece of advice you got from your parents about money as a kid. What did you think of it at the time?

Do you apply this lesson to your financial life now? If so, in what way? If not, why not?

Knowing that money is your life energy, would you modify how you apply your parents’ advice in any way? If so, how?
