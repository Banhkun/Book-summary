## Step 1: Understanding the Flow of Money in Your Life

There are a variety of factors that compel us to choose money over our lives. This chapter delves into the emotional factors and economic realities that dictate our relationship with work and money, as well as why choosing money over life is harmful to both our wellbeing and that of the planet.

Finally, we will explore the first step in reframing your relationship with money: visualizing your earnings and calculating net worth.

### Problem #1: Choosing Money Over Life Hurts Our Wellbeing

There’s growing evidence that wanting more and valuing our job over our personal life has detrimental effects. In one US survey:

  * 60 percent of people suffered from job-related stress, anxiety, and depression.
  * 12 percent of people worked more than 50 hours in a week.
  * The majority expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs.



Yet we’ve little to show for all this hassle. Economic circumstances in the US mean people are earning less, saving less, and accumulating more debt. Here are the numbers:

  * The majority of wage earners haven’t seen their pay increase more than 5.3 percent since 2000. 
  * Before the 1980s, people saved over 10 percent of their income. Today, most save 5 percent or less. 
  * Fewer earnings and savings has led to more debt—about $11,000 for every person in the US.



There are two reasons that we choose money over life: We don’t know how to leave jobs we don’t like, and we don’t know how much money is “enough” for our happiness.

#### We Don’t Know How to Leave Jobs We Don’t Like

We don’t know how to leave jobs we don’t like because our work is tied to our identity, and we think we need to stay with jobs to earn money.

##### Identity

We conflate our job with our identity and worth as human beings. We also judge others based on their work. For instance, teaching is considered less prestigious than being a doctor, even though guiding and instructing children is arguably just as demanding. This is called jobism.

We spend so much time working that it has become the main way that we express ourselves, but this wasn’t always the case. We used to develop identity from our interactions in the community, through places like churches and neighborhoods.

##### Additional Reasons

There are three additional reasons that we stay in jobs we don’t like:

1\. We face burnout, boredom if the work isn’t challenging enough, and a competitive atmosphere that is hard to succeed in. Though these seem like reasons to leave a job, we often interpret these circumstances as the norm in all workplaces—and any notion we had of finding the dream job of our childhoods gets filed away as idealistic. We think that this is the best we can get.

Example: Elaine wished she could leave her job as a computer programmer. The work bored her and she hated it. But she worked well enough that she wouldn’t be fired. Her earnings bought luxuries, like a sports car, but not satisfaction. She thought that life would always be this way, no matter the work she did.

2\. We have debts—house payments, student loans, and more—that can make leaving a job difficult.

3\. We have bought into the idea that we need money and the things it can buy to satisfy our needs.

#### We Don’t Know How Much Money Is “Enough” for Our Happiness

The second reason we choose money over life is that we don’t recognize when we have “enough” money. This is due to money lessons we learned in childhood and continue to apply as adults.

##### Childhood: Learning About Money

Many habits get solidified in childhood before we’re fully aware of them. When we carry these behaviors into adulthood unchecked, they can be harmful to our wellbeing.

Young children are hard-wired to meet their needs externally. If you were hungry, you’d cry and a parent fed you. Over time, you learned that not only could your basic needs be met by looking outside of yourself, but so could your desire for niceties—things beyond basic needs that enriched your life in some way, like a bicycle or a toy. But you learned that you needed money for such goods—and to have money, you needed to work.

Eventually, you expanded from using money to purchase basic goods and niceties to purchasing luxury goods. As you got older, you continued to look externally to address your emotional needs. This required spending money.

##### Adulthood: The Elusiveness of Happiness

It’s difficult to discern when we have enough. As we enter adulthood, we expect to accumulate wealth and possessions as we move through our lives. From lavish weddings to ice cream cones, we spend money both to mark our successes and to comfort ourselves in times of distress or boredom.

We think that we’ll feel happier and more satisfied as we spend money. But often, this isn’t the case. Most people want about _50 percent more income_ than they have. A study asked people to state their income and rate their happiness on a scale of 1 to 5, from completely unhappy to completely fulfilled. Scores ranged from 2.6-2.8 regardless of how much money the person earned—people earning below $1,500 a month and over $6,000 a month gave roughly the same responses.

**To remedy this, we need to identify what is enough for us, both from a money perspective and a stuff perspective.** This means:

  * Examining how much money it takes to satisfy basic needs, niceties, and even some luxuries.
  * Spending within our means so that we don’t take on debt.
  * Avoiding having excess stuff, or clutter, that causes us stress, guilt, or shame. When we accumulate stuff that we don’t use, like once-worn clothes that we then donate, we question our motives for buying them in the first place, augmenting our dissatisfaction.
  * Reducing clutter. This includes spending time and money on immaterial experiences and activities that have no meaning for us, like going to a networking event that you have no interest in.



In Step 4, you’ll use several questions to examine your spending and determine what is enough for you.

### Problem #2: Choosing Money Over Life Hurts the Earth

Not only is spending more money unlikely to make us happier, it also has severe consequences for the earth. Everything we consume comes from this planet, from the sand that’s used to make the glass in our windows to the cashmere in our sweaters. **If everyone consumed resources at the rate of the US, we’d completely deplete the earth’s resources in less than a year.**

Because the planet’s resources are finite, consuming more than our fair share means that we’re robbing resources from the generations to come.

#### A History of Consumption

Why do we consume so much? It started with the Industrial Revolution. Machines started making goods and fulfilling more of people’s needs. By the 1920s, people felt like they had enough—they worked enough, and got paid enough. They asked to reduce their working hours in order to relax.

But these changes didn’t sit well with two groups:

  * Protestants valued a strong work ethic and eschewed leisure. They thought leisure opened the door to corruption by the devil and a pathway to other sins. 
  * Industrialists also balked at the idea of people working less. If people weren’t interested in buying goods and services, factories wouldn’t need to produce them at the same rate. This would halt economic growth, threatening civilization itself.



For production to continue at the same rate or faster—and to continue to line the pockets of industrialists—there needed to be new demand for factory-produced goods and services. **Thus, marketing was born: the practice of convincing people to buy things they didn’t need.**

Doing this required changing people’s ideas about _why_ they worked. Advertising played a critical role, making a person feel that they lack something, then providing the solution to their problem—a product or service for purchase. Marketing taught people that:

  * They should earn enough money to cover their basic needs and to buy things they _want_.
  * Leisure no longer meant just relaxation—it became a time to fill with things and activities you buy to relax, like travel and entertainment.



#### Breaking the Consumption Habit

The first step toward breaking your consumption habit is dismantling the myths you hold about growth, technology, and climate change.

##### Myth #1: Growth Is Good

Our economy is still based on the idea that growth is good. We think growth will alleviate poverty, decrease unemployment, and improve the standard of living. Because not spending money could lead to these woes, we’ve become convinced that it’s not only our right to consume, but our patriotic duty. By this same rationale, saving money is seen as not being patriotic and not contributing to the economy.

But the “growth is good” mantra ignores that the planet has limited resources. Every plant and animal is limited by access to resources, like water. And nothing lives forever. If we harvest a species of fish too fast for the population to replenish, then we drive that species to extinction.

**Breaking down the myth that more is better will help us break harmful consumption patterns that deplete the planet of its resources.**

##### Myth #2: We Just Need the Right Technology or Policy

Sometimes we’re too quick to look to technology or government to solve the world’s problems. Here’s why:

  * We think better technology will help. It has helped address pressing problems, like developing the polio vaccine, so it’s easy to think it’ll save us again.
  * We think that our government will step in, creating programs to solve pressing issues.
  * We blame third world countries for the world’s problems. We worry about overpopulation there, while doing little to address overconsumption in our own country.



##### Looking to technology and government makes us feel powerless to effect any change.

##### Myth #3: The Danger Isn’t So Immediate

Humans are hardwired to react to threats that pose immediate danger, like being hunted by a predator. We have trouble addressing less immediate issues, like climate change—we just don’t feel in danger. We may not feel the danger, but if we don’t act soon, our planet and future generations will pay.

**Instead, we need to accept scientific understanding of the climate crisis and work to change our habits with the same urgency as if we were facing down a bear.** Working through the steps in this book will help build sustainable consumption patterns that will preserve the planet for future generations.

### Step 1: Visualize Earnings and Calculate Net Worth

The first step in examining your relationship with money is to systematically take an inventory of all the money you have earned and the material possessions you own.

Though you may feel tempted to skip this step, don’t. Examining the money that has come into your life can be a powerful step toward understanding not only your earning power, but how you choose to spend it. In later steps, you’ll analyze your spending to evaluate if it helps you satisfy your “enough.”

While completing this step, and all further steps, practice the following:

  * **Don’t shame or blame yourself for what you learn.** Your earnings and net worth don’t equal your value as a person.
  * Be thorough in attempting to dig up all that you can about your financial past and present. That way, you’ll get the clearest view of how much money you’ve earned.



Here are the steps:

1\. **Calculate how much money you’ve earned in your lifetime.** Include income from your first babysitting job when you were 13 to your current job, and all the full-time jobs, side gigs, and gifts received in between.

To round up all sources of income, look at:

  * Income tax returns
  * W-2 forms
  * Bank statements
  * What the Social Security Administration says you’ve earned in your life so far
  * Checkbook ledgers
  * Money you received as a gift, or won
  * Earnings from work that you might not have reported on your taxes, such as tips and babysitting wages
  * Loans
  * Capital gains records
  * Illegal sources



Add in any earnings that you didn’t declare in tax returns, like tips you earned but didn’t report, and income from odd jobs. It may take a few days to comb through these records.

2\. **Calculate your net worth.** Sort your possessions into things you own and things you owe—these are your assets and liabilities, respectively.

Liquid assets include cash itself and anything you can exchange for cash, including:

  * Money in checking and savings accounts
  * Savings bonds (US)
  * Bonds
  * Stocks
  * Brokerage accounts
  * Money Market accounts
  * Mutual Funds
  * Certificates of Deposit or other savings certificates
  * Any cash you have on hand
  * Security deposits
  * Debts owed to you that you could collect



Fixed assets include any material possession you own worth a dollar or more. Assign a value for each of these possessions. Look at online marketplaces, such as auctions or Craigslist if you need help.

Write down liabilities as any debts you have or money you owe. If you list an asset like your car or house, make sure you list the money you owe on it as a liability.

To calculate your net worth, find the sum of your liquid and fixed assets. Then, subtract your liabilities.
