## Step 8: Graphing Your Investment Income

In this step, you’ll learn how growing your investment income will help you achieve financial independence. First, you’ll learn what financial _interdependence_ is and how it will help you accumulate savings. Second, we’ll define some useful terms and discuss how to grow your savings through compound interest. Lastly, we’ll discuss how to navigate your approach to financial independence.

### Building Your Savings

When you embody frugal living, you learn to find ways to enjoy more and spend less without relying on the transactional (money-based) economy for needs or fulfillment. Instead, you grow your participation in the _relational_ economy—meeting your needs through cultivating your abilities and community. **This is called financial interdependence: money-free wealth that you both give and benefit from.**

#### Skills

As the economy fluctuates, different skills are in demand at different times. Growing your skills and abilities is a great way to save money because you can get things for yourself and do things for others while paying little to nothing. Plus, it allows you to weather the changing market and gives you paid employment options to fall back on, if you need them.

Some skills include:

  * DIY repair or construction
  * Cooking
  * Marketing



#### Community

If we have little to no meaningful familial or social life, it’s easy to feel lonely and disconnected.

**Developing close family relationships and friendships in which you give and receive helps you avoid loneliness by generating a suite of people to support you and vice versa.** This is known as social capital. It also helps you build savings by relying more on people and less on things to meet your needs.

Some examples of building your community include:

  * Joining social communities like churches or book groups
  * Making amends with friends or family
  * Singing in a choir
  * Running for county council



### Putting Your Savings to Work

By following Steps 1-7, your spending dips, and your income and savings grow. Below, you’ll learn key terms and the basics of how to invest your savings to reach financial independence by building a cushion and investing your capital. (Step 9 will lead you through your investment options in more detail.)

#### Cushion

The first stop for your savings is your Cushion: the readily available cash that lets you weather financial hardship. **You’ll keep this money in a savings account, aiming to build it to cover 6 months of expenses.** If you find yourself out of work, you’ll have this cushion to fall back on.

#### Capital

Savings you don’t need to spend in the short-term is your capital: money you can invest to generate passive income. Unlike your cushion, you won’t keep your capital in a bank account. You’ll invest it so that it grows over time.

#### Compound Interest

Getting your capital to make money for you is one of the keys to reaching financial independence. Investing in bonds or other investment instruments allows capital to accrue compound interest—money that the investment instrument adds to your invested capital.

You can use the following formula to calculate how much interest your savings will accrue each month: **monthly investment income** = **capital** x **current interest rate** divided by 12.

Example: Your first month, you have $100 in capital. The current interest rate is 4 percent. The formula would look like this: **monthly investment income** = **$100** x **4%** divided by twelve = $0.33 per month.

In one year, you’d earn $4 in interest ($0.33 x 12) for a total of $104 (your initial investment plus your interest). If you reinvested that a second year, you’d earn $4.16 for a total of $108.16. And so on.

Compound interest exponentially grows your savings because it works on both the initial investment _and_ the interest accrued.

#### Crossover Point

**When you have more monthly investment income than expenses, this is your cross-over point: when you no longer need to work for money and have reached financial independence.**

### Step 8: Plotting Your Investment Income

In Step 5, you created a graph to chart your monthly income and expenses. Now you’ll add a third line to the graph to chart your monthly investment income.

1\. Calculate how much monthly investment income your capital will generate per month with the same formula discussed above: **monthly investment income** = **capital** x **current long-term interest rate** divided by 12. For current long-term interest rate, use the interest rate for 30-year US Treasury Bonds, or the interest rate for certificates of deposit.

This isn’t how much investment income you have at the moment you calculate it. **It’s a projection of the monthly investment income you can expect if you invest your capital, regardless of the method you use to invest it.**

Example: You have $1,000 in capital and the current interest rate is 4%. Plugged into the formula, you’d get **$1,000** x **4%** divided by 12 = $3.33 per month

This capital, if you invested it now, would conservatively yield $3.33 per month in compound interest, or $40 per year. Using a third color, plot $3.33 on your graph. Over time, as you build your capital each month, your graph will look something like this:

2\. Apply this formula to your total savings each month. For example, if you save $500 next month, plug $1,500 into the formula.

#### Projecting Your Crossover Point

As your expenses stabilize, and your monthly investment income grows, you’ll be able to project your crossover point—approximately when you’ll reach financial independence.

To estimate your crossover point, you need several pieces of information:

  1. average yearly spending
  2. monthly withdrawal rate—the percentage of assets you’ll withdraw each month.
  3. total assets—how much money you’d need to make paid work optional.



**Four percent is widely considered a safe withdrawal rate to avoid overdrawing your assets.** Effectively, you need 25 times your annual expenses in order to guarantee a 4 percent per month withdrawal rate indefinitely. Use the following equation: **total assets needed** = **average yearly spending** x 12 divided by the **withdrawal rate**.

Example: You spend an average of $36,000 per year, or $3,000 per month. You want to be able to withdraw 4% of your assets per month. The formula would read: **total assets needed** = **$36,000** x 12 divided by **4%** = $900,000.00

In graph form, your monthly investment income line will have risen above your monthly spending line, as shown below:

### Navigating Financial Independence

Even as you approach and cross over into financial independence, you’ll still need to navigate stress, work, and expenses.

#### Stress

Stress comes in many forms. You may encounter three issues:

  * wondering about how you’ll spend your time 
  * emotional swings—wanting to dabble in many experiences
  * worrying if you’ll have enough money



Here’s how to navigate this big change:

  * **Before the crossover point, try spending your weekends doing some of the things you plan to do in your free time.** That way, you’ll have a starting point for what to do.
  * When you do reach crossover, start to enjoy some of things that you promised yourself you’d do once you’d reached financial independence. Examples include sleeping, camping, or volunteering.



As for having enough money, all of the steps you’ve completed up to this point were designed to help you spend within your means. Financially independent people often discover that their expenses decrease even more during FI because they don’t need to pay for work-related expenses.

#### Work

Financial independence means that you don’t have to work for money. However, that is just one option available to you. Not everyone decides to stop doing paid work when they reach FI. If you choose to work, FI gives you flexibility to decide when you work and what kind of work you do.

Here are some examples of what work might look like:

Example 1: You work for a few years, save, and invest, and then leave the workforce for months to years to go back to school, raise children, or take a long vacation.

Example 2: You work a summer job and have the rest of the year off.

Example 3: You use passive income to supplement income from part-time side hustles.

Example 4: You work full time doing work you’re passionate about, but feel no pressure to make money because of your passive income.

#### Expenses

Financial independence doesn’t mean that you won’t periodically face large expenses. For example, your car may eventually need to be replaced.

In addition to your Cushion, you can develop a _Cache_ —a readily available source of savings to put toward large expenses. Even if you’re not working full-time anymore, you can still continue to build up savings.

This money may come from:

  * work-related expenses you’re no longer paying
  * paying fewer taxes 
  * taking on side hustles
  * receiving gifts or inheritances
