## Exercise: Determine the Flow of Money in Your Life

Complete the first step in Your Money or Your Life.

* * *

Make a list of all your income sources in your lifetime and how much you earned from each.

List all of your assets and liabilities. Then, subtract your liabilities from your assets to calculate your net worth.

What’s surprising or notable about your earnings? About your net worth?

You’ve now calculated your earning potential and your net worth. List some things you have to show for it (a house, jet ski, handbag, and so on).
