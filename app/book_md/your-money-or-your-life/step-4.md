## Step 4: Aligning Spending With Values, Purpose, and Dreams

The next step in understanding how you spend your life’s energy is to look at the things—material and immaterial—that you want in life. First, you have to get in touch with what you are trying to achieve in life—your values, purpose, and dreams. We’ll explore some questions to help you define each of these things for yourself.

Once you’ve identified the above, you’ll use it as a guide for Step 4—looking at your monthly tabulation and asking a series of questions to assess whether your spending aligns with your values, purpose, and dreams.

### Values, Purpose, and Dreams

#### Values

Your values reflect your beliefs. We feel content when our behavior is consistent with our values. But how we choose to spend our time and life energy doesn’t always reflect our true values. Sometimes we need to adjust how we spend our time and/or money.

For example, maybe you value reducing your carbon emissions to combat global warming. You’d like to express that value by commuting by bike, but instead, you justify driving your car to work most days because the bike commute adds an extra 20 minutes of travel. To solve this, you elect to prep your lunch and work bag at night to reclaim 20 minutes of your morning, allowing you to bike.

You’ll explore aligning your spending with your values later in this chapter.

#### Purpose

Similarly to values, identifying your life’s purpose can guide your spending habits and how you use your time.

There are two kinds of purpose:

  1. Your general purpose is more short-term and personal. It’s when you act or do something in the present that allows you to achieve something important later. For example, you save money now so that you can take a sustainable farming course later.
  2. Life purpose is more long-term and focused on the bigger picture—how you choose to put your life energy to use to contribute to the world. **It’s recognizing that you are a small part of a bigger whole, but instead of feeling insignificant, you’re empowered to contribute your talents to important causes.**



If our purpose in life is out of focus, we amble along with little direction. Identifying your purpose allows you to align your life’s energy with it.

##### Finding Your Life’s Purpose

Ecologist and writer Joanna Macy suggests three approaches for finding your life’s purpose:

  1. **Identify your passion.** Think about a cause or activity that you’d dedicate yourself to, not to escape or avoid your life, but because you care about it. Maybe you’re a skilled kayaker and you decide to lead guided kayaking tours of your favorite local lake.
  2. **Identify your pain.** If you’ve navigated a tough experience, you may have expertise to help others in similar situations. For example, if a close friend of yours committed suicide, you could dedicate part of your time to suicide prevention organizations.
  3. **Identify problems close by.** There may be problems in your community that you feel called to make better. For example, you start writing regular letters to get your city council to allocate money to homeless services.



#### Rediscovering Your Dreams

Another way to get in touch with your sense of purpose is to revisit childhood dreams. These dreams can indicate how we’d enjoy spending our time.

But sometimes, we abandon our dreams. There are two main reasons:

  1. **We dismiss dreams as too childish, thinking they will never come true.** Trying to get your painting career off the ground might be difficult if your current desk job takes up all of your time, and you have bills to pay. More often than not, you might just stick with work you don’t like, as discussed in Step 1.
  2. **We take on debt, and dreams start to feel impossible.** Sometimes achieving a dream involves going into debt, as in getting a college education. This debt limits our ability to achieve additional dreams—we can’t afford to pursue them. 



**To find fulfillment, we have to reclaim our dreams and take steps to achieving them while dealing with our other obligations, like debts or bills.**

At first, it might feel difficult to access and work toward dreams that you’ve set aside for so long. Answer the questions below to remember your dreams:

  1. When you were a kid, what did you picture yourself doing for work?
  2. What is something you’ve done—in your career, or in general—that you’re proud of?
  3. What is something that you’ve wanted to do for a long time, but haven’t yet?
  4. What makes you feel fulfilled? How does it relate to money?
  5. You learn you have one year, max, left to live. What would you choose to do with that time?
  6. If you could live without having to work for money, how would you spend your time?



### Step 4: Evaluate Monthly Spending

Now that you have a sense of your values, purpose, and dreams, you’ll use them as benchmarks to evaluate your spending in each of your categories and subcategories.

Using the 3 blank columns on your monthly tabulation, ask yourself the following questions for each category and subcategory:

##### Question 1: Is the Amount of Happiness and Contentment I Got From These Purchases Worth the Life Energy I Spent?

Ideally, the more money you spend, the more enjoyment you should get. But it’s common to spend money that doesn’t bring adequate fulfillment for the expense. Question 1 helps identify areas where you’re overspending relative to your enjoyment. On the flip side, it helps you see spending categories that bring great joy to your life that you could spend _more_ money on. You’ll start to map the intersection between spending and fulfillment—what’s enough for you.

Look at each subcategory and category of your spreadsheet, and assign one of three symbols in the first column for each:

  * Use a “-” sign if you didn’t get fulfillment proportional to what you spent and should spend less.
  * Use a “+” sign if you got fulfillment proportional to what you spent and think you should spend more.
  * Use a “0” if you got fulfillment proportional to what you spent and think your spending should stay the same.
  * For example, you ask Question 1 looking at the $50 you spent on magazine subscriptions in the past month and realize that most of those magazines regularly go unread. Because you don’t enjoy them in proportion to their cost, you mark a “-” in the first column, indicating that you can spend less. 



Do this as objectively as you can without thinking too hard about the amount you spent. This will help you evaluate the subcategory purely from an enjoyment perspective without passing judgment.

**Asking monthly whether your spending brought you fulfillment will calibrate you to your “enough”—the intersection of your spending with fulfillment.** Learning what your “enough” is rather than relying on external sources for fulfillment is a major component of making sure your spending leads to happiness.

##### Question 2: Is Spending This Amount of Life Energy Consistent With My Values and Purpose?

Next, you’ll examine your spending in each subcategory and category through the lens of your values and purpose.

Look at the next blank column, to the right of the column you used for Question 1. In this column, follow the same procedure as before, using “-”, “+”, and “0” to show when spending less money, more money, or the same amount is necessary to bring each particular category and subcategory in line with your values and life purpose.

For example, you spent about $25 dollars each week on lunches from chain restaurants and $16 on lunches from locally-owned businesses. You’re comfortable with the total amount spent, but you’d prefer that the majority of the lunch money go to locally-owned businesses because you value keeping wealth in the local community. To reflect this, you mark a “-” for the chain restaurants subcategory, and a “+” for the local businesses subcategory.

##### Question 3: If I Didn’t Have to Work for Money, Would I Spend More, Less, or the Same Amount of Life Energy?

Earlier in this chapter, you were asked to consider how you might spend your time if you didn’t have to work for money. Question 3 goes one step further, asking you to consider how you would spend your _life energy_ (money) differently if you didn’t have to work for money.

Working often requires that we spend money on things like commuting. **Asking Question 3 for each subcategory and category illuminates how much of your spending is due to work and work-related activities.**

You may find that life would be cheaper if you didn’t have to work. For example, maybe you’d stop spending money on your fancy work wardrobe. But you might spend more in certain categories, like travel.

There are no right or wrong answers. The point is to imagine how your spending would look different under a different set of circumstances. **Since you’re working toward financial independence—not having to work for money—this will ultimately help you plan for life once you’re financially independent.**

In the next blank column, to the right of the column you used for Question 2, follow the same procedure as before, marking a “-”, “+”, and “0” to show how you think your expenses in each of these categories would change.

#### Spotting Patterns and Making Adjustments

Once you’ve gone through each question with each of your subcategories and categories, the next step is to return to each subcategory to reflect.

Evaluating your subcategories according to each question may make clear the areas to adjust. For example, if you marked a minus indicating that you didn’t derive enough enjoyment from what you spent on movies, _and_ you marked a minus indicating it didn’t align with your values and purpose, this is a sign you should adjust your spending in that category.

Again, try to do this as objectively as possible, and go easy on yourself. **Ultimately, the goal is to adjust your spending so that you only have 0s (“I’m spending exactly what I want to spend in this category”) or pluses (“Spending life energy in this category brings me great fulfillment in proportion to what I spend, and spending even more will bring me even greater happiness.”)**

This process allows you to redirect or eliminate excess spending and get closer to your “enough.”

##### (Optional) Question 4: In a World Where Everyone Could Meet Their Basic Needs and Had Enough, How Would My Spending in This Category Change?

We over-consume material goods. If everyone in the world did this, we’d quickly deplete the earth’s resources. To interrupt this tendency, consider asking this fourth question to determine whether spending in each of your subcategories aligns with people around the world having enough to meet their needs now, and in the future.

Tailor this question to make it compelling to you. Here are 4 examples of ways to rephrase it:

  1. If everyone spent like this, would the world be a better place?
  2. Is this good for the environment/Earth/others?
  3. What would Jesus do?
  4. **If everyone in the world were this mindful about how they spent their life energy, would it change the world?**



Though this question isn’t required, you may find yourself naturally asking it after the first three.
