## Exercise: Figure Out Your Guest List

Now that you know that every gathering you have must only include people who support the reason for gathering, apply Parker’s advice to ensure that you curate your guest list accordingly for your next gathering.

* * *

What is the reason that you’re gathering? Recall Parker’s advice that a reason must be clear, specific, and _not_ defined by the type of gathering.

List the people you might invite to this gathering—whether you want to invite them or feel obligated to.

Of these people, who would _actively support_ your reason and in what ways?

Remember that Parker advises against inviting anybody who doesn’t actively support your reason. What are some ways you can mitigate the potential fallout of _not_ permitting such a person to be there? For example, you could write “no plus ones” on your invitation.
