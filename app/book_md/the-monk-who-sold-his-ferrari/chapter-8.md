## Chapter 8: The Lighthouse—Purpose

In this section we discuss **the lighthouse from Raman’s fable, which represents purpose.** As we said in the last chapter, a purpose in life is one of the keys to happiness: Like a lighthouse guides ships through dangerous waters, your purpose guides you through your life.

(Shortform note: Light (and, by extension, a lighthouse) is a common symbol in religious texts as well as literary ones. Christianity in particular frequently refers to Jesus as a guiding light, and the **purpose** of Christianity is to serve Jesus. Regardless of your own religious leanings (or lack of them), this example shows how a clear purpose can guide you through life.)

> In _Limitless_ , Jim Kwik talks about _dominant questions_ : questions that you ask yourself so that you’ll focus on relevant information. **Your purpose is like a dominant question for your entire life.**
> 
> For example, if you’re looking to buy a new car, your dominant question might be, “What’s the best car for me?” With that question in mind, your brain will naturally search for information about cars that meet your needs—price, reliability, and so on—as you go about your day. Therefore, if you happen to see an advertisement for a car dealership, you’ll take note of that advertisement instead of dismissing it as background noise.
> 
> In the same way, suppose that you’re a doctor whose purpose is to treat sick patients—as you go through each day, you’ll subconsciously search for information that’s relevant to that goal: information about newly discovered diseases, promising new treatments, and so on.
> 
> However, at this point your dominant question might simply be, “What is my purpose?” This chapter seeks to help you answer that question.

### How to Find Your Purpose

The concept of _dharma_ , which roughly means “purpose,” __ teaches that everyone has a mission on Earth, and unique skills and gifts to help complete that mission. According to Sharma, living by your dharma is the only way to achieve true happiness; therefore, in order to live happily and contentedly,**you must first discover what your purpose is.**

> _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ translates dharma as “purpose,” which is accurate but doesn’t convey the full scope of the word.
> 
> Dharma has a much deeper and more religious meaning than just one’s purpose in life; it’s both the laws of the universe as set down by the gods, and it’s what each individual person is meant to do as a result of those laws.
> 
> The _Bhagavad Gita _explores this topic in greater depth.

#### Setting Clear Goals

Sharma teaches that the first step toward finding your dharma is**setting clear and specific goals.**

Do this right now: Take a piece of paper and write down some _specific_ long-term goals. Write whatever comes to mind in the moment—you can always reevaluate your list later.

Having a list of goals will help sort through the clutter of your daily thoughts, so that you can focus your attention and energy on what’s important to you.

> In _Eat That Frog_ , Brian Tracy’s book about achieving difficult goals, the first chapter discusses the importance of knowing what those goals are. Tracy, like Sharma, writes that having specific goals will focus your energy and motivate you to achieve them—and the more ambitious your goals are, the more motivated you’ll be.

##### John’s Dharma

John reminisces about how he used to lose track of time while painting. He compares the feeling to being in heaven. **Julian tells him that feeling is the result of focusing his energy on something that he loves.** He suggests that John’s dharma may be to make beautiful paintings for others to enjoy.

> **Dharma Leads to Flow; Flow Leads to Nirvana**
> 
> _Flow_ , by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is a deep dive into the kind of experience that John’s remembering. Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as an “optimal experience” where you’re completely focused and completely happy—you’re not losing any mental energy to intrusive thoughts or unhelpful feelings.
> 
> _Nirvana_ is a state of endless, perfect happiness, which Sharma touches on briefly in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_. In a religious context, Nirvana is roughly equivalent to heaven; thus, John’s comment that painting was like “being in heaven” shows the link between dharma and Nirvana.
> 
>   * Nirvana is the end goal of Buddhism and Hinduism, where it’s defined as **a perfect union between your spirit and god (or the universe).** The _Bhagavad Gita _offers details on this more religious interpretation of the concept.
> 

> 
> In a more secular context, **you could consider Nirvana to be a state of perpetual flow** —thus, according to Sharma, living by your dharma is a crucial part of reaching Nirvana.
> 
> Sharma and Csikszentmihalyi offer two different approaches to reaching this state of perfect focus and happiness:
> 
>   * Sharma says that **you can be happy at all times** by finding your dharma, and devoting all of your energy to fulfilling it. According to Sharma, any time that you’re working toward your dharma, you’ll be in a flow state (though he doesn’t use the word “flow” to describe it).
> 
>   * Csikszentmihalyi says **you can _find_ flow in any situation** by setting challenges for yourself. These challenges should be difficult, but achievable.
> 
>     * For example, if you want to improve your basketball skills, perhaps you’d practice three-point shots. You’ll experience flow as long as those shots are difficult (but not impossible) for you to make. If making those shots becomes too easy, you’ll exit the flow state, and that’s how you’ll know that it’s time to set a new challenge. 
> 


John now questions whether his goals can be smaller and more practical, such as losing weight. Julian replies that there’s nothing wrong with setting a lot of small goals on the way to larger objectives; in fact, small steps are the best way to get started on major life changes.

> Small goals lead to small victories, which are crucial for maintaining your enthusiasm as you work on a large project like finding your dharma.
> 
> _Our Iceberg Is Melting _is another parable about making major changes. According to that book, one of the key steps in a major project is to **achieve and celebrate small victories** , just like Julian described in the previous section.

#### Reaching Your Goals

The Sages had a five-step process for achieving their goals:

**1\. Clearly visualize the goal**. Take a moment each day, perhaps right after you wake up, to imagine yourself as you’ll be once you reach your goal.

  * For example, if your goal is to improve your physical fitness, picture yourself with the body you want to have. 



(Shortform note: In _Can’t Hurt Me_ , former Navy SEAL David Goggins describes how visualizing his goals helped him through the worst parts of SEAL training. His mental image of success helped him to push through pain and exhaustion while he worked to turn that image into reality.)

**2\. Create positive pressure** for yourself. This does not mean to badger or berate yourself—that would be negative pressure—but to somehow add some stakes to your goal that encourage you to pursue it.

  * One way to create positive pressure is to publicly announce your goal. Doing so instantly puts pressure on you to fulfill it, because people are now watching you.



> In his self-help book _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins talks about _eustress_ : positive pressure that improves performance (as opposed to _distress_ , which is negative pressure that hinders performance).
> 
> In Chapter 9, Robbins talks about how to create eustress for yourself. Two key suggestions are:
> 
>   * Recognize that you’re not satisfied with your current situation, thereby motivating yourself to change it.
> 
>   * Share your new goal with friends who will encourage you to pursue it (the same advice that Sharma gives in this section).
> 
> 


**3\. Create a clear and specific timeline for your goal**. Deadlines will help keep you on track throughout the process.

  * Commit the goal and the deadline to paper—a deadline that’s only in your mind is no deadline at all.



(Shortform note: Deadlines are another type of positive pressure. Deadlines motivate you to finish your tasks; and the closer a task’s deadline gets, the more motivated you’ll be.)

**4\. Choose a _specific_ action or behavior that will help reach your goal, and do it every day for 21 days.** This is how long it takes for new habits to be formed, and bad habits to be replaced.

(Shortform note: Although Sharma and other self-help experts frequently say that it takes 21 days to form a healthy new habit, in reality it might take much longer—one study showed that it took an average of 66 days (and in some cases as long as 254 days) for a new behavior to become a habit.)

**5\. Enjoy the process**. Have fun while pursuing your goals; if your new ritual feels like a chore then you won’t stick to it.

(Shortform note: James Clear’s self-help book _Atomic Habits_ offers some more advice on finding the fun within your new habit. For example, if your new habit is daily exercise, you might find that going for a run with your dog is more fun than walking on the treadmill at the gym.)

##### A Helpful Tool: the Dream Book

**Sharma suggests that one way to find your dharma is to keep a Dream Book.** Buy a cheap notebook, and fill it with goals and dreams from all areas of your life. Divide your Dream Book into sections based on what type of goal you’re adding: fitness, financial, relationship, spiritual, and so on.

Also include pictures that represent your goals, and people who have achieved those goals already. For example, if your goal is to get in better shape, perhaps include a picture of a superstar athlete.

> A Dream Book can help not only with tracking your goals, but also with discovering where your passions lie. As you look through your notebook, you can ask yourself questions like:
> 
>   * What areas of my life are most of my goals focused on?
> 
>   * Which goals am I most excited to pursue?
> 
>   * Which accomplishments came easily to me, and which ones did I struggle with?
> 
> 

> 
> These are only examples; any questions that guide you to a better understanding of yourself will help you find your purpose.
