## Chapter 13: The Path of Diamonds—Living in the Moment

**The last metaphor from Yogi Raman’s fable is the path of diamonds, which represents living in the moment:** fully experiencing and enjoying each moment as it comes and goes. According to the parable of the garden, the diamond path leads to happiness.

However, the path stretches out into the distance because **happiness is a process, not a goal.** In other words, you’ll never reach a point where you’re “happy” and don’t need to pursue happiness anymore.

Sharma notes that, while it’s important to have goals and dreams, don’t sacrifice the little joys and pleasures of life to reach them. Live your life now, not at some uncertain time in the future like after retirement or winning the lottery.

> The path of diamonds is a reference to Vajrayana Buddhism (_vajrayana_ can be translated as “diamond path” or “diamond way”). Vajrayana teaches that there’s no clear distinction between what people might call good and bad, or holy and profane—it teaches you to accept things for what they are, instead of judging and labeling them. By doing so, you remain present and focused, rather than lost in your own thoughts and judgments.
> 
> In simple terms, the path of diamonds represents Sharma’s belief that **being fully present in each moment as it happens** is like walking down an endless, impossibly beautiful road. According to Sharma, you’ll never reach the end of the path of diamonds, but you’ll be happy for as long as you’re walking on it.

### How to Live in the Now

First of all, Sharma says, don’t worry about the past or fear the future. This lesson ties into the concept of a focused mind from Chapter 7—**distracting yourself with worries and fears is draining, while putting all of your energy into the present moment is invigorating.** Many of the other lessons will help you to be more present and appreciative in each moment as it passes; for example, the Heart of the Rose is all about eliminating distracting thoughts.

Secondly, even in hard times—or perhaps especially then—**give thanks for everything you have.** For example:

  * Your health (mental or physical)
  * Your family and friends; those who love and support you even when you’re struggling
  * The dreams and goals that give you a reason to keep trying
  * The small pleasures of life, like a good meal or a beautiful sunset



> “Live in the moment” is another lesson that bridges many different schools of thought, and therefore one that’s worth thinking about.
> 
>   * Stoicism argues that, rationally, there’s no benefit to worrying about the past or the future; all you can do is make the best choice possible in the present moment.
> 
>   * Hinduism and Buddhism say that you mustn’t let unimportant events take root in your mind. Instead, you should experience each moment as it comes, and then let it go when it’s over.
> 
>   * Any number of secular self-help books suggest the same thing: Dwelling on the past or worrying about the future is a waste of time and energy.
> 
> 

> 
> Lori Gottlieb’s memoir _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_ is all about how she learned to live in the moment. Gottlieb went through an unexpected breakup, which led to a major midlife crisis.
> 
> Through therapy and self-reflection, Gottlieb came to realize that the underlying issue was her fear that she’d be alone forever. She was finally able to move past her crisis by learning to appreciate each moment as it happened, rather than worrying about the future or obsessing over the past.

### Julian’s Final Lesson

Julian’s last lesson is about _Nirvana_ , a state of perfect happiness and contentment. When you reach Nirvana, you see the beauty in everything and experience no pain. This is the ultimate goal of everything that Julian has said and taught.

You’ll know you’ve reached that stage when you start to notice the divinity in everything around you, from the bloom of a flower to the laugh of a child.

> In both Buddhism and Hinduism, Nirvana is the ultimate goal of every living being. However, while Sharma describes Nirvana as a state of perfect peace and happiness, more traditionally it means the end of your individual existence.
> 
> According to Buddhism and Hinduism, reaching Nirvana means that your soul unites with God, and you’re freed from the cycle of death and reincarnation. In other words, the lifetime in which you reach Nirvana will be your last.
> 
> Those religions see life—and therefore reincarnation—as suffering; they seek to free people from that suffering. In contrast, Sharma is trying to make the life you have more meaningful and enjoyable.

After sharing that final lesson, Julian embraces John and walks out into the morning sun. All he leaves behind is his empty teacup.

> Julian’s empty cup is the final image of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari._ It serves as a reminder of the Empty Cup proverb, and a sign that Julian’s own “cup” is still empty, in spite of—or maybe because of—all he’s learned.
> 
> Just like Julian, you must remember to keep your cup empty so that you can always fill it with new lessons.
