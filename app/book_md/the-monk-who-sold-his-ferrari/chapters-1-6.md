## Chapters 1-6: Death and Rebirth

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is a parable, a story meant to teach a lesson. It seeks to teach readers different methods to manage their thoughts, their time, and their lives. **By following these lessons, Sharma promises that you can find personal fulfillment and inner peace.**

The book contains several parables layered on top of each other: Julian, a lawyer-turned-monk, tells a former colleague named John about his travels in India and how he learned to master himself and take back control of his life. He has a lot to teach, and John is willing to learn.

Within the Julian-John story is another layer about Julian’s time in India, where he studied with the Sages of Sivana and learned the secrets of enlightenment. Within _that_ story is a fable Julian learned from his primary teacher, Yogi Raman. Raman’s story contains metaphors for the seven main lessons Julian learned from the Sages, and which John (and, by extension, the reader) will now learn from Julian.

### John and the Great Julian Mantle

Julian Mantle is a successful, famous, and wealthy lawyer. He seems to have it all: a mansion, expensive Armani suits, a private island, and his prized red Ferrari.

However, the stress of Julian’s job wears him down. He continually takes on more and more work, and never finds time to relax. He’s a perfectionist who tries to think of, and cover, every remote possibility before going to trial. Eighteen-hour work days are common for him and John, his intern. Julian copes with the stress of his job by eating, smoking, and drinking too much. His unhealthy lifestyle has made him fat, and he looks older than he is.

> Julian’s life at the beginning of this story is what many people dream of having for themselves. By working hard, he’s become rich and well-known in his profession. He has every material possession that most of us could ever want. In other words, by any typical measure, Julian Mantle is “successful.”
> 
> However, as you’ll soon see, **his workaholic life isn’t something that people should aspire to.** The American Psychological Association (APA) reports that workaholism has negative impacts on physical and mental health—largely due to stress—as well as negative impacts on the workaholic’s relationships.
> 
> Are you wondering whether you might be a workaholic? Psychotherapist Ana Jovanovic offers 5 warning signs of workaholism, and some first steps you can take to adjust your relationship with your work.

By the time the story begins, Julian is losing his passion, his energy, and his focus. Instead of the brilliant legal arguments he built his career on, he often falls back on rambling, half-related stories and precedents. This is a sign that his mental health is declining along with his physical health.

One day, Julian has a heart attack and collapses mid-trial. While in the hospital, he decides that he no longer wants to practice law. After recovering, Julian sells off most of his material goods for a fraction of their value. **He takes what little he has left and goes to India to look for guidance in his life.**

(Shortform note: One of the major topics of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is finding balance in life. To help illustrate the point, it starts by showing the reader an _unbalanced_ life. In other words, **the first chapter of this book is a warning about what not __ to do.**)

### The Return of Julian Mantle

Julian is away for over three years, and he makes no contact with his old associates during that time.

While he’s gone, John gets older and more jaded. He develops a nasty temper and a habit of worrying about things he can’t change. In spite of that, he settles into a decent middle-class life; not as extravagant as Julian’s old life, but comfortable.

John’s great love in life is his children. He says that, after having kids, the way he viewed the world and his place in it changed—his secure, middle-class life wasn’t enough anymore. John began to search for meaning in his own life, but without much success.

> **John’s role in this book is to be a stand-in for the reader.** John’s clearly unhappy, as evidenced from his anxiety and his short temper. He also seems to be looking for something in life, though he doesn’t know what; he just knows that he feels stressed and unfulfilled.
> 
> Those sentiments are common among people who are just starting to read about spirituality and meditation—they drive people to start their spiritual journeys in the first place.
> 
> Therefore, the lessons that John takes away from this—especially the ones that he comes up with himself or repeats back to Julian—are the lessons that Sharma hopes will stick with you the most.

One day Julian appears at John’s office without warning. He’s now fit, healthy, and happy, and looks decades younger than he did before his heart attack. The transformation is so extreme that John doesn’t recognize him at first.

Julian settles in and tells John that his heart attack had been a symptom of his broken spirit, **the cause of which was his unbalanced lifestyle.** His doctor had warned him that if he kept practicing law, the stress would soon kill him. Julian saw an opportunity to reinvent himself and find his passion again, which was why he left for India so suddenly.

John asks whether it was hard to give up everything and leave, to which Julian replies that it was the easiest thing he’d ever done. As Albert Camus said, “Real generosity toward the future requires giving all that you have to the present.” Julian took that quote literally, and gave up everything to seek his new life.

Julian begins to tell John about his travels.

> The beginning of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ gives us something of a “before and after” look at spirituality and meditation. We saw Julian before he began his spiritual journey—sick, exhausted, and miserable—and now we see him at the end of that journey, when he’s happy and healthy.
> 
> **Sharma is saying: Here’s where you are now (past Julian); and here’s where you could be (present Julian).** The rest of the book teaches you how to start making that change in your own life.

### The Missing Years—Julian’s Time in India

Julian had traveled through India seeking teachers and guidance. After seven months of wandering, Julian met a Yogi named Krishnan.

Krishnan was another former lawyer who got tired of the constant stress and overwork. Much like Julian, he gave up everything to seek new meaning in life. Eventually, Krishnan realized that**his purpose is to serve others and make the world better.** He was now the caretaker of a small local temple, where he had come to know himself and his place in the world.

Krishnan offered Julian this wisdom: Everything happens for a reason. Every setback is a lesson, and every failure is a chance to grow. Do not regret your past, but learn from it. Do not fear failure, but embrace it as a teacher. **The only true failure is failing to try.**

> Remember that Julian’s perfectionism was what drove him to his unbalanced lifestyle in the first place. Therefore, this first lesson is exactly what Julian needs right now: **By letting go of the fear of failure, he’ll be able to approach problems in a healthier and more balanced way.**
> 
> This is also Sharma’s first lesson for the reader: Don’t regret the life you’ve lived up until this point, but also don’t be afraid to try new things.
> 
> Furthermore, don’t give up if you feel that you’ve failed at one of the lessons or practices in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_. Instead, think about what that failure could teach you.
> 
> Thomas Griffin, president of OptinMonster, offers these four tips to **maximize the value of your failures:**
> 
>   * **Humility:** Nobody’s perfect—accepting that you’ll make mistakes and encounter failures will help to lessen the sting when it happens. As a result, you’ll be able to stay focused and motivated instead of getting discouraged.
> 
>   * **Persistence:** The most important part of learning from failure is **not giving up.** Instead, ask yourself _why_ you failed, and how you can avoid that issue in the future. Most importantly, be honest about your mistakes so that you can learn from them.
> 
>   * **Flexibility:** After acknowledging why you failed, and determining how to avoid that problem in the future, you have to **commit to changing your approach.** In other words: You’ve decided what to do, but now you have to _do_ it.
> 
>   * **Filtering:** This is about applying what you’ve learned from your failures. New ideas are exciting, and you’ll be tempted to immediately act on all of them. Instead, jot your ideas down in a notepad. Come back to those ideas later and, using the experience you’ve gained from previous failures, _filter_ through your ideas to see which ones seem like they’ll do well going forward.
>

Krishnan suggested Julian look for the Sages of Sivana to continue his spiritual education. **Krishnan explained that the Sages are a near-mythological group of monks who are supposed to have the keys to health, longevity, and happiness.** They live high in the Himalayas, where it is dangerous for even experienced climbers to explore, and many people have died trying to find them. Despite the danger, Julian set out the next day to look for the Sages, somehow knowing he would be safe and would find what he was looking for.

(Shortform note: Julian’s physical journey echoes the reader’s spiritual journey in many ways. Much like someone just beginning to explore spirituality, Julian doesn’t know where he’s going or what he’s going to find along the way. Nonetheless, he sets out without fear, and with a sense that this experience is meant for him—just as you should do when exploring your spirituality.)

After a week traveling alone through the mountains, Julian found a Sage of Sivana. The man was at least as old as Julian, but his skin was perfectly smooth and he had the energy of someone half his age.

The Sage agreed to take Julian to Sivana and teach him, on**** one condition:**Julian must take what he learns back home, and share it with as many people as possible.** Julian gladly accepted.

(Shortform note: The monk tells Julian that it’s not enough to learn the secrets of inner peace and happiness—he must share those lessons with others. Julian will later tell John the same thing. Therefore, this is something that Sharma wants you to take to heart: **Don’t just find happiness for yourself, help others to find it as well.**)

#### Sivana: “Oasis of Enlightenment”

The monk introduced himself as Yogi Raman and brought Julian to Sivana, a small village hidden in the mountains. The inhabitants all showed the same ageless health and vigor as Raman.

Julian observed that the people in Sivana went about their business purposefully, but calmly—not at all like his hectic lifestyle. Most remarkably of all, **everyone there seemed to be perfectly happy.**

> Julian’s old life was a warning about how not to live, while Sivana is Sharma’s idealized lifestyle. You can compare your lifestyle to both Sivana and Julian’s old habits to get a sense of how healthy or unhealthy your current habits may be.

The next day, Julian began studying under Yogi Raman. Through study, meditation, and quiet observation of the world, Julian learned many of the Sages’ secrets. He learned to master his own thoughts, to take responsibility for his own health—physical, emotional, and spiritual—and how to avoid slipping back into his unbalanced lifestyle of overwork and unhealthy choices.

After only three weeks, Julian noticed the first signs of personal growth: He began seeing the beauty in simple things, like the night sky and a spider’s web. At around the same time, he began experiencing an inner peace he’d never felt before. Julian became happier, more energetic, and physically healthier each day he spent with the Sages.

(Shortform note: The fact that Julian noticed these changes in only three weeks is important, especially if you’re just starting to learn about or practice spirituality—it’s a promise that you, too, will start feeling better almost immediately. Therefore, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of practicing these lessons for months or years, you can feel hopeful that you’ll start feeling better within weeks.)

### The Next Evening

Julian comes to John’s house the following evening, where they continue talking. However, at this point John begins to wonder whether it’s all a prank. He says the whole story is unbelievable.

In response, Julian picks up a teapot and pours it into John’s cup until it is full, then keeps pouring as it overflows. Julian says that, like the cup, John can’t take in any more until he empties himself.

> **An empty cup is a common metaphor for an open mind,** especially in Eastern philosophy and martial arts circles. The quote, “empty your cup so that it may be filled...” is often attributed to Bruce Lee, but in fact, he was citing an ancient Chinese proverb.
> 
> Just like you can’t pour more tea into a cup that’s already full, your mind can’t take in new ideas until you let go of what you _think_ you know. In other words, if you think you already understand a subject, you won’t be receptive to new ideas about it—especially if those ideas contradict what you already “know.”
> 
> We can see that John’s “cup” is full because he doubts Julian’s story. John’s judging the situation based on his own life experiences, which tell him that going to India and exploring the Himalayas alone would be very dangerous, and unlikely to lead to any sort of spiritual awakening. However, if John can’t learn to accept even the basic facts of Julian’s story, then he has no hope of learning the spiritual lessons that Julian wants to teach him. **Therefore, John’s first step is to simply believe that Julian’s telling the truth.**

Julian challenges John to study with him and apply his teachings just for one month. He promises that John will see huge improvements in his own life, and the lives of those around him.

> Sharma reiterates that it only takes a few weeks to form new habits, and to feel the positive effects of those habits. This lesson also suggests that major life changes can begin with small steps.
> 
> Author Gretchen Rubin explores a similar concept of improving your life through small changes in her book _The Happiness Project_. However, while Sharma suggests working to improve all areas of your life at once, Rubin lays out a 12-month plan where each month is focused on a different aspect of self-improvement:
> 
>   * Increasing your energy
> 
>   * Improving your relationship with your significant other (if applicable)
> 
>   * Finding work you love
> 
>   * Becoming a better parent (if applicable)
> 
>   * Enjoying your leisure time
> 
>   * Strengthening your friendships
> 
>   * Meaningful spending; in other words, spending money in ways that make you happy, and avoiding spending it in ways that _don’t_ make you happy
> 
>   * Cultivating gratitude in your day-to-day life
> 
>   * Pursuing your passion
> 
>   * Self-reflection
> 
>   * Improving your attitude
> 
>   * Doing all of the previous steps at once
>

### The Parable of the Garden

The Sages’ beliefs are based on seven core virtues. Yogi Raman teaches these virtues to Julian through this short story:

You are sitting in the most peaceful, most magnificent garden you’ve ever seen. In the center of the garden is a red lighthouse, six stories tall. Suddenly, the door at the base of the lighthouse opens and a nine-foot-tall, 900-pound sumo wrestler stumbles out into the middle of the garden. He’s almost completely naked, except for a pink wire cable worn as underwear (we’ll return to this cable in Chapter 10).

The sumo wrestler finds a gold watch and picks it up. He puts on the watch and immediately falls to the ground, unconscious.

Suddenly, the sumo wrestler smells some nearby roses and wakes back up. He jumps to his feet with renewed vigor and looks to the left, and is startled by what he sees. There is a long path encrusted with diamonds stretching into the distance. The sumo wrestler walks along the path, and it leads him to eternal happiness.

> Religions and other spiritual traditions often teach through stories like this one. Even the Bible, perhaps the most influential religious text in history, is commonly considered to be allegorical or metaphorical, rather than literal.
> 
> Instead of directly telling you what the lesson is, such traditions rely on imagery and metaphors to get the student thinking for him or herself. The student, guided by the teacher, must then explore the metaphors and find the lesson within them.
> 
> Because the student has to personally engage with the material, rather than memorizing lessons by rote, he’s more likely to remember that lesson and be able to apply it in various situations.

Though the story seems nonsensical at first, Sivana’s seven core virtues are represented by images within it.

(Shortform note: The rest of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is dedicated to explaining the seven metaphors from the garden parable.)
