## Shortform Introduction

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is a parable centered on Julian, a hotshot-lawyer-turned-monk, and his former colleague John. Julian shares with John what he’s learned from studying with the Sages of Sivana, a near-mythological group of monks in India who know the secrets to enlightenment.

Julian’s lessons range from gaining control of your thoughts, to finding a purpose in life, to properly managing your time so that you can achieve that purpose. All of this works toward the ultimate goal of living a simple, fulfilling, and happy life.

### About the Author

Sharma started his career as a litigation lawyer, but he found the work unfulfilling. He quit law and self-published his first self-help book, _MegaLiving: 30 Days to a Perfect Life_ ,__ in 1994.

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ was Sharma’s second book, and it became a worldwide hit. With this book’s success, Sharma found himself in demand as a life coach and motivational speaker. In 1997 he founded the management consulting firm Sharma Leadership International.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers

Robin Sharma initially self-published _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ in 1996. Three years later, in 1999, HarperCollins republished it for commercial distribution.

### The Book’s Context

While the events of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ are fictional, they’re based on Sharma’s own experiences.

As discussed, Sharma never found peace or satisfaction working as a lawyer, and his wife divorced him due to his hectic work schedule. Sharma quit law in his twenties and, with the support of his parents, pursued a career in writing instead. Many of the core lessons in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ come from life lessons that Sharma learned from his parents.

The character Julian Mantle lived an exaggerated version of Sharma’s own life story. Rather than recognizing his own unhappiness and quitting law early, he kept going until he suffered a heart attack. Rather than adjusting his lifestyle based on life lessons from Indian parents, Julian traveled to India to study with a mythical group of sages. Now, Julian is passing on what he’s learned to his friend John, just as Sharma is passing on what he’s learned to his readers.

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ provides a basic grounding in core concepts of spirituality and self-improvement, such as inner peace and the interconnectedness of all life. Many of the book’s teachings draw upon Buddhist beliefs and practices, like meditation and accepting each moment as it comes; however, it’s written with secular readers in mind.

#### The Book’s Impact

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ has been translated into 51 languages and has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.

The book’s success cemented Robin Sharma’s position as a renowned author and self-help guru and kicked off a series of bestselling books, including:

  * _The Secret Letters of the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_
  * _Family Wisdom From the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_
  * _Who Will Cry When You Die? Life Lessons From the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_
  * _Leadership Wisdom From the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_
  * _Discover Your Destiny With the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_



### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Fans praise _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ for its simple, straightforward lessons and accessible writing style. Mark Victor (co-author of _Chicken Soup for the Soul_) said the book was “Nothing less than sensational.”

Critics argue that the lessons in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ are so oversimplified that they’re useless, or that the book’s just restating lessons that any number of other self-help books teach. Some also feel that the parable format feels childish.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is a parable, meaning that it’s in the form of a story rather than a list of lessons or commandments. This style is intended to engage the reader’s imagination and interest—it gets you _thinking_ instead of just memorizing, which is helpful in figuring out how to apply the book’s spiritual lessons to your own life.

_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ gives basic overviews of many different spiritual concepts—summed up in the Seven Virtues that Julian teaches to John—as well as offering guidance on how to start applying those virtues to your own life. This makes it a good introduction for readers new to Eastern spirituality. That said, _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ ’s __ wide array of ideas and practices might overwhelm the reader—it seems impossible to practice everything that Sharma recommends. He suggests **each reader take away whatever lessons and exercises are useful to him or her, rather than feeling pressured to remember and practice them all.**

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

This book contains several stories layered on top of each other. The “top layer” is Julian speaking to John. Within that story is the story that Julian’s telling about his time in India. Within Julian’s story is a _third_ story: a short parable that one of the monks told him, which contains the Seven Virtues that this book seeks to teach the reader.

Despite the layered narratives, _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is easy to follow. Most of the story happens within the first “layer,” as Julian passes along what he’s learned to John. This narrative structure allows John to take the place of the reader and ask questions that Robin Sharma anticipated his readers would ask about the lessons.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ll explore _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ as an introduction to spirituality and philosophy. In addition to examining Sharma’s teachings, we’ll build connections to other texts that explore certain ideas in more depth (such as _The Power of Now_ explaining how to “live in the moment”), and to other philosophical traditions with similar teachings (such as Stoicism’s emphasis on understanding your purpose).

The first six chapters of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ are short—only about a fifth of the book’s total pages—and are devoted to introducing the characters and the setting. To highlight the lessons in the last seven chapters, we’ve reorganized the narrative of the first six chapters into a single section.

Each of the remaining seven chapters is devoted to one of the Seven Virtues: Each chapter explains what the virtue is, why it’s important, and how to begin practicing it in your own life. As in the story, this allows each piece of information to flow logically to the next. Furthermore, it’s helpful to keep the narrative arc intact so that we can frame the lessons in terms of the conversation between Julian and John.
