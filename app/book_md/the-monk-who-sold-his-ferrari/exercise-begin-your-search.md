## Exercise: Begin Your Search

It’s time to begin searching for your own Dharma, and the first step is to set goals. Remember that enjoying the process is crucial—you won’t reach your destination if every step feels like a chore.

* * *

Write down a single, specific goal for yourself, and a reasonable timeframe to achieve it. The goal could be from any part of your life, but should represent an improvement that you want to make.

Close your eyes and picture yourself achieving that goal. What do you see?

What kind of stakes can you add to the goal to encourage yourself to pursue it? For example, could you tell some friends about your new goal, or promise yourself a reward if you reach it?

What can you do _today_ to get closer to that goal?

What can you do tomorrow, and every day from then on, to get closer to that goal?
