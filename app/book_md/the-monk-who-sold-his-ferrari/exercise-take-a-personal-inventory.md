## Exercise: Take a Personal Inventory

Julian’s old lifestyle and the Sages’ lifestyle illustrate two different extremes: The first is a life of stress, overindulgence, and materialism, while the second is a simple, balanced, and fulfilling lifestyle. Take a few minutes now to think about where you fall on the spectrum from Julian’s old life to the lives that the Sages of Sivana lead.

* * *

Think back on the past week. Name one thing that was a major source of stress for you.

What’s one unhealthy habit you’ve indulged?

Now think about the positives: What’s one thing that made you happy over the past week?

What’s a healthy choice that you made this week?
