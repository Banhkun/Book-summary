## Chapter 2: The Horror Begins

Every April, millions of tiny flowers burst into life across the vast plains of Osage County, Oklahoma. But their beauty is short-lived—In May, larger flowers bloom, killing the smaller ones by choking out their access to life-giving sun and water. This is why the Osage call May “the time of the flower-killing moon.” In 1921, May was to signal the start of a far more sinister season of death.

**On May 27, 1921, the partially decomposed body of a 25-year-old Osage woman named Anna Brown was discovered in a ravine** in Osage County, Oklahoma, dead from a bullet to the back of the head. Anna would be merely one of the first victims in a five-year-long Reign of Terror that would run from 1921-1926 and claim the lives of dozens (and possibly hundreds) of Osage men, women, and children.

Anna’s immediate family included her sisters, Mollie Burkhart and Rita Smith, and her mother, Elizabeth Kyle. Mollie was married to a white man named Ernest Burkhardt, a native of Texas who had moved to Osage County as a young man. Rita and Anna had also married white men.

(Shortform note: In this NPR interview, _Killers of the Flower Moon_ author David Grann explains that intermarriage between whites and Osage had become quite common by the early 20th century. Many white people from states bordering Oklahoma had been drawn to the area by the oil boom and the opportunity to get rich—by either striking oil or marrying an Osage.)

Anna had been a vivacious, outgoing young woman. In the days before her disappearance, Anna’s family had been concerned about her behavior—she had been staying out late at night at speakeasies, often in the company of Bryan Burkhart, the brother of her sister Mollie’s husband. Anna had been missing for three days, immediately sparking her family’s worst fears. They were no strangers to loss—**just a few years before, a younger sister named Minnie had died of a mysterious and unexplained wasting illness.**

### The Citizens Inquest

**Elements of the frontier justice system remained in these parts of rural Oklahoma in the 1920s.** Police forces were not yet fully professionalized, so ordinary citizens still assumed some of the responsibilities of criminal justice, including investigation of evidence and even pursuit of suspects.

This was a relic of old American attitudes toward official police departments, dating back to the era of the Revolutionary War. Americans of that time feared that professional law enforcement agencies, like standing armies, would become instruments of oppression that would trample upon their rights and liberties. It was only with the spread of industrialization and urbanization, and public fear of the crime that was expected to follow in their wake, that professionally staffed police departments emerged.

**One of the remaining vestiges of the former rough-and-tumble approach to criminal justice was the citizens inquest** , to which the murder investigation of Anna Brown was subjected. In a citizens inquest, members of the community visited the scene of a homicide with the county coroner to collect evidence and record any witness testimony. The all-white members of Anna’s inquest were selected not for any particular expertise, but merely for being the first white men to arrive on the scene. The amateurish and careless examination that followed adhered to no forensic protocol. There was no canvassing of the area for footprints or shell casings and no dusting for fingerprints. To make matters worse, the presence of the large crowd contaminated and compromised the crime scene, significantly hampering the subsequent investigation.

Anna’s body was already badly decomposed when it was discovered, with the corpse emitting a nearly unbearable stench in the May heat. The primitive autopsy was an awful and grisly affair—onlookers gawked as the coroner dismembered Anna’s putrefying remains, using the most primitive of instruments and taking little care to respect her body or the mortuary practices of the Osage. Her mother and sister Mollie were present while the coroner performed his grim task on the barely recognizable body, identified only by her clothes and the gold fillings in her mouth. During the course of the gruesome procedure, Anna’s body was cut open and her cranium sliced open to extract her brain. After seeing a small bullet entrance wound at the back of the head, the coroner pronounced Anna’s death a homicide.

**He was not alone in conducting the examination of Anna’s remains. He was joined by two local doctors, James and David Shoun**. Although they had identified the entrance wound at the back of Anna’s head and pronounced her death a murder, they could not locate the bullet. Also on the scene was the sheriff of Osage County, a man named Harve Freas.

Freas represented the traditional, informal approach to law enforcement that was still the practice’s guiding philosophy in this remote region of the United States at this time. He, like many rural sheriffs, was not a professionally trained law enforcement official. He was a rugged frontiersman, a relic of the Old West, in which **so-called “lawmen” were little more than criminals themselves**. These lawmen tended to have little regard for the law itself, frequently administering violence while turning a blind eye to gambling and bootlegging activities. Freas was cut from this cloth, having connections to known outlaw figures in the area.

**Mollie and her family were devastated by the loss of Anna.** Mollie took the lead in organizing her sister’s funeral, incorporating elements of both Catholic and Osage funerary tradition. Unfortunately, because Anna’s body was in such a state of decomposition (not to mention having been manhandled by the Shoun brothers and the coroner during the autopsy), Mollie was unable to paint her sister’s face—which, according to Osage religious rites, would mean that Anna’s spirit would be lost. Adding insult to injury, the family was gouged by the undertaker, who charged them the exorbitant rate of $1,450 for Mollie’s casket, $80,000 in today’s dollars.

### William Hale: King of the Osage Hills

**But Anna’s murder was to be just the beginning**. About a week after her body was discovered, _another_ Osage victim was found near an oil rig. This time, the corpse belonged to a man named Charles Whitehorn, who had been missing for about two weeks. Whitehorn was a well-known and popular figure in Osage County, married to a half-white, half-Cheyenne woman. Like Anna Brown, he had been shot in the head—and the bullets appeared to be the same kind as the ones that had killed Anna Brown.

The execution-style murders of two Osage, coming so quickly on the heels of one another, became a prominent story in the local news, as speculation began to mount about who could be responsible. The similar method of killing suggested a link between the two murders, as did their proximity in space and time.

Because she spoke English and was married to a white man, Mollie became the family’s natural liaison with the white authorities. But this was also due to the fact that she wasn’t married to just _any_ white man. **Her husband, Ernest Burkhart, was the nephew of William Hale, one of the most prominent figures in Osage County.**

Hale was a widely respected businessman and influential force in the county, having made his fortune in the cattle business. Known as the “King of the Osage Hills,” Hale’s business interests were firmly entrenched throughout the county. He had powerful political connections and was even a reserve deputy sheriff in the town of Fairfax. The county prosecutor himself owed his election to Hale.

In an era when many white authority figures used their status to exploit and abuse the Osage, **Hale positioned himself as a benevolent, if somewhat paternal, figure**. His philanthropy had supported the establishment of charities, schools, and hospitals for the Osage, and he vowed to Mollie and her mother that he would see justice done for Anna.

### The Investigation Stalls

**Mollie testified to the local justice of the peace that she had last seen Anna in the company of her brother-in-law, Bryan Burkhart**. Bryan testified that he had dropped Anna off at home early in the evening, after which he’d gone back into town. The authorities even briefly detained both Bryan and Ernest Burkhart, though the evidence against them at this time was purely circumstantial and they were soon released.

But there were competing theories about who the murderer could be, given the chaos and lawlessness that defined Osage County. The undeveloped wilderness of the area made it a prominent hideout for all manner of bandits, fugitives, and outlaws. Moreover, many unscrupulous characters had been drawn to the area by the oil money, making the county a hotbed of forgers, scam artists, and gangs of armed robbers.

**In this environment, there was no shortage of red herrings, as unsavory informants with ulterior motives provided investigators with false leads.** One man, a convicted and imprisoned forger, initially confessed to the crime. He claimed that he had been paid by Anna’s ex-husband to murder her and dump her body in the ravine. But officials quickly concluded that the man’s confession was false—he hadn’t been in the county at the time and had had no known contact with the ex-husband, who also had a proven alibi. The forger later confessed that he had made his story up, hoping to secure better prison conditions.

Other rumors surfaced that Anna’s slaying was part of a love triangle gone bad, with some of these rumors even positing a romantic relationship between Anna Brown and the other murder victim, Charles Whitehorn. Investigators pursued these leads, but they, too, proved to be lies.

Investigators _thought_ they had a break in the case when they discovered that someone had placed a phone call to Anna’s house on the night she disappeared, with the call coming from a business in the nearby town of Ralston. But no operator in Ralston had any record of such a call. Authorities suspected that someone had arranged to have the phone records falsified to throw investigators off.

**By July 1921, the local authorities wrapped up the investigation, concluding that Anna was murdered by “parties unknown.”** They had surrendered the quest for justice for Anna. And that same month, another tragedy befell Mollie Brown when her mother, Lizzie, died from her wasting illness, so similar to how Minnie had died a few years before—and to how many other healthy Osage seemed to have died of unexplained wasting sicknesses in recent months.

Bill Smith, a white man and the husband of Mollie’s sister, Rita, found the circumstances of Lizzie’s death to be highly suspicious. He began to believe that she and other Osage had been deliberately poisoned, and that her death was linked to those of Anna Brown and Charles Whitehorn.

### The Failures of Private Investigators

**The criminal justice system in Oklahoma was hopelessly corrupt, incompetent, and amateurish at this time**. Sheriff Freas, nominally in charge of the murder investigations, was removed by the state attorney general shortly after the murders for his corrupt dealings with bootleggers and gamblers.

Given this sorry state of affairs, private investigators often stepped in to fill the void. But the private investigators were little better, and quite possibly worse. **Many agents of the famed Pinkerton Detective Agency were criminals themselves** , with no respect for people’s civil liberties or for proper protocol in criminal investigations. Many, similarly, used their position to extort and terrorize the people they were supposed to be protecting.

Scott Mathis, a local merchant who was also serving as the administrator of Anna’s estate (Anna having been deemed a financial “incompetent” by the government), hired a private investigator named William J. Burns to look into the Osage murders. Unfortunately, Burns proved to be just another in a long line of hustlers, scam artists, and charlatans, an unscrupulous character who was known to rig juries and break into law offices to steal evidence. He and his team of investigators pursued several false leads, with no results. **The investigator hired by William Hale, a shadowy figure who went by the name of “Pike,” likewise failed to make any headway.**
