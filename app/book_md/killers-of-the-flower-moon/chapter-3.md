## Chapter 3: The Murders Escalate

In February 1922, nine months after the bodies of Anna Brown and Charles Whitehorn were discovered, a fit and healthy 29-year-old Osage man named William Stepson suddenly dropped dead. Authorities concluded that he had died of strychnine poisoning. **Poison was an ideal way to commit murder in a remote locale like Osage County, with incompetent professional law enforcement professionals and a coroner untrained in forensics** , without access to a crime lab.

The spate of mysterious poisonings of Osage men and women continued into July 1923. The community was, rightly, terrified. These were clearly not random homicides—**the tribe was clearly being targeted by a well-orchestrated and coordinated campaign of murder**. In their distress and desperation, the Osage prevailed upon a white oilman named Barney McBride to journey to Washington, D.C. and use his connections there to lobby the federal government to intercede in the case directly. McBridge was a trusted and benevolent figure among the Osage, and they believed he could intercede effectively on their behalf.

But McBride himself fell victim to the murderous conspiracy, even in faraway Washington, D.C. In August 1922, he was found dead in a culvert in Maryland, a short distance from the capital. Now, the Osage murders were national news. The _Washington Post_ headline blared: “CONSPIRACY BELIEVED TO KILL RICH INDIANS.”

### The Death of Henry Roan

**In February 1923, the body of a 40-year-old Osage man named Henry Roan was found slumped behind the steering wheel of a Buick** , a few miles outside of Fairfax. Roan had been shot in the back of the head. Local authorities notified William Hale, whom Roan had considered a close friend and benefactor. In fact, Hale was the benefactor on Roan’s $25,000 life insurance policy. Hale was present when another gruesome citizens inquest and autopsy was performed on Roan’s remains. Of course, Hale didn’t reveal the existence of the life insurance policy—which had given him a direct financial interest in Roan’s death.

Roan’s death was shocking to Mollie, who had just given birth to her third child—a girl named Anna. Roan had briefly been Mollie’s husband, back in 1902, before she’d met Ernest. As it was a traditional Osage marriage, there was no legal record of it, but Mollie still had a deep and personal connection to Roan. She had never told Ernest about this marriage, however, and chose to keep her connection to this latest murder a secret.

**The murder of Roan created an atmosphere of terror and paranoia that ripped the community apart.** People began to suspect their neighbors, friends, and even family of being involved in the deadly conspiracy. Bill Smith, Mollie’s brother-in-law, had been looking into the killings on his own, unable to shake the suspicion that his mother-in-law, Lizzie, had been poisoned.

He and his wife Rita, Mollie’s sister, began to receive threats and intimidating “warnings” as Bill appeared to get closer to the truth, especially after he discovered a connection between Roan’s murder and local criminal kingpin and bootlegger Henry Grammer. It seemed that that Roan had told people he was headed to Grammer’s ranch to get some illegal whiskey right before he disappeared—and that Anna Burkhart had often visited Grammer’s ranch as well. Bill and Rita Smith fled their home in early 1923, believing that they were being targeted. Bill confided to his friends that he “didn’t expect to live long.”

### The Explosion

**On March 10, 1923, the house that Bill and Rita Smith had moved into exploded in a thunderous blast, just before three o’clock in the morning**. Neighbors heard the explosion for miles around, with the force of the blast blowing out windows in the neighboring town of Fairfax. Nothing remained of the house but twisted metal and burnt furniture.

A party of searchers, including Ernest Burkhart, arrived on the scene and found Bill Smith, burnt nearly beyond recognition. Rita’s mangled and charred remains were pulled from the rubble. The body of their young servant, Nettie Brookshire, was never found—most likely, her body entirely melted away in the blast, leaving no remains.

Bill recovered consciousness two days later, in unbearable physical agony and emotional despair upon learning of his wife’s death. The doctor David Shoun, one of the two brothers who had presided over the autopsy of Anna Brown, claimed that Bill revealed no details of what he knew about the explosion or the murders that had preceded it before his death on March 14.

**By this time, the spate of killings had become known as the Osage Reign of Terror**. In April 1923, the Governor of Oklahoma sent the top state investigator, Herman Fox Davis, to Osage County. Some Osage held out hope that an outside agent would get better results than the local authorities. But Davis proved to be just the latest in a long line of corrupt and incompetent state and local law enforcement officials. Almost immediately after arriving in Osage County, he was caught taking a bribe from the operator of a local gambling ring. Davis would be convicted of bribery in June 1923.

**But there were still white people who sought to obtain justice for the terrorized Osage.** In June 1923, a local attorney named W.W. Vaughan spoke to an Osage friend of his named George Bigheart, who was in an Oklahoma City hospital, dying from what both men suspected was poisoning. At this meeting, Bigheart relayed critical information that he had obtained about the killings and passed along some documents that would point to those responsible for them. Vaughan stayed at Bigheart’s side until Bigheart finally passed away. Vaughan then called the Osage County sheriff, who had replaced the disgraced Freas, to tell him that he had new information on the case and was taking the first train back to the county to fully brief the authorities.

But Vaughan never got to share what he’d heard from Bigheart. The attorney’s body was found near the railroad tracks three days after he placed this call to the sheriff. **He had been strangled to death, stripped naked, and thrown from the train**. The documents he’d obtained from Bigheart were gone.

### Targeting Mollie

In the wake of the Smith bombing, Mollie’s situation became even more fraught. **Mollie was convinced that there was a well-orchestrated plot afoot to eliminate her family, and that she would be the next target.** She became a recluse, shuttering her windows and closing her home to guests. In this state of absolute terror, she even gave her new baby, Anna, to a relative to raise. Most troublingly, she was in ill health—she was a diabetic, and her condition appeared to be getting worse.

In response, the ever-present local doctors, the brothers David and James Shoun, visited Mollie regularly to give her injections of what they claimed was insulin. But the authorities weren’t so sure that Mollie _was_ really sick. An anonymous letter to the Bureau of Indian Affairs warned that Mollie’s life was in grave danger. **Mollie _wasn’t_ sick with diabetes—like George Bigheart, William Stepson, and her own mother, she was being poisoned**. The only question was who was responsible.

### Appeal to the Federal Government

By 1923, more than two years into the Reign of Terror, 24 lay dead. Even the local justice of the peace and county sheriff were terrified and they refused to open up new inquests into the murders. The campaign of terror looked to have won a complete victory over the forces of law and order.

By now, it was clear to the Osage that the local authorities were totally unable to deal with the situation. In 1923, the Tribal Council drafted a written appeal to U.S. Senator Charles Curtis, who was himself part-Osage.

(Shortform note: Charles Curtis would later serve one term as Vice President of the United States under President Herbert Hoover. He is, to-date, the only person of Native American ancestry to hold the office.)

**Eventually, the Bureau of Investigation, a then-obscure branch of the federal Department of Justice, sent agents into Osage County to investigate the ongoing slaughter**. The Bureau, outrageously, charged the tribe $20,000 for its services—$300,000 in today’s money. Even worse, they badly bungled the case when they released from prison a convicted bank robber named Blackie Thompson, whom they hoped would help the investigation by working as an undercover informant. Unfortunately, Blackie went on a crime spree upon his release, robbing a bank and killing a police officer, offenses for which he was captured and re-imprisoned.

The entire ordeal was _another_ failure of law enforcement in Osage County, and a fiasco for the Bureau. It seemed there was little hope of justice for the Osage.
