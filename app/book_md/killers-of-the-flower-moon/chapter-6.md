## Chapter 6: The Aftermath

**The success in prosecuting the Osage murder case was a major coup for the Bureau of Investigation—and for its ambitious and attention-seeking director, J. Edgar Hoover.** Hoover crowed to the media that the case had been deemed unwinnable by everyone, including local sheriffs, county prosecutors, and even the Oklahoma Attorney General, until the Bureau had stepped in.

Hoover used the glowing press from the Osage case to boost the Bureau’s image and position himself and his agency in the public imagination as the epitome of no-nonsense, professional, efficient, and effective law enforcement. Indeed, he was as relentless in his pursuit of headlines as he was of criminals. In the early 1930s, Hoover even arranged to have dramatized versions of the Bureau’s most famous cases (including the Osage case) serialized as popular radio dramas. In all of these fictionalized accounts, Bureau agents were presented as resourceful and quick-witted near-supermen, for whom criminals were no match.

As the years went on, Hoover’s power and influence only grew. In the 1930s, the FBI’s profile loomed larger when it took on infamous “Public Enemies” like John Dillinger, the Lindbergh baby kidnapper, organized crime figures, and other Depression-era outlaws.

**But in his endless quest for publicity, Hoover neglected some key figures who had helped the Bureau achieve such great success—the actual agents in the field, men like Tom White.** Although Hoover praised Tom’s work privately, he never shared the public spotlight with him. Over the years and decades that followed, Hoover maintained a cordial, if cool, public distance from the agent who had done so much to remake the Bureau’s image.

### Tom White: The Forgotten Hero

Tom White did at least enjoy an initial career boost from his work on the Osage case. In fall 1926, the U.S. Justice Department named him the new warden of the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas. Life had come full-circle for Tom, who had grown up in the shadow of the county jail that his father had operated in Texas.

Like he had when he was a boy, Tom and his family lived in housing directly on the prison grounds. He followed in his father’s footsteps as warden—although he was tough and uncompromising on matters of order and discipline, he also would not allow the men in his custody to suffer cruel or inhumane treatment. He was fair-minded with the inmates at Leavenworth and made genuine efforts to improve conditions at the notoriously unsafe prison.

**For someone of his background and era, Tom White was progressive in his attitudes towards convicted criminals** , seeing in many of them the potential for redemption and rehabilitation. He was personally opposed to capital punishment, although he was occasionally called upon to oversee executions at the prison—just as his father had been.

Shortly after he arrived at Leavenworth, Hale and Ramsey were transferred to the very same penitentiary. White treated them no differently than any other inmates, sometimes even going out of his way to make it easier for Hale’s wife to visit her husband. For his part, Hale never admitted any involvement in the Osage slayings. He was unrepentant throughout his time in prison, even attempting to bribe an appeals court to secure his early release.

In 1931, after five years on the job, Tom White was shot in the arm by a gang of inmates who had managed to break out of Leavenworth. Tom had tracked the gang to a nearby farm, where they were holding a teenage brother and sister hostage. His intervention saved their lives, though Tom forever lost the use of his left arm. When the members of the gang were returned to Leavenworth, Tom ordered his staff not to harm them, still maintaining his preference for order and justice over mindless vengeance.

**Despite his ordeal, Tom White still believed that some inmates could be rehabilitated**. One convict, Red Rudensky, a safecracker, had initially been recruited to join the escape plot. But Rudensky had refused, having seen that White was a humane and fair-minded warden who had made genuine attempts to help the men of Leavenworth reintegrate into society upon release.

White had taken an interest in Rudensky’s progress, and the inmate didn’t want to jeopardize his chance of rehabilitation with the dangerous escape attempt. Rudensky turned out to be one of the best success stories to come from White’s progressive approach to the penal system—after he was paroled in 1944, he went on to a successful career as an author and businessman. He credited Tom White with helping get his life back on track.

**After White retired in 1951 at the age of 70, he tried several times to reestablish contact with Hoover, who rebuffed his former star agent.** Hoover had no interest in sharing credit or the public spotlight with White and had no use for the old retired lawman. White was determined not to let the Osage case fade from public memory and wanted to share with the world his part in bringing the conspirators to justice. Spurned by Hoover, he tried his hand at writing memoirs, a project which he began in 1958.

To assist with this project, he asked Hoover if the FBI would be willing to release old files from the Osage case. But the FBI provided only the most perfunctory materials, and the now-elderly and frail White was left largely on his own to work on the memoirs. Sadly, his work was rejected by the publisher. **Tom passed away in 1971, an obscure and largely forgotten figure** , despite his extraordinary efforts in bringing down one of the most infamous criminal conspiracies to terrorize Americans in the early 20th century.

### Life After the Reign of Terror

Following the elimination of her family and the conviction of her husband, Mollie was left to rebuild the shattered pieces of her life. Yet, somehow, she managed to find some measure of happiness and purpose in the years after the Reign of Terror.

In 1928, she married a half-white, half-Creek man named John Cobb. By all accounts, their love was true and genuine. As a full-blooded Osage woman, Mollie had been declared “incompetent” and, thus, unable to manage her assets throughout her adult life. She was determined to free herself from this unjust burden. **In 1931, Mollie secured her personal victory over the cruel and inhumane guardian system** when a court granted her full U.S. citizenship and ruled that, at age 44, she was competent to manage her own financial affairs. Until she passed away in 1937, Mollie would lead a life of financial autonomy. Although she could never recover what had been robbed from her, in her final years, she succeeded in lifting the chains that had shackled her for her entire life.

Hale was released from prison in 1947, although he was barred from returning to Oklahoma. He lived the rest of his life in quiet obscurity, before dying in 1962 at the age of 87.

In 1966, Ernest Burkhart was finally paroled and returned to Oklahoma to live with his brother Bryan (Ernest had briefly been set free before this time, but had committed another crime and swiftly been reincarcerated). **Mollie’s surviving children and grandchildren were outraged that Ernest dared to set foot back in their community after the crimes he had committed.** The family ostracized Ernest, who lived out most of the rest of his days in a vermin-infested trailer. Ernest’s son, nicknamed “Cowboy,” did occasionally visit him, possibly out of a desire for some connection with his estranged father. But even Cowboy couldn’t shut out his father’s crimes—when Ernest died in 1986 and was cremated, Cowboy chucked the ashes over a bridge in rage.

Today, much of the wealth of the Osage has evaporated, as oil prices plunged beginning in the 1930s. **The cruel irony was that the Osage finally gained control of their wealth precisely when the source of that wealth began to lose much of its value.** As early as 1931, the annual yield from an Osage headright had plummeted to $800. The situation became more dire as the oil wells dried up due to overdrilling, along with the discovery of new petroleum sources in other parts of the world. At one auction in the 1920s, prospectors had bid a collective $14 million for Osage oil leases—in 2012, three leases went for less than $25,000. The former boomtowns had turned into decaying and desolate ghost towns.

### A Closed Case?

**Although the Reign of Terror took place nearly a century ago, its memory haunts the Osage today**. A great-grandson of the slaughtered Henry Roan told David Grann, author of _Killers of the Flower Moon_ , that the murders are always in the back of his mind, especially knowing how personally connected he was to all of it.

In his archival research and interviews with descendants of victims of the Reign of Terror, Grann made a shocking discovery—Hale and his gang were _not_ the sole perpetrators of the murderous conspiracy. Although the Bureau had declared the case to be closed when Hale, Burkhart, Morrison, and Ramsey were convicted, many more people had taken part in the slaughter. **Not all of the murders could be linked to Hale—and justice had never been done for these victims.**

The Osage with whom the author spoke told him that there were _many_ unsolved murders from the Reign of Terror that were never counted among the totals and never properly investigated by the Bureau. As he pored over the archival record, Grann discovered the stories of Osage who had been murdered _before_ the Reign of Terror’s conventional start date of 1921. One Osage woman, Mary Lewis, had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer by two white men and her body left to rot in a swamp. This heinous crime had occurred in 1918, three years _before_ Anna Brown was found in the ravine. **The Burkhart-Hale saga may have been the bloodiest episode of the Reign of Terror, but it was just one thread in a vast web of murder and mayhem.**

Grann made contact with Martha Vaughan, a granddaughter of W.W. Vaughan, the attorney and confidante of George Bigheart who had been mysteriously strangled and thrown from a train after he’d publicly declared his intention to intervene on behalf of the Osage in 1923. Vaughan had been Bigheart’s attorney and was helping him obtain a certificate of competence, which would have entitled Bigheart to freely spend his headright money instead of having it frozen in a guardianship. Yet a few days after Bigheart had conferred with Vaughan, both men were dead.

Martha believed that there was more to the murder than Hale simply wanting to eliminate someone he perceived as a threat. She said that a relative who had tried to investigate Vaughan’s death _after_ Hale’s incarceration had received an anonymous letter threatening to kill the entire family if he looked into the matter any further. Whatever the conspiracy was, it went beyond Hale.

Martha also revealed that a shadowy and unscrupulous figure named H.G. Burt had embezzled Vaughan’s estate after his death. When Grann dug further, he discovered that Burt had been deeply involved in the “Indian business,” borrowing money on the cheap from whites before loaning it back out to Osage at usurious interest rates. In reality, he was little more than a loan shark. **Agents of the Bureau had identified Burt as an associate of Hale during the original investigation, but never brought charges against him.**

As it turned out, Burt had been named guardian of Bigheart’s daughter’s headright (as he had been for many other Osage) and would have been in a position to greatly profit from Bigheart’s death. Moreover, a news article at the time of Vaughan’s murder from the _Pawhuska Daily Capital_ revealed that Burt had been a passenger on the very same train from which Vaughan was thrown. It may have been circumstantial, but the evidence in the historical record of Burt’s guilt was overwhelming—and he was merely one of the countless white Oklahomans of the time who stood to gain handsomely from the bloody “Indian business.”

### The True Toll

**The archival records showed a seemingly endless series of Osage wards who died under mysterious circumstances during this era**. Because these cases were never investigated by local authorities, private investigators, or even the Bureau of Investigation, it was impossible to determine conclusively whether or not these individuals had been murdered. But their frequency and shared characteristics strongly hinted at a conspiracy.

Many deaths that looked innocuous were anything but. One Bureau agent wrote in the case files that white perpetrators would get an Osage drunk and take them to a doctor (like the Shoun brothers) who would declare them intoxicated. Poison would then be injected into the victim, after which the doctor would pronounce them dead of alcohol poisoning. **Many scholars now believe that the official death count of 24 for the Reign of Terror is tragically off the mark, and that the true figure is in the hundreds.**

One scholar has tabulated the Osage annual death rate from 1907-1923 to be 19 per 1,000. The comparable rate for whites during this period was 12 per 1,000: Osage were dying at more than 1.5 times the rate of white people. And this was all despite the vast wealth of the tribe, which, all other things being equal, should have made their death rates _lower_ than those of white people. Another scholar has noted how many Osage from the era died in childhood, a chilling sign of the moral depravity of the killers.

**So many prominent members of the white community had blood on their hands** —business leaders like Hale; doctors like the Shoun brothers; merchants like Scott Mathis, owner of the Big Hill Trading Company and guardian of Anna Brown’s estate; bankers like H.G. Burt; not to mention attorneys, politicians, law enforcement officials, and judges.

The Osage community has managed to persevere—the tribe now operates several casinos that generate tens of millions of dollars annually and, in 2011, received a $380 settlement from the U.S government in compensation for the decades of fraud and abuse. The Osage Nation has its own tribal government within the state of Oklahoma and operates its own health, education, and welfare programs. And although the oil money is mostly gone, the old fear that the white man’s money would erase their identity has happily _not_ come to pass, and the tribe proudly maintains its cultural heritage.

**But the past can never be erased and the pain never forgotten. The fields and prairies of Osage County are forever soaked in blood.**
