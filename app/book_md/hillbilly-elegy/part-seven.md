## Part Seven: Coming to Terms

JD had made it. He was a successful Yale lawyer.**He had beaten the odds and achieved his slice of the American Dream.** But his girlfriend Usha (soon to be his wife) helped JD realize that he still carried the baggage of his tumultuous upbringing. She pointed out that **he still had no healthy mechanism of conflict resolution.**

While he might not have taken to screaming, cursing, and vicious insulting like his mother, he would withdraw completely from her at the slightest disagreement. He feared becoming like Bev and desperately wished to avoid subjecting Usha to that experience.

On one occasion, Usha attempted to comfort JD after he’d performed badly in an interview with a Washington, D.C. law firm. He exploded at her in classic Bev-style, yelling,**“Don’t make excuses for weakness. I didn’t get here by making excuses for failure.”**

He eventually apologized, expecting her to pounce on this act of “surrender” and go for the jugular with him—because that’s exactly what _his_ family back in Middletown would have done. But instead, she forgave him and explained to him that he needed to learn how to talk to her.

JD further saw how much healing he needed to do when he went to Thanksgiving dinner at Usha’s family’s home. **The family was happy and free of conflict and drama** —they actually seemed to _enjoy_ each other’s company. There were no accusations or angry exchanges between family members.

In fact, when JD learned that there was an estranged family member, he was surprised by her father’s explanation. He told JD that he still called and checked up on him, telling him that **you can’t just turn your back on family.**

### Adverse Childhood Experiences

Prompted by these experiences, JD wanted to learn more about how the kind of traumas he’d experienced as a child affected people in their adulthood. He researched the phenomenon called adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

Common ACEs included being sworn at or insulted; being pushed or grabbed; witnessing a lack of support among family members; living with substance abusers; and exposure to people who were clinically depressed or suicidal. Looking back, JD realized that **he had experienced all of these situations during the course of his childhood.**

He saw that he wasn’t alone. **Over half of children growing up in working-class households had experienced at least one ACE**. The contrast with non-working-class people, among whom only one in ten experienced an ACE, was stark.

Children with ACEs are likelier to suffer from anxiety and depression, performly poorly in their studies, and experience unstable relationships—tragically, the pattern of dysfunction in these children’s lives perpetuates itself generation after generation.

As adults,**people replicate the instability they themselves witnessed as children**. Thus, JD’s mother descended from being a salutatorian of her high school to the multiple marriages and drug addiction of her adulthood. Even people like his sister Lindsay, his cousin Gail, and his Aunt Wee, all of whom managed to achieve stability, struggled through periods of dysfunctional relationships.

### Making Peace With Mom

JD knew he had to change his thinking, to stop seeing disagreements as struggles to the death, stop using words as weapons, and stop thinking of apologizing as a form of weakness and surrender. To do this, he needed to finally make peace and come to terms with the person who had caused him more grief and anguish than anyone: his mother.

JD had been out of regular contact with his mother for a long time by this point. He had run the gamut of emotions toward her, but mostly, he was angry. He was angry that her addictions had robbed him of so much of his childhood; and he was angry that she had failed to model good adult behavior for him, forcing him to do it all on his own.

But he now realized that**he had never tried to empathize with her** , to understand what it was like to _be_ her. Years ago, he had rejected Bev’s 12-step platitudes about her substance abuse being a disease. He had seen it as a shameful cop-out, an abdication of any responsibility for the situation she had put herself—and her children—in.

But JD’s thinking had evolved. Was Bev an out-of-control narcissist, or was she really just a product of her culture? **What self-destructive values had she learned from her _own_ childhood?**

In the end, JD saw that it was a mix of both. Given what he now knew about ACEs, it was obvious to him that Bev had clearly suffered from severe emotional trauma during her childhood. Her experiences of seeing her father’s alcoholism and her parents’ volatile marriage had to have had some impact on the course her life took as an adult. But he also placed personal responsibility front-and-center. Bev was hardly a villain, but**she deserved much of the blame for what she inflicted on her children.**

#### Never Turn Your Back

JD’s new attitude toward his mother would once again be put to the test when she turned to a new drug: heroin. This time, however, JD worked to help his mother get on her feet. Following the advice of Usha’s father, **he was practicing empathy rather than turning his back.**

He checked her into a Middletown motel to help her avoid homelessness and monitored her finances to make sure she stayed on track. He was acting more like a parent to her, as if she were _his_ child. And he accepted his limits: he couldn’t solve all of his mom’s problems, she had to fight some of her battles on her own. But he also saw that **he couldn’t turn his back on family, no matter how much they disappointed or hurt him**.

### A Farewell to Hillbilly Culture

JD now believed that more than anything else, **stable family structure and good values were what mattered for fostering success**. He saw that the “elites” abhorred by hillbilly culture were beating the hillbillies at their own game: they were happier, wealthier, had lower divorce rates, were better educated, and lived longer.

It wasn’t about material prosperity, or enacting big government programs to solve problems that were inherently spiritual and cultural. He saw that everyone in his family (including himself) who had become successful had done so by**escaping and marrying outside of the hillbilly culture**.

In looking at his own story, JD knew that he had made it out of Middletown and gone on to an Ivy League education only because he had the support and stability of his Mamaw and Papaw. But so many of the people he’d grown up around _didn’t_ have that kind of role model or support system.

In researching the current state of the American Dream, JD saw that upward mobility was still attainable in places like the northeastern United States and much of Western Europe—it was**in the South, the Rust Belt of the Midwest, and in Appalachia that poor kids were most likely to be trapped in a cycle of poverty.**

In citing Raj Chetty’s study on social mobility in America, Vance noted that working-class kids in these regions lived in income-segregated communities—that is, they grew up only among other poor people, without exposure to affluence. They also were disproportionately likely to live in single-parent homes.

JD, in looking at his own experiences, saw how public policy that was meant to help often exacerbated the social decay in these communities. Section 8 housing vouchers segregated lower-income families from the rest of the community; **Social services often cut extended family members out of the picture** for children whom they placed in foster homes, depriving them of key emotional support systems. Indeed, if social services has actually taken JD away from Bev, he would have been deprived of his Mamaw and Papaw—the two people who did more than anything to put him on the right path.

While Vance doesn’t entirely reject the ability of public policy to mitigate these circumstances around the margins, he sees the woes of this part of the country as stemming from poor cultural priorities.

  * A de-emphasis on education.
  * A culture of honor that celebrates and rewards destructive conflict resolution.
  * An evasion of personal responsibility, exemplified by the community’s embrace of conspiracy theories and a tendency to blame problems on outside forces.



In Vance’s final analysis, _all_ of this prevents the white working class from rising up and solving the problems in their communities and their families.
