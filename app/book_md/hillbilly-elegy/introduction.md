## Introduction

The rural, white working-class in America is one of the most-studied, yet least-understood subsets of the country’s population. In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, pundits, economists, and political commentators have struggled to make sense of why **the once staunchly Democratic “hillbillies” of Appalachia have turned so sharply toward the Republican Party.**

  * Is it as simple as a racial backlash to the presidency of Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president?
  * Is it a reaction to the elimination of manufacturing and industrial jobs across vast swathes of the Midwest and Upper South?
  * Or is it a rejection of changing social and cultural norms that have left this community feeling isolated, alone, and unrepresented?



Beyond just partisan politics, _Hillbilly Elegy_ sets out to examine why conditions have become so dire for this segment of the population. Through his narrative, JD Vance takes us through the history of how hillbilly culture and values spread beyond their heartland in Appalachia, why these norms and standards of conduct have become hindrances to upward mobility, and how the culture needs to change if it is to succeed in a rapidly changing nation and economy.

### Social Decay

_Hillbilly Elegy_ explores **the cultural pathologies of the white working class in America through the personal experiences of its author, JD Vance**. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and spending most of his childhood and teenage years in Middletown, Ohio, Vance saw firsthand the destructive attitudes and values of this culture—attitudes and values that he believes are primarily responsible for its perilous state. They include:

**An aversion to hard work and thrift** , as shown by the high levels of unemployment, indebtedness, drug addiction, and the widespread propensity of individuals in his community to lavishly spend beyond their means.

**A resentful, insular culture** that blames the rest of the world for its problems (or just denies their existence) instead of taking an introspective look at itself.

**A “culture of honor” that demands the resolution of disputes through violence or, at best, harsh verbal abuse**. These modes of conflict resolution may work in the hillbilly culture, but they leave these people utterly unprepared for a life outside it.

A destructive tendency to indulge in **conspiracy theories that discourage meaningful participation in 21st-century society**. These conspiracy theories can be both political and religious in nature. On the political side, for example, the widespread acceptance of “birtherism” (the belief that Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. or that he is a secret Muslim). On the religious side, Vance laments the strong hold that Young Earth creationism and disbelief in the theory of evolution have within this community.

**A gloomy pessimism and fatalism** that encourages people to abandon any hope that their conditions will ever improve. This attitude only encourages indifference and apathy, as well as poor work ethic: if things will never get better, there’s no point in working hard to try to improve your lot in life.

### An Autobiography of Crisis

As both a work of social commentary and an autobiography, _Hillbilly Elegy_ takes us through Vance’s formative years where he witnesses one social dysfunction after another:

  1. Endemic poverty and high levels of unemployment.
  2. Widespread drug and alcohol addiction, chronicled most personally and painfully through Vance’s mother’s battles with substance abuse.
  3. Low levels of educational attainment (Vance himself is one of the few members of his extended family to attend college).
  4. Child abuse and domestic violence.
  5. Verbal abuse.
  6. Marital strife (vividly demonstrated by the five husbands Vance’s mother cycles through).
  7. Welfare dependency.



Vance shares the story of his struggles growing up within this culture as a means of articulating **a broader social and cultural critique of the Appalachian white working class**. Through it all, however, Vance is undeniably proud of where he comes from and clearly loves his family very dearly.

He credits his maternal grandmother and grandfather (whom he calls Mamaw and Papaw) with saving him from the dysfunction of his nuclear family and instilling in him the attitudes and work ethic that empowered him to rise above.

**Mamaw refused to allow young Vance to succumb to the “woe-is-me” mentality** that haunted his community: she encouraged him to work hard, do well in school, and never lower his expectations of himself because of where he came from.

While Mamaw and Papaw were undoubtedly products of the hillbilly culture, they were also self-aware enough to recognize the drawbacks that it could have on a young person’s outlook. They, instead, exemplified **the _best_ of hillbilly culture: its pride in America, its patriotism, its grit and toughness, and its fierce sense of loyalty to family and community.**

Thanks to their guidance, JD was able to graduate high school with honors, enlist in the U.S. Marines, matriculate at Ohio State University, and graduate from Yale Law School. Yet Vance is clear that these accomplishments, while extraordinary in the context of the community he came from, are quite ordinary to millions of kids from other parts of the country.

His story shows that the American Dream is not dead, but that **the hillbilly culture from which he came is severely inhibiting the white working class** from taking advantage of the opportunities that still exist for hard-working, enterprising, risk-taking people.
