## Part Six: Higher Education

JD finally enrolled at Ohio State in 2007, following his discharge from the Marines. Whereas the idea of going to college had seemed daunting when he was graduating high school, now he was fear-free.

After discovering what he was truly capable of in the Marines, **JD felt empowered to take on any challenge. He was ready.** As the university was in Columbus, Ohio, this was also JD’s first time in an urban setting, and he was taken with the city’s array of cultural opportunities.

College was a happy time for JD. Where he had nearly flunked out of high school, he was now earning straight As in every class at Ohio State. He also realized that he wanted to go to law school after completing his undergraduate studies. His thinking about this still reflected his upbringing. He wasn’t drawn to it by any passion for the law: it was simply that the rich kids’ parents in Middletown had either been doctors or lawyers, and he knew he didn’t want to work with blood.

### Sharpening Political Views

During his undergraduate years, JD worked for a state legislator at the Ohio state capitol. The senator and JD shared the same brand of conservative politics and JD loved seeing how the political process worked from the inside.

JD recalls their shared opposition to a bill to curb payday lending practices. His boss was one of the few legislators to oppose the measure.

> **Shortform note:** Payday loans are high-interest loans that target people with low credit ratings. You’re advanced a sum of money at a high interest rate, which you’re meant to pay off with your next paycheck, hence the name. The research shows that most people who use payday loans are unable to settle up with the lender during their next pay cycle, so they end up needing to take out subsequent loans in order to stay afloat. For this reason, the practice is widely considered to be a form of predatory lending.

JD, however, had occasionally relied on payday loans to cover basic expenses, as had many people in his community. JD believed that without them, such people would have overdrawn their bank accounts and faced potentially worse financial consequences than the interest from the loans.

For him, the problem was that well-meaning politicians were pushing measures that would actually _harm_ the very people they were intended to help. In examining his political evolution, JD sees this as another experience that cemented **his commitment to free-market conservatism** and his rejection of welfare state liberalism.

### Deep Pessimism

In stark contrast to his own success and upward mobility, JD also started to examine some of the problematic political views of the folks back home in Middletown during this time.

**The community was a bastion of traditional patriotism** —Middletown sent lots of its kids to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, as they had in Vietnam, Korea, and both world wars. But for all their outward love of country, people at home were imbued with a deep pessimism about the United States and their future role within it. Indeed, **working-class whites have the lowest expectations of future economic success** , lower than blacks and Latinos—who are still objectively far worse-off than working-class whites.

Vance argues that the community felt increasingly alienated from mainstream American culture and had a pervading sense that the world had passed it by. Hillbillies had no cultural or political figures that they could look to as examples. He saw that lots of people in Middletown and similar communities started to retreat into lurid conspiracy theories to explain away their culture’s decline. These theories blamed nefarious outside forces for the struggles of the white working class—and, to JD’s dismay, **gave people an excuse to avoid taking personal responsibility** for their own lives.

#### Conspiracy Theories

Lots of the wild conspiracy theories focused around mistrust and fear of Barack Obama, the first African-American President of the United States.

“Birtherism” is quite popular among white conservatives like those among whom JD grew up. One poll shows that a majority of white conservatives either believed Obama was foreign-born or weren’t sure. JD recalls lots of conversations with relatives where they alleged that Obama had ties to radical Islamic terrorist groups.

He sees the proliferation of anti-government or anti-media conspiracy theories as deeply injurious to the community. Though hardly a liberal Democrat, JD believes that**blaming the government or Obama for all of life’s problems is wrong**. It leads to an incorrect view of the world, discourages meaningful engagement with it, and inhibits any attempts to alleviate the dire material circumstances of the white working class. It’s just a new version of the old hillbilly fatalism: **outside forces have stacked the deck against you, so why bother?**

In a telling example, JD recalls a friend who quit his job because he didn’t like waking up early. The next day, the man was on Facebook ranting about how he couldn’t find work because of the “Obama economy.” This is a clear demonstration of the problems of **blame-shifting and evasion of personal responsibility**.

### The Ivy League

In 2009, JD achieved what would have once been unthinkable. He graduated from Ohio State with a double major, summa cum laude. He knew that his next step was to go on to law school, and he decided that Yale was the best place for him to pursue his legal studies.

JD had reservations about attending an Ivy League law school. No one where he came from had ever set foot in that world, and he knew he’d be surrounded by wealthier people who had gone to elite private colleges. Nonetheless, he applied and was accepted into the Yale Law School class of 2013, receiving nearly a full scholarship to attend.

Ohio State had been a cultural shock for JD, but it was _nothing_ compared to Yale. Within his first week, he had the opportunity to see Tony Blair and George Pataki speak. Even more surprising, his classmates told him that major political and business leaders were _always_ speaking to some campus group or another. **JD had a level of elite access that he’d never dreamed of before.**

As he had in the Marines, JD was meeting new people who came from all over the world, with completely different backgrounds and experiences from his own. At first, this was intimidating. But he knew how to draw on the strength of his prior accomplishments and knew that **he had the work ethic and intellectual capacity to succeed at Yale**. He proudly held his own in classroom discussions and tests.

### Social Capital

But JD also saw that there was a whole other grading system at Yale, beyond the marks you received in class.**He also needed to earn high _social_ grades—making connections, networking, and learning how to move and operate** within the elite circles of an Ivy League law school.

As well as he might be doing in class, JD was initially confounded by the cocktail parties and networking sessions that seemed to define so much of the Yale experience. This, he was to learn, was **social capital: the networks of relationships that enable individuals to function and succeed**. Having social capital meant access to people, institutions, and opportunities. JD realized how sorely lacking he’d been in this vital asset for all his life.

Because he’d lacked these relationships and networks growing up, JD started his career at a major disadvantage. His classmates tended to be far more versed in the nuances of this elaborate dance: they knew how to schmooze at dinner parties, make connections with professors, and network with future employers. They already knew the rules of this part of the Ivy League experience, which made sense considering that 95 percent of them were upper-middle-class or wealthier.

Indeed, the wealth gap was stark. JD’s classmates talked about expecting to earn around $160,000 in just their _first_ year after graduation. No one in Middletown _ever_ came close to earning that kind of money.

JD was learning that **social mobility was about more than raw earning power**. He discovered that successful people followed a different set of norms and values than the white working-class hillbillies he grew up with.

#### Barriers to Mobility

These experiences showed JD just how different his upbringing had been from that of most of his classmates. He saw just how wide the gaps truly were between social classes and how **pressures from both above and below inhibited social mobility.**

From the top, elite institutions like Yale often deliberately excluded people with JD’s background from entering and accumulating the social capital they needed to succeed. As a case in point, one of JD’s professors firmly believed that Ivy League schools should refuse to admit students from non-elite state schools, regardless of the individual merit of the applicant.

But there were also pressures from the bottom. So much of**hillbilly culture was rooted in resentment at “elites,”** that being cut off from the world of Ivy League schools and white-collar jobs was worn as a badge of honor by many in JD’s community. At Yale, JD began to have guilt over having made it out of Middletown and felt that he was, in some way, a traitor to his culture and his class.

### Networking

Each summer, recruiters from high-powered law firms aggressively recruited from among the students at Yale Law. Making a good impression on the recruiters was crucial to JD’s next steps. But doing so would require a mastery of the dinner parties, cocktail hours, and interviews for which he’d been little prepared up to that point in his life.

At one such dinner, JD was initially baffled by the elaborate etiquette in which he was expected to be fluent. This even came down to small things like:

  * Not knowing that chardonnay was a white wine.
  * Not knowing what sparking water was.
  * Not knowing which utensils to use for which course.



These seem like small things, and JD was able to handle them thanks to help from some friends. But they highlight **the gap he faced due to his upbringing**. These were the working gears of a system that had been completely hidden and unavailable to people like him. He needed to know how to speak the language of elites, to convince them that he belonged.

In order to make it, he had to have connections: **a great CV simply wasn’t enough.** Successful people at Yale didn’t bombard prospective employers with resumes. **They relied on friends and family to help them establish _personal_ connections** with the people who held the keys to their future.

But in the end, JD learned how to play the game. Thanks to his advisor and his obvious intellect (he made the law review in his second year at Yale), he landed a position at a prestigious law firm.
