## Chapter 18: Hafid Meets His Successor

The book zips back to where the story began—Hafid is an old man who has liquidated all his fortunes, and he’s waiting to meet the successor to whom he will give the scrolls. One day a poor man in beggar’s clothes appears at Hafid’s door, saying that he is searching for “the greatest salesman in the world.” He is Saul of Tarsus, also known as Paul.

### Paul’s Story

Paul tells Hafid that several years ago, he was hired to round up the followers of a man named Jesus, a preacher who had been crucified by the Romans. Jesus’s followers were severely punished, even put to death. Paul routed out the crucified man’s disciples until one fateful day when he had a radical epiphany. His heart changed completely, and now instead of persecuting Jesus’s followers, he preaches the gospel of Jesus.

Of course, Paul has a huge credibility problem: Most people know of his past and do not trust him. No one will listen to his sales pitch as he tries to “sell” the words of God. Still, Paul plods onward with his preaching for four years. Finally, one day a voice from above tells him to “ask for guidance from the greatest salesman in the world,” and he comes to see Hafid.

### Hafid Learns About Jesus

Hafid is intrigued by the stranger’s story, and he asks Paul more about Jesus. Paul speaks with passion about the miracles Jesus performed, his crucifixion and resurrection. Finally, Paul presents Hafid with Jesus’s tattered, ancient robe. Hafid is amazed—he recognizes it as the robe he gave to the baby in the cave many years ago. He asks Paul to recount the story of Jesus’s birth, and Paul talks about the star that shone over Bethlehem, the same star that awed Hafid’s mentor Pathros.

The parable ends with Hafid rejoicing, knowing that he has found the long-awaited successor who will take ownership of the scrolls. And just like that, the Apostle Paul becomes the next-in-line “greatest salesman in the world.”
