## Chapter 10: Project Hollywood Strains Relationships

Many men in the community had allowed seduction to consume their lives. As a result, they had nothing else—family relationships, outside friendships, professional success—to cushion their self-esteem, so rejection from women rocked their whole world.

**A pickup artist (PUA) is only a PUA if he successfully picks up women, which means that his entire value within the community is based on how women respond to him.** Of course, basing your self-worth on another person is inherently risky because, no matter how good your technique, you can’t control how she’ll react.

**Many men in the community developed a hard shell of misogyny to protect their egos when women rejected them.**

Additionally, the act of sarging turned human interaction into a game, which inevitably objectified women:

  * PUAs referred to women as targets.
  * **PUAs constantly referred to women based on their attractiveness on a scale of one to 10.** For example, they’d call a hot babe (HB) who rated as an eight simply HB8.
  * PUAs sized women up to determine the best approach and tactics, just as a basketball point guard would size up a defender. 



Finally, PUAs almost surely slept with their share of women with boyfriends and husbands. Over time, seeing so many women cheat so often and easily degraded the men’s trust in and respect for the female sex.

**The same skills and knowledge that the men were using to pick up women were inhibiting them from developing and maintaining a healthy relationship with the women.**

### Mystery Tries to Recover From His Breakup

Three weeks after Mystery’s visit to the mental health center, he seemed to be getting better. Mystery resumed leading pickup seminars, but now he used his experience with Katya as part of his lesson—although it seemed to be more for his own catharsis than for his students’ benefit. **Mystery claimed that his fake-marriage to Katya was a brilliant pickup scheme, because it was the ultimate maneuver to make a woman attached to you.**

Mystery said that his fake-marriage with Katya went awry only because she’d known it was fake. Next time, he would create an entire fake wedding ceremony, with an actor for an officiant and everyone in the know except for the woman and her parents.

#### Mystery’s Love Triangle

As Mystery was recovering from his breakup with Katya and his mental health breakdown, he became entwined in a love triangle. More accurately, **Mystery _created_ the love triangle in order to feed his ego.**

First, there was Gabby. Just like Mystery, Gabby was narcissistic and talked incessantly. Surprisingly, she and Mystery hit it off—they each fed each other’s need to have someone around to listen to them talk. Soon, Gabby believed that she lived at Project Hollywood, though none of the other housemates were aware of or approved of this move.

Then, there was Twyla. Twyla was friends with a woman who Mystery dated years prior. When Mystery offered to help the woman with a bout of depression she was going through, she showed up at Project Hollywood with Twyla. Twyla and Mystery ended up getting together, and then Mystery hired Twyla to be his personal assistant.

**The love triangle caused constant drama that centered around Mystery’s affection.** He didn’t appear to genuinely care for Gabby or Twyla, but he thrived on the attention.

### Style and Lisa

One day, two of Courtney Love’s bandmates, Sam and Lisa, showed up at Project Hollywood, looking for Love. Love was not around, so Style sat and talked with them.

Style had met them once before, but this time he was struck by Lisa, Love’s guitarist. Lisa absolutely oozed confidence—so much so that she was impenetrable to Style’s seduction tactics.

Society teaches women to be submissive, which causes many women to make themselves seem less imposing and even less intelligent in an effort to appear more attractive to men. This was part of the reason negs worked in seduction, because it played up this power hierarchy between men and women.

But some women rejected that model—and Lisa was one of them. Lisa had inner confidence that didn’t rely on validation from anyone else. **Negs bounced right off of Lisa because she could dismiss them without a moment of doubt about who she was or how awesome she was; if the guy negging her didn’t see that, it was his problem.**

Soon, Style and Lisa began spending more time together. They had common interests and great chemistry, but even after spending multiple nights together, talking in bed, Lisa wouldn’t let Style kiss her.

Negging didn’t work. None of his routines worked. Freezing her out didn’t help. She was adamant.

Style began to doubt himself. He prided himself on his ability to kiss-close women within a half-hour of meeting them. **Style wondered if Lisa saw through his techniques to the man he’d been before he joined the community, the man who was insecure and afraid of women’s power to reject him.**

#### Style’s Seduction Tactics Push Lisa Away

When Lisa went out of town to play with the band, she asked Style if they could have dinner together when she was back in town. **Still relying on his seduction strategies, Style gave a cocky-funny response—but it backfired, and Lisa was turned off by Style’s obnoxious reply.**

Style managed to salvage dinner plans, and he eagerly prepared for the night Lisa was scheduled to return to LA. Style waited at the airport, but Lisa never showed up. He called, but she didn’t pick up the phone or return his messages.

Style found out later from Love that Lisa had come in on an earlier flight. He was still confused as to why Lisa had stood him up.

A couple days later, Lisa called Style to say she was back in town. She offered no explanation or apology. Style felt sure that things were over between the two of them—she clearly wasn’t interested.

Style was on his way to Miami with another PUA, so he spent his trip sarging and sleeping with women in an effort to get over Lisa. He used the massage routine to instigate another threesome, and, for a moment, he was on top of the world. But as soon as it was over, he felt empty. **Style realized that he had no real connection with any of the women he’d spent the last two years sleeping with.**

### More Problems at Project Hollywood

Style returned from Miami to more drama in Project Hollywood.

**Katya had been out of town for six weeks, during which Mystery had called her constantly, trying to get her back.** Meanwhile, Herbal was also calling Katya regularly, and Katya’s feelings for Herbal were growing stronger.

When Katya returned to LA, she went straight to Project Hollywood and told Mystery that she wanted to date Herbal. Mystery acquiesced and agreed to back off—but, as soon as he saw Katya and Herbal kiss, it made him crazy.

One night, Katya was out late helping Papa with a Real Social Dynamics workshop, so Papa suggested that Katya sleep in Herbal’s room, though Herbal was out of town. Hours later, Katya woke up to Mystery, who kicked down Herbal’s door and started throwing things. **Mystery screamed at Katya that she was merely a guest in the house, and the next time she was there without Herbal, he would attack Herbal.**

#### Style’s Housemate Leaves Project Hollywood

One day, while grabbing lunch at a nearby restaurant, Style ran into Extramask, who’d been a student with Style in Mystery’s workshop. Although Extramask lived at Project Hollywood, he was part of the Real Social Dynamics team, all of whom spent most of the time secluded in Papa’s room.

**Extramask revealed that Style’s post about social robots had struck a chord, and he’d decided to stop sarging and pursue spirituality.** He was planning to go to an ashram in India, where he would stay indefinitely.

Style was astounded: When they’d met, Extramask had been extremely naive. But Extramask’s pivot from seduction to spirituality reminded Style of his old friend’s Dustin’s conversion from being a womanizer to a celibate living in a yeshiva. Both Extramask and Dustin had been trying to fill a void with women and sex, and, when they realized they couldn’t, they tried to do it with God.

Style reflected on the optimism he’d had when they started Project Hollywood, that it would be a headquarters for self-improvement and life enrichment beyond sex and romance. That dream was now shattered by the harsh reality that **the house dynamics were breeding instability and dysfunction.**
