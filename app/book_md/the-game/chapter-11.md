## Chapter 11: Style Leaves Project Hollywood

The very concept of Project Hollywood—as a place for men who dedicated their lives to chasing women to coexist peacefully—had been flawed all along. It was overly optimistic to assume that they wouldn’t fight over women, their competing businesses (Mystery’s Mystery Method and Papa and Tyler Durden’s Real Social Dynamics), or their egos.

Seduction techniques taught men to be alpha males to attract women. Most of these men had spent their lives being pushed around by other alpha males, so when they started to embody alpha traits themselves, it could be intoxicating. **Many members of the community became so focused on flexing their alpha strength that they sabotaged their friendships in the process.**

The cracks had started to show almost immediately, and, by now, the residents of Project Hollywood were split by fault lines.

### Mystery’s Antics Come to a Head

Style, Papa, Xaneus, and Playboy called a house meeting with Mystery and Herbal to resolve their issues. It appeared that someone had to move out:

  * Herbal didn’t want to live there without Katya.
  * Mystery didn’t want to live there with Katya. 
  * Papa didn’t want to live there with Mystery, because he was fed up with Mystery’s drama and outbursts. 



The housemates appointed Style as a mediator. He came up with a compromise: **Katya wasn’t allowed in Project Hollywood for two months, during which Mystery had to get over Katya, pull himself together, and stop destroying property and threatening people.**

Mystery pushed back, saying that Style and the housemates were choosing Katya over him. At that, Style’s frustration with Mystery that had been mounting for months came to a head.

Style told Mystery that he was self-sabotaging by:

  * Wasting his potential as an illusionist by talking a big game but never following through with booking shows
  * Squandering his pickup business by not being more proactive and organized
  * Pushing away all the women he got close to 



**Mystery broke down, and he acknowledged that he’d made a mess of his life.** He said that he was broken, and that he didn’t know what to do.

#### A New Beginning for Mystery

Mystery posted on Mystery’s Lounge that he planned to move out of Project Hollywood the following month. His high hopes for Project Hollywood had fallen flat, because:

  * Having two competing businesses under the same roof created toxic competition in the house.
  * His housemates’ meddling in his private life with Katya was unacceptable.



Soon after, he followed up his post with an update: While on a trip to Chicago, **Mystery had met the woman he believed he wanted to marry.** She was coming to LA to visit him, during which time his mom and sister would also come visit in order to meet her.

Mystery's supposed future wife was named Ania. She was quiet and passive, which complemented Mystery’s manic narcissism.

#### Style Gets Insight on Mystery’s Mental Health

While Mystery’s mom and sister were in town to meet Ania, Style talked with them about Mystery’s mental health. Style spoke openly with them about Mystery’s troubling behavioral patterns—in particular, since his last bout of depression, he’d been resorting to violence and destruction, as he did when he kicked down the door to Herbal’s room.

Mystery’s sister, Martina, explained that each time Mystery had a bout of depression, it was worse than the last. Furthermore, she speculated that their father’s death had caused changes in Mystery.

First, **Mystery was looking for a new target and scapegoat for the anger and resentment he’d long harbored for his father.** Mystery had always blamed his depressions and emotional outbursts on his father and the dysfunction he’d caused. Recently, Katya had filled his father’s role.

Second, Mystery had begun to act more like his father. The two had been so similar that they constantly butted heads, and, when they did, his father would explode with rage and violence. Now, Mystery was beginning to emulate that violence. On top of that, he’d begun drinking, as his father had done excessively.

Style had been worried about Mystery’s emotional stability, and he asked Mystery’s mother and sister what they could do to help. **They determined that the best course was not to interfere in his life decisions** —even the wildly ill-advised—**and simply to be there to support him when things came crashing down.**

#### Mystery Moves to Las Vegas

When Mystery moved out of Project Hollywood, he decided he and Ania would move to Las Vegas. **Mystery reasoned that he could find work doing magic performances there, and he planned to start Project Vegas.**

Mystery asked Style to help him build Project Vegas—promising that they’d learn from the mistakes of Project Hollywood—but Style refused. Style was working on disentangling himself from the community, not embedding himself even deeper.

Mystery understood. **Despite Style’s concern and frustration over Mystery’s erratic behavior, the two agreed that the bond they’d formed transcended sarging and Project Hollywood drama.** They would remain friends even if Style left the community.

(Shortform note: Style wrote the foreword for Mystery’s book, _The Mystery Method: How to Get Beautiful Women Into Bed_ , which was published a couple years later.)

### Lisa Is Hot and Cold With Style

One day, as Style was leaving the mansion, Lisa came driving up. She and Sam—Courtney Love’s other bandmate—were on their way to a bar, and they were on their way to Project Hollywood to invite Style to join them.

Style went back to the house to change, and then hurried to the bar to meet them. He was eager to find out why Lisa had stood him up after her trip to Atlanta, but when he got to the bar, Lisa and Sam were sitting with two men.

The men were intimidating, not just because of their tattoos and rock-and-roll style, but also because they were exactly the type of men Style assumed Lisa would date. Style felt invisible next to the men.

**Disappointed that he couldn’t talk with Lisa, Style got up from the table and sarged to make himself feel better.** He wanted a jolt of positive feedback from a woman to ease his feeling of rejection.

However, as he approached one set (group of women) after another, he discovered that they all knew his routines already.**Project Hollywood had been pumping out so many PUAs-in-training that all the women who went to the clubs in that area had already heard all of the same lines and routines.** The same thing was happening in other seduction hubs—from New York to San Francisco to Montreal.

Now doubly discouraged, Style told Lisa and Sam that he was heading home.

#### Style Breaks Up With Isabel

When Style got back to Project Hollywood, Isabel—one of the many women he’d been casually dating, whose jealousy impeded Style’s first threesome attempt—was there waiting for him.

**There was nothing wrong with Isabel, but Style’s feelings for her paled in comparison to how he felt about Lisa.** Nonetheless, they had sex and she spent that night with Style.

The next morning, Isabel pressed Style about whether he was still dating other women. He confessed that not only had he started seeing Lisa, but that he had feelings for her.

Isabel gave Style an ultimatum: leave Lisa or lose Isabel. There was no question in Style’s mind—he chose Lisa.

### Style Gets Clarification From Lisa

For all the difficulty Style was having trying to break through Lisa’s tough exterior, he wondered why he kept coming back.

  * He thought that **_she_ might be using the same hard-to-get seduction tactics on _him_** , and that they were working as well for Lisa as they had for Style time and again. 
  * He considered whether he’d internalized the alpha-male principles to the point that **he was determined to sleep with Lisa because she posed such a challenge** , simply to prove that he could.
  * He wondered if she saw who he truly was, and if **there was a part of him that sensed that he could be fully himself with her**. 



Style wanted to take a leap with Lisa. He put his PUA moves to the side and asked Lisa out for a traditional dinner date. She hesitated, but agreed.

The date was harder than any pickup. Style had already tried all his routines on Lisa—and they didn’t work anyway—so he was on his own. No techniques. No scripts. Just Style.

Style mustered the courage to ask Lisa why she’d stood him up after her trip to Atlanta. **Lisa told Style that he’d been rude and aloof, and it had turned her off. Again, Style’s seduction strategies had backfired with Lisa.**

Style wanted more clarification on what had happened between them. He wanted to know if she was really running game on him, as he’d suspected.

The reality was that, although Lisa thought Style had acted rudely, she had missed him when he was in Miami. Lisa was hoping to catch up with Style when she invited him to the bar, but she was frustrated when Style had immediately clammed up around the two men and then promptly left.

Making matters worse, the following day, Lisa’s bandmate Sam had used Style’s bathroom and seen the condom he’d used with Isabel on their final night together. Sam told Lisa, and Lisa assumed things with Style were over.

When Style asked Lisa to dinner, she had hesitated because she was fed up with his mixed signals. The only reason that she ultimately agreed was because he was asking her on a real date—and because he seemed nervous, which she took as a sign that he genuinely liked her.

**Finally, Style and Lisa had stopped playing the game: Style wasn’t using lines, and they were both being up-front about their feelings for each other.** They shared their first kiss, and then they spent the next few hours talking and kissing.

After that night, Style broke things off with all the women he’d been seeing casually.

#### Style and Lisa Finally Get Together

When Style had sex with Lisa, he discovered a new kind of intimacy. For the past two years, he’d been using sex as a form of entertainment and a validation. But Style had such a deep connection with Lisa that it felt like the whole world stopped when they had sex.

One night, Style told Lisa everything about the community—the PUAs, the tactics, even the acronyms. **Lisa told Style that everything she liked about him was already part of him before joining the community; in fact, the game almost ruined their chances of getting together.**

Style knew that Lisa was right, but he also recognized that, before joining the community, he wouldn’t have had the confidence to pursue Lisa. **So much of the game was artificial** —the scripted routines, the peacocking outfits, even the aliases—**but mastering the game had helped Style develop the inner confidence to be himself.** Style could now graduate from the community.

### Real Social Dynamics Takes Over Project Hollywood

Project Hollywood was falling apart. Physically, the house needed a deep cleaning and some serious repairs—but the social fabric was in even worse shape.

Mystery and Herbal made up just in time for Mystery’s move-out. Then Herbal moved back to Austin with Katya. Style was alone in the house with Papa, Tyler Durden, and their Real Social Dynamics minions.

Papa and the rest of the Real Social Dynamics crew—including former students, junior PUAs, and the steady stream of newcomers that Papa kept moving in—completely ignored Style.

One day, Style asked Tyler Durden about everyone’s strange behavior. **Tyler said that everyone in the house hated Style, and that they blamed him for much of the drama in the house.** Tyler pointed to examples of people Style had been friends with who’d suddenly turned cold toward Style.

Style was blindsided. Although he’d become disillusioned with the community, he thought he’d remained friendly to everyone in the house.

#### Style Discovers the Real Social Dynamics Scheme

One of the last of the original Project Hollywood residents to move out was a PUA named Playboy, who’d moved in with Herbal and Xaneus.

Before Playboy left, he pulled Style aside to tell him that **Papa and Tyler Durden had schemed to push Mystery out of the house, and now they were trying to do the same to Style.** Ultimately, they wanted to turn Project Hollywood into a headquarters and dormitory for their workshop business, Real Social Dynamics.

Papa and Tyler had taken the social principles from seduction and twisted them to use in all areas of life. For example, they had routines to get their workshop students to give the business better reviews, and they had routines to make everyone in the house do what they wanted.

Papa and Tyler had instructed everyone who moved into the house to freeze Style out. **This explained why all the housemates had been ignoring Style, and why Tyler had told Style that everyone hated him—it was all a strategy.**

Style already knew it was time for him to get out of the toxic environment in Project Hollywood, and this was the icing on the cake.

### Style Exits the Community

Before Style left the community, he met with one last guru, named Eric Weber. While Ross Jeffries earned the title of godfather of the seduction community in the 1980s, Weber had laid the foundation for future PUAs with his 1970 book, _How to Pick Up Girls_.

Weber had since gotten married, had kids, and left the game. Style sought his advice on how to get out of the community.

Weber told Style that the primary tool to get out of the community was confidence. Weber warned that **men who don’t attain that inner confidence become obsessed with the game, in a futile attempt to fill their psychological holes.**

On the other hand, men who developed enough confidence and self-worth no longer needed validation from women—although, Weber admitted, even he still had moments of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy every now and then.

#### Style Leaves With Everything He’d Come With—Plus Confidence

During Style’s two years in the pickup world, he had:

  * Met with the top gurus
  * Learned every line, routine, and trick—and then developed his own
  * Enjoyed success with women—including the number and attractiveness of the women he picked up, dated, and had sex with—unlike anything he’d ever thought possible for himself
  * Developed confidence in his ability to navigate social interactions
  * Risen to celebrity status within the community
  * Entered into a relationship with a woman with whom he felt an unprecedented connection



**The game had helped Style recognize the assets that he already possessed, which built his inner confidence.**

Like Weber—and everyone—Style would probably have moments of self-doubt. However, he would always know that he had within him the traits and abilities that he previously believed were out of his reach.

(Shortform note: In the years after this book's publication, Neil was treated for sex addiction, among other mental and emotional conditions. While in rehab for this addiction, a doctor told him that his years in the seduction game had deeply ingrained his dysfunctional behaviors.

After receiving treatment, Neil got married in 2013 (not to Lisa) and had a son. In 2015, he published another book about his recovery from the seduction community, titled _The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships_. He no longer leads seminars on seduction techniques, but rather on how to be happier and more confident.)
