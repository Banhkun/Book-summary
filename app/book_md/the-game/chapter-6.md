## Chapter 6: A New Generation Emerges in the Pickup Community

While Style’s life balance was far off-kilter, all the time and energy he’d dedicated to the game hadn’t been in vain.

**Through Style’s constant sarging, his performances in Mystery’s workshops, and the field reports and tips he shared on the online message boards, he’d inadvertently become a guru.** While Mystery was recovering from his mental breakdown, his absence further cemented Style’s position as a top pickup artist.

**The community was expanding rapidly with young members** —some still in high school—**who wanted to emulate the master pickup artists**(PUAs).**** The new members wanted not only seduction technique, but also day-to-day advice, such as where to apply to college. Many of the young, new sargers that were constantly joining the community looked up to Style and studied his posts.

### Style’s Status as Top PUA

A year after joining the community, Style had become a true master of the game. He’d internalized the techniques, developed his own routines—which many members now used, word for word—and slept with countless women.

One post on the message board had even named Style the best PUA. The post lauded Style’s subtlety and powers of manipulation, calling him “sneaky” and “evil.”

**As Style felt the pressure of his new status, his motivation for pickups further shifted from impressing women to impressing the men in the community.** Style constantly felt the need to execute difficult sarges in front of the other men, in order to prove himself and justify the praise he received. Things that used to thrill him—like having a conversation with a woman—were now grossly inadequate.

The key to Style’s success was figuring out that **all the routines and pickup tactics were designed to make women feel comfortable enough to let their guards down** :

  * The opening line should feel casual and friendly. If your opener sounds like a pickup, it’ll come off as aggressive and scare the woman off. 
  * Right after your approach, a false time constraint eases the woman’s concern that you’re going to lurk around all night. 
  * The negs and push-pull approach makes the woman unsure whether or not you’re hitting on (or even interested in) her, so she becomes curious in your intentions instead of being deterred by an overt pickup.
  * **The routines** —including magic and ESP tricks—**make you appear fun and interesting, so that she doesn’t want you to leave.**
  * Creating an excuse to be alone together gives the woman the opportunity to be physical with you, without making it obvious to her friends that she _wants_ to.
  * Once she’s at your house, creating another false time constraint prevents her from feeling pressured and, if you end up having sex, she can tell herself it was spontaneous. 
  * **As the physical intimacy escalates, pulling back before she has a chance to object prevents her from feeling uncomfortable or pressured.**
  * If she does object, pull way back—so much so that _she_ ends up pushing _you_ to resume. Her objection is most likely an anti-slut defense (ASD), because she doesn’t want to seem too willing. Tell her that you respect her choice to say no, but that if you’re kissing her, you can’t stop yourself from wanting more, so you have to shut it all down. Between all or nothing, she’ll most likely choose all. 



**Although Style knew he was manipulating women with routines and techniques, he felt that, overall, his interactions with women were more honest now than they had been before he was a PUA.** Before learning the game, he’d lie or deceive women into thinking that he wanted commitment, just so that he could have sex.

But the game had taught him that women don’t necessarily want commitment—they just want to feel comfortable and they don’t want to be perceived as promiscuous. Now, Style was upfront with women about what he expected and what he offered.

### Mystery’s Return

When Mystery got out of the hospital, he was manic and buzzing with ideas.

**Mystery had determined that he became depressed only when he was alone, so he wanted to create a headquarters where people would always be around; he called it Project Hollywood.**

Mystery also wanted to book three months’ worth of workshops all over the world, but Style couldn’t commit to three months of winging Mystery’s workshops. Style had been neglecting the rest of his life for over a year, and he couldn’t stay off the grid any longer.

Mystery didn’t skip a beat. Mystery invited Papa and Tyler Durden, who were more than happy to wing the workshops.

#### Tyler Durden Hits the Community by Storm

Tyler Durden was a 22-year-old college student who dove head-first into the seduction community, reading thousands of pages of archived posts on the message boards and relentlessly emailing Style for tips.

Growing up, Tyler had been physically and intellectually behind his peers, and his father had measured him against standards that Tyler couldn’t achieve. Out of that constant feeling of inadequacy grew someone who spoke and acted strategically in an effort to make everyone think he was powerful. Over time, **Tyler had come to think that all human interactions could be both calculated and manipulated** —which primed him for the rules and tactics of the pickup game—**to the extent that he lacked human empathy.**

Tyler proposed that new members of the community get over their shyness by physically running into women or hitting them with something soft, in a way that was meant to be playful. His approach to seduction was abrasive, shameless, and totally different from traditional methods that required more studying and memorizing techniques.

However, for all Tyler’s bravado, he seemed to be more focused on sarging (hitting on women) than closing. One day, he posted a field report about how he’d leaned over the counter and kissed the cashier at a juice bar—but when she invited him into the back room, he froze.

Nonetheless, **Tyler’s brazenness and constant presence on the seduction message boards helped him become well-known within the community** , and soon he became Papa’s wing.

#### Tyler Durden and Papa Go Rogue

As green as Tyler Durden was, the seduction message boards were full of impressive reviews of Tyler’s work in Mystery’s workshops. In fact, students were so enthusiastic about the workshops that there was a demand for more.

After teaching his workshops in England and Amsterdam, Mystery flew home and left Tyler Durden and Papa behind to run a few more workshops to meet the demand. **Papa and Tyler were supposed to simply continue teaching the Mystery Method, but, one night, they went off-script and invented AMOGing.**

AMOGs—the alpha males of the group—are obstacles to PUAs. While most PUAs were nerds and outcasts in high school, most AMOGs were popular jocks. When a PUA tried picking up a girl in a group, the AMOG usually cut him down with insults. Tyler and Papa created the tactic they called AMOGing in order to deflate AMOGs who stood in their way.

#### AMOGing: Step by Step

Tyler Durden described the steps of AMOGing in an online post:

  1. When the AMOG first tries to intercept your target, double-down on his interception by jokingly asking the AMOG to please get the woman away from you. This is designed to make the woman object to leaving you, which is one strike against the AMOG.
  2. When the AMOG insults you, facetiously say that you’re trying to impress him and insert an insult you can glean from looking at him. For example, you can say that you’re trying hard to impress him and the rest of the polo-wearing guys. It may not be something inherently negative, but pointing it out like this will make him self-conscious. 
  3. When the AMOG insults you again, joke that he’s trying to become your friend. For example, tell the AMOG that he’s funny, but he doesn’t have to try so hard to be funny to make you like him. 
  4. When the AMOG looks like he wants to fight, call it out and sarcastically suggest facing off in an arm-wrestling or one-armed push-up competition. This is meant to **mock the AMOG for trying too hard and flexing his physical power.**
  5. When the AMOG touches you aggressively, tell him you’re not gay. He’ll begin insisting that he’s not gay. 
  6. When the AMOG tries to physically intimidate you, don’t say or do anything.**If he keeps trying to engage you, and you still don’t respond, it makes him look like he’s trying to get your attention, and that you’re above it.** At this point, you can make an eye signal to the woman for you both ditch the AMOG, and she’ll go with you. 



Tyler went on to write that it’s key to smile confidently when confronting an AMOG, because a confident smile is emblematic of AMOGs. **Essentially, you want to out-AMOG the AMOG.**

### Tyler Durden and Papa Create Their Own Company

Tyler Durden and Papa didn’t stop at inventing the AMOG strategy—they built a company around it. Their company was called Real Social Dynamics, and it offered a website and in-field workshops.

For Mystery, this was adding insult to injury: **Not only did Tyler and Papa use his workshops as a platform to develop and promote AMOGing, but the name of their competing business was one word off from the name of Mystery’s seminars, Social Dynamics.**

In addition, the format of Real Social Dynamics workshops mirrored Mystery’s setup:

  * They were three nights
  * They started and ended at the same times
  * They cost the same



The primary difference between the two workshops—besides the techniques—was that Mystery only allowed six students per workshop, while Tyler and Papa had dozens. The pair was making money hand over fist.

Tyler and Papa’s company set off a spark of entrepreneurship in the community. Other sargers and PUAs realized that they could just as easily start their own seduction business, because:

  1. If these two young rookies could run workshops, anyone could.
  2. There was an insatiable demand for pickup strategies.



**Throughout the community, men were offering workshops, creating websites, marketing products, selling DVDs, and writing e-books about seduction.** Many of the entrepreneurs were far from experts: Several of the men were fairly new to the community, and one had lost his virginity just a month before offering workshops.

### Neil Publishes His Article About the Seduction Community

Style saw how the community was changing and growing, and he realized that he had to publish his article about the world of seduction before another writer caught wind of it and scooped him. He worked with his editors at _The New York Times_ , who could hardly believe that the details about the seduction community were real.

No one in the community knew Neil, the writer—they only knew Style, the PUA. Hardly anyone even knew what Neil did for work. Neil worried that the article would destroy Style, and that he’d lose the friendships he’d formed as Style.

However, when the article ran, there was no backlash. **Style had become such an integral part of the seduction community that his peers saw him as Style first, and Neil second.** No one in the community saw Style as a traitor—rather, they gave him kudos for being featured in the _Times_.

**Neil found himself wanting to remain active in the community; not only had he learned how to pick up women, but he’d found friends and a sense of community that he’d never known before.**

Ultimately, the article benefited both Style and Neil:

  * Style now understood how solid his position was in the community. Plus, it created more intrigue among community members, many of whom posted about Neil’s career and bought his books. 
  * Neil got an assignment to do a cover story on Tom Cruise for _Rolling Stone_ , because Tom Cruise had specifically requested Neil after reading his _Times_ article.
