## Chapter 9: Project Hollywood Gets Two Female Housemates

Amidst growing problems in Project Hollywood, two new roommates moved in—both of them female.

One was Courtney Love. Love still had Style’s phone number from when he’d interviewed her for _Rolling Stone_ and had subsequently spent the following three days in her apartment. Love texted Style one night, telling him that she was overwhelmed with bills and the task of keeping her life in order without a manager. She asked Style if she could stay at Project Hollywood for a little while.

Love made herself right at home in the house. **Love was a messy house guest** —she left open jars of peanut butter and jelly scattered around the kitchen, with sticky smears streaking the counters—**but she quickly endeared herself to everyone in Project Hollywood.**

The other new roommate would also become well-liked among many of the housemates, but she would also lead to the breakup of the original Project Hollywood housemates. Her name was Katya.

### Mystery and Katya

Mystery met Katya—a chipper Russian woman in her early 20s—during a workshop. A couple days later, Mystery invited her to come by the mansion to hang out. Within a couple weeks, Katya and her dog had moved into Project Hollywood and she had ingratiated herself with everyone in the house.

Three weeks after they met, Katya and Mystery bought rings and told everyone they had eloped. **Mystery and Katya weren’t legally married—it was just a hoax—but their relationship shifted nonetheless.** Mystery stopped going out to clubs, and he began staying in bed all day. For all his expertise in picking women up, he knew little about how to have a healthy relationship.

Katya still wanted to go out, and she grew frustrated that her fake-husband had suddenly become so idle. **Katya started getting drunk regularly, and the two began resenting each other.** Soon, Katya was coming onto the other Project Hollywood housemates, including Style—but when Style told Mystery about it, Mystery seemed unaffected.

#### Mystery and Katya Break Up

The tension and resentment between Mystery and Katya were reaching a peak.

**As Mystery and Katya’s cold war continued—Mystery freezing her out, and Katya hitting on the other housemates—Katya and Herbal began developing feelings for each other.**

Style advised Herbal to talk to Mystery about it; Mystery had given Herbal permission to pursue his ex once before, and Mystery didn’t appear to care about his relationship with Katya anymore. After Mystery had another fight with Katya that evening, he gave Herbal his blessing to act on his feelings for Katya.

Just hours later, Katya and Herbal were together, and Mystery immediately regretted what he’d said. The feelings of rejection called up the emotional neglect he’d suffered as a child, and he broke down, insisting that he loved Katya.

The next day, Mystery was still a wreck. The last time Style saw him depressed—before Mystery’s mom and sister checked him into a psychiatric ward—Mystery had been catatonic. This time was different: **Rather than being void of emotions, Mystery was overcome by them, to the point of convulsing.**

Style determined that he should get Katya and Herbal out of Mystery’s sight:

  1. Style asked Herbal to refrain from seeing Katya until Mystery was more stable, and Herbal agreed. 
  2. **Style asked Katya to move out of Project Hollywood for a while, and to stop having sex with Herbal.** Katya agreed. 



Still, Mystery began talking about suicide, which prompted Style to take him to a mental health center, where Mystery got prescriptions for Xanax and a sleep aid.
