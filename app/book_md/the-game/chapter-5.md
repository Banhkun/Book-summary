## Chapter 5: Style Gets Too Deep in the Game

By the time Mystery’s Miami workshop approached, **Style was far beyond merely observing the community for his writing assignment—he was a full-fledged member and well-respected pickup artist (PUA).**

Style’s relationships with the other men now existed in the real world, not just on message boards. He had forged friendships with some of the men, and they went out sarging together regularly. Other men in the community constantly called and emailed, looking for advice and asking to be Style’s wing.

At the same time, the community was growing. Local seduction communities were popping up and flourishing around the world.

Style was enjoying his new powers—especially after so many years of feeling completely inadequate around women. But **Style’s motivation for picking up women was no longer for sex or romance as much as it was to impress the other sargers and PUAs.**

### Style Polishes His Pickup Game

Despite—or possibly because of—Style’s success in Belgrade and his status in the community, he felt tremendous pressure to prove himself at the next workshop in Miami. As it turned out, his months of preparation, meetings with gurus, and hypnosis training paid off.

Mystery, Style, and the workshop students were at a Miami club when two gorgeous, confident women walked in. They were 10s, as PUAs would say—in fact, one of the women was an 11.

Style was after the 11:

  1. Style knew that he’d have to practically ignore the women, because almost every man in the club was gawking at them. PUAs never do what everyone else is doing. 
  2. When Style approached the women, he had to do so indirectly. He struck up a conversation with a transvestite next to them, and then he accused one of the women of copying the transvestite’s outfit. **Style had to neg the women hard to make himself stand out from all the men drooling over them.** It worked. 
  3. Style had to shift from vaguely offending the women to initiating a conversation that they’d want to continue. His priority now was to let them know that he wasn’t intimidated by their looks. Style told them that he lived in LA, which is full of beautiful women, and that a woman’s outlook and personality counted far more than her beauty. Again, it worked. 
  4. **Style stood with his back to the woman he was interested in** —the 11—**to make her wonder why he wasn’t paying her more attention, but he turned to engage her just often enough to keep her from losing interest.**
  5. Style told the 11 two cold-reading truisms—fairly obvious observations that seem uncannily perceptive, bordering on psychic—that appeared to seal the seduction. Ironically, as the 11 showed more interest in Style, the 10 began giving him more kino (physical contact).
  6. Once Style knew he had the women hooked, he strategically pushed-and-pulled. For example, when one woman hugged him, he playfully pushed her away, which only increased her attraction. 
  7. Style had to isolate the 11. He managed to sit down with her in a booth, where he showed her an ESP trick and they soul-gazed. Finally, they kissed. 



**Style was victorious—not only because he’d kiss-closed an 11, but because he’d perfectly executed a difficult pickup.** He was hooked on the game.

#### Turning Seduction Into a Competition

**The better Style got at the game, the more his love and respect for women dwindled.** Learning to _seduce_ women didn’t teach Style how to _connect_ with them.

Seduction became a competition—literally. One night, Grimble invited Style to meet a former madam and recent inmate named Heidi Fleiss, who he’d been talking to about the pickup game.

When Style arrived, Fleiss challenged him to a pickup competition. They approached women together to see whether Style had a better chance of seducing them or Fleiss of recruiting them as escorts (though it was just for competition, since she was retired).

The two more-or-less tied—though Fleiss was convinced she’d won—but **Style’s biggest takeaway was how similar seduction and exploitation could be.**

### Dustin Visits Style

One day, Style got an unexpected visit from his college friend, Dustin. **Dustin had been the first man Style knew who was comfortable, confident, and successful at picking up women.** Dustin was truly a natural.

Style had been thinking of Dustin constantly since he joined the community. After having been such a misfit with women for most of his life, Style was excited to finally connect with Dustin over techniques, watch Dustin’s approaches, and incorporate Dustin’s strategies into his own game.

As Style began to tell Dustin about the game and the seduction community, Dustin stopped him. Dustin had left that life behind. Now, he was living at a yeshiva in Jerusalem and abiding by a vow of celibacy.

Dustin explained that he’d gotten tired of just having sex with women and he’d begun to crave an emotional connection. **Eventually, Dustin recognized that he’d been basing his self-worth in his success with women.** That’s when he turned to a life of God.

Far from wanting to compare pickup techniques, Dustin had come to ask Style’s forgiveness for glamorizing a corrupt lifestyle. Dustin felt his example had influenced Style to get into the game, and he felt guilty for contributing to Style’s corruption.

However, Style didn’t see Dustin’s lifestyle or the seduction game in general as corrupt. **Style countered that the game hadn’t just helped him pick up women, but it also had made him a better person.** In his effort to become more attractive to women, Style had:

  * Begun exercising
  * Improved his diet
  * Become more confident
  * Tapped into his emotions
  * Learned how to interact with people in all contexts



Dustin didn’t disagree, but he wasn’t convinced. He simply said he’d always be there if Style needed him.

Not long after, Style got a postcard from Dustin, dubbing him with the Hebrew name Tuvia. The postcard explained that the name meant that **Style was driven to seek out good things in life, but sometimes got caught in bad things in the process**.

### Training the Next Generation of PUAs

Style wasn’t the only one who’d undergone a transformation—just about every student who took a workshop with Mystery started dressing better and carrying himself with more confidence.

**The seduction game was based on the premise that everything standing between you and picking up a woman was within your control.** Mystery and Style felt that they could help men reach their full potential.

The workshops made such a profound impact because Style and Mystery were brutally honest. Being successful with women had nothing to do with good looks or innate ability—men simply had to correct bad habits and learn new ones, from their posture to their clothes.

Typically, their workshop students fell into one of three categories:

  1. Regular guys with average social skills who simply wanted to improve their ability to pick up women
  2. Men who studied the information and techniques, but who were so uptight that they seldom implemented any of it 
  3. Men who were socially awkward but who were fast learners. **These men improved quickly, but they failed to internalize the principles and the confidence behind the lines, and thus they struggled if they had to go off-script.**



Papa—a college student who paid Mystery $1,500 for a private workshop, instead of the standard $600 fee for a group lesson—was the third type. When he first met Style and Mystery, he asked to record their conversation so that he could study the information later.

Papa was an excellent student, immediately correcting every error and applying the lesson to his next pickup. Style was impressed at Papa’s progress throughout the three-day workshop, and he reflected on the transformational effect that just a handful of scripted lines could have.

However, Mystery and Style didn’t realize that there were some drawbacks to teaching the same lines and routines to student after student:

  1. The **scripted routines substituted genuine connection** , which made every pickup and every woman less meaningful. 
  2. **Mystery and Style were inadvertently creating clones of themselves** , instead of coaching men to be their best selves and helping them develop an inner confidence.



Later, Style would discover the full consequences of training an army of pickup clones—and Papa would be a leader of the clones.

### Style and Caroline

On the last night of Papa’s workshop, Style sarged a woman named Caroline, while Mystery sarged her friend, Carly. The four left the club for a diner, in what Mystery and Style called an instant date.

An instant date—taking a woman on a date immediately after picking her up—was now the goal when they sarged, because changing locations made the woman feel like they’d known each other longer than a few hours. The time distortion accelerated their rapport and familiarity with a woman, which increased the chance of getting her into bed sooner.

From the diner, Carly invited everyone to her nearby apartment (another location change), where Style and Caroline fooled around a bit but stopped short of having sex. **Style realized that he was more interested in Caroline than he had been in any other woman since he’d joined the seduction community** —despite the fact that she was just 19 and she was a single mom with a baby, and Style was in his early 30s.

#### Style and Caroline Start a Relationship

When Style and Mystery first started talking to Carly and Caroline at the club, Mystery had pulled out his video camera and started recording their conversation, which hadn’t appeared to bother the women. The next day, Style and Mystery watched the video and analyzed it, the way that athletes analyze game footage, noting what they’d done well and where they could improve.

When Style saw Caroline again that night, they had sex—but immediately after, Caroline began crying. She worried that they shouldn’t have moved so quickly, and that Style wouldn’t be interested anymore. Style reassured Caroline that he wanted to see her again.

Within a couple days, the pair went out to dinner with Mystery, and then Caroline brought Style back to her house, where she lived with her son, mother, sister, and brother. **Style considered Caroline his girlfriend, and he began spending more time with her and her son.**

#### Style and Caroline’s Relationship Fizzles

After being together at Caroline’s for several days straight, both Caroline and Style started getting weary of the relationship. Style was becoming stir crazy from spending so much time in the house, and he could tell he was pulling Caroline’s attention away from her son.

Style had felt a genuine connection with Caroline, but now it was waning. **It was well-known in the seduction community that love could come and go quickly, and sargers and PUAs accepted that fact as an occupational hazard.**

Style thought of something he’d read about love: Contrary to most people’s beliefs, love doesn’t need to last forever—sometimes love lasts just a few minutes, days, or weeks. He felt his and Caroline’s brief love had reached its end.

### Mystery’s Downturn

Meanwhile, Mystery was struggling.

Despite his pickup career, he’d had a longtime girlfriend, named Patricia. Initially, Patricia had accepted Mystery’s lifestyle, but now she was ready to settle down. She told Mystery that if they didn’t start moving toward marriage and kids, their relationship was over—so they broke up.

**Mystery referred to love as “pairbonding,” which he viewed as an evolutionary mechanism that was meant solely to motivate people to survive and procreate. Still, he was reeling** from his breakup. Mystery was now falling victim to his own cat string theory: He’d taken Patricia for granted until they broke up, and, once she was inaccessible, he could think of nothing else.

The breakup was keeping Mystery up at night. One night, he took several Tylenol pills with codeine. However, they weren’t strong enough to knock him out, and he spent the whole night posting on Mystery’s Lounge.

On his codeine high, Mystery gushed about how much he loved the seduction community and the friends he’d made there. Mystery wrote about how he wanted the community to be a place where the men could share more than just seduction tips—he wanted them to help each other achieve their life goals.

Mystery put out a request for help in achieving his goal of becoming a professional magician (which he talked about constantly). He wanted to convince a broadcast network to give him a one-hour magic special, which he planned to parlay into an ongoing show in Las Vegas.

In his codeine ramblings, Mystery wrote that doing daily performances would feed his need for constant attention. This acknowledgment offered some insight into why **Mystery loved the pickup game—because he fed off the attention from women.**

#### Mystery Reaches a Breaking Point

A couple days later, Mystery emailed Style about an argument he had with his sister. His sister had punched him, and Mystery reacted by taking her by the throat and flipping her onto the floor.

In a followup email, Mystery confessed that he was going crazy, having trouble sleeping, and physically aching. **Mystery said that he was close to suicidal.**

Not long after, Mystery posted a message online titled “Mystery’s Last Post.” In the post, he thanked the seduction community for everything it had done for him, and he said that he wouldn’t be posting anymore.

#### Style’s Intervention

Style couldn’t let Mystery—his friend and mentor—drift off into the abyss without trying to save him. **Style turned to the community to find help.**

He sought advice from one of Mystery’s former students, named Doc, who was a psychologist. Doc gave Style a list of questions to ask Mystery, which Style asked the next time he visited Mystery:

  * Do you spend a lot of time thinking about death? (Yes.)
  * Do you consider doing harm to yourself? (Yes.)
  * Do you think about killing yourself? (Yes.)
  * How? (Drowning.)
  * Why haven’t you? (Logistics.)



After going through the questions, Style called Mystery’s father—but his father hung up as soon as Style mentioned Mystery’s name (his real name, Erik). Then, Style tried calling Patricia.

Despite their breakup, Patricia was concerned about Mystery when Style told her about his behavior. **Patricia told Style that Mystery had attempted suicide in the past** , and she suggested that Style call Mystery’s mother and sister.

Just then, Mystery walked toward the front door, telling Style that he was doing to kill his father and then himself. He’d taken more sleeping pills.

Style managed to coax Mystery back into the house and call Mystery’s mother, who arrived with his sister within half an hour. **Mystery’s mother and sister took him to a hospital and checked him into the psychiatric ward.**

### The Community’s Downturn

Mystery wasn’t the only one in the community floundering. **Many of the men had become addicted to picking up women, constantly determined to improve their game.**

Their obsession was more potent because most of the men had struggled to pick up women all their lives, which was what drew them to the seduction community in the first place. Not only were they enjoying unprecedented success, but they had a built-in community they could brag to. **Some men had left their jobs and quit school in order to spend more time sarging.**

Papa—the college student who’d done a one-on-one workshop with Mystery and Style—told Style that he’d become consumed in the game. He was failing school and his father was worried about him.

Style was no exception: He’d all but stopped taking writing assignments, and he was neglecting his family and friends outside of the community.

Style, Papa, and several other members of the community decided to take a step back from seduction and regain control of their lives—but it wouldn’t last long.
