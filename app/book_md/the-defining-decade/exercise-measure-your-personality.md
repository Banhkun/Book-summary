## Exercise: Measure Your Personality

Relationships are far more likely to be successful if the two people involved genuinely like each other and are fairly similar in personality. The “Big Five” personality model outlines five major personality traits that a person can have. A person has each of these characteristics in either low, medium, or high levels. They are: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

* * *

Write down where on the scale of each trait you lie. Are you low, high, or in the middle for each of these characteristics?

Examine your current relationship or think of a previous one. Is or was your partner close to you on any of these? Where did you differ and to what degree?

How did any personality differences cause conflict between you?

Did any of your other characteristics, maybe ones for which you were both similar, help you get through that conflict? If not, how did you resolve it? Or not?
