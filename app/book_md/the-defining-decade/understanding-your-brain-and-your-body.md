## Understanding Your Brain and Your Body

As should now be clear, your twenties are a unique decade during which you’ll have opportunities you won’t encounter again. Many of these are available simply because the world is very open to you during this time. But timing is not the only reason your twenties are so full of potential. In your twenties, your brain and body are developing in remarkable ways specifically designed by evolution to prepare you for the rest of your adulthood.

Understanding both the opportunities and limits of your brain and your body during this decade can help you better anticipate and plan for the future. Here are some of the steps involved in this process:

  * Learn new skills while you can: Take advantage of its remarkable potential to learn. At the same time, watch out for your brain’s wiring shortcomings.
  * Take control of your primitive brain and its emotional reactions to setbacks.
  * Cultivate real confidence through mastery of skills: Gain experience and face challenges to find confidence.
  * Cultivate a positive personality by being active. 
  * Be aware of your body’s childbearing limits: Don’t put off raising a family.
  * Keep track of the time: Plan your years smartly. 



### Learn New Skills While You Can

In your twenties, your brain goes through a period of massive neuron production, one of two major growth spurts in your life. The first growth spurt is during your toddlerhood, and prepares you for all you are about to learn in childhood. The second starts in adolescence and continues through your twenties, preparing you for adulthood.

Because of this,**your twenty-something brain is incredibly plastic and open to learning, and the experiences you have in your twenties will shape how you approach the rest of your life:**

  * Your job teaches you how to plan for the decades ahead and how to negotiate the complex social world of adult life. 
  * Your relationships prepare you for the intricacies of a long-term partnership.
  * Your setbacks and disappointments train you how to handle the challenges you’ll inevitably face in work, love, and parenthood. 



Many twenty-somethings find this learning process difficult because very often, **the skills they now need are completely different from the ones they’ve practiced and honed during school.** They find their old skill sets are no longer enough to ensure success in life. School problems had right-or-wrong answers and defined time limits. Adult problems are not as clear-cut. There’s no one right answer for who to partner with, what career to pursue, or when to start a family. There will be pros and cons to each of these decisions, and navigating them requires you to juggle complexity in a way you didn’t need to when you had the more solid road map of schoolwork.

Fortunately, your brain is remarkably adept at mastering these skills during this period of your life. However, despite its strengths at this time, your brain has a shortcoming: Some parts are developing faster than others. **This uneven progression is part of the reason many twenty-somethings have difficulty planning for the future.**

The frontal lobe—the part of the brain that was last to evolve and is responsible for reason, judgment, and long-term planning—only fully matures as we approach age thirty. Therefore, in your twenties, your more primitive, emotion-driven brain is fully operational while your more temperate, forward-thinking brain is not yet fully functional.

In fact, twenty-somethings often share characteristics of people who’ve had trauma-induced frontal lobe damage: These people become reckless rather than thoughtful and often make decisions that work against their long-term interests. They have trouble planning for the future or seeing the specific steps needed to achieve a goal.

Luckily, we are not bound to the whims of our primitive brain while our frontal lobe takes its sweet time maturing. In fact, practicing adult skills helps your frontal lobe develop properly.

### Take Control of Your Primitive Brain

Twenty-somethings often have a difficult time regulating their emotional responses to interactions at work and in their personal lives. This is partly because the emotional-regulation parts of the brain are still developing, and until they’re fully established, young adults are still very much at the mercy of their primitive brains’ instincts.

Our brains are built to detect novelties because they might be either threats or opportunities. We remember surprising moments strongly because they help us learn to survive. For example, people will remember with clarity their first date with their eventual partner, or the time they sent a snide email to the wrong person.

In your twenties, your brain also reacts much more strongly and emotionally to surprises, especially when they are negative, than it will when you are older. MRI scans reveal that the brains of twenty-somethings are far more active in the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain, than those of older adults when presented with negative stimuli.

The effects of this can be both good and bad. While emotional distress can teach you valuable lessons that you can apply to future situations, if distress is constant, it can lead to depression, anxiety, and a general sense of being out of control. **Twenty-somethings often react to this emotional distress by trying to escape the cause of it, leading them to leave a difficult job or a relationship that isn’t perfect.**

This is not a good long-term strategy. The difficult parts of a job are typically inherent in entry level positions. Leaving a job before you’ve moved beyond the difficult parts might mean you end up in a series of entry-level positions, each one filled with difficult parts. Additionally, while you should definitely leave any relationship that has serious problems, there are times when your emotional reaction might be inappropriately scaled to the actual issue, and you risk leaving a relationship with potential.

A better strategy is to train your frontal lobe to take control of your amygdala. You may not have much control over the events of your day, but you can have control over how you react to them.

Reevaluate events by focusing on the facts of them, instead of the emotions:

  * Examine your fears closely. The consequences you are afraid of are unlikely to be as severe as your emotions are telling you they are. You are unlikely to be fired for small mistakes, and even if you are, you are unlikely to end up in a dead-end job for the rest of your life as a result. 
  * Focusing on the facts of a situation rather than your emotional response to it can lessen, or even prevent, negative feelings from developing. 



Reach out to friends or loved ones for help if you need it, but don’t rely on them for their assistance in getting through difficult times. Asking someone for emotional support on a regular basis means you are borrowing her frontal lobe instead of developing your own.

### Cultivate Real Confidence Through Mastery of Skills

Real confidence doesn’t come from ignoring your anxiety or listening to friends and family tell you you’re wonderful. **Real confidence comes from mastering skills, overcoming challenges, failing sometimes, and accumulating successes.** You can’t bypass this process by hiding out in an easy job. Mastering easy skills will give you a fragile confidence that’s readily shattered at the first sign of stress. Genuine confidence comes from overcoming genuine challenges.

To become someone who regularly masters skills:

  * Cultivate a “growth mindset.”
  * Devote 10,000 hours to learning your skill.
  * Recognize the successes you’ve already had.



#### Cultivate a Growth Mindset

To truly be open to the opportunities you’ll find in your twenties, adopt a “growth” mindset, rather than a “fixed” mindset, to better equip yourself to get the most out of your challenges.

**People with _growth_ mindsets believe that their own skills and talents are in a constant state of change, and can be improved with practice and knowledge.** This attitude makes them view failures as opportunities to learn and grow. They approach challenges by working harder or trying new strategies, and are more likely to come out of a challenging situation with confidence and enthusiasm.

People with _fixed_ mindsets see their own skills and talents as all-or-nothing propositions: they either have it or they don’t. They’re smart or they’re stupid. This attitude leads them to avoid struggle, as struggle is a sign that they don’t have “it,” whatever “it” is in that particular situation. People with fixed mindsets give up more quickly when challenged with difficult tasks and see challenges and failures with distress and shame.

People with growth mindsets react better to challenges and setbacks than do people with “fixed” mindsets and are better able to acquire new skills. They generally outperform people with fixed mindsets and have rosier outlooks on life and work.

(Shortform note: To learn how to develop a growth mindset, read our summary of Grit.)

#### Devote 10,000 Hours to Learning Your Skill

Research shows that the best predictor of a person’s success is not innate talent but instead, the amount of time she invests in the endeavor. **Consistently, across all kinds of industries from medicine to music, mastery of a skill comes after about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. At 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, this means five years.**

Often, twenty-somethings are unprepared for this truth, expecting to start a job and immediately be not only good at it but also openly appreciated for it. This disconnect between expectations and reality leads to anxiety and causes many twenty-somethings to abandon their pursuits too soon because they are discouraged by their lack of mastery.

(Shortform note: For further exploration of skills development, read our summary of Peak.)

#### Recognize the Successes You’ve Already Had

Don’t discount the work you’ve already put into a pursuit. Take stock of how long you’ve been working at something and calculate how much longer it will take before you can start feeling mastery of it. Being aware of the process will help you not get discouraged by it because of unrealistic expectations.

### Cultivate a Positive Personality

In our twenties, our personalities can change more significantly than at any other time in our lives before or after. Although we often think of childhood or adolescence as the time when personalities are formed, **it’s the decade of the twenties when we really start to become the people we’ll remain for the rest of our lives.**

During their twenties, it’s not unusual for people to change from shy to confident or depressed to happy. Studies show that very often, life starts to feel better as you move through your twenties. As you grow into adulthood, you’ll get better at regulating your emotions, become more socially competent and responsible, and start to feel more agreeable about life in general. Because these changes happen when long-term careers and relationships are forming, they can greatly affect the trajectory of your life, and because your personality is so plastic during these years, you have an excellent opportunity to adopt a permanent, positive outlook on life.

Sometimes a person will try to find positivity by getting lost in her past—examining her upbringing as a child of divorce or her difficulties in high school, for example. This person might hope that by coming to terms with her past, she can adopt a happier outlook on life that will propel her into adulthood. While you definitely should examine the influences that made you who you are, dwelling on them isn’t going to ultimately move you forward, and a positive outlook, rather than being a _prerequisite_ for adulthood, is often a _product_ of it.

**The best way to break the patterns of the past and cultivate a happy outlook is not through reflection but through action.** By actively investing in your adulthood—pursuing opportunities, gaining experience, and achieving small successes along the way—you will craft a satisfying future.

Just the process of making goals can make you happier. When a person is purposefully working toward goals, she’s happier even if she doesn’t immediately succeed at the goals. The process itself gives her a sense of purpose. Twenty-somethings who feel even a small amount of personal or financial success feel more positive and confident than those who don’t. In contrast, twenty-somethings who don’t feel they are making progress toward a goal often feel stressed and alienated.

### Be Aware of Your Body’s Childbearing Limits

As people marry later, more couples are having their first child in their thirties and even forties. People often justify their decision to put off childbearing by pointing to celebrities or friends who have started families late. But anecdotal stories of success are not representative of the true difficulty that couples face when they try to start families late.

**Putting off starting a family greatly increases the chances of running into fertility issues.** Having sex around the time of ovulation has about a 20 to 25 percent success rate of conception up until around age 35. Then the rate starts to drop, until it’s only five percent at age 40 and two percent at age 42.

If you need fertility treatments, they are expensive, and get more so as you age. Because older couples need more treatments on average per successful birth, a twenty-something couple may pay $25,000 for a baby but a couple in their mid-forties can expect to pay around $300,000—if they can find someone to treat them at all. Many fertility clinics will not treat women over 40 as the low rate of success brings down the rates the clinic can advertise.

Aging issues affect both men and women. Researchers find that older sperm is associated with neurocognitive problems in children like autism and schizophrenia.

**Further, even when successful, having kids late can be difficult in other ways.** The pressure to have kids when your time is running out can be an enormous stress on a marriage, particularly a new one. Then, if you want multiple children and you have back-to-back pregnancies to squeeze them in, you’ll end up with multiple very-young children, yet another stress.

Additionally, you may find yourself caught up in raising young kids just when your career starts hitting its stride. And, you might end up caring for your children just when you need to start caring for your own parents.

Finally, as you get older, your priorities are going to change. When you’re forty or fifty, you may very well wish to trade the years you spent on trivial activities in your twenties for more years with your kids, or eventually, with their kids. You also may wish that your kids could know your parents better as grandparents. If your parents had you in their late thirties and you have kids in your late thirties, your parents could very well be in their mid-seventies when your children are born. Their relationship as grandparents will inevitably be limited.

In sum, don’t fall into the trap that so many do, swayed by cultural myths of late-life fertility. If you think having children may one day be important to you, start to plan for it in your twenties, when you are still in control of the process.

### Keep Track of the Time

The way time passes changes once we leave school. In school, time is clearly delineated into semester-sized pieces with well-defined projects and deadlines. In the real world, there’s just one big chunk of time with large, abstract projects like “start a family” or “have a career,” but no clear deadlines. It can be disorienting, and the lack of regular deadlines can lead people to live day-by-day and lose track of time. Day-by-day can easily turn into year-by-year.

“Present bias” also encourages twenty-somethings to put off planning for the future. People are inclined to favor the rewards of today over the promises of tomorrow. The present feels real, the future feels abstract.

Further, twenty-somethings are often actively encouraged to think only of the present with cultural messages like “You’re only young once,” or “You have all the time in the world.”

But delaying your future-planning carries great risks. The attitude that “life begins at thirty” might lead you to postpone getting started on major milestones, and **might then lead to a very stressful thirties decade in which you need to do everything at once:** go to school while planning a marriage, or graduate and enter the workforce while pregnant.

#### Make a Timeline

Get started on your future-planning by making an actual, physical timeline.

  * Draw it out, or create it on your computer. 
  * **Begin with the end.** Think of a goal you want and decide where you want that to happen on your timeline. Do you want to have your first child by 35? Is it important to you that you’re not working at a coffee shop at age 30?
  * Work backwards from there. If you want to start a family in your early thirties, what does that mean for your plans to go to law school? Will you be comfortable doing both at the same time? When you write things down on paper, they become more real to you, and you’ll be able to better judge how these events might overlap and how much time you’ll need to allow for each. You’ll then be more in control of purposefully spacing them out.
