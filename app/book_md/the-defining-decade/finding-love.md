## Finding Love

Planning for a career has a different status in our culture than does planning for a marriage. Having a specific and measurable career plan is socially acceptable and admired by many. To help you plan a career, you have a wide variety of resources available to you, including books, classes, counselors, and consultants.

Having a specific and measurable marriage plan is not as socially acceptable. It is often mocked. And there are far fewer resources available to help you; universities don't offer classes on it and unless you go “downmarket” to talk shows where marriage is more commonly discussed, there’s not a lot of public discussion about it.

**And yet, choosing a marriage partner arguably has a far more lasting effect on your long-term happiness.** You can revise your career many times over the course of your life, but your life partner is far less modifiable. You can’t just leave a marriage like you can leave a bad job; after divorce, you may be permanently linked to your ex both financially and logistically through children or other ties.

Furthermore, though they may not openly admit it, and while it’s not often acknowledged in pop culture, young adults do generally want to get married. In the United States, about half of young adults marry by age 30, 75 percent by age 35, and by age forty, 85 percent are married.

While it might not be politically correct to be strategic about finding a relationship, as it violates the ideal of having a relationship find you, unexpectedly and uncontrollably, the truth is being strategic is very important. Give it serious thought now, in your twenties, so you don’t find yourself settling later. There are some guidelines that can help you approach the subject mindfully and purposefully:

  * Don’t date down: Don’t date people you outgrew several years ago.
  * Seek a similar personality: People with similar attitudes are generally happier. 
  * Don’t cohabitate, or do it wisely: Move in together only under certain circumstances.
  * Pick a partner with your family in mind: When choosing a mate, remember you’re also creating a family.
  * Don’t delay marriage to prevent divorce: It’s not the deterrent you might think. 



### Don’t Date Down

**Dating down means dating a person you would have dated in a previous period of your life, when you were less mature and less developed.** When you date people you’ve outgrown in maturity, experience, and insight, you prevent yourself from finding a person you have a more meaningful connection with.

Often, a person dates down when she holds negative beliefs about herself leftover from childhood influences. Her identity stories reflect difficulties from her past. For example, someone who was neglected as a child might have a low opinion of her own worth. She might consequently date people with lower career ambitions with whom she doesn’t share a stimulating intellectual connection, because of a mistaken belief that she’s lucky to have anyone at all.

We start to form our identity stories in adolescence. These stories are born of our experiences and take shape according to how we think other people see us. When they are negative stories, they can stop us from carrying through on our long-term goals. However, when our identity stories are positive, they can inspire and guide us.

Fortunately, you can change the stories you tell yourself about yourself. When you feel yourself making a mistake you know you’ll later regret, pause. Take notice of what is driving that decision. Listen carefully to your identity stories and recognize which parts of them come from other people’s judgments, evaluations, and advice. Examine those elements and decide which ones you can disregard. Then find a new story to take its place.

When you stop acting reactively to unconscious beliefs, you can slow down and allow yourself room to closely examine how those beliefs are influencing your decisions. For example, someone who was raised by emotionally abusive parents and bullied as a teen might find herself, in her twenties, having serial one-night stands. Until she stops and confronts the identity stories that are driving her, she’s unlikely to take control of her romantic life. But once she interrupts her habits of reaction and consciously acknowledges the childhood voices in her head, she can start to see that she no longer has to give those voices power. She can think about what she truly wants out of a relationship and start acting more purposefully towards that goal.

In your twenties, your childhood experiences no longer have to define you. Confront your past and then look forward to your future: Look at who you are now and what you’ve accomplished, and focus on where those traits can lead you.

### Seek a Similar Personality

Relationships are far more likely to be successful if the two people involved genuinely like each other and are fairly similar in personality. The first element, liking a person, is very often caused by the second, being alike. It is often said that opposites attract, and to some degree and in some situations, that is true. But similarities are a stronger predictor of marital success. The trick is knowing which similarities to worry about.

Many couples are similar to each other in things they could list on paper: religion, education, attractiveness, age, politics, and socio-economic background. But while traits like this can help you weed out partners who would be unsuitable for easy-to-spot reasons (for example, maybe it’s important to you to raise your children Jewish; a prospective partner from a different religion might be a non-starter), they don’t guarantee happiness. There are plenty of divorces among couples who share many of these kinds of similarities.

It is far more important to be well matched in personality. Research shows the more similar two people’s personalities are, the happier they are likely to be with their relationship. **Personality is the overall way you interact with and react to the world: your outlook.** It’s not about the experiences you’ve had but how you’ve handled them. It’s not about what you like but why you like it.

The “Big Five” personality model outlines five major personality traits that a person can have. A person has each of these characteristics in either low, medium, or high levels. They are:

  1. **Openness:** Are you practical, conventional, skeptical, and reluctant to try new things? (low) Or are you open to new experiences, intellectually creative and curious, adventurous, and insightful? (high)
  2. **Conscientiousness:** Are you easygoing, sometimes careless, spontaneous, and prone to addiction? (low) Or are you disciplined, organized, and responsible? (high)
  3. **Extraversion:** Are you shy, independent, cautious, and recharged by alone time? (low) Or are you outgoing, active, chatty, and energized by others? (high)
  4. **Agreeableness:** Are you combative, suspicious of others, and contrarian? (low) Or are you cooperative, trusting, flexible, and affectionate? (high)
  5. **Neuroticism:** Are you secure in yourself and emotionally resilient? (low) Or are you moody, anxiety-prone, and easily triggered? (high)



There’s no “right” or “wrong” personality on any of these scales, but **we are often more compatible with people who lie somewhat near us.** A tendency to see the world in similar ways not only prevents conflict from developing between you but also enables you to face the challenges that life will throw at you as a team.

More often than not, the reason a couple ends up separating is because of personality differences that on reflection were there all along. If one person is gregarious and loves being around people, but her partner is reserved and hates parties, they might be regularly annoyed by the other’s choices: The outgoing one may be irritated that her partner wants to stay in and rent a movie rather than checking out that new bar, and the reserved one may think the outgoing one has her priorities wrong. Though they may match in other areas—they may both be very agreeable, for example—if they are different enough that their interests and hobbies don’t generally overlap, there’s a high likelihood they won’t last.

This doesn’t mean you should look for someone with an identical personality to yours, or that you should automatically reject a person because she differs significantly on one or more of these scales. While you don’t want to choose a person with a vastly different outlook on life, **there are advantages to partnering with someone who’s a bit different from you.** Differences can be helpful when your marriage progresses to the point where it includes other people, such as children. A diversity of interests and skills can be helpful and keep life interesting.

Further, there will always be at least some personality differences. How you handle them and whether or not you can reconcile them amicably are stronger predictors of long-term marital happiness than whether or not you both match perfectly on each of the Big Five traits.

### Don’t Cohabitate, or Do It Wisely

Many young adults think that living with a partner before marriage will allow them to “try out” a marriage before committing and will result in a stronger union. Unfortunately, the statistics don’t back this up: **Couples who live together are more likely to divorce down the road than those who do not.** This is called the “cohabitation effect” and it has baffled researchers for years.

Some researchers theorize that those who cohabitate may be less conventional and open to divorce in the first place, but the cohabitation effect appears to be true regardless of religion, education, or political leanings. The effect seems to be more a result of the fact that when people cohabitate, they often end up passively and reactively sliding toward a marriage, rather than proactively deciding on one. When this happens, a couple often ends up staying together because of sunk costs and ultimately separates because they never truly understood a marital relationship or they were never right for each other in the first place.

#### People Stay Because of Sunk Costs

When two people decide to move in together, it’s often touted as an easy solution to short-term challenges like rent. Moving in together seems fun and cost-effective, and feels like an easily-escapable arrangement, unlike marriage. And it might be, at first. But after combining lives for a while, leaving the situation can actually feel quite difficult, and **a couple may feel it’s easier to stay in a relationship because of the sunk costs of the arrangement.**

When you make an initial investment in a relationship, the “switching costs” feel hypothetical and far away. But after some time passes, the costs feel bigger and more real. You may have shared pets, passwords, and finances that are harder to walk away from. This is known as “consumer lock-in,” and it describes the fact that people are less likely to look for other options once they’ve made an investment in a first option.

You also may be older, and the idea of starting over can feel more daunting at 32 than it felt at 27. Instead of cutting your losses, you may opt for marriage because it feels like it makes sense given the investments you’ve already made in the relationship. In a word, you feel stuck.

#### People Don’t Fully Understand Marriage

People often move in together under the pretense that they are giving marriage a trial run, but in truth, a live-in relationship has little resemblance to a marriage. Stresses like mortgages, pregnancies, child-rearing, holidays with in-laws, college and retirement plans, and bills often don’t exist during cohabitation but can destroy a marriage. Once a relationship transforms from _live-in_ to _married_ , these stresses can break it.

#### A Couple May Be Poorly Matched From the Start

Often people slide from dating to sleeping over to moving in without fully examining the relationship. The process is driven by short-term impulses—fun weekends, cool friends, good sex, shared rent—that may not have been what either one would have looked for in a long-term partner.

Because cohabitation feels more easily escapable than marriage, both men and women agree that they have lower standards for a live-in partner than for a spouse. Interestingly, the cohabitation effect does not hold for couples who move in together after becoming engaged. These couples are as likely to stay together as are couples who don’t cohabitate before marriage. The effect seems to be entirely caused by people moving in with right-now partners who end up becoming, unintentionally, more permanent partners, for the wrong reasons.

This is not to say you should absolutely not cohabitate before marriage, but if you are considering doing so, don’t make the decision lightly:

  * Lean towards not doing it.
  * Get clear about the other person’s long-term goals and commitment level before you move in. 
  * Keep an eye on the costs of leaving. Regularly check in on the constraints keeping you in the relationship and make sure they don’t get so burdensome that you would be unable to walk away. 



### Pick Your Partner With Your Family in Mind

When choosing a life partner, it is easy to forget that the decision involves more than just the two of you. Western culture prizes independence and often glosses over the fact that in picking a spouse, you are creating a future family. This family will include not only your future children but also your new in-laws and extended family.

When you don’t fully consider the impact this new family will have on your future happiness, you risk setting yourself up for difficulties. **The family you create and adopt with your partner will define your life in the decades ahead.**

Of course, you shouldn’t settle down with a partner just because you love her parents and siblings. Your relationship with your partner always has to come first. However, you should give your situation serious thought if you are considering settling down with someone from a family you don’t feel comfortable in. Marrying into a family you don’t fit into might make your life miserable in the future and may also reflect values in your partner you’ve overlooked. Maybe you meet your partner’s family and discover they’re unaffectionate and distant. You may find this explains some of your partner’s behavior, and you might decide this is not how you envision your own future family.

This is, again, not to say that you should reject someone based only on her family. But her family must factor into the decision.

If you yourself come from a difficult family background, this decision is even more important, and because you don’t have stable family experiences to draw from, it’s often more difficult. If you are one of these people, you now have an opportunity to create a family environment for yourself that you may once have thought was unobtainable. Examine consciously and thoroughly the kind of family life you envision for yourself in ten and twenty years. Being explicit with yourself about your goals will prevent you from choosing a partner reactively and allowing yourself to fall into the family patterns you would like to evade.

### Don’t Delay Marriage to Prevent Divorce

Young adults today are putting off marriage not only because of the societal expectation to but also because of a fear of failure. Divorce looms large in the minds of today’s twenty-somethings. About half of all young adults are children of divorce, and the other half knows someone who is. Everyone acknowledges how difficult divorce can be and how negatively it can affect the lives of any children involved, and everyone wants—rightly so—to avoid that fate.

People have concluded that delaying marriage is a good way to lessen the risk of eventual divorce. They believe waiting until they are more mature and settled in their careers will prevent them from marrying someone they’ll later grow apart from. However, delayed marriage is not the protective element that people imagine it to be. Although marriages between very young partners (especially teens) have high rates of divorce, after age 25 the divorce rate stabilizes at around 40 percent.

Additionally,**putting off marriage creates other difficulties and risks:**

  * As the pool of available singles decreases, the quality of those available may also decrease. 
  * While older spouses may be more mature, they also may be more set in their ways and have a more cynical view of love, making it more difficult to establish a healthy and lasting marriage in the first place. 
  * Delaying marriage exposes you to the risk that at age thirty, you’ll feel the pressure reverse immediately. At thirty, marriage turns from something we’ll get around to someday to something we wish was happening _right now_. At that point, people start looking for any partner, rather than the right partner.
