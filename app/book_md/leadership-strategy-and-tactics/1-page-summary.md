## 1-Page Summary

_Leadership Strategy and Tactics_ by Jocko Willink argues that the key to being a good leader is putting others before yourself. By being humble, building good relationships, and taking responsibility for your team’s mistakes, Willink claims you can help your team become more successful and reach common goals.

After serving for 20 years as a US Navy SEAL, Willink developed a unique leadership philosophy that he shares through his leadership consulting program, Echelon Front, in books like _Extreme Ownership_ (2015) and _The Dichotomy of Leadership_ (2018), and through his podcast. In _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_(2020), Willink combines the leadership principles discussed in his previous books into a field manual, where he provides specific situational advice about how to lead well in your daily life.

In this guide, we’ll discuss why leadership is important, and how **humility, relationships, responsibility, and balance** all contribute to good leadership.

In the book, Willink presents over 30 pieces of leadership guidance. Many of his principles overlap, so we’ve organized his rules and advice into the four major themes outlined above. We’ll address these themes one at a time, covering each rule and its relevant advice. Along the way, we’ll compare Willink’s ideas to other leadership books, such as _Principles: Life and Work_ and _The Obstacle Is the Way_. We’ll also examine what psychologists and other leadership experts have to say to support and challenge Willink’s advice, adding nuances and tips to help you implement his ideas in your daily life.

### The Importance of Leadership

First, we’ll discuss Willink’s idea of leadership to establish what this term means throughout this guide and why it’s worth considering. We’ll start by distinguishing it from manipulation, then we’ll explain why leadership is essential for success.

#### What Is Leadership?

According to Willink, **leadership is the ability to get people to support each other to achieve a common goal**. He explains that leadership fundamentally involves getting people to do what you want them to do—when what you want them to do serves the common interest. Although this sounds similar to manipulation, Willink claims that these two strategies have different purposes. If you’re manipulating people, you’re simply controlling others to serve your own benefit. Manipulation might secure temporary success, but your team will eventually recognize your self-interested motivation and stop following you.

In contrast, Willink claims **true** **leadership is motivated by the good of the people you’re leading and a goal you all share**. If you lead to benefit your team and achieve a common mission, your team will recognize this and follow you.

> **Is Manipulation Ever Ethical?**
> 
> Although Willink asserts that manipulation is separate from leadership, one expert claims that multiple philosophies would accept manipulation as an ethical leadership strategy. This implies that manipulation and leadership can coexist.
> 
> Similar to Willink’s belief, **Kantian** philosophy would view manipulation as an ethical leadership strategy as long as you aren’t using someone merely as a means for your personal gain but instead are manipulating them in a way that respects their own interests. This is because Kantian philosophy views something as ethical if it treats someone as an “end in themselves” rather than “a means to an end.”
> 
> And according to **utilitarian** philosophy, manipulating your team would be ethical as long as it helps more people than it harms. This is because Utilitarian philosophy prioritizes results over process and the greater good over individual happiness.

#### Why Leadership Matters

By learning how to lead well, everyone on your team benefits and you’ll achieve collective goals more quickly. Willink says the purpose of this book is not to advance _your_ career but, instead, to help your team achieve success. **By acting in service of others through leadership, Willink says you’ll not only succeed as a leader, but as a person**.

(Shortform note: Willink doesn't explain why helping others will lead to your success as a person or what it means to be a successful person, but perhaps he means that helping others through leadership will give your life meaning. Research shows that helping others leads to a deeper sense of meaning because it strengthens our relationships. Helping others affirms your own sense of value because it makes you feel autonomous, competent, and connected to others.)

### Good Leaders Are Humble

Now that we’ve covered what leadership means to Willink, we’ll discuss the principles and practices that good leaders embody—the first of which is humility. To Willink, humility means recognizing that you’re not more important than anyone on your team. He argues that you can’t be a good leader if you aren’t humble, because **without humility, your team won’t follow you**. We’ll first discuss how humility inspires your team to follow you by earning their respect. Then, we’ll explain why humility is essential to make informed decisions and grow as a leader.

#### Practice Humility to Earn Respect From Your Team

When you’re in a leadership position, don’t ever consider yourself _above_ your team. Doing this could cause your team to resent you and, as a result, they won’t follow you with much enthusiasm. Instead, work _alongside_ your team with humility. If you demonstrate humility, Willink says you’ll influence your team to cooperate with you to achieve a common goal. This is because acting humbly will earn you respect, and when people respect you, they follow you.

(Shortform note: Willink proposes that you can earn your team’s respect by displaying humility. A slight nuance, research suggests that showing humility influences your team to trust you, but only if they suspect your motivations are honest and well-intended. For example, if your team suspects you’re acting humbly solely because you want them to think highly of you, the plan could backfire.)

Here are **three ways you can practice humility** and earn your team’s respect:

**1) Don’t use condescending language.** Just because you might be in charge of other people, it doesn’t mean you’re better than them. Rather, Willink says you should view your team as equally valuable individuals who deserve respect. So, you should speak to your team in a way that reflects this perspective. For example, if someone at work compliments you for leading a project successfully, avoid saying something that denotes a higher status, such as, “That’s why they pay _me_ the big bucks.” Instead, consider saying something that places you on equal ground with your colleagues, like, “That project was successful because of our whole team’s contributions!”

(Shortform note: Condescension isn’t limited to the words you use. Experts say you can also convey condescension in the style of your delivery and your body language. Be mindful not to speak excessively slowly when you’re explaining something to someone. This might be perceived as “dumbing down” whatever you’re explaining. As for body language, avoid yawning, sighing, or tapping your fingers when you’re listening to someone else speak. These behaviors convey that you don’t think what the other person has to say is valuable.)

**2) Get your hands dirty.** Because you’re equal to the people on your team, no task is below you. For example, if you’re in charge of an office, don’t consider yourself above necessary maintenance chores like taking out trash, replacing printer ink, or cleaning bathrooms. Willink says doing daily tasks with your team will also give you an opportunity to connect with and learn about them (we’ll further discuss how to build relationships with your team in a later section).

(Shortform note: Many successful leaders say that you should never assign someone a task that you’re unwilling to do yourself. This is a good measure of your humility and also whether or not the task itself is demeaning or inappropriate.)

**3) Respond to conflict by giving a compliment.** When you feel challenged by someone, it’s tempting to defend your pride by talking yourself up and diminishing the other person. Instead, Willink says to give the other person praise. For example, let’s say a coworker brags that they always arrive at the office earlier than you do. Instead of pointing out that you work later than them every day, or that you work harder than they do, tell them that you’re grateful they arrive so early to get the office up and running for everyone else. This act will demonstrate confidence. The person challenging you will respect this confidence and be more willing to follow you.

(Shortform note: To deliver an effective compliment, make sure it is sincere. If people think you don’t mean what you say, a compliment can backfire by weakening the trust in your relationship. Make your compliments more sincere by noting something specific. It’s easier to do this if you regularly pay close attention to the good things your team does. This not only leads to more meaningful compliments, but it also forces you to look at your daily work in a more positive way.)

#### Practice Humility to Make Better Leadership Decisions

Practicing humility as a leader not only earns your team’s respect, but it enables you to better listen to your team. **If you’re too prideful to accept criticism from others or to budge from your own ideas, you’ll waste time arguing with your team and you’ll miss out on ideas** that are better suited to handle a situation. Additionally, if you resist advice from people with valuable experience and insight, you won’t be as informed as you _could_ be, and the quality of your decisions will suffer. Instead, humility opens you up to helpful information so that you can make better leadership decisions. In this section, we’ll explore **three ways to accept criticism with humility**.

**First, accept criticism from anyone**. It can be hard to accept criticism from people you don’t like or that you don’t think are qualified to give you advice. However, Willink says it’s worth doing because applying what you learn from criticism can make you a better leader. To keep from taking criticism too personally, Willink recommends you objectively focus on the big picture. In this case, the “big picture” to keep in mind is improving as a leader.

(Shortform note: To take criticism well, consider these expert tips: Prepare general responses to criticism in advance. It can be difficult to respond to criticism in the moment, so having some prepared phrases can keep you from freezing up as you gather your thoughts. Another thing to consider is that the criticism you receive may not be aimed at _you_ , but instead, your role. Realizing this can prevent you from taking criticism too personally and becoming emotional. If you take some of the heat off of yourself, it will be easier to stay calm and think clearly.)

**Second, don’t commit to your ideas**. If your idea conflicts with another person’s, **instead of trying to prove that you’re right, try to objectively assess which idea is actually better**. If your idea is significantly better, this should be apparent to the other person with more discussion. If your ideas are very similar, go with the other person’s idea. By doing this, you’ll give them ownership, which will encourage follow-through, and you’ll also build trust with them. This will strengthen your relationship and, in turn, strengthen your team.

(Shortform note: To more easily let go of your own ideas and execute someone else’s, one expert says it helpful to realize that you don’t need to agree with their idea, you only have to commit to the actions required to carry out their plan. This is also true when certain people on your team don’t agree with _your_ plan. Don’t waste energy explaining why they should conform to your idea or why they’re wrong for believing what they believe. Respect their opinion and ask them to help you carry out your plan anyway. By not pushing too hard to bring someone on board with your way of thinking, you’ll save time and avoid insulting anyone for their ideas.)

**Third, learn from leadership examples in your daily life**. If you think you don’t need to put any effort into improving because you’re already a great leader, Willink says your leadership skills will stop developing while the problems you face continue to evolve. Instead, be humble and continue to grow as a leader by studying. To do this, actively **look for leadership examples in what you read or during your daily activities, and learn from what you experience**. For instance, if you’re shopping for clothes, pay attention to how the store’s manager interacts with other employees and how the employees react to their leadership. Ask yourself whether the manager’s approach seems to be effective and consider why it is or isn't.

(Shortform note: As you look for examples of leadership to learn from in your daily life, consider the areas of leadership where you’re lacking and keep them top of mind. This will help you notice and learn from leaders that demonstrate strength in those areas. Additionally, ask leaders you respect how _they_ approach the areas you’re not confident about.)

### Good Leaders Build Relationships With Their Team

Once you’ve earned your team’s respect by practicing humility, you can build strong relationships. According to Willink, **your team is held together by relationships, and relationships are built on trust**. Without relationships, you simply won’t have a team to lead. To build good relationships with people, Willink says you have to extend trust to your team by empowering them to lead, by communicating regularly, and by always telling the truth.

(Shortform note: How do good relationships improve your team? Research shows that good relationships improve your team by increasing everyone’s creativity, collaboration, and productivity. Additionally, people who feel they have good relationships with work colleagues feel more satisfied with their jobs, are less likely to experience burnout, and are more likely to stay with their team long-term.)

#### Empower Your Team to Lead

**Let your team know _what_ needs to be done and _why_ it matters to your shared mission, then give them freedom to decide _how_ to do it**.**** Willink claims that by trusting your team with opportunities to lead, you’ll inspire them to reciprocate and trust you. For example, let’s say you give your team the responsibility of organizing a client event. Tell your team that you want to make your guests feel welcome and proud to be working with your company (this is _what_ needs to be done). Then, explain _why_ this is important: These clients are major partners with your organization and provide significant funds to grow the company. From there, let your team come up with the plan, or the _how_.

In addition to building trust, empowering your team to lead has other benefits:

  * This strategy will increase your team’s commitment to the mission because they’ll have a sense of responsibility for the plan. This is because people tend to think their own plans are best.**If your own plan has a problem, you’re more inclined to solve it** , whereas if there’s a problem with someone else’s plan, you’re likely to blame them instead of looking for solutions.
  * By letting your team take on responsibilities, they develop leadership skills. By contrast, if you solve all of their problems, you’ll stunt their growth.
  * By designating duties to other people, you free yourself up to handle bigger-picture problems and support the team on a greater scale. 



Here are a few things to keep in mind as you designate leadership roles to other people:

  * If the plan your team comes up with is good enough to get the job done, go with it.
  * If the plan your team comes up with is less than sufficient, respectfully suggest improvements or ask questions about the plan until your team realizes its shortcomings.
  * In urgent and consequential cases, or when your team is indecisive about something, you may have to make a more immediate decision. According to Willink, if you normally allow your team the freedom to shape plans as they see fit, they’ll respect and follow you in the rare moments when you make executive decisions.



> **Empower Your Children to Make Decisions**
> 
> Willink’s advice on extending responsibility to your team may be just as applicable to leading your children as it is to leading the adults on your team. As with your team, encouraging your children to make decisions helps them develop critical thinking skills, form trusting relationships, determine their values, and build resilience.
> 
> It can be tempting to make decisions for your children, especially when they’re indecisive or you think they lack the experience or knowledge to make the right choice. However, they’ll only become better decision makers through practice. You can help a child of any age make decisions by teaching them the following:
> 
>   * **Making a wrong decision isn’t the end of the world**. Mistakes happen and can be fixed together, so it’s okay if you don’t choose the best option at first.
> 
>   * **Thinking longer and harder won’t make the decision any easier**. Sometimes you have to go with your gut because over-analyzing causes more problems.
> 
>   * **It’s okay to have mixed feelings about your decision**. With every choice you make, you have to give something else up, and that can feel bad. It doesn’t mean you’re making the wrong choice.
> 
> 

> 
> As you expand your child’s range of freedom according to their maturity, they’ll probably make a lot of bad decisions. However, they’ll learn that their decisions have consequences and a bit of sting will help them steer clear of similarly poor choices in the future. When your child’s decision-making skills are eventually challenged by self-doubt or the influence of trouble-making peers, encourage them by letting them know you trust in their ability to make good choices. Similar to Willink’s strategy, extending trust will motivate your child to trust you in return.

##### A Note About Empowering Your Team to Cultivate Self-Discipline

Just as it’s useful to encourage your team to take on responsibility, it’s also beneficial to get your team members to develop self-discipline. External discipline (i.e. delivering a command) may get your team to do the bare minimum of what’s required to achieve a task, but it won’t inspire maximal effort.**** On the other hand,**self-discipline is an internal force that drives your behavior and gives you a sense of personal control over what you’re doing**. This sense of ownership inspires more commitment and effort to succeed.

To cultivate self-discipline in your team, explain _why_ your request matters for their own success and the success of the team’s mission. If this doesn’t work, you may have to apply external discipline by ordering your team to complete necessary tasks. Ideally, your team will eventually realize the benefits of the forced discipline for themselves (such as pride in their results) and adopt the practice voluntarily.

> **The Relationship Between Motivation, Habits, and Self-Discipline**
> 
> Which is more important for self-discipline: motivation or good habits? According to psychologists, the two may actually go hand-in-hand. Research shows that intrinsic motivations are more effective than external motivations for developing successful habits, and having successful habits may drive self-discipline
> 
> **Extrinsic motivation** is similar to the external discipline that Willink describes: a drive based on external reward or punishment. For example, a monthly bonus you’re trying to earn or your fear of disappointing your boss after she gives you a project to do. In contrast, **intrinsic motivation** is your drive to do what you innately enjoy or are interested in.
> 
> In a study observing the effects of different motivation sources on long-term weight loss habits, external motivation was shown to be short-lived and ineffective, while intrinsic motivation was long-lasting and effective. Based on this research, a clinical nutritionist makes the case that intrinsic motivation and discipline are required to reach your goals and achieve long-lasting health. In this view, discipline is essential to perform the daily habits that lead you to accomplish your goals.
> 
> Similar to Willink’s theory, the clinical nutritionist’s view is that **intrinsic motivation may form _after_ you perform a habit over time** and discover something about it you enjoy. The difference is that Willink says someone’s internal drive to do something will develop once they recognize its benefits or develop pride, whereas the nutritionist’s view is that you’ll develop self-sustaining behavior once you find something in it you enjoy.

#### Communicate Regularly With Your Team

In addition to empowerment, good relationships are also fostered by effective communication. If communication is poor or lacking altogether, teams don’t understand the big picture or how their individual roles relate to the team’s mission. As a result, your team’s morale drops and the group risks falling apart. So, **regular, quality communication is necessary to keep a team synced, healthy, and strong**.

##### Have Conversations With Your Team

It sounds simple but is often overlooked: By regularly talking to your team members, you’ll get to know their perspectives better. Understanding each other’s points of view will further strengthen trust among your team. Here are a few tips for connecting with people on your team through conversation:

**Get to know your team’s roles and responsibilities**. Have them take you through their tasks. Ask them what does and doesn’t work for them so you can understand their daily life and improve any flaws in your team’s operation.

(Shortform note: It can also be beneficial to have your team members teach you something unrelated to their professional role. Connecting over a more casual subject can be a great way to bond. Additionally, you could arrange occasional workshops (in-person or virtual) where someone on your team hosts a meeting to teach something they’re passionate about. This way, you not only bond with that one team individual, but your whole team gets to know each other better.)

**Validate other team members’ emotions and opinions**. If you’re talking with someone who’s emotional about something, match their emotion first, then bring the intensity down as you ask questions and try to solve the problem. Matching their emotion will make the other person feel like you’re on their side. When people have opinions that don’t align with the team’s mission, empathize with their idea, then ask questions to understand the reason for their opinion. By understanding their ideas, Willink claims you’ll be able to counter and convince them to support your team’s goals more effectively.

(Shortform note: If someone’s negative thoughts or emotions are wearing on you or taking a lot of your time, experts say it’s important to set boundaries. This could mean establishing times during the day when you’re available to talk or limiting the majority of your interactions to email exchanges.)

##### Make Your Instructions Simple and Clear

Use simple language that everyone on the team can understand. Willink says that a good way to ensure your message was clearly understood is to **ask your team members to explain to you in their own words what you told them**. Finally, communicate to your team in more than one format because different people absorb information best in different ways. For example, if you deliver news or instructions in person, follow up with an email that summarizes your message.

(Shortform note: Miscommunications can be sussed out and cleared up if you give your team many opportunities to discuss the plan and ask questions. As we mentioned earlier, Willink promotes the idea of welcoming criticism and suggestions from your team, but you can encourage any questions that people might be hesitant to ask by hosting open forums or arranging anonymous surveys. You can also optimize the variety of communication channels you use by asking the people on your team which mediums they prefer.)

#### Tell Your Team the Truth

Another way to maintain good relationships with your team is to always tell the truth. While it’s easy to deliver positive truths to your team,**if you don’t communicate harsh truths, problems that might be easily solved with the support of your team will be harder to correct**. If your team’s not aware of a problem, they can’t help you overcome it.

(Shortform note: Telling the truth isn’t just beneficial for the success of your team; it also supports good health. One study found that when participants consciously tried not to lie for 10 weeks, they reported significantly fewer negative mental and physical health symptoms than those who didn’t avoid lying.)

Additionally,**if you try to hide the negative side of a situation, your team will eventually find out on their own, which can cause them to lose their trust in you or even spread harmful rumors about why it’s happening**. When people aren’t told what’s going on, they speculate about why bad things are occurring. Willink says that speculations made in the dark are always worse than the reality. These negative ideas are harmful because they can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, if your team believes your company is going to fail, they might start working carelessly because they believe the company is going under anyway. As a result, the company suffers even more and eventually fails.

(Shortform note: Although transparency can prevent many problems, there are certain cases where transparency could do more harm than good. In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio argues that information is best kept quiet when it involves personal issues, when it could put the long-term interests of your team or your clients at risk, or when sharing information is likely to be more distracting than beneficial to their performance.)

Willink says **when a problem occurs, address it with your team as soon as possible**. The longer you wait to break bad news, the harder it will be to tell your team and the more time there is for problems and rumors to develop. Rip off the Band-Aid and tell your team what’s going on.

> **Organize Your Problems, Then Address Them**
> 
> Willink recommends breaking bad news to your team as soon as you can, but what do you do if the issue isn’t extremely severe or urgent? In _Traction_ , Gino Wickman argues that problems should be categorized into three different lists depending on their severity:
> 
>   * **A list of issues for quarterly meetings:** These issues aren’t time-pressing and can wait to be dealt with when it’s convenient. For example, if a company-wide norm is being changed by HR.
> 
>   * **A list of issues for weekly meetings:** These are strategic issues that need to be addressed with more urgency. For example, the company’s priorities need to be discussed.
> 
>   * **A list of urgent, departmental issues:** This list contains issues that should be brought to the attention of the department head at a weekly departmental meeting. For example, this could be a meeting to address an unexpected drop in sales or an upcoming presentation that was scheduled last minute.

### Good Leaders Take Responsibility for Their Team’s Problems

According to Willink, as a leader, you’re responsible for any problems that occur on your team. Casting blame when something goes wrong wastes time and causes your team to stagnate. Instead, **embrace the responsibility you have for your team's problems and focus on creating solutions**.

In this section, we’ll explain how adopting a sense of radical responsibility for your team prevents future problems and encourages your team members to take more responsibility for themselves. We’ll then discuss Willink’s advice for how to make effective decisions that lead to solutions.

#### Benefits of Radical Responsibility

Willink coined the phrase “extreme ownership” and even titled a book after it. In this section, we’ll explore what this means, referring to it as “radical responsibility.” Radical responsibility means taking responsibility for _all_ of the problems related to your team and mission. A mindset of radical responsibility not only puts you in a position to solve whatever problems are at hand, but it also helps prevent future issues. **If you know that you’ll bear the weight of responsibility for any of your team’s potential missteps, you’ll take preemptive actions to avoid mistakes.**

> **Can Radical Responsibility Lead to Burnout?**
> 
> In _The Road Less Traveled_ , M. Scott Peck agrees with Willink that taking responsibility for problems leads to active solutions. However, he explains that an excessive sense of responsibility—believing everything is your fault—is an expression of neurotic behavior. This can lead to anxiety, fear of commitment, and a lower quality of life.
> 
> To maintain a positive, action-oriented mindset, _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ says to distinguish fault from responsibility. Fault concerns the uncontrollable past, but responsibility concerns the present—which you have the power to influence. For example, you’re not at fault for a critical mistake your team member made yesterday, but you’re responsible for your reaction to that problem today.

Another benefit of taking responsibility is that it’s contagious. **By taking responsibility for a problem, you’ll inspire other people to take responsibility, too**.

(Shortform note: Although taking responsibility sets an inspiring example for your team to follow, you might not always be around to set the tone. The authors of _Built to Last_ argue that you should encourage your team to align themselves not with you as a leader, but with the values of your culture—in this case, the cultural value would be radical responsibility. The most important leadership quality that sets long-lasting companies apart is a long-term vision and concern for organizational culture.)

#### Make Effective Decisions

Once you’ve taken responsibility for a problem, the next step is to make a decision that will solve it. This begins with detaching and prioritizing.

##### Detach From the Situation

First, when you’re faced with a problem, don’t react impulsively. This can lead to rash decisions and ineffective solutions. Instead, Willink suggests you _detach_ physically and mentally from the situation before you decide what to do. Willink claims that **by learning to detach, you’ll manage your emotions better, read other people more effectively, and gain more perspective** on how to appropriately handle a situation.

When you notice you’re getting emotional about a situation (breathing hard, clenching your fists, and so on) perform these physical steps to relax and think more clearly:

  * Take a step back.
  * Lift your chin.
  * Take a deep breath.
  * Look around.



(Shortform note: As a modification of Willink’s detachment protocol, when you take a deep breath, try prolonging your exhale. This slows your heart rate and helps you calm down. For example, inhale for four seconds and exhale for eight.)

**Maintain awareness of the “big picture.”** Don’t focus too much on the small details of a problem because you’ll blind yourself from seeing what really matters. For example, if you’re trying to type a critical letter of apology to a coworker, don’t fixate on which font to use or what time of day to send it to them. Instead, focus on what matters, like owning up to your mistake and acknowledging that you’ll do what it takes to repair your relationship.

(Shortform note: In Stoicism, focusing on the big picture means remembering that life is finite. By remembering that you only have a limited time to live, you can overlook petty problems and focus on the purpose of life (in Stoicism, the purpose of life is to live virtuously). As a leader, remembering that life is temporary may help you avoid spending valuable time on meaningless tasks and focus on actions that make a real difference for your team’s success.)

**If you feel like you’re too detached from the problem to solve it, temporarily immerse yourself in the details until you understand what’s going on**. For example, if a sales strategy isn’t working, go down to the floor and talk with customers, cashiers, and anyone else you encounter until you get to the root of the problem.

(Shortform note: To get to the root cause(s) of an issue, consider using the “five whys” technique, which involves gathering a group of people related to the issue at hand, agreeing on what the problem is, and then asking “why” roughly fives times, or until you get to the root cause of your issue.)

##### Prioritize Your Problems

After you’ve detached, the next step is to address the problems you face in the order of their importance. To prioritize your problems and determine whether or not you should step in, ask yourself if the problem can cause you and your team to fail your mission, if the problem is worth your time, and how bad the problem will get if you leave it alone. By default, Willink says to**let your team handle all of the problems they’re capable of handling without you** by order of priority. This will allow you to focus on big-picture problems and tackle issues that go beyond their power or scope.

(Shortform note: In _Extreme Ownership_ , Willink and Leif Babin include another key tip for prioritizing your problems: Focus on the issue that the other issues depend on. For example, if an angry client calls your office wanting to access information from their online account but your office’s Wi-Fi has also crashed, prioritize the Wi-Fi issue because you won’t be able to access the customer account on your computer system without it. When it seems like a problem can be handled by your team, avoid stepping in to take charge and instead ask how you can support them. This will slow down your instinct to take control and you’ll show your colleague that you trust their ability to handle it.)

##### Carry Out Difficult Decisions Gradually

In situations where you don’t have enough information to make a confident decision about how to handle a problem, take small, incremental actions which slowly carry out your “best guess” solution. This prevents you from overinvesting in an incorrect decision that wastes a lot of your team’s time and energy. Instead, **executing your decision slowly will allow you to adjust your plan if necessary**. For example, let’s say a retail manager has noticed that inventory is going missing. He suspects employee theft, but he doesn't want to alienate his team by making accusations. He can start addressing the problem with the small step of asking his employees to keep a closer watch on their sections and double count their drawers. It's possible that this would solve the problem by itself. If it doesn't, he can move to more extreme measures.

(Shortform note: Incremental plans have a variety of benefits. Besides allowing you to adapt over time, a plan with defined steps keeps you and your team focused on individual goals along the way. Additionally, _The 12 Week Year_ explains that crafting a shorter plan increases its predictability. For example, you’ll likely have a better idea of what your team’s resources and capability will be in one month compared to one year from now. Thus, you’re equipped to make a more realistic and effective plan for a shorter time range. This advice could apply to a leader’s gradual plan for an uncertain situation: plan steps within a predictable range of time.)

### Good Leaders Are Balanced

Willink argues that leaders must remain balanced to operate effectively. He claims that the extreme ends of any strategy or behavior can be harmful. In this section, we’ll discuss a couple key areas of leadership where striking a balance helps you lead your team well.

#### Balance Between Optimism and Realism

When your team is facing difficulty and morale is low, **maintain a balanced attitude**. Your attitude as a leader influences the attitudes of the people on your team. If you succumb to negativity, your team will follow suit. On the opposite end, if you’re blinded by optimism and put an unrealistically positive spin on everything, your team will think you’re oblivious to the problems at hand. As a result, you’ll lose credibility with your team. Instead, **acknowledge the reality of the situation but focus your effort on the solution**.

(Shortform note: In _The Obstacle Is the Way_ , Ryan Holiday explains that according to Stoicism, no situation is inherently good or bad. Rather, your perspective determines whether something is good or bad. So, in the face of adversity, Stoic philosophy says you should view challenging situations as opportunities for some kind of good. Holiday argues that this perspective will prime you to discover hidden solutions in your problems and overcome them.)

#### Balance Between Praise and Criticism

**When you give feedback to your team, be complimentary, but give them a goal to strive for**. If you give purely complimentary praise, you might make your team arrogant and complacent. And if your team gets complacent, they won’t perform as well as they could. On the other hand, if you dish out nothing but criticism, your team might lose motivation. Constant criticism without praise can lead your team to think they don’t need to perform at their best because their efforts aren’t appreciated anyway. So, give your team praise, but encourage continuous improvement.

(Shortform note: In _Principles: Life and Work_ , Ray Dalio lists several ways to keep feedback fair and effective. When you’re delivering negative feedback, you should be honest and specific about how they can improve. Support your points with data and don’t sugarcoat what you have to say. To prevent the recipient of your feedback from worrying unnecessarily about small, negative points, cushion your criticisms by putting them in the context of their total performance. Another way to balance your approach to feedback is to adapt your review to the individual you’re speaking to. One person might be sensitive, while another person is combative. Adjust accordingly.)
