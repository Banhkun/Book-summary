## 1-Page Summary

In _Attached_ , psychiatrist Amir Levine and psychologist Rachel Heller contend that many of our relationship issues stem from differences in how we perceive and express intimacy—and that, by understanding this, we can achieve greater harmony in our relationships.

In this guide, you’ll first learn how humans generally relate to romantic partners: What are secure and insecure attachment styles, and why do they matter? You’ll then learn more about the three attachment styles, and what your attachment style indicates you need from a relationship. Then, you’ll discover the problems that can arise if your intimacy needs clash with your partner’s and how to handle it when they do. Finally, you’ll learn how to adopt the behaviors of the secure attachment style and use them to make your relationships more fulfilling. Along the way, we’ll examine how Levine and Heller’s ideas compare with recent research on attachment styles and include recommendations from other experts on practical ways to improve your relationship.

### What Are Attachment Styles?

According to Levine and Heller, everyone has an _attachment system_ —a mechanism in your brain that compels you to seek, monitor, and maintain intimacy with a chosen partner. Attachment theory contends that this desire for intimacy is biological __ and inescapable, which psychologists attribute to an evolutionary adaptation: In prehistoric times, pairs of humans had a better chance of survival than any solo human, so genetic selection favored people who "attached," or learned how to develop close bonds with others.

(Shortform note: Levine and Heller’s contention that we evolved to desire intimacy with a chosen partner implies a long-standing biological preference for monogamy. However, in _Sex at Dawn_ , authors Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá argue that monogamy is not biologically ingrained but, rather, relatively new: Prior to the advent of agriculture, humans lived in multimale-multifemale mating systems.)

The authors note that every human responds differently to the urge for closeness: Some suppress it, while others automatically embrace it. Psychologists categorize these different responses into “attachment styles,” which are the beliefs and behaviors that determine how you function in intimate relationships. There are three main attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant.

  * **Secure attachers** are nurturing, responsive, and comfortable with intimacy. 
  * **Anxious attachers** are preoccupied with making their relationship solid and constantly seek reassurance from their partner. 
  * **Avoidant attachers** are more distant and see intimacy as a threat to their independence.



(Shortform note: Because Levine and Heller popularized the concept of attachment styles among romantic partners, we’ve used their terms (secure, anxious, and avoidant) throughout this guide. However, these styles have several different names: Secure is a universal term, but anxious attachment is also known as anxious-preoccupied attachment, and avoidant attachment is also known as dismissive-avoidant attachment.)

#### The Origins of Attachment Theory

The idea that adults attach to their romantic partners, which underlies Levine and Heller’s work, reflects attachment theorists’ contention that humans have attachment needs throughout their entire lives. However, attachment theory was originally developed to describe the relationship between children and their caregivers. It is rooted in research from the 1960s, when psychologists Mary Ainsworth and John Bowlby—who are credited today as the founders of attachment theory— discovered the importance of parent-child bonding. By studying children raised in orphanages, they learned that providing kids with food and shelter isn’t enough: Kids who lacked a parent or attachment figure had a much higher chance of stunted physical, emotional, and intellectual development, even if they had adequate food and shelter.

(Shortform note: Romantic attachment theory is based on the premise that romantic relationships are like the attachment bonds formed between children and their parents. However, modern psychologists have pinpointed various issues with Ainsworth and Bowlby’s work—the foundational findings on which attachment theory is based. Namely, they argue that Ainsworth and Bowlby focused too heavily on the mother-child relationship and ignored other factors that we now know are more predictive of your development, like your temperament and social class. These criticisms of parent-child attachment may have implications for the study of adult romantic attachment.)

### Why Attachment Matters

Levine and Heller argue that having an emotionally satisfying romantic relationship significantly improves your quality of life.

Many modern Westerners assume that in order to thrive, you must be self-sufficient. But, Levine and Heller contend, our _partners_ help us thrive: **Partners who satisfy our basic attachment needs** —**our deep-seated desires for security, comfort, and love—make us more independent, bold, and brave**. This seems initially paradoxical: How does relying on someone else make you more independent? Attachment theorists explain that relying on someone who nourishes your emotional needs makes you feel safe: You believe that this person will catch you if you fall. And since you have this safety net, you feel emboldened to take the steps necessary to thrive.

(Shortform note: The idea that our partners help us thrive may be unusual to many Westerners, but it’s so ingrained in other cultures that the authors debated whether or not to include it. In a post-publication interview, Levine explained that Heller, who is Israeli, initially didn’t see the need to discuss the importance others have on our lives because their importance was so obvious to her.)

But what happens if our partners _don’t_ give us the emotional support our brains crave? Our brains instruct us to pursue it at all costs—request it, demand it, even throw a temper tantrum if necessary. When we still don't get the emotional nourishment we need, arguments erupt and the relationship sustains damage. Moreover, since we don’t feel safe, we lack the courage to be our best selves—and we never thrive as much as we might have.

(Shortform note: We can see just how powerfully our brains crave emotional support from our partners—and how much damage not receiving it can cause—by looking at what happens to people whose partners pass away. Research suggests that even if you’re aware that your partner is gone, if your brain doesn’t fully understand that your partner can no longer support you emotionally, you’re more likely to continue pursuing this support—and thus suffer more debilitating forms of grief.)

### Why Understanding Your Attachment Style Matters

Because of this deep-seated need for attachment, Levine and Heller argue that if you want to be your best self, your romantic relationship must fulfill your emotional needs. The best way to create such a relationship is to understand both your own and your partner’s attachment styles. If you know your _own_ attachment style, you’ll better understand what you need in a romantic relationship. If you can decipher _others’_ attachment styles, you’ll be better able to assess if a potential partner is _capable_ of fulfilling those needs. And if you already have a partner, you’ll finally understand what lies at the root of your conflicts—and how you can resolve them.

> **Not Just Romantic: How Your Overarching Attachment Style Affects Your Relationship**
> 
> _Attached_ focuses exclusively on your and your partner’s attachment style in romantic relationships—but that might not be enough to determine whether your relationship will fulfill your emotional needs. Research supports the idea that you have one overarching attachment style, which affects all your relationships, as well as different attachment styles in specific types of relationships—like the one with your romantic partner.
> 
> For example, you might have an insecure _overarching_ attachment style, but a secure _romantic_ attachment style. Researchers contend that your _overarching_ attachment style affects the outcome of your relationships too: For example, partners with overall insecure/romantically secure attachment styles tend to be happy in their relationships when things are going well but may not be well-equipped to handle crises.

### Understanding the Three Attachment Styles

Now that you know the importance of understanding attachment styles, we’ll delve deeper into the three main attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant. In this section, you’ll learn the hallmarks of each attachment style and what each type of attacher should focus on to maintain healthy relationships.

#### How Secure Attachers Behave

Levine and Heller explain that a person with a secure attachment style **has a compelling desire for intimacy with a romantic partner, but they’re also comfortable with emotional distance.** They don't need to constantly negotiate the level of intimacy or independence in their relationship; they’re generally content with whatever their partner wants.

(Shortform note: Secure attachment doesn’t just indicate emotional stability in a romantic relationship; it’s also correlated with several other factors that may affect happiness in a relationship. For example, one study found that secure attachers tend to have fewer issues with substance abuse than insecure attachers.)

Notably, **secure attachers are predisposed to expect their partners to love them** and don’t worry about their relationships falling apart. As such, they are good at communicating their emotional needs and can keep their emotions steady when faced with adversity. Levine and Heller contend that this is why, as research shows, **people with secure attachment styles tend to have happier relationships** than those with insecure attachment styles.

> **Why Secure Attachment May Not Predict Relationship Satisfaction**
> 
> Levine and Heller go as far as saying that a secure attachment is “the best predictor of happiness in a relationship,” but other experts argue that that’s not exactly right. One study found that the biggest predictor of relationship satisfaction is how committed you think your partner is to your relationship—regardless of how committed they actually are. In a way, this supports Levine and Heller’s argument, since they imply that secure attachers are more likely to think their partners are committed to the relationship. But since it’s possible that some insecure attachers also assume their partner is committed to the relationship, this study’s results don’t exactly align with Levine and Heller’s argument.

If you’re in a relationship with a secure attacher, you’ll feel emotionally safe—as though being with them makes it easier for you to face the outside world. In fact, Levine and Heller note, dating a secure attacher tends to make insecure attachers _more_ secure.

(Shortform note: If you’re an insecure attacher, you may only feel emotionally safe with your secure partner after some time has passed. In a 2022 interview, Levine noted that insecure attachers may feel initially uncomfortable with the healthy relationship behaviors exhibited by their secure partners because they’re accustomed to different relationship patterns, and recommended working through this anxiety by relaxing and accepting these behaviors.)

(Shortform note: In a 2018 interview, Levine shared an acronym daters can use to identify secure attachers: CARRP. Secure attachers tend to be consistent, available, reliable, responsive, and predictable.)

**If you’re a secure attacher, your major relationship goal is to maintain your secure attachment style.** Levine and Heller explain that as a secure attacher, you’re good at recognizing cues that indicate compatibility, so you tend not to get trapped in negative relationships. But since you tend to forgive easily, you may let negative behaviors repeatedly slide and stay in a relationship longer than you should—which can shift your attachment style. If you start to recognize the anxious or avoidant tendencies described below in your behavior, it might be time to leave your relationship.

(Shortform note: If you _do_ find your attachment style changing in a relationship, consider spending time with other secure attachers: In a 2022 interview, Levine explains that spending time with secure people—even if it’s not your romantic partner—can make you more secure.)

#### How Anxious Attachers Behave

A person with an anxious attachment style **has a compelling desire for intimacy with a romantic partner and is highly attuned to anything that seems to endanger that intimacy.** They believe their very survival depends on the success of their partnership, so they are perpetually on guard and zero in on even the slightest perceived threats, like a small change in their partner’s tone of voice.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that anxious attachers may also be hypersensitive to threats in other areas of their lives. One study found that anxious attachers were the first to notice if a room gradually filled with smoke.)

Whenever an anxious attacher perceives a threat, they are flooded with “activating strategies”—internal states that make them want to regain intimacy with their partners at all costs. These activating strategies lead the anxious attacher to engage in “protest behavior,” or actions used to demand greater intimacy—like constantly calling. Once that intimacy is reestablished, the anxious attacher relaxes. But the “protest behavior” tends to cause harm in the relationship.

For example, Annie leaves for work before her husband, Anxious Andrew, on the morning of their anniversary. Anxious Andrew wakes up and sees no indication that Annie remembered their anniversary—which he perceives as a threat to their relationship. He immediately grows stressed and wants to speak with her (the activating strategy), so he texts her (the protest behavior). If Annie texts back immediately, Andrew relaxes and goes about his day. But if Annie _doesn’t_ text back immediately, Andrew remains stressed and continues texting—and when Annie finally sees the barrage of texts, she grows annoyed, which sours their anniversary.

> **How Other Attachment Theorists Describe Anxious Attachment**
> 
> Levine and Heller’s definitions of the terms “activating strategies” and “protest behavior” are somewhat confusing. Despite using the word “strategy,” they define an “activating strategy” exclusively as a thought or feeling— _not_ an action or plan. Additionally, they define “protest behavior” as “any action that tries to reestablish contact with your partner and get their attention.” By this definition, calling your partner once because she’s late coming home—an action most would find reasonable—is protest behavior. But the authors heavily imply that protest behavior _must_ negatively impact the relationship: All of their examples of protest behavior feature unhealthy relationship behaviors, and they describe protest behavior as something you “resort to” when you’re unable to effectively communicate your needs.
> 
> Levine and Heller’s confusing definitions may result from their attempt at originality. Today, many modern-day attachment theorists refer to “hyperactivating strategies.” This all-encompassing term describes _both_ the thoughts and feelings that prompt an anxious attacher to seek intimacy when threatened —what Levine and Heller call activating strategies— _and_ the behavior these attachers use to regain that intimacy—what Levine and Heller call “protest behavior.” But the term specifies that these behaviors are “clingy and controlling”—so a single phone call would likely not be considered an undesirable attachment response.

**If you’re an anxious attacher, accepting your romantic needs is critical to developing a happy relationship.** Levine and Heller explain that many anxious attachers try to ignore their needs for intimacy and reassurance because they’re ashamed of them. But if you don’t accept these needs, you won’t express them and give your partner the opportunity to fulfill them. Alternatively, you may select a partner who’s incapable of fulfilling these needs. Either way, you’ll be perpetually unhappy because your relationship isn’t giving you what you need.

(Shortform note: You can only accept your romantic needs if you know exactly what they are. To determine yours, one anxious attachment style coach recommends reviewing whether your complaints about former partners signaled unfulfilled needs. For example, if you disliked that your partner didn’t text you every day, daily contact with your partner may be a need.)

#### How Avoidant Attachers Behave

A person with an avoidant attachment style doesn't possess a compelling desire to achieve closeness with a romantic partner. Like all humans, their brains are wired to seek an intimate connection, but when the partnership gets too close, they feel suffocated.

(Shortform note: The avoidant attacher’s evasion of intimacy isn’t just limited to romantic relationships; it affects their relationships with their children, too. Research indicates that avoidant attachers may not enjoy parenting their babies as much as secure attachers and that they tend to find parenting more stressful.)

**Avoidant attachers employ several techniques to maintain some emotional distance from their partners.** These techniques, also known as “deactivating strategies,” are thoughts or behaviors the avoidant attacher uses to keep their independence in the relationship and avoid getting too close, such as consistently prioritizing alone time over time with their partner. But by distancing yourself from your partner, you may damage the health of your relationship.

(Shortform note: The term “deactivating strategy” seems similar to “activating strategy,” but Levine and Heller’s usage of the terms are more different than they initially appear. Activating strategies are the _thoughts and feelings_ that drive your actions— _not_ the actions you take. In contrast, _de_ activating strategies include both your thoughts _and_ your actions.)

**If you’re an avoidant attacher, recognizing and combating your deactivating strategies can help you have a happy relationship.** One strategy Levine and Heller recommend is to second-guess your negative thoughts about your partner: Is it _really_ a problem, or are you trying to push your partner away?

(Shortform note: If the thing you dislike about your partner isn’t _really_ a problem but still bothers you, try to accept your partner’s flaws. To do so, one psychologist recommends focusing on your own flaws: Reminding yourself of what you make your partner deal with may help keep their flaws in perspective.)

### Incompatible Attachment Styles: Understanding Anxious-Avoidant Partnerships

Now that you know both your own and your partner’s attachment style, you can assess whether you’re capable of fulfilling each other’s emotional needs. Levine and Heller explain that while any attachment style combination can work, one is particularly volatile:**** anxious and avoidant attachers.**** In this section, we’ll discuss why people in anxious-avoidant relationships struggle so much, techniques to improve that relationship—and when you should end it.

#### Why Anxious-Avoidant Pairs Struggle

Levine and Heller explain that **people in long-term** **anxious-avoidant relationships get stuck in a cycle of conflict because their intimacy needs clash.** The anxious attacher always wants to be closer. The avoidant attacher will occasionally accept increased intimacy but soon grow uncomfortable and withdraw. The anxious attacher responds to this withdrawal by trying to reconnect—which repels the avoidant partner even more.

(Shortform note: Anxious and avoidant attachers may also have personality traits that exacerbate conflicts between them: One study found that anxious attachers tend to care more about fairness than avoidant attachers. So, for example, an anxious attacher may grow upset that her partner isn’t pulling equal weight in their relationship—then grow even more upset when the avoidant attacher doesn’t think this apparent inequality is a big deal.)

Levine and Heller note that while these partners may love each other, their **interactions tend to worsen over time because the couple's different needs expand into every corner of life.** For example**,** if Avoidant Annie is reluctant to marry because she wants to maintain her independence, that desire probably won’t disappear after the wedding—and may later manifest in a fight about whether to vacation together or separately. **Every aspect of their shared life becomes a point of contention** , and each partner’s happiness in the relationship deteriorates.

(Shortform note: You may be able to avoid at least some of this relationship deterioration by talking explicitly about your needs and values in the way relationship counselors recommend you do prior to marriage. One counselor recommends that engaged couples discuss how much time they expect to spend with each other: Once you’re married, are weekends just for your spouse? This might be particularly helpful for anxious-avoidant couples to help them understand and prepare for their differing expectations.)

Given the volatility of and pain experienced by people in anxious-avoidant relationships, Levine and Heller recommend avoiding them if you can. In other words, if you’re an anxious attacher, steer clear of long-term relationships with avoidant attachers, who can’t meet your intimacy needs. Similarly, avoidant attachers should steer clear of anxious attachers, who’ll exacerbate their desire for independence.

(Shortform note: Some critics argue that Levine and Heller default too heavily to insisting that people with insecure attachment styles find secure partners instead of trying to improve their relationships—especially when it comes to anxious-avoidant partnerships. Instead of breaking up, one option that the authors mention but don’t delve deeply into is Emotionally Focused Therapy, or EFT. In EFT, both partners are taught how to break out of the behavioral patterns they’re stuck in, which could improve their relationship.)

#### How Anxious-Avoidant Pairs Can Be Happy: Find Secure Role Models

If you’re already in an anxious-avoidant partnership, what should you do? One way you can improve your relationship, according to Levine and Heller, is by **finding a secure role model and mimicking their behavior.** They contend that by repeatedly behaving like a secure person, you gradually develop a more secure attachment style—and, as we’ve seen, the more secure your attachment style, the more fulfilling your relationships tend to be.

> **Why Does Behaving Securely Shift Your Attachment Style?**
> 
> Levine and Heller don’t specify _why_ behaving like a secure person shifts your attachment style. It’s possible that secure relationship behaviors are similar to what productivity expert James Clear calls identity-based habits. In _Atomic Habits_ , Clear contends that you should first decide who you want to be, then develop the habits you think that person would engage in. He explains that by behaving like the person you want to be, you prove to yourself that you are that person—so you continue performing those behaviors as an expression of your identity. Similarly, _behaving_ like a secure person could make you believe that you _are_ a secure person—and shift your attachment style as a result.

To practice secure behavior effectively, Levine and Heller recommend that both the anxious and avoidant partner do the following:

  1. Find a role model—someone who has a comfortable and secure way of dealing with others.
  2. Think about the role model’s specific behaviors and actions in response to a variety of life situations. For example, how do they behave when someone in their life angers them?
  3. When you face a conflict, think about what your role model would do—and use their behavior to inform your own.



> **How Others Recommend Role-Modeling Secure Behavior**
> 
> Many experts recommend mimicking secure role models, but their recommendations differ from Levine and Heller’s in some key ways. Notably, Levine and Heller state that your role model can be someone you know either well or superficially. In contrast, one advice columnist warns against modeling your relationships after couples you don’t know well: The less you know the couple, the greater the chances you’ll idealize their relationship.
> 
> In addition, while Levine and Heller recommend learning by observing others’ behavior, this columnist recommends asking the couple directly how they behave in various situations instead of relying solely on your observations.

#### When You Should End the Relationship

While you can learn from role models, some relationships can’t be fixed. Levine and Heller explain that if you’re an anxious person with an avoidant partner and the following statements ring true, your partnership has become harmful and possibly abusive, and you may need to end it:

  1. Your partner is kind to everybody else but not to you—in fact, you don’t like to discuss with others how your partner treats you.
  2. Your partner values others’ opinions more than yours.
  3. You don't really know much about your partner's life, so you feel you have to spy on them to find out. 
  4. You don't know if you can count on your partner to be there for you in an emergency situation. 



> **Avoidant vs. Abusive: How Can You Tell?**
> 
> Levine and Heller don’t properly distinguish between behaviors that are harmful versus abusive, only noting that these behaviors occur if the avoidant partner views their anxious partner as “the enemy.” This may lead the anxious partner to misidentify the nature of the behaviors they’re experiencing—or not notice that their _own_ behavior may be abusive: Notably, spying on your partner is considered a sign of abuse. If you think you might be experiencing abuse, experts generally recommend calling a local domestic violence hotline to get the support you need.
> 
> While the behaviors the authors describe may or may not be abusive, they are definitely harmful to the health of your relationship. All of these behaviors indicate contempt toward your partner, which is a death knell for your relationship. In fact, renowned relationship researcher John Gottman has found that contempt is the “number one predictor of divorce.”

### How to Behave More Securely in Your Relationships

Copying the behaviors of secure attachers isn’t the only benefit for people in anxious-avoidant relationships: Levine and Heller contend that **learning to _communicate_ and to _fight_ like a secure attacher benefits your romantic relationships. **In this section, you’ll first learn why it’s important to communicate like a secure attacher and how exactly you can do so. Then, you’ll learn why it’s important to handle conflicts like a secure attacher and the rules you should follow when you fight.

#### Four Rules for Communicating Like a Secure Attacher

Levine and Heller contend that whether you’re single or partnered, learning to communicate like a secure attacher will help you thrive in your intimate relationships.**** If you’re seeking a new partner, communicating your needs directly and honestly can help you choose someone who’s _emotionally capable_ of meeting them and weed out the ones who aren’t. Once you're in a relationship, communicating effectively helps ensure your needs are met.

(Shortform note: Levine and Heller’s contention that communication is essential to relationships echoes that of many relationship experts. In _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_ , relationship counselor John Gray expands upon this contention: He argues that in heterosexual relationships, women and men are practically speaking different languages because men talk to communicate information while women talk to communicate feelings—and to have a successful relationship, you must learn to respond to what your partner _actually_ wants. Generally speaking, men should communicate how much they _care_ about their female partner, while women should communicate how much they _trust_ their male partner.)

Levine and Heller explain that to communicate like a secure attacher, **express your needs and expectations directly and in a nonthreatening, inoffensive, and noncritical manner.** You can do so by following these four rules.

  1. **Be honest and speak openly.** Your needs matter—no matter how your partner feels about them. It might be scary, but it’s only by making your desires clear that you give your partner the opportunity to fulfill them. _Example:_ "I’d like to get married in the next two years. I want to find out if you see us getting married in that time frame." (Shortform note: Levine and Heller’s advice contradicts many dating advice books, which recommend expressing your desires more subtly. In _Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man_ , comedian Steve Harvey urges women to express their standards in an organic way that lets men read between the lines—like by saying, “I see myself being married in the next two years.”)
  2. **Express your needs directly, without blaming or judging.** Use phrases like "I need," "I feel," and "I want." Remember, your goal is _not_ to make your partner feel inadequate—after all, their needs are just as valid as yours. _Example:_ "I need to know that you respect my intelligence. When you make jokes about me being a dumb blonde, I question whether you value me for my brains or my looks." (Shortform note: Some people try to use “I feel” statements but continue to blame their partner with statements like “I feel that you’re being unkind.” This is _not_ about your needs but about your partner’s actions. To avoid this trap, experts recommend ensuring that your “I” statements actually discuss your personal experience—like by saying, “I feel hurt when you make dumb blonde jokes.”) 
  3. **Use specific examples to illustrate your concerns.** Don't rely on generalities, which leave room for misunderstandings. Stick to concrete language. For example, say, "When you make plans with friends and don’t tell me about them in advance, I feel like you don't want the kind of intimacy that I need." (Shortform note: Being specific may be especially helpful at the beginning of the discussion, which one relationship psychologist contends is the most important part: The tone you set then will determine how the rest of the conversation goes. So consider starting with a specific issue instead of saying, “You never tell me about your plans.”)
  4. **Time your discussion for when both parties are calm and collected.** If the situation is already volatile, let it simmer down before you attempt an honest, forthright discussion. (Shortform note: Psychologists also warn against arguing when either party’s basic needs—like sleep and proper food—haven’t been met: Someone who’s hungry or tired isn’t in the right mindset to have a productive conversation.) 



#### How to Defuse Conflict Like a Secure Attacher

Levine and Heller suggest that learning to fight like a secure attacher can also improve your relationship. They explain that while not every couple faces the intimacy-related disagreements discussed throughout this guide, **even the most secure couples fight** about basic, daily-life issues—like who’ll make dinner or take out the trash. However, research indicates that such arguments can actually help couples grow closer. Levine and Heller contend that this is because secure attachers follow certain rules of communication that let them effectively work through the conflict without destroying their relationship in the process.

So if you’re an insecure attacher facing a daily-life conflict, Levine and Heller recommend following these rules to effectively work through it. (Just make sure it’s _actually_ a daily-life conflict: As we’ve seen, some conflicts—like whether to vacation together or separately—seem initially like a daily-life conflict but are actually symptomatic of clashing intimacy needs.)

> **How Other Researchers Define Relationship Conflicts**
> 
> While Levine and Heller categorize relationship conflict as either intimacy-related or daily-life-related, other researchers use different terms. Notably, Gottman categorizes relationship issues into three types: solvable conflicts around a particular topic; perpetual conflicts that relate to fundamental personality or value differences; and gridlocked conflicts, which are perpetual conflicts that have escalated due to poor management.
> 
> According to Gottman, only one-third of conflicts in a relationship are solvable; the other two-thirds are perpetual or gridlocked. But just as some daily-life conflicts are actually intimacy-related, the same issues can be solvable or perpetual depending on the situation. So how do you tell which is which? If you can’t tell, the answer may simply be to talk about it: Gottman recommends examining the emotional roots of each conflict, so that you can learn more about your partner and thus grow closer—even if you never resolve the initial issue.

  * **Prioritize both your _and_ your partner’s happiness. **Remember that in a partnership, you’re looking for every conflict to end in a win-win situation. (Shortform note: In _Crucial Accountability_ , the authors describe the importance of establishing a sense of shared purpose before a difficult conversation. To do so, lay out the facts, express your feelings, then ask for your partner’s perspective: This demonstrates that you care about your partner’s feelings and want to solve the issue together.) 
  * **Keep the argument centered on the present issue** —don't get sidetracked or expand the argument to include other issues. A conflict about someone leaving the kitchen a mess shouldn't turn into an argument about who takes on more work in the household. (Shortform note: Focusing the argument on one issue can be easier said than done. If something else comes up that needs to be dealt with, experts recommend scheduling a separate conversation to discuss it.) 
  * **Stay focused and don’t distance yourself emotionally or physically.** You need to approach the issue head-on until it gets resolved in a mutually agreeable way—even if it takes some arguing to get there. (Shortform note: Psychologists note that even if you’re actively engaged in the discussion, your body language may convey emotional resistance to the conversation. So try to transmit cues that convey that you’re open to the discussion—like with appropriate eye contact.) 
  * **Tell your partner exactly what you need and want.** No matter how long you've been with your partner, they can’t anticipate all your needs. (Shortform note: Telling your partner _exactly_ what you want may also prevent them from misinterpreting you. Consider active listening: In this technique, before responding to your partner, you first repeat back what you think they said to help validate them and to ensure you’ve understood their message correctly.)
