## Chapter 2: Dependency Doesn't Mean Weakness

Although research into attachment styles is still evolving, we know that the desire for attachment is wired into us. Further, the people we choose as our romantic partners have a huge impact on our ability to thrive in the world. They affect how we feel about ourselves and how much we believe in our own abilities.

**Partners who satisfy our basic attachment needs—our deep-seated desires for security, comfort, and love—unwittingly give us the courage to go out into the world and thrive.** In contrast, partners who _don't_ satisfy these needs may stunt our ability to achieve our goals. They may even have a negative effect on our health.

### The Dependency Paradox

It may seem like a paradox, but **depending on another person will actually make you more independent, bold, and brave.** According to attachment theory, when our emotional needs are nourished, we have no reason to be needy or anxious. In fact, we become much more daring.

This idea—that people become braver by depending on others—contradicts what most of us learn as we grow up. We’re taught that we should strive for self-reliance. Self-help books and psychology blogs are full of advice on how to be more emotionally independent—after all, needing another person is weak, even shameful. We’re told to focus on our own happiness, to set clear boundaries with our partners, and to look after ourselves first and foremost.

**That's all well and good if you're solo, but if you're in a relationship, it's counterproductive.**

Brain research reveals a different story. When we're in a relationship, our brains are wired to crave our partner's emotional support as well as their physical closeness. If our partner fails to deliver that support, our brains instruct us to pursue it at all costs—request it, demand it, even throw a temper tantrum if necessary. When we go to great lengths and still don't get the emotional nourishment we need, arguments erupt. Feelings are hurt. Neither partner feels any satisfaction. The relationship sustains damage.

#### An Attachment Conflict on Reality TV

A popular reality TV show provides a good example of how our relationships can make us either stronger or weaker, depending on whether or not our emotional needs are met. In the show, couples dash around the globe and test the mettle of their relationships by participating in adventure challenges together, such as bungee-jumping off bridges and kayaking through rough seas.

In one of the first episodes, one couple succeeded in several challenges and nearly won the big cash prize, but **ultimately they were foiled by attachment issues.** When tensions between the couple escalated during particularly high-risk challenges, the woman repeatedly asked her partner to hold her hand. She couldn’t explain why, but she believed that small gesture would give her the confidence she needed.

Her partner refused to do it. When asked why, he said he was irritated by his girlfriend's "neediness."

After the pair lost the race, the woman blamed herself, telling TV viewers she felt ashamed of not being able to manage her fear in high-risk situations.

The outcome of the race might have been different if this couple had understood the basic tenets of attachment theory. The man would have understood that one small adjustment—the simple act of holding his girlfriend's hand—would have made a world of difference.**Had he been willing to soothe her emotional needs, she would have been capable of bravery.** Instead, her anxiety and fear was further elevated by her partner's unwillingness to reassure her.

### The Origins of Attachment Theory

The Western belief that we should be emotionally self-sufficient has its roots in 20th-century parenting books, which warned against coddling children or smothering them with too much love. As far back as the 1920s, experts warned parents that if they wanted their children to grow up self-reliant and fearless, they should dole out affection sparingly.

**The tide turned in the 1960s when psychologists Mary Ainsworth and John Bowlby published studies that proved the importance of parent-child bonding.** By studying infants raised in orphanages and institutions, they showed that babies and young children are not attached to their parents just for food and shelter. According to their research, children raised without a parent or an attachment figure—but with adequate food and shelter—had a much higher chance of stunted physical, emotional, and intellectual development.

Credited as the founders of attachment theory, Ainsworth and Bowlby also argued that **humans have attachment needs throughout their entire lives, not just as children.** Later research has continued to support this idea, with a slight twist: Unlike babies, adults benefit from having a supportive, nurturing relationship even when their "supporter" isn't physically available to them. Adults can thrive with just the knowledge that someone is there for them psychologically and emotionally.

### Self-Help That Hurts, Not Helps

Despite this research, many adults still subscribe to the outdated ideology that they shouldn't rely too much on their partners. **Our society’s overarching message is to strive for independence in all things, even our relationships.** We're told that what's most important is knowing how to satisfy our own needs and self-soothe.

This is partly due to the **codependency myth,** which gained momentum in the late 20th century. If you're involved in a relationship with someone who suffers from substance abuse, self-reliance, independence, and strong boundaries may be your salvation. You don't want to depend on a partner with addiction problems, and you don't want to assist them in their addiction.

**But while codependency theory makes good sense for relationships in which one party is an addict, it's counterproductive when applied to other kinds of relationships.** The notion of maintaining strict boundaries with our romantic partner defies human biology and brain wiring.

### Reality Check: We Are Wired for Attachment

Not only is your mental health affected by the quality of your partnership, your physical health is as well. **Studies have proven that being in proximity to your romantic partner changes your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and hormone levels.** If you're in a relationship, you can't choose to be independent because biologically, you're not.

**The research:** At the University of Virginia, Dr. James Coan proved that relationships affect our emotions. In one study, he told married women that they would receive a mild electrical shock while he scanned their brains in an MRI machine. The women were divided into three groups: those who had to undergo the scan and shock alone, those who could hold a stranger's hand during the experiment, and those who could hold their husband's hand during the experiment. Not surprisingly, the latter group experienced much less stress than the other two groups. Their brain scans showed almost no activity in the hypothalamus, the region of the brain that registers stress. The hand-holding husbands were "helping" the women on a physiological level.

Researchers at the University of Toronto found more evidence of our physiological connection to our partners. **Their studies showed a correlation between blood pressure and marital happiness—or discord.** Study participants with high blood pressure who considered their marriages to be happy and satisfying actually experienced lower blood pressure when their spouses were present. The opposite was also true: Participants with unhappy marriages experienced elevated blood pressure when their spouses were present.

Psychologist John Bowlby posited that **this "merging" of physiological responses is an evolutionary adaptation.** After all, if a predator is chasing you, it's safer to have someone near you who senses the threat just like you do and will help respond to the emergency.

The conclusion? Romantic attachments don't just happen in our heads and hearts. Our whole body responds.

### How Children Find Courage to Face Unknowns

Even though attachment theory now acknowledges there are many factors that determine adult attachment styles, it’s still worth examining the importance of the parent-child bond. After all, our relationship with our parents as infants is our first experience of relying on other human beings.

**The research:** Psychologist Mary Ainsworth advanced the science of parent-child attachment through a study known as the "strange situation test," proving that having an attachment figure close by creates a "secure base" for a child. In her study, she placed a mother and her child in the same unfamiliar room that was filled with toys. When mother and child were together, the child felt secure enough to explore the room and play with whatever toys he or she found. But when the mother left the room, the child became distraught. A research assistant would try to appease the child by offering more toys, but the child wasn't reassured by a stranger. Only when the mother returned did the child relax and start playing again. Ainsworth postulated that this "secure base" is a requirement for children to explore and develop.

### Adults Need a Secure Base, Too

Researchers expanded on Ainsworth's studies and discovered that adults are not all that different from a small child in an unfamiliar room full of toys. When adults feel secure, they can take on the world's challenges with confidence. **Adults face "strange situations" every day, but if they have a secure base, they have a better chance to thrive.** A secure base helps adults deal with the ups and downs of their careers, nourish relationships with their family and friends, enjoy their hobbies and interests, and pursue their goals, even if they experience setbacks along the way. Unfortunately, when adults don't have a secure base, they can falter.

The bottom line: We need the reassurance of our adult attachment figures (i.e. romantic partners) in order to focus on challenging tasks and succeed in our goals. **Having a partner who provides a "secure base" and makes us feel safe—one who knows how to reassure us in challenging situations—allows us to be our bravest selves.**

**The research:** At Carnegie Mellon University, researchers have studied the way that adult partners offer support to each other. In a lab setting, partners discuss their individual goals with each other. Afterward, they are led into separate rooms to answer questions about how the discussion went. Not surprisingly, those who believed their partners were genuinely interested in their goals had higher self-esteem and thought they had a better chance of achieving their goals than those whose partners were less supportive or interested.

**This doesn't mean that you and your partner must be joined at the hip.** In fact, it's the opposite. Knowing that you have a partner who "has your back" will actually make you more independent, more willing to take risks, and more capable of stepping out bravely into the world.
