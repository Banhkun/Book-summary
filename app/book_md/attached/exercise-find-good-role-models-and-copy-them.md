## Exercise: Find Good Role Models and Copy Them

Security priming is role-modeling how secure people interact and behave. To behave like a more secure partner, emulate people you know who have a comfortable and secure way of dealing with their romantic partner.

* * *

Name two people you know who you think have secure relationships with their partners.

Come up with four real-world examples of how those two people behave in their intimate partnership—two examples for each person. (For example, “Bob calls his wife Sue during his lunch break every day and they chat for 15 minutes” or “Bob always attends Sue’s hockey games and cheers her on”)

Now make a list of three ways you might be able to emulate your two role models’ behavior.
