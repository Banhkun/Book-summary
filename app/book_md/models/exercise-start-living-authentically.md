## Exercise: Start Living Authentically

Now that you’ve learned how to develop inner confidence by living authentically, you must start living authentically. In this exercise, you’ll decide where and how to start.

* * *

Manson suggests that there are three keys to living authentically and thus attracting women: Develop a satisfying life, overcome your worries regarding women, and express yourself appropriately. Describe how you’re doing in each of these areas. For example, you might be happy with your current life and regularly pursue women but struggle to sustain a long conversation.

Review your answer to the previous question. Which area, if you improved it, would have the greatest impact on your love life? (Note: Remember that Manson argues that developing a satisfying life is the most important part of improving your success with women. So if you’re unhappy with your general lifestyle, you should improve this area first.)

What would succeeding in this area look like for you? For example, if you’re unhappy with your current life because you hate your job, success might look like finding a fulfilling career. Alternatively, if you struggle to sustain good conversations, success might look like having an hour-long conversation with a woman at a bar.

Plan on doing something _today_ to move you toward your vision of success, and write it down below. If you want to find a fulfilling career, you might write, “After work today, I’ll review job postings in my area.” If you want to improve your conversation skills, you might write, “After work today, I’ll practice talking for one minute about my childhood.”
