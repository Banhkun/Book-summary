## 1-Page Summary

In the modern world, how can a heterosexual man successfully attract women? In _Models_ , self-help guru Mark Manson’s first book, **Manson argues that the key lies in “non-neediness,” or inner confidence** : Women desire a man whose sense of self-worth depends on how he judges himself rather than how others judge him.

Known for books like _The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck_ , Manson initially gained the attention of other men due to his success in seducing women using traditional pick-up techniques. These men started to ask Manson for advice just as Manson was realizing that these techniques, while useful, weren’t necessarily healthy. Dissatisfied with these techniques and wishing to understand more about _why_ women liked him, Manson started to study dating. Eventually, he concluded that men were struggling to succeed with women partly because they lacked “models” that taught them _how_ to do so—and so he wrote _Models_ to help them.

(Shortform note: Many viewed _Models_ as Manson’s attempt to transition from the pick-up community to a more mainstream audience. Some found this transition distasteful, arguing that Manson decried pick-up techniques despite the fact that these were the techniques he’d originally used to win over women and his promotion of these techniques made him famous.)

The book teaches you how to attract and have sex with women based on those models. In this guide, you’ll first learn what inner confidence is. Then, you’ll learn how to develop the three essential keys to attracting women: cultivating a satisfying life, overcoming your worries, and being vulnerable. These keys will help you in _all_ stages of your relationships—even if you’re not heterosexual or male. Along the way, you’ll discover how Manson’s recommendations compare to advice from other dating experts.

(Shortform note: Though Manson mentions that the book can help _everyone_ in _all_ stages of relationships, his advice is primarily geared toward straight men who want to attract and have sex with women instead of those who want a long-term relationship. Our guide reflects this.)

### Understanding Inner Confidence

According to Manson, **women desire men who embody “non-neediness** ,” or inner confidence—in other words, a man whose sense of self-worth depends on how _he_ judges himself, rather than how others judge him.

Manson emphasizes that inner confidence doesn’t mean that you totally disregard others’ judgments. Rather, it means that you care _more_ about your own opinion than that of others. When dating, this manifests in a **willingness to adjust your behavior as much as the woman does** —but no more. You’re focused on how _you_ feel about a woman, so you’re not willing to change your behavior excessively to accommodate her. In contrast, an unconfident man bends over backward for the woman he desires because he needs her approval in order to feel good about himself.****

> **Another Reason You Shouldn't Adjust Your Behavior**
> 
> In _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Richard Cooper also warns against adjusting your behavior too much to match a woman’s desires—but for different reasons. Like Manson, Cooper contends that women desire men who express confidence. However, Cooper specifies that women intensely desire “alpha” men, who are able to support and lead their woman in the relationship.
> 
> Cooper explains that, throughout your relationship, your woman will subconsciously and regularly test you to see whether you’ll assert your power. If you do, she’ll continue seeing you as a high-status “alpha.” But if you adjust your behavior too often and acquiesce to her whims, she’ll start to see you as a lower-status “beta”—and eventually, she’ll lose her attraction to you.

That said, Manson emphasizes that you must actually _be_ confident—you can’t fake it. Most modern dating advice teaches men to _portray_ themselves as confident. For example, they might recommend waiting three days before texting a woman back to give her the impression that you’re busy (even though you’re not). However, this advice usually backfires in the long run. Initially, you might successfully convince a woman that you don’t care that much about her opinion and thus attract her. But eventually, you’ll inevitably express behavior that demonstrates that you actually care much more about her opinion than you’ve let on—which will lead her to lose her attraction to you.

> **Another Reason Faking Confidence Could Backfire**
> 
> In _TheSix Pillars of Self-Esteem_, Nathaniel Branden suggests an alternate reason you shouldn’t fake confidence: doing so can actually make you _less_ confident. Like Manson, Branden contends that if you have self-esteem (or confidence), you believe in your own capability and have a strong sense of self-worth that doesn’t depend on the judgment of others. Branden adds that your self-esteem depends on your behavior: Behaving in ways that reflect capability and a sense of worth improves your self-esteem; behaving in ways that don’t reflect either lowers your self-esteem.
> 
> Branden implies that acting in a manner incongruous with your beliefs lowers your self-esteem because it demonstrates poor judgment: You aren’t acting in a way that reflects what you believe, which suggests that you don’t trust your own capability. So if you fake confidence with a woman, you risk not only losing her (once she discovers that you’re unconfident) but also missing chances with future women because you develop even lower self-esteem.

### How Inner Confidence Helps You With Women

Now that you’ve learned what inner confidence is and why women like it, how can it help you attract women?

First, Manson explains that inner confidence attracts women because it signals that you are “high-status,” or high-value, which women find attractive. Women evolved to desire high-value men because the higher the man’s value, the better he could provide for his offspring.

Back when the factors we use today to gauge a man’s value—like money—didn’t exist, women gauged a man’s value based on his confidence. In hierarchical tribal societies, low-value men _had_ to care about what (higher-value) others thought of them to ensure their survival. Conversely, high-value men were able to disregard most others’ opinions. Therefore, in the modern day, if you’re unconcerned with others’ opinions, a woman perceives you as high-value; if you’re concerned with their opinions, she perceives you as low-value.

> **What Evolutionary Psychologists Say About What Women Want**
> 
> Among evolutionary psychologists, the idea that women evolved to desire higher-value men because they could provide better for their offspring is known as the “evolved preferences theory.” Most proponents of this theory argue that women evolved this preference because they were unable to get resources on their own. They also argue that women gauged a man’s value based on his proven ability to acquire resources, like food, instead of on his confidence.
> 
> However, some psychologists believe in “social roles theory,” which posits that women started to desire men who could provide them with greater resources _after_ the advent of agriculture. They assert that when humans evolved distinctly human characteristics, we were still hunter-gatherers. In such a society, female gatherers found and provided most of the resources (the food)—so there would have been no evolutionary advantage for men who could acquire good resources (since women were the ones gathering those resources anyway). It wasn’t until humans developed agriculture that women started to depend more on their mates for food—which was when they started to prefer men with more resources.
> 
> Based on social roles theory, Manson’s contention that a woman gauges your value based solely on your confidence would be false; you would need to have actual resources (like money) in order to attract a woman.

Second, Manson explains that by developing inner confidence, you’ll more efficiently build deeper connections with the women you desire. When you develop confidence, you’re able to view rejection as a benefit: If one woman rejects you, it only means they wouldn’t have been a good match, and you now have the chance to find someone who is.

(Shortform note: Manson focuses primarily on why you should view being rejected by women you’re _trying_ to date as a benefit. In _How to Not Die Alone_ , Logan Ury adds that you should adopt a similar perspective if a woman you’re _already_ dating rejects you, explaining that reframing your breakup positively will help you recover faster. Specifically, Ury recommends writing a diary listing both what’s good about the breakup and what was negative about the relationship.)

When you don’t fear rejection, you’re more willing to “polarize,” or push women into deciding how they feel about you, which Manson argues is the key to male dating strategy. You’ll inevitably encounter some women who are clearly disinterested (whom you should ignore) and some who clearly desire you (whom you should approach).

However, most of the women you meet will be initially “neutral,” or lukewarm in their feelings toward you—in other words, she doesn’t know yet if she likes you. But if she _remains_ lukewarm too long, she’ll likely grow disinterested. So whenever you meet such a woman, you should push her out of that mindset by doing something that makes her immediately decide whether or not she’s interested—like asking for her number.

(Shortform note: _Mating in Captivity _author Esther Perel warns that it’s not just women who are lukewarm toward you who might grow disinterested; a woman with whom you’re in a committed relationship may also lose her attraction to you. Perel attributes this loss to the institutionalized nature of commitment: Typically, when women commit to men, they start to inhabit social roles that revolve around others—like wife or mother. But Perel contends that women are most aroused by being desired, which requires that they focus solely on themselves. So if a woman is, for example, a man’s wife, she struggles to temporarily set aside that role—and so she doesn’t desire him.)

Manson explains that pushing has two main benefits: First, it demonstrates confidence—so doing it to a lukewarm woman ups the chances that she’ll grow interested. Second, pushing improves your efficiency: If the lukewarm woman decides she _doesn’t_ like you, she’ll let you know quickly—and then you can move on to finding and building a connection with someone else.

> **Pushing: An Alternate Perspective**
> 
> Like Manson, in _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Cooper writes that you’ll meet some women who are clearly uninterested, some who are neutral, and some who are interested (your “promoters”). Cooper also agrees that you should ignore women who are clearly uninterested.
> 
> Unlike Manson, Cooper doesn’t recommend pushing a neutral woman to prompt her to decide whether she likes you. This is because, according to Cooper, you can only get women to like you by _being_ attractive. You can’t turn a neutral woman into your promoter by merely altering your approach (such as by pushing and asking for her number); you’d have to _become_ more __ attractive by improving yourself. Therefore, Cooper recommends that you approach only your promoters; ignore neutral women, who won’t be interested in you unless you significantly improve your own attractiveness by, for example, spending months in the gym.

### How to Develop Confidence: Live Authentically

So how do you actually _become_ confident? Manson argues that **you must grow comfortable with vulnerability** , which he defines as the ability to courageously live according to your own truth. When you’re comfortable with vulnerability, you’re willing to express yourself despite the risk that others may not approve. In this way, you demonstrate that you care more about your own judgment than you do about others’ and thus embody confidence.

To develop vulnerability, Manson explains that you must force yourself into situations that make you vulnerable. You can do this by living “honestly,” or authentically: When you’re living by your own truth, you’re automatically vulnerable because you’re presenting your authentic self to the world despite any potential negative consequences. In other words, you only develop the ability to live according to your own truth by _actually_ living according to your own truth.

> **How Manson’s Ideas Relate to Other Experts’ Ideas of Vulnerability**
> 
> In _Daring Greatly_ , Brené Brown likewise asserts that you must grow comfortable with vulnerability, which she also defines as the courage to express yourself honestly. However, she doesn’t recommend that you do so in order to build confidence. Rather, Brown explains that vulnerability is an essential element of “wholehearted living,” which is characterized by behaviors or beliefs that facilitate meaningful connection and growth. To live wholeheartedly, we must overcome our fear that we’re not worthy of connection and belonging—but we can only do that by being vulnerable.
> 
> So _how_ do you practice being vulnerable? Instead of recommending that you force yourself into situations that promote vulnerability, Brown recommends that you learn techniques for dismantling whatever armor you use to prevent showing your authentic self to others. The dismantling technique you use will depend on what type of armor you use to protect yourself.
> 
> For example, you might resort to “numbing,” or reaching for anything—like alcohol—that will allow you to escape from pain. If so, Brown suggests that you practice mindfulness: Be present with your feelings and allow yourself to notice without judgment that you’re engaging in numbing behaviors. When you’re able to notice these behaviors in the moment, you then have the ability to make a new choice.

In this section, we’ll discuss Manson’s three keys to living authentically: Develop a satisfying life, overcome your worries, and learn to express yourself well.

#### Key #1: Develop a Satisfying Life

According to Manson, the first key to living authentically is to **develop a baseline life that satisfies you**. This means that you know what you desire out of life and are actively working toward making those desires a reality.

Manson explains that developing such a life is critical for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates confidence because your life is a reflection of _your_ desires instead of _others_ ’. For example, instead of living in a town you hate because your parents want you close by, you live in a town you love.

(Shortform note: In _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_ , Branden suggests that taking responsibility is an essential element of self-esteem—and his definition of taking responsibility is similar to what Manson defines as a baseline life that satisfies you. Branden argues that when you take responsibility, you understand that you’re in control of pursuing and manifesting your desires, and you’re actively working toward them. Branden adds that unless you take responsibility and don’t let others dictate what you do, you can’t have good self-esteem.)

Second, the baseline life you have determines the kind of women you’ll attract. Manson argues that **you meet and attract women who are similar to you**. For example, if you’re a couch potato, you’re unlikely to meet or draw the attention of a fitness nut. Even if you do meet at a bar and start a conversation because you’re physically attracted to each other, you won’t have enough in common to sustain a relationship. Therefore, if you want to meet and attract high-value women, you have to become a high-value man.

(Shortform note: Studies bear out Manson’s contention that similarity matters when dating—but only to a degree. Similarity boosts romantic attraction, although psychologists differ on why this is: Some believe that dating someone like you is simply more enjoyable; others suggest that the more similar you are to someone, the more you assume they’ll like you, and so the more you like them. However, similarity doesn’t affect the happiness of your relationship long-term: Having a partner who likes the same things you do accounts for less than 1% of your relationship satisfaction.)

##### Become Physically Desirable

First, you must **become physically desirable** to the women you want. Start by focusing on your wardrobe: Wear coordinated clothes that fit you well, since these will make you look polished and presentable. These clothes should match your lifestyle; a city slicker in hiking boots looks ridiculous. Then, review your diet and gym routine. Exercising regularly and cutting out junk food from your diet will improve your looks quickly.

(Shortform note: In _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Richard Cooper makes more specific recommendations regarding how to make yourself more physically desirable to women. Even clothes that match your lifestyle and each other won’t look good unless they’re fitted, so look for clothes that include some spandex and are labeled “fitted.” And when improving your fitness via diet and exercise, aim for a 1.62 ratio between your shoulder width and your hip width; this is the proportion that most women find attractive.)

Manson suggests that changing how you carry yourself and how you speak will also improve your physical attractiveness. When you walk, you should straighten your back, keep your head up, and look people in the eye. When you speak, you should lower your voice, slow your speech, and raise your volume: People should be able to hear you easily.

(Shortform note: Why does changing your posture and how you speak make you more attractive? It may be because both convey greater confidence. In _12 Rules for Life_ , Jordan Peterson suggests that changing your body language—such as by straightening your back and keeping your head up—signals to others that you’re higher-status, and so they’ll treat you accordingly. Similarly, other experts add that lowering your voice, slowing your speech, and raising your volume all convey greater confidence—partly because they imply greater authority.)

##### Develop Your Own Interests

Second, you must **develop your own interests**. Manson emphasizes that attractive men have rich lives. Not only do they have varied hobbies, but they also know _why_ they like what they like because they developed their tastes on their own instead of inheriting them from their friends. So expose yourself to various pursuits—and as you do so, think critically about __ why you like (or dislike) each one.

(Shortform note: In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam also recommends exposing yourself to various pursuits. However, she doesn’t recommend this in the context of attracting women—rather, Vanderkam recommends that you try many different things so that you can discover what you most enjoy and can thus fill your time pursuing whatever’s meaningful to you. Specifically, Vanderkam suggests that you create a list of 100 things to do before you die, and then that you start doing anything cheap and easy from the list. The more things you try, the more you’ll discover what you like and why you like it—and the better able you’ll be to spend time on things that matter to you.)

When you’ve cultivated a rich life and various interests, think about the kind of woman you want and how to meet her. Manson recommends that you envision your ideal woman: What is she like, and where does she hang out? Then review your own interests: Which hobby of yours could you pursue in a way that helps you meet the women you want? For example, if you like to read and want a well-read woman, you could join a book club.

(Shortform note: Manson assumes that your ideal woman shares your hobbies. But in _How to Not Die Alone_, Ury explains that sharing hobbies is not an important component of a successful long-term relationship—as long as you both allow each other to pursue your own interests independently. Rather, Ury recommends that you look for women who complement you. For example, if you’re an introvert, look for someone who’ll pull you out of your shell.)

Once you’ve discovered how to pursue this hobby, start doing so and **become a leader in that environment**. Manson explains that, by nature, humans view you as higher-status if others _also_ view you as high-status. However, this status is environment-dependent. For example, a famous Chinese celebrity might walk unknown through the streets of San Francisco—until he arrives in Chinatown, where people recognize him. So if you want the women you like to view you as high-status, you should take on a status-boosting position in the place where you meet them. Using our previous example, you wouldn’t just join the book club; you might become the guy who decides where the book club happens.

(Shortform note: If you’re a heterosexual woman trying to attract men using Manson’s advice, taking on a leadership position to boost your status within your hobby may have mixed results depending on your physical appearance. Studies suggest that men’s interest in fairly attractive women decreases if those women are high-status. However, men’s interest in extremely attractive women increases if those women are high-status.)

#### Key #2: Overcome Your Worries

The second key to living authentically, according to Manson, is to **overcome your worries about pursuing women and then actively pursue them.** When you don’t pursue a woman because you’re worried she’ll reject you, you embody non-confidence: You’re prioritizing her potential judgment of you instead of acting on your own truth (your desire to approach her). In contrast, by actively pursuing a woman, you embody confidence: You’re acting on your own truth—even if you’re afraid that she’ll reject you.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck_ , Manson adds that overcoming your fear of rejection is helpful not just when pursuing a woman but also once you’ve entered into a committed relationship with one. Manson asserts that in a healthy relationship, both partners prioritize being honest with each other; in other words, they both act on their own truths and embody confidence, and they’re comfortable with both saying and hearing “no.” While this rejection can result in hurt feelings, this pain is short-lived because both partners care about each other enough to work through the difficulty together.)

Manson warns that if you _don’t_ overcome these worries, you’ll likely handle them in a potentially problematic way. Notably, you might hold women responsible for your fear, which can create damaging prejudices. For example, if you’re afraid to speak to women, you might fool yourself into thinking that the reason you don’t talk to women is that all women are too stupid to talk to you. Alternatively, you might tell yourself that you don’t know how to talk to women yet and need to learn more flirting tips—which prevents you from practicing and improving your real-life skills. For example, you’ll read yet another dating book instead of going on Tinder.

> **Incel Psychology: The Risk of Not Overcoming Your Worries**
> 
> If your fear prevents you from actively pursuing women and you’re trying to learn more about how to approach them online, you might come across the incel community. “Incels,” or involuntary celibates, believe that they weren’t born physically attractive and are thus unable to have sexual relationships with women.
> 
> These men assume that women _only_ sleep with physically attractive men, that other qualities like kindness don't attract women, and moreover, that their own levels of physical attractiveness are fixed and not improvable. As a result, they blame women for their lack of sexual prowess and don’t try to date them because they think they’ll be rejected anyway. Incels sometimes go to extremes: Many self-identified incels have committed mass murder.

That said, overcoming these worries doesn’t necessitate that you get rid of them entirely. As Manson points out, worry is a normal emotion that you’ll never eradicate. Rather, to build confidence, you must learn to act _despite_ any worry you might feel. Each time you do so, you’ll become a little bit braver.

For example, if you ask a woman you’ve never met out on Instagram, you should write, “I know this is a little weird, but do you want to meet in person sometime?”’

> **Why Acting Despite Your Worry Might Make You Braver**
> 
> In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman elaborates on why acting despite your worry might make you braver. Goleman explains that worry exists because it’s beneficial: Worrying helps you come up with solutions by anticipating danger before it occurs. This is why it’s tough to simply stop worrying—your rational brain sees _why_ worrying is good and so wants you to continue doing so.
> 
> Therefore, Goleman states that you must actively challenge your worries by asking yourself questions like, “Is this dreaded event probable?”. It’s possible that acting despite your worry also constitutes a challenge to those worries: You prove to your brain that your worry wasn’t useful—and so you’re less likely to worry when you take a similar action in the future.

##### How to Act Despite Your Worry

So how do you get yourself to act despite your worry? Manson suggests that the first step to overcoming these worries is to **identify exactly what scares you**. The most damaging fear is the fear of approaching a woman because unless you can speak to a woman, you’ll never forge an intimate connection with her. However, you may be scared of other things, like asking her out once you’ve gotten her number.

(Shortform note: The _Factfulness_ authors argue that fear depends on both your risk and exposure, and so you can reduce your fear by evaluating the likelihood of your feared outcome actually happening. So after identifying exactly what scares you, consider also identifying your worst-case scenario and how likely that scenario is to happen. For example, your worst-case scenario when approaching a woman or asking her out might be that she tells you that you’re gross and that she was never interested in you—but most people are polite enough not to do that. By acknowledging that your worst-case scenario is unlikely to happen, you’ll lessen your fear.)

Second, **select the tiniest possible version of the thing that scares you.** Repeat this tiny thing daily until it’s not hard, then make it slightly harder—until you eventually work up to doing the major thing that scares you. For example, say you’re scared of having conversations with women. Instead of trying to force yourself to talk, make a goal to simply smile at three women each day. Once you grow comfortable with that, add just one sentence, like “Have a nice day!” when speaking with, say, a female barista. Slowly work up to adding more sentences until you’re comfortable with a full-blown conversation.

(Shortform note: Manson’s description of how to overcome your worries is similar to how BJ Fogg recommends that you develop a habit in _Tiny Habits_. Like Manson, Fogg suggests that you identify an impactful behavior and make it completely unintimidating by selecting its tiniest possible version. Fogg recommends that you repeat this behavior daily until it’s not hard, and then expand it slightly. Unlike Manson, Fogg suggests that you celebrate each time you successfully perform the tiny behavior—a habit you may want to adopt each time you successfully do the tiny thing that scares you. When you celebrate your success, you feel good—and your brain notes and reinforces any actions it performed before feeling good.)

#### Key #3: Express Yourself Well

According to Manson, the third key to living authentically is to “communicate honestly,” or to **express yourself well**. Manson suggests that this is a two-part process. First, you must be _authentically_ vulnerable. Second, you must convey that vulnerability effectively.

Why does authentic vulnerability matter? As we learned earlier, women gauge your value based on your confidence. Manson explains that, to judge your confidence, women decide whether you’re expressing vulnerability—which they do by reading your “intentions,” or objective. If your objective matches your behavior, she’ll trust you when you convey your attraction to her and so will be willing to explore it. But if your objective _doesn’t_ match your behavior, she’ll notice this mismatch and grow distrustful of you—so when you convey your attraction to her, she’ll feel unsafe and want to leave. Therefore, if you try to communicate vulnerability—but your true objective is to sleep with her—you’ll turn her off.

(Shortform note: Studies support Manson’s contention that women are innately able to read your objective and determine whether you’re being authentically vulnerable. Studies suggest that women are better at mentalizing, which is the ability to judge what another person is thinking, and that they’re better at empathy, which is the ability to judge what another person is feeling. Studies also support Manson’s contention that it matters that people perceive you as authentic: People judge men as more physically attractive when told that those men are honest.)

However, Manson notes, it’s not enough to be authentically vulnerable; you must _also_ be able to convey yourself effectively. Miscommunications happen in all situations—romantic and otherwise. But if you’re able to convey your attraction effectively, you minimize the chances that a woman misinterprets you and maximize your chances of building a deeper connection with her.

(Shortform note: In _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_ , John Gray suggests that learning to communicate well is essential not just when _trying_ to date a woman but also during the relationship because nearly all relationship problems stem from communication errors. Gray asserts that this is because men tend to communicate information, while women tend to communicate feelings—and so men must learn to interpret the literal request behind the woman's feelings. For example, he must learn to recognize that when she says, “We never go on dates anymore,” she really means, “Will you take me out to dinner again soon?”)

So how can you express yourself well? Manson suggests several techniques for the

four stages of attracting a woman: the introduction stage, the conversation stage, the dating stage, and the physical intimacy stage.

##### 1\. The Introduction Stage

Manson recommends that you calmly walk up to her from the front (you don’t want to scare her). Smile and**introduce yourself with a simple opening line** , like “I’m X. I think you’re hot so I wanted to say hi.” Don’t stress over the exact words! At this stage, she’s merely deciding whether you’re confident and have an honorable objective; a needlessly complicated line will make you seem unconfident and seedy. If women regularly don’t give you the time of day at the introduction stage, something’s wrong. Double-check that your objective is honorable, that you’re expressing confidence in your approach, and that you look good.

(Shortform note: Manson assumes that you’re introducing yourself to a woman in person—but how do you introduce yourself to a woman you’ve matched with online? In _How to Not Die Alone_ , Ury warns against simple opening lines because they’re too generic: Women are more apt to ignore lines like, “I think you’re hot so I wanted to say hi,” that you could have sent to anybody on your list. Instead, Ury recommends that you send a message that sparks conversation by highlighting something you’ve read on her profile. And if you’re constantly getting ignored online, it may not have anything to do with your individual choices: For example, as Ury notes, Asian men have a much harder time dating online than do men of other races.)

##### 2\. The Conversation Stage

To converse well with a woman, Manson suggests that you master three main skills. The first skill is sharing information about yourself. To grow comfortable with sharing information about yourself, practice talking for a minute about several topics on which you two are likely to connect—such as your background or your future goals.

The second skill is getting her to share information about herself. Manson suggests that you learn to **make declarations** instead of asking questions. For example, don’t ask where she’s from; guess where she’s from based on an observation. By doing so, you practically guarantee that the conversation continues. If you’re wrong, she’ll correct you or ask why you guessed that; if you’re right, she’ll be impressed and want to know how you got it right. Making declarations also allows you to direct the conversation with potentially off-topic statements, which helps ensure that the conversation doesn’t stop because you can’t think of a new question.

The first and second skills help you because they provide you with more opportunities to find something in common and increase the intimacy between you.

> **More Ways to Foster an Emotional Connection**
> 
> In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Leil Lowndes provides further tips for fostering an emotional connection with someone so that you can reveal more about yourselves to each other and thus find greater commonality and intimacy. When preparing answers to common questions, like those that ask about your background or goals, include not just the answer but also an interesting fact or observation that fosters conversation: For example, you might say, “I'm from X, where they make the best goat cheese in the world.”
> 
> Instead of recommending that you make declarations about someone, as Manson does, Lowndes recommends that you ask questions to continue the conversation. If you’re worried that you’ll run out of things to talk about, Lowndes suggests that you prepare in advance by listening to the news (so that you have common topics to discuss) and that you continually try new activities (which will improve your ability to communicate with different kinds of people).
> 
> During the conversation, Lowndes recommends that you ask questions about how they spend their time, listen to their answer, then express how much you enjoyed listening to them and relate your interest to theirs. By doing so, you’ll signal that you’re interested in who they are and what they like—so they’ll like you more.

The third skill is showcasing your sense of humor. This conveys that you’re confident enough to laugh without obsessing over others’ opinions. People enjoy different types of humor, so just try to be funny in the way that _you_ think is funny—for example, some people enjoy sarcastic comments, while others enjoy puns. Focus on finding a woman whose sense of humor complements yours rather than trying to convince someone else that you’re funny. If you’re not funny, study famous comics to improve your ability to make women laugh.

> **Why and How to Be Funny**
> 
> Like Manson, other experts agree that humor is essential to the relationship but for different reasons. In _How to Not Die Alone_ , Ury recommends that you make your partner laugh not because it shows confidence but because laughter creates oxytocin, a hormone that encourages connection. And while experts agree that you should focus on finding a woman whose sense of humor complements yours, they clarify that doing so bodes well for your long-term romantic future: The happiest couples share a sense of humor and are able to laugh at the same things.
> 
> This is true even if neither partner is a huge jokester—but if you do want to be funnier, try studying not just famous comics but also how humor works: Psychologists have found that people who can explain why something is humorous tend to be funnier.

##### 3\. The Dating Stage

After a successful conversation, you can move on to the dating stage, which begins when you **ask a woman for her phone number**. Manson notes that some women will give you their phone number but not respond to or go out with you—either because they’re not genuinely interested or for other reasons (like they’re busy at work that week). You can reduce the possibility of getting the number of a woman who’s not interested by only asking for her contact information if she seems to like you—which she’ll demonstrate via signs like stroking her hair or paying more attention to you than to her friends. But after your first meeting, it’s hard to tell whether she’s lost interest or she’s genuinely distracted.

Therefore, Manson recommends giving every woman three chances. After meeting someone, message her within 24 hours to say it was nice to meet her. The following day, text something relevant to your previous conversation. Build a little rapport if you can, but focus on scheduling a date. If she blows you off at any point (such as by not texting back or missing a date), you can try again (like by texting again)—but if she does so three times in total, move on to someone else.

> **How to Tell if A Woman You Met Online Likes You**
> 
> Manson’s recommendations assume that you meet the woman in person. How can you tell if a woman you matched with online is genuinely interested? In _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Cooper suggests that one clue is whether she gives you her phone number: If she does, she’s interested, but if she tries to give you an alternate form of communication or keep the conversation on the dating app, she doesn’t intensely desire you and you should move on. The second clue is how far she’s willing to travel to meet you: A woman who intensely desires you will at least be willing to meet you halfway.
> 
> After your first date, Cooper recommends you pay attention to her behavior. A woman who intensely desires you will have sex with you quickly, go out of her way to meet you, and respond to texts within a reasonable time frame. If she doesn’t, she doesn’t intensely desire you, and you shouldn’t waste your time on her—in other words, don’t give her three chances, give her zero.

Assuming you do successfully schedule a date, how should you proceed? On your first date, Manson suggests that you **schedule four to six consecutive activities** —most of which involve something active and opportunities to touch. For example, you might get hot chocolate, walk through a holiday market, go ice skating, then grab donuts. The more activities you do with someone, the greater intimacy you build—and the greater your chances of having sex. You can also improve your chances of having sex by scheduling your date at night and doing the activities close to either your or her place.

> **How Other Experts Suggest That You Approach a First Date**
> 
> Other experts have different recommendations regarding how to proceed on your first date. Like Manson, Logan Ury argues that you should try to build intimacy on the first date. However, instead of scheduling several different activities that allow for movement and touching, Ury suggests that you do something creative together: You’ll have fun and learn whether your date has qualities that make them a good long-term candidate—like whether they persist despite challenges.
> 
> Conversely, in _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Cooper recommends that you don’t try to build intimacy on the first date. Rather, Cooper argues that the first date is for determining whether you have a connection and whether you like her at all; you can start trying to build intimacy later. That said, Cooper assumes that you met the woman online (a topic Manson doesn’t cover), so consider following Cooper’s recommendations for women you meet online and Manson’s for women you meet in person.

##### 4\. The Physical Intimacy Stage

If the date is going well, how do you take things further physically? Manson explains that **women are turned on by being _wanted_**. Therefore, it’s essential that you demonstrate how much you want her by touching her. So take the lead and push forward unless she asks you to slow down or stop (or is clearly incapable of doing so because she’s incapacitated in some way).

Manson recommends that you **start touching her during the conversation stage**. Start by touching the outer edge of her body (like her shoulder), and pay attention to how she responds. If she’s smiling a lot, looking at you, and putting herself nearer to you than she needs to be, she’s likely into you.

(Shortform note: When should you start touching a woman if you met her online (and thus skipped the pre-date conversation stage)? Experts warn against touching her too sexually on the first date, as this may make her think that you’re overly touchy and promiscuous. Instead, touch her only in ways that aren’t overtly sexual—for example, touch her lower back gently to guide her, but avoid wrapping your arm around her waist. And, as Manson says, pay attention to her reaction, since women differ on whether or not they like being touched on a first date: If she’s smiling a lot, looking at you, and putting herself close to you, she may like you, but that doesn’t guarantee that she wants to be touched.)

The next step is to **kiss her**. Manson explains that if she’s interested, she’ll likely touch you or purposefully manipulate the situation so that you’re alone together (such as suggesting that you get some air and leaving her friends in the bar). That said, men are mostly oblivious to female signals of desire—so if you do perceive that she’s open to you kissing her, she’s likely sent you several signals already and so you should just kiss her. When you kiss her, be gentle and caress the rest of her body as well. And if she turns the kiss down, ask why—she may not be ready or she may merely be uncomfortable with your location.

> **How to Gain Enthusiastic Consent**
> 
> Many modern daters operate on the principle of enthusiastic consent. This means that you assume that the answer is no unless she tells you yes (unlike Manson, who operates on the assumption that the answer is yes unless she tells you no). When you’re operating under the principle of enthusiastic consent, interpreting your date’s body language and cues (such as when she touches you or purposefully ensures that you’re alone together) is still important because it helps you decide whether to pursue the next step. However, when pursuing the next step, you must gain verbal consent _prior_ to initiating that step instead of going ahead and then stopping only if you perceive that she’s uncomfortable.
> 
> How can you gain enthusiastic consent and demonstrate how much you desire your date without making things awkward? Experts recommend that you ask assertively (instead of pausing or hesitating) and without interrupting whatever you’re currently doing. For example, if you’re massaging her shoulders, ask _during_ the massage to kiss her by saying, “I want to kiss you,” rather than, “Um, I was wondering, if I could, um, kiss you.”

Finally, **escalate kissing into sex**. Manson suggests that you start by touching her breasts—if she’s enthused, she likely is willing to have sex. To be good in bed, Manson suggests that you do three things. First, **during foreplay, create anticipation** , which will heighten her arousal: For example, brush your fingers against her nipples before pinching them. Second, **dominate her** : Giving up control turns women on. Try physically moving her around or talking explicitly about what you’re doing. Finally, **communicate with her** : Be open about what you like or dislike, and learn to laugh if things go awry. The better your communication, the more intimate you’ll feel—and the better sex you’ll have.

> **What Other Experts Say About Having Good Sex**
> 
> Experts differ on the effectiveness of Manson’s recommendations. In _She Comes First_ , Ian Kerner agrees that anticipation is essential for women to feel arousal and that touching her breasts and nipples can put her in the mood for sex. However, he recommends that you start building this anticipation before you start touching each other, such as by dropping hints throughout the day with sexy messages.
> 
> Similarly, while experts agree that many women like to be dominated, they suggest that the turn-on lies not in the losing of control but the gaining of it: In everyday life, women tend to fill specific societal roles, and surrendering control in the bedroom allows them to regain control of what role they want to play. Experts also warn against trying to dominate a woman by physically moving her or talking explicitly unless you gain clear consent first, as otherwise, you may risk damaging your relationship.
> 
> Finally, experts agree that communication and a sense of humor are essential to good sex: Studies suggest that couples who communicate about sex enjoy sex more. That said, be careful how you laugh during sex—laugh with your partner, not at them.
