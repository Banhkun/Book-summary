## Exercise: Understand Your Male-As-Default Mindset

Throughout this guide, we’ve learned how various institutions harm women—both deliberately and inadvertently—because they operate on a male-as-default mindset. In this exercise, we’ll examine the ways in which _you_ might be operating in a male-as-default mindset—and how you might start to question those assumptions.

* * *

As you read this guide, what examples of a male-as-default mindset did you recognize from your own thoughts and behaviors? For example, perhaps you regularly complain about a female coworker who leaves early to take care of her kids or you’ve always questioned whether women are harassed on public transportation because the statistics suggest otherwise. (Remember that since the male-as-default mindset is _societal_ , you likely have it even if you’re not a man.)

How has reading this guide affected how you feel now about these thoughts and behaviors? Do you still stand by them, or are there extenuating circumstances you may not have considered?

After reading this guide, what steps can you take to actively combat the male-as-default mindset in your life? For example, if you’re a manager, maybe you can be more understanding the next time a female employee needs to take an emergency day off because her child is sick.
