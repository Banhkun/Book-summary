## Introduction

In _Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right_ , **sociologist Arlie Hochschild seeks to understand the social, cultural, and emotional forces driving right-wing politics.** As a professor at UC Berkeley, famous for its tradition of left-wing activism, Hochschild recognizes the need to step outside of her liberal bubble and understand the world as American conservatives see it.

In an era of rising political polarization, Americans on both the left and the right increasingly see one another not as rivals, but as bitter enemies and even existential threats.**** By speaking with conservative Tea Party supporters living around Lake Charles in southwestern Louisiana, **Hochschild attempts to move past the partisan divide and approach American politics from a position of _empathy_ for those on the right.**

It is only by breaking down this empathy wall, that we can come to truly inhabit the emotional world of the right, giving us insight into _why_ these voters believe what they believe—and why those beliefs might make sense given these voters’ experiences. It is only by forging these points of connection and seeing the world from the perspective of those on the other side of the political divide that we can begin to overcome the widening chasm in American politics that threatens the very functioning of our democracy.

In this summary, we’ll make our journey across the empathy wall by exploring:

  * The paradox of white working-class conservative voters supporting the pro-corporate, anti-tax, and anti-environment agenda of the modern Republican Party—and how these policies often result in disastrous outcomes for such voters and the communities they cherish
  * How the support of rank-and-file Tea Party voters for such policies stems not from ignorance or greed, but rather, from their ingrained sense of honor, pride, and resentment at a liberal, secular culture that they feel disrespects them and their values
  * How institutions like industry, church, and conservative media (Fox News in particular) shape and order the moral universe conservatives inhabit—and how they resent what they perceive as the imposition of liberal moral values upon them
  * How white conservatives, especially men, feel that minorities, women, and immigrants have unfairly “cut in line” ahead of them on the path to the American Dream—and how they believe the federal government has taken the side of the line cutters
  * How cultural changes have left conservatives feeling isolated and alienated from the country they once knew—feeling like strangers in their own land
  * How liberals and conservatives can overcome the empathy wall and find common ground
