## Part 3: Honor and the Tea Party

In the last chapter, we discussed some of the core institutions that shape the right’s worldview and explored some of the deep stories—individual personal narratives that they _feel_ to be true—that underlie these voters’ political conservatism.

In this chapter, we’ll expand upon that analysis and explore a key theme that runs through much of right-wing politics: honor. By understanding their culture of honor, we can gain deep insight into how members of the right view themselves as losing status and position in the world—critical if we are to overcome the empathy wall and find common ground.

Specifically, we’ll explore:

  * The common belief among Tea Party supporters that undeserving “others” have cut in front of them in the line to the American Dream, something that greatly insults their sense of honor
  * The economic woes of many older, white working-class men, which contributes to their feelings of alienation and shame—and makes them highly receptive to right-wing politics
  * The perceived loss of cultural dominance felt by many white conservative Christians
  * How the struggle to maintain their honor in a hostile world leads conservatives to adopt a culture of endurance, which finds expression in a few unique ways



### Cutting in Line

**A major driver of the resentment felt by many Tea Party members is the belief that undeserving “others” have cut in front of them in the line to the American Dream.** The feeling of having one’s rightful position usurped stands as a tremendous insult to the honor and dignity of people who believe this.

These conservatives see themselves as having worked hard, sacrificed, and played by the rules their entire lives, only to be rewarded with stagnating wages, blocked opportunities, frustrated dreams, and, in the case of southwestern Louisiana, poisoned air and drinking water.

The Tea Party members—predominantly (although not exclusively) older, white, rural, Christian, native-born, and male—see an increasingly diverse, unrecognizable, and alien America usurping their rightful place at the front of the line. They see programs such as affirmative action, cash assistance, and higher education subsidies as taking _their_ hard-earned money and giving it away to provide unfair advantages to _other_ social groups—young people, African-Americans and Latin people, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and women.

**They feel left behind, isolated, and marginalized in a country that they believed was created by their hard work and sacrifice** —in other words, they are strangers in their own land, robbed of their deserved rewards.

#### Race and Sympathy Fatigue

**Although they deny harboring any personal racial animosity toward minorities, many Tea Party attitudes toward government redistribution programs are racially tinged.**

In her conversations with conservative Louisianans, Hochschild observes that, despite their professed innocence on racial matters, Tea Partiers do believe in a racial hierarchy—one in which white people (and white men, in particular) belong at the top. Their resentment at the “line cutting” phenomenon stems from their belief that this rightful position has been unfairly usurped. They see a media landscape that celebrates the glamorous lives and exploits of Black celebrities like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Serena Williams, while ignoring (when not downright denigrating) white working-class people.

**The figure of former President Barack Obama looms large in the racially inflected Tea Party narrative of unfair advantage.** They see the first African-American president as the line-cutter-in-chief, gleefully waving ahead the other non-white line cutters in his political coalition through his liberal tax-and-spend programs.

To Tea Partiers in Louisiana, Obama prioritized the takers over the makers (we discussed the “makers and takers” trope in Chapter 2).

These themes are amplified by conservative media like talk radio and Fox News, which focus on supposed “welfare queens” living a glamorous lifestyle on the government dime. This further contributes to the feelings of diminished honor. People on the right believe themselves to be suckers for working hard for a living, while _others_ are enjoying the luxurious benefits of government largesse.

**They proclaim “sympathy fatigue” when they hear about the supposed plight of immigrants and minorities**. For them, it is absurd to feel sympathy for people who’ve simply been handed every advantage in life, while _they_ have had to work and struggle for everything—and still find themselves falling behind.

Of course, these views are a distortion of reality, as Hochschild points out. Historically, Black people have been at the _back_ of the proverbial line, being “cut” in front of repeatedly by white people through the institutions of slavery, segregation, lynching, and discrimination, which stole their labor, dignity, and even their lives over the course of centuries. This legacy persists today when we look at the racial wealth gap—on average, Black households earn only 55 percent of what white households earn.

(Shortform note: To learn more about the Black wealth gap, read our summary of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s article “The Case for Reparations.”)

### Loss of Status

Closely tied to the idea that they are being displaced by line jumpers is the notion, popular among those on the right, that they are losing their once-privileged social status. White Christian men in particular (who comprise a disproportionate share of the Republican base) believe that they have lost their dominance in both the economic and cultural spheres.

#### Declining Wealth

While you may disagree with the political views espoused by Tea Party members, it is impossible to deny that **many white working-class people have indeed lost ground within the nation’s economic hierarchy.** To many, this certainly feels like they are being robbed of their just rewards.

People born after 1950 have, on average, seen their real incomes (wages when adjusted for inflation) steadily _decline_ as they get older, leading to an alarming downward mobility. This is the inverse of the fabled American Dream—people are doing _worse than_ the generation that preceded them.

This trend is especially true for people without a college education, as is the case with many Tea Partiers in southwestern Louisiana. Global economic developments have exacerbated this trend. Globalization has made it easy for large multinational corporations to export low-wage, low-skill manufacturing jobs overseas; moreover, automation greatly reduces the need for human workers.

Once-thriving communities across the United States have been hollowed out and destroyed, leading to economic misery and social decay. For a certain subset of white men, their inability to provide for themselves or their families is a deep source of emasculating shame. This affront to their honor leads them to cast about for someone to blame for their plight—and in their outrage and despair, they are increasingly drawn to far-right politics of resentment.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how the economic decline of America’s manufacturing sector has impacted white working-class communities, read our summary of JD Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and a Culture in Crisis.)

#### Loss of Cultural Dominance

**Many Tea Party supporters also bemoan their loss of cultural dominance** , with movies and television shows now appearing to cater exclusively to minorities, LGBTQ people, and non-binary people, while portraying non-traditional families in a positive light.

For them, there appears to be no more room in American pop culture for the traditional, white family. As rural white Southerners, people on the right in the Lake Charles area of Louisiana deeply resent demeaning media depictions of their communities as being filled with ignorant and racist “hicks” or “rednecks.”

Distressingly, they find that the values and norms they hold dear—being heterosexual, married, churchgoing, and traditional—are scorned by the media and Hollywood as being backward, out of touch, and even inherently bigoted. In other words, their cherished values and norms are now sources of cultural shame.

For many on the right, these shifting cultural norms and celebrations of diversity and non-traditional family structures in movies and television represent a personal affront. They see the broader culture’s caricature of their way of life as an assault on their honor and dignity.

(Shortform note: For a deeper discussion of this narrative of cultural decline, read our summary of Robert P. Jones’s article “We’ve Reached the End of White Christian America.”)

### Expressions of Endurance

**The commitment to honor and endurance through struggle finds its expression in different ways.** Although people on the right are bound by common political loyalty and shared negative attitudes toward government, they arrive at these positions differently and find different emotional rationales for their political attitudes.

These conservative expressions of endurance fall into three broad character types:

  * The Team Player
  * The Worshipper
  * The Cowboy



But all are based in a shared ethos of endurance, sacrifice, work, and honor.

#### Type #1: Team Players

**Team players in the conservative world are defined by their loyalty to their “team”—in this case, the Republican Party.** To be a Team Player is to unflinchingly support the party, its leading political figures, and its affiliated cultural institutions. This finds expression in a celebration of the hallmarks of right-wing American political culture: rural and small-town life, church, and industry.

One woman interviewed by Hochschild named Janice Areno (niece of Harold Areno, whom we met in Chapter 1) embodies loyalty to the GOP and a belief in its commitment to the value of hard work. As a “self-made” woman who worked her way up from poverty to affluence through effort and sacrifice, celebrating work for its own sake defines her moral world.

**In this view, hard work is inherently correct and moral. Getting paid without doing work is not just a waste of taxpayer money; it is damaging to the pride and dignity of the individual and a gross moral violation of the natural order.**

Accordingly, Areno believes that people should not be rewarded for their moral failure in shirking work. She is fiercely opposed to any form of welfare, believing that those who do not work should be left to starve and that mothers on cash assistance should undergo forced sterilization, lest they create more mouths for the state to feed.

Her unwavering loyalty to conservative principles also makes Areno a staunch defender of free-market capitalism. Instead of calling for stricter state regulation of the energy industry, **the proper response to environmental disasters is to endure them and be grateful for the bounty of private industry—environmental degradation is just the price of prosperity.**

For someone like Areno, it is impossible to accept any alternative. To accept the necessity of some state oversight of the free market would be to concede ground to the other side of the political divide—in effect, to betray her team.

#### Type #2: Worshippers

In the context of conservative Louisiana politics, the Worshipper accepts pollution and its resultant negative health outcomes in the name of jobs and material wealth. Even tragedies like the Bayou Corne sinkhole are justifiable, because they are a small price to pay for the wealth and prosperity that the free market brings. **While pollution may be regrettable, it is something to be endured. In life, sometimes you must sacrifice things you want for the greater good.**

One Louisiana woman named Jackie Tabor is a quintessential Worshipper. In detailing her life story, she discusses the series of houses she’s lived in with her husband, each a step above the previous one. But she reminds herself that she couldn’t live in nicer homes or have a better standard of living until she had truly earned it. Striving for too much too fast would have run counter to God’s plan for her and her husband.

**There is a deeper lesson here: You shouldn’t grab too quickly for your slice of the dream. Sometimes things aren’t meant to be, and your role is to be happy and accept whatever fate delivers.** This ties in nicely with anti-welfare conservative politics. Taxing the “makers” to give to the “takers” runs counter to this ethic of sacrifice and renunciation and represents an unnatural interference with God’s plan. In this worldview, there is an inviolable hierarchy—and some people are simply meant to be at the bottom of it.

#### Type #3: Cowboys

**Conservative Cowboys are motivated by their fierce pride in their independence and belief that risk and danger are necessary parts of life.**

For Cowboys, state regulations forbidding a company from dumping waste in a bayou or mandating individuals to wear seatbelts make people weak and dependent on the government for their own safety. The only way the United States was able to develop into an advanced economy and society, they claim, was because entrepreneurs had the freedom to take risks. And risks are essential to progress.

A Cowboy doesn’t run to the government for a handout when he gets into an accident on the job or contracts cancer through exposure to chemicals. He recognizes that he is the only one responsible if he gets hurt or sick—not the company and certainly not the government.

This worldview is closely tied to traditional notions of masculinity. **A real man values toughness, endurance, bravery, and honor. It is unmanly and dishonorable to rely on the government or to seek redress for your problems through the legal system.** A real man instead sucks it up, grits his teeth, and solves his own problems.

This attitude is backed up by sociological data. One 1997 study found that white males engaged in the most risky manual labor professions were significantly _less_ concerned about exposure to dangerous occupational conditions than workers who were less exposed to danger on the job.

One Louisiana man named Donny McCorquodale embodies the conservative cowboy archetype. He believes that even the most basic safety regulations are unnecessary and harmful. When discussing the possibility that an old petrochemical leak from 1994 might threaten the structural integrity of a nearby bridge—one that happens to carry an average of 50,000 vehicles per day—McCorquodale insists that it is not the government’s role to guarantee public safety.

He does so on explicitly “cowboy” grounds, arguing that risk is an important and necessary part of progress. Regulation, he says, threatens to stifle innovation and entrepreneurship. It’s impossible to make an entirely safe world—and any attempt to do so is an inversion of the “natural order.” As for those unfortunate souls who happen to contract cancer because they drank poisoned water or died in a bridge collapse caused by chemical leaks that undermined the piling supporting the bridge? They are just collateral damage, their lives the price of freedom and progress.
