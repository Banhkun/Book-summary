## 1-Page Summary

In _Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right_ , **sociologist Arlie Hochschild seeks to understand the social, cultural, and emotional forces driving right-wing politics,** in an effort to move past the partisan divide and approach American politics from a position of _empathy_ for those on the right.

People on the opposite sides of the political divide are not just separated by political beliefs. They are also separated by an empathy wall—a barrier that prevents them from achieving a deep understanding of the other side. The empathy wall causes us to feel hostile and dismissive toward those with whom we disagree politically, making it nearly impossible to find common ground and work toward solutions to our society’s pressing problems.

By breaking down this empathy wall, we can come to truly inhabit the emotional world of the right, giving us insight into _why_ these voters believe what they believe—and why those beliefs might make sense given these voters’ experiences.

We’ll make our journey across the empathy wall by exploring:

  * The paradox of white working-class conservative voters supporting the pro-corporate, anti-tax, and anti-environment agenda of the modern Republican Party
  * How the support of rank-and-file Tea Party voters for such policies stems not from ignorance or greed, but rather, from their ingrained sense of honor, pride, and resentment at a liberal, secular culture that they feel disrespects them and their values
  * How white conservatives, especially men, feel that minorities, women, and immigrants have unfairly “cut in line” ahead of them on the path to the American Dream—and how they believe the federal government has taken the side of the line cutters
  * How cultural changes have left conservatives feeling isolated and alienated from the country they once knew—feeling like strangers in their own land
  * How liberals and conservatives can overcome the empathy wall and find common ground



### The Conservative Paradox

If we’re going to overcome the empathy wall between liberals and conservatives, we need to first explore what appears to be an inexplicable phenomenon of American politics: that **the most conservative, heavily Republican states in the country are enduring immense suffering—often as a result of the anti-government, anti-tax, pro-business policies favored by the politicians who represent them.**

Across the conservative South, states and counties lag behind the rest of the country across nearly every measurement of human development—to the great frustration and puzzlement of many on the left.

**The conservative state of Louisiana ranks near the very bottom of all 50 states across most quality-of-life measurements** , including life expectancy, health outcomes, median income, educational attainment, and pollution.

The GOP’s electoral dominance has resulted in a business climate that enables polluters to operate with a free hand. Despite their political loyalty, ordinary Louisianans have suffered extraordinary abuse at the hands of a largely unregulated corporate sector. Even when the negligence of petrochemical companies results in the wholesale destruction of a community (as happened in 2012 in a Louisiana town called Bayou Corne, when a drilling company accidentally created a massive sinkhole that forced the evacuation of the town) residents denounced _government_ as the culprit. The conservative paradox leads these voters into a self-destructive feedback loop in which:

  * They enthusiastically vote for politicians who promise to slash regulations on business and cut funding for agencies tasked with enforcing public safety.
  * Understaffed and underfunded agencies lack the resources to properly enforce safety regulations, leading to industrial disasters.
  * The failure of the government to prevent these disasters affirms voters and politicians in their belief that the problem lies with government—and, therefore, the only solution is to reduce its role even further by voting for _more_ right-wing politicians.



Next, we’ll explore some of the consequences of the conservative paradox for the lives of everyday Louisiana residents.

#### Example #1: Environmental Degradation

**According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and environmental watchdog groups, Louisiana is one of the most polluted states in the country.** The state’s wetlands, for example, are in an extremely vulnerable condition. Since 1930, Louisiana has lost an area of its wetlands equal in size to the entire state of Delaware.

**With the arrival of companies like Firestone and Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) in the years after World War II, industrial pollution poisoned the land and water.** Republican politicians and their pro-business, laissez-faire ideology have given these polluting companies a free hand to poison the drinking water and destroy a once-thriving commercial fishing industry, all in the name of free enterprise.

#### Example #2: Worker Exploitation

**The petrochemical industry is also well-known for its ruthless exploitation of employees**. One former Louisiana petrochemical worker recounts numerous industrial accidents in which he saw coworkers gruesomely maimed or killed.**** The company for which he worked offered minimal compensation to these workers or their families.

Later, when this man became chronically ill from years of exposure to dangerous chemicals, he was fired by the company for alleged “absenteeism”—but the real reason was their desire to avoid paying his mounting medical bills.

### Regulation and Hierarchy

Given these experiences of exploitation, it might seem baffling why Louisiana voters would keep electing politicians who allow oil companies to poison their air and drinking water, expose them to lethal chemicals, and wreak havoc on their state’s budget and social services.

But if we’re going to overcome the empathy wall, we need to delve deeper and understand the deeper story behind _why_ these voters believe what they do.**The emotional force that truly animates support for conservatism is a desire on the part of white conservatives to uphold their honor, dignity, and perceived rightful place in the social and racial hierarchy.** Even though they would likely benefit from the more pro-worker, pro-regulation policies favored by the Democratic Party, conservative Louisiana voters feel culturally alienated from it.

Tea Party supporters believe that cosmopolitan liberals sneer and look down upon rural conservatives like themselves as racist, sexist, Bible-thumping, bigoted reactionaries. For them, liberal values are an affront to their honor and dignity—and they believe that the Republican Party, for all its faults, better represents _their_ values.

(Shortform note: Although the Tea Party no longer exists as a movement, its values and beliefs are still widely held by the broader conservative movement in the United States. Many candidates who ran explicitly as Tea Party conservatives in the 2010 midterm elections remained powerful figures within the Republican Party a decade later, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator Rand Paul, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.)

#### Maintaining the Hierarchy

**Despite the pervasive anti-government, anti-regulation rhetoric, conservative politics is quite accepting of state regulation—when it’s directed at certain social groups.**

In conservative states like Louisiana, pursuits and cultural totems associated with a certain form of white male masculinity are indeed lightly regulated. Highly individualistic, risk-taking behavior receives a light regulatory touch. Thus, state laws regarding the consumption and sale of liquor (even open containers in vehicles), the ownership of firearms, and the wearing of motorcycle helmets are indeed quite lax. For many Louisiana white men, being able to drink, own as many guns as you want, and ride your motorcycle without a helmet speak to the heart of what it means to be a man.

**On the other hand, Louisiana employs some of the nation’s most heavy-handed and harsh regulation when it comes to the rights and prerogatives of women and minorities,** including restrictive anti-abortion laws and a racially biased criminal justice system.

#### Traditional Values and Political Loyalty

While many Louisiana Tea Party members may lament the loss of the natural environment and the old Cajun way of life at the hands of the petrochemical industry, they insist that they are grateful for the jobs and economic opportunity that these companies bring.

More than environmental concerns, many conservatives claim that **their faith in God and their belief in traditional family values are most important to them—and that their commitment to _these_ values is what cements their loyalty to the Republican Party.**

For them, the federal government is the far bigger threat to their way of life, with liberal politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton representing a direct affront to their values.

### Honor and the Tea Party

So far, we’ve examined some of the deeper attitudes that underlie the political conservatism of Tea Party supporters.

Now, we need to expand upon that analysis and explore a key theme that runs through much of right-wing politics: honor. By understanding their culture of honor, we can gain deep insight into how **members of the right view themselves as losing status and position in the world** —critical if we are to overcome the empathy wall and find common ground.

#### Cutting in Line

**A major driver of the resentment felt by many Tea Party members is the belief that undeserving “others” have cut in front of them in the line to the American Dream.** The feeling of having one’s rightful position usurped stands as a tremendous insult to the honor and dignity of people who believe this.

The Tea Party members—predominantly (although not exclusively) older, white, rural, Christian, native-born, and male see an increasingly diverse, unrecognizable, and alien America usurping their rightful place at the front of the line. They see programs such as affirmative action, cash assistance, and higher education subsidies as taking _their_ hard-earned money and giving it away to provide unfair advantages to _other_ social groups—young people, African-Americans and Latin people, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and women.

#### Race and Sympathy Fatigue

**Although they deny harboring any personal racial animosity toward minorities, many Tea Party attitudes toward government redistribution programs are racially tinged.**

**The figure of former President Barack Obama looms large in the racially inflected Tea Party narrative of unfair advantage.** They see the first African-American president as the line-cutter-in-chief, who gleefully waved ahead the other non-white line cutters through his liberal tax-and-spend programs.

These themes are amplified by conservative media like talk radio and Fox News, which focuses on supposed “welfare queens” living a glamorous lifestyle on the government dime. This further contributes to the feelings of diminished honor. People on the right believe themselves to be suckers for working hard for a living, while _others_ are enjoying the luxurious benefits of government largesse.

**They proclaim themselves to have “sympathy fatigue” when they hear about the supposed plight of immigrants and minorities**. For them, it is absurd to feel sympathy for people who’ve simply been handed every advantage in life, while _they_ have had to work and struggle for everything—and still find themselves falling behind.

#### The Makers vs. the Takers

Closely related to the idea of line cutters is the concept of “makers” and “takers,” in which **hardworking “makers” are victimized and exploited by lazy “takers” living off the government.** The foundations of this worldview are rooted in a deeply emotional conviction that there are _deserving_ and _undeserving_ recipients of government aid—and that liberals and the federal government have sided with the undeserving at the expense of the deserving.

**In this view, hard work is inherently correct and moral. Getting paid without doing work is not just a waste of taxpayer money; it is damaging to the pride and dignity of the individual and a gross moral violation of the natural order.**

#### Masculinity and Risk

**Conservative notions of honor are also closely linked to traditional ideas around manhood and masculinity. A real man values toughness, endurance, bravery, and honor. It is unmanly and dishonorable to rely on the government or to seek redress for your problems through the legal system.**

Thus, for many white male conservatives, state regulations forbidding a company from dumping waste in a bayou or mandating individuals to wear seatbelts make people weak and dependent on the government for their own safety.

A true man doesn’t run to the government for a handout when he gets into an accident on the job or contracts cancer through exposure to chemicals. He recognizes that he is the only one responsible if he gets hurt or sick—not the company and certainly not the _government_.

This attitude is backed up by sociological data. One 1997 study found that white males engaged in the most risky manual labor professions were significantly _less_ concerned about exposure to dangerous occupational conditions than workers who were less exposed to danger on the job.

### Loss of Status

These resentments at being cut in front of reflect deeper anxieties about the perceived loss of once-privileged social status. White Christian men in particular (who comprise a disproportionate share of the Republican base) believe that they have lost their dominance in both the economic and cultural spheres.

#### Declining Wealth

**Many white working-class people have indeed lost ground within the nation’s economic hierarchy.** To many, this certainly feels like they are being robbed of their just rewards.

People born after 1950 have, on average, seen their real incomes (wages when adjusted for inflation) steadily _decline_ as they get older, leading to an alarming downward mobility. This is the inverse of the fabled American Dream—people are doing _worse than_ the generation that preceded them.

This trend is especially true for people without a college education, as is the case with many Tea Partiers in southwestern Louisiana. Global economic developments have exacerbated this trend. Globalization has made it easy for large multinational corporations to export low-wage, low-skill manufacturing jobs overseas; moreover, automation greatly reduces the need for human workers.

Once-thriving communities across the United States have been hollowed out and destroyed, leading to economic misery and social decay. For a certain subset of white men, their inability to provide for themselves or their families is a deep source of emasculating shame. **This affront to their honor leads them to cast about for someone to blame for their plight—and in their outrage and despair, they are increasingly drawn to far-right politics of resentment.**

#### The Civil Rights Era

**The events of the 1960s, particularly the Civil Rights Movement, provide a deeper historical context for the political attitudes of conservative Southern whites.**

While the successes of the Civil Rights Movement are celebrated as crucial victories for justice in much of the rest of the U.S., white Southerners have a different perspective on them. They deeply resented white northern allies of the Civil Rights Movement (whom they saw as moralizing and condescending) descending on their communities to upend what they believed to be the traditional Southern way of life. In some instances, federal troops were even sent into Southern states to supervise integration efforts.

To many white Southerners, the erosion of the region’s traditional racial order represented a downgrading of their _own_ status. Going back to the antebellum era, their whiteness itself had always protected them from ever being at the bottom of the social hierarchy, regardless of their personal or economic circumstances. **Any movement toward Black equality—particularly one imposed and enforced by the hated federal government—represented a deep threat to their status and honor.**

This bitterness is reflected in the sentiments expressed by many Southern Tea Party supporters, who resent the portrayal of white Southerners as racist, ignorant, and backward—the villains in the American story of progress.

#### Loss of Cultural Dominance

**The backlash to the 1960s continues, as many Tea Party supporters bemoan their loss of cultural dominance** , with movies and television shows appearing to cater exclusively to minorities, LGBTQ people, and non-binary people, while portraying non-traditional family units in a positive light.

Adding insult to injury, the castigation of white identity has come as other groups are embracing and celebrating _their_ identities—Black, Latinx, women, LGBTQ, and so on. Tea Party supporters, deeply imbued with an ideology that values hard work and self-reliance, resent what they see as a celebration of marginalization and victimization on the part of such groups.

#### Trump Voters and Emotional Self-Interest

These long-simmering historical resentments among white voters were a crucial factor in driving support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

As we’ve seen, liberals often deride conservative white working-class voters for voting against their own interest—the conservative paradox we explored earlier. **But liberals take too narrow a view of what constitutes “interest.” Interests can be non-economic in nature.** For blue-collar conservatives, supporting Trump was powerfully in their _emotional_ self-interest. What they admired most about Trump was his willingness to give voice to their grievances and resentments in unvarnished terms.

With his inflammatory rhetoric toward Muslims (whom he proposed outright banning from the country) and the nation of Mexico (along whose border with the U.S. he proposed building a wall to stop illegal immigration), Trump skillfully activated conservative voters’ anger toward line cutters. More than any other Republican candidate, Trump helped to create a new emotional permission structure that enabled white conservatives to express long-simmering anger and defy the cultural elites who they believe look down upon them.

When Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” or encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters at his rallies, he was deliberately discarding the emotional rules that many conservatives feel have been imposed upon them by liberals—that they must only speak about marginalized groups in certain ways and be careful to always use whatever politically correct term is in vogue.

### Conclusion: Breaking Through the Empathy Wall

**To heal America’s growing political divide, liberals and conservatives must find ways to overcome the empathy wall that separates them.** Each side is far too busy demonizing the other and reacting to caricatures of their political opponents, rather than substantively engaging with what the other side really believes and why they believe it.

**Liberals must recognize that conservatives are not motivated solely by bigotry and hatred, nor are they uneducated or unsophisticated**. Their political beliefs and resentments stem from a long history of feeling marginalized and discarded by mainstream American culture—of feeling like strangers in their own land. Moreover, there is much that liberals ought to admire about people on the right—their sense of pride in the dignity of work; their commitment to family and community; and their spirit of entrepreneurship, individualism, and independence.

If progressives wish to remain electorally competitive and to make progress toward their vision of a national common good, they must step outside their left-wing bubble and actually engage with those who disagree with them. Some ways to bridge this division could include:

  * A national high-school exchange program in which students from different regions of the country live and study in another part of the U.S. for the school year
  * A national youth service program, similar to the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, that brings together young people from around the nation to work on projects that will benefit the whole nation, such as installing solar panels, building dams, or planting gardens.



**However we do it, getting past the empathy wall is the only way we can bring civility back to our politics, restore public faith in democratic institutions, and rejuvenate the American Dream.**
