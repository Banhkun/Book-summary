## Part 2: Pillars of the Conservative World

In the last chapter, we saw how the GOP’s commitment to unregulated industrial capitalism has delivered environmental and economic havoc to its most loyal voters. We also saw how that political loyalty comes from those voters’ commitment to traditional values and their resentment toward a Democratic Party that they believe is disrespectful and hostile to their way of life.

In this chapter, we’ll move our analysis forward and approach the empathy barrier by examining the institutions that order and shape the emotional world of the Tea Party right in Louisiana, specifically:

  * The energy industry—even when its mistakes result in massive environmental destruction
  * The region’s particular brand of Christianity, with its emphasis on self-reliance and personal responsibility
  * Conservative media, especially Fox News, which provide an emotional outlet from what conservatives feel is the judgmental and lecturing tone of mainstream media and culture



### The Power of the Energy Industry

As we saw in Chapter 1,**the energy industry has emerged as the most powerful player in**

**Louisiana politics,** despite its underwhelming performance in creating jobs for state residents.

The rise of fracking technology, in which high-pressure water is injected into underground rocks to extract natural gas, has been a boon for energy companies like Sasol, which maintains a significant presence in southwest Louisiana.

These companies are lured to the state by its pro-business, anti-regulatory conservative politics and by the well-documented willingness of local residents to support high levels of pollution in their communities. These residents and voters justify the environmental degradation in the name of job creation and reducing dependence on government.

The fracking boom, while yielding big profits to large energy companies, has mostly been an experience of false promises and dashed hopes for residents.

#### A Blank Check for Business

**Local governments across Louisiana have rolled out the welcome mat for the energy industry, giving private interests a blank check to exploit public natural resources.**

In the small town of Westlake, where Sasol has committed to investing $21 billion in a new energy complex, Mayor Bob Hardey (an enthusiastic Tea Party supporter) has given the multinational corporation an essentially free hand to dump waste into the town’s rivers and streams and emit greenhouse gases. He is loyal to the energy industry and believes that it—not the government—represents the best way to bring prosperity to the community he loves.

As mayor, he’s used the eminent domain power (through which the government seizes private land for public use after compensating the owner) to help Sasol acquire land for its complex, even using the power of his office to pressure private landowners to sell to the energy giant.

**The land acquisitions undermine the social fabric and character of the community** , as energy companies like Sasol acquire land in order to raze churches, historic homes, and even cemeteries that stand in the way of their construction plans.

#### Against “Poor Me”

**Although he claims to harbor no racial animosity, Hardey, like many Tea Party conservatives, describes his opposition to the welfare state in highly racialized terms.** In attacking affirmative action, he says that no one should be hired for a job simply to fill racial quotas, and that there are plenty of jobs available for those willing to work.

Deep personal stories often inform people’s political views, and it’s no different for those on the right like Mayor Hardey. He claims that he was able to work his way up from relative poverty because his job at the Phillips 66 manufacturing plant gave him an opportunity to prove himself and take personal responsibility for his life—and that immigrants and racial minorities face no barriers that prevent them from doing the same, without government handouts.

Hardey’s belief in his own deep story and the role that he believes industry played in his own success are what shapes his anti-government politics. Decrying what he describes as a culture of “poor me,” **he views all programs designed to ameliorate poverty and redress economic inequality as unjust handouts to the lazy and undeserving.**

### The Bayou Corne Sinkhole Disaster

**Louisiana has been beset by high-profile environmental disasters caused by a weakly regulated energy industry. One of the most devastating occurred in 2012 at a place called Bayou Corne in Assumption Parish.**

There, a drilling company called Texas Brine accidentally caused the collapse of a massive cave over 5,000 feet below the bayou in the course of drilling for concentrated salt. The collapse of the cave caused oil and methane gas from the underground to rise, appearing as visible bubbles on the surface of the water. Residents reported seeing methane gas bubbles appear in puddles for weeks after the incident.

The cave’s destruction sucked in massive amounts of water, opening up a 37-acre sinkhole that destroyed trees, boats, and homes. The industrial catastrophe disrupted the geology of the local area to such an extent that small earthquakes and other seismic events rocked the community for months after the cave collapse.

Eventually, even the staunchly pro-energy industry Governor Bobby Jindal had no choice but to issue an evacuation order for Bayou Corne.

#### Blaming Government, Not Industry

**Despite the obvious negligence, incompetence, and irresponsibility of Texas Brine, most residents of Bayou Corne did not direct their anger at the company that was directly responsible for the destruction of their community.** Instead, they trained their rhetorical fire on the government.

It was the conservative paradox in action—people who’d been directly harmed by the consequences of anti-regulation politics (Texas Brine was later shown to have blithely ignored federal and state safety regulations) were lining up to denounce _government_ as the culprit. In reality, the Bayou Corne Sinkhole disaster was a result of _under_ -regulation, not overregulation, as well as regulatory capture, in which state agencies become dominated by industry lobbyists and representatives.

The conservative paradox leads these voters into a self-destructive feedback loop in which:

  * They enthusiastically vote for politicians who promise to slash regulations on business and cut funding for agencies tasked with enforcing public safety.
  * Understaffed and underfunded agencies lack the resources to properly enforce safety regulations, leading to events like the Bayou Corne Sinkhole.
  * The failure of the government to prevent these disasters affirms voters and politicians in their belief that the problem lies with government—and, therefore, the only solution is to reduce its role even further by voting for more right-wing politicians.



#### A Community Erased

One enthusiastic, college-educated Tea Partier from Bayou Corne named Mike Schaff sees government as the source of all his community’s problems. While he disapproves of how Texas Brine handled the aftermath of the sinkhole, his emotions toward them are more based in hurt and disappointment than anger. He had genuinely believed that the company cared about the community and was surprised to see how little they did for displaced residents.

But he rationalizes their actions on the grounds that they are a profit-maximizing corporation that has to answer to shareholders._Of course_ they’re going to try to cut costs by evading safety regulations and fighting the payment of legal claims to residents.

But it’s the job of government officials to protect _everyone_ , and on this score, according to Schaff, they failed miserably—only confirming his deep-seated belief in government’s essential worthlessness.

This is despite the fact that the devastating consequences of his worldview are on display all around him. For example, Schaff’s wife and grandchildren had to move away from the town, because the presence of methane gas leaks made it unsafe for them to stay. Many of his neighbors have also left under the evacuation order, decimating what was once a tight-knit and vibrant community. He is unable to even light a match in his own garage, out of concern that doing so would spark a methane explosion. His beloved community has simply been erased.

#### The Makers vs. the Takers

**Schaff’s ideology is grounded in his belief that hardworking “makers” like himself are victimized by lazy “takers” living off the government.** He claims (falsely) that half of Medicaid recipients in the state are not working or even attempting to find work. The foundations of this worldview are rooted in a deeply emotional conviction that there are deserving and undeserving recipients of government aid—and that liberals have sided with the undeserving at the expense of the deserving.

We see these attitudes on display in Mike’s own deep story. He admits to having personally used government programs such as federal hurricane relief, unemployment insurance, the interstate highway system, and the United States Postal Service. The difference, as he sees it, is that he is a _deserving_ recipient of these programs because he paid for them with his tax dollars. It is those undeserving “others” who didn’t pay in and are taking advantage of hardworking people like himself.

### Being Churched

**This same right-wing notion of the deserving and the undeserving is reinforced in the region’s churches—along with industry, another key pillar of the Tea Party worldview.** Indeed, Louisiana is extremely pious, with some of the highest church attendance figures in the country.

People refer to themselves as “being churched,” in the same way that you might describe yourself as being well-educated or well-mannered. Church is not simply a physical place where you go—it’s a way of being.

**In the small towns and rural communities that dot the southwestern corner of the state, churches provide many of the services that municipal governments do in more cosmopolitan cities.** Churches offer fitness centers, recreational facilities, childcare services, and even addiction treatment programs. Here, religion is community, therapy, welfare, and meditation all rolled into one.

Whether the church service is Catholic, Pentecostal, or Baptist, the message from the pulpit stresses personal endurance over difficult circumstances through a one-on-one relationship with Jesus. Notably, it does _not_ preach the need to improve external circumstances in your community or perform good works.

**The implication is that salvation is a matter of personal responsibility—and that your problems are yours and yours alone to deal with.** This regional variation of Christianity also teaches that it is unwise to wish or dream for things beyond your means. If Jesus wants you to have your dream house, it will be provided for you. If He doesn’t, then it won’t.

The important thing is to accept your station in life, set aside your envy and striving, be happy with what you have, and cheerfully endure any hardship that might come your way. This religious orientation fits well with conservative _political_ ideology, which downplays the role that external forces (government in particular) can play in improving one’s circumstances. It is a message that accords well with right-wing ideas regarding traditional social, racial, and gender hierarchies.

Some churches in Louisiana go a step beyond this and preach explicit anti-environmentalism, arguing that the Earth and everything beneath it is God’s bounty to humankind—and that people have a duty to accept this bounty and utilize it to the maximum extent possible.

#### Church and the American Dream

For one woman named Madonna Massey, fervent Pentecostal faith and steadfast commitment to free-market capitalism go hand-in-hand. Massey is the wife of a Pentecostal pastor, and the couple has ambitious plans to build a megachurch to spread the word of God to more believers.

As a talented gospel singer, she has accomplished more than she ever dreamed she would. But she stands opposed to any attempts by the government to ameliorate inequality in society—or to help others rise above the circumstances of their birth and grab their slice of the American Dream as she has. She attributes her own success to her work ethic and her unwavering faith in God, who has rewarded her with earthly blessings.

Massey’s moral world is ordered by her church. Government only exists to perform a few limited functions, such as protecting private property and guaranteeing national security. God is the only entity that can provide everything else in life, from healthcare to education to access to food. For Massey, any attempt by the government to provide these goods to people is an infringement upon the American Dream and a perversion of God’s will.

### Fox News and the Emotional Template of Conservatism

**But if there’s any institution more trusted by conservative Louisianans than big business or church, it might be Fox News.** One faithful viewer interviewed by Hochschild described Fox News stars like Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O’Reilly as being more akin to family for her than distant television personalities.

By devoting inordinate coverage to highly racialized topics like the 2014 Ebola outbreak, crime in urban centers like Chicago, and the “birther” conspiracy theory regarding President Barack Obama’s place of birth, Fox News serves up race-infused fear and paranoia to its older, conservative, and overwhelmingly white viewership.

**The right-wing news network powerfully shapes the emotional world of its viewers, providing them with a deep story or master narrative of the world, in which they are the brave, right-thinking heroes fending off the forces of liberalism, secularism, and political correctness.**

Perhaps most importantly, it validates viewers’ emotional orientations, confirming their ideas about what’s right and wrong and what’s important or unimportant. One viewer said that she likes Fox News because it doesn’t try to manipulate her emotions and make her feel guilty the way other news sources do—a source of great resentment for her.

She says that the liberal media implicitly try to blame the world’s humanitarian problems on America—and, specifically, conservative white Americans like _her_. They are trying to impose liberal emotional rules on her, dictating to her what she ought to care about.

Fox News is comforting because it validates her deep emotional belief that the world’s problems are not _her_ problems, and that she doesn’t have to feel guilty about them.
