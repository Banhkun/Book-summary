## Part 5.1: Living Your Best Life—Meaning, Gratitude, and Letting Go

In Part 4, we talked about how to use your Bullet Journal to become more productive, particularly in terms of setting and working toward goals, maximizing your time, and overcoming obstacles.

In Part 5, we’ll continue to explore Carroll’s suggestions for putting your Bullet Journaling into practice. This time, however, we’ll go beyond productivity and focus on strategies for living your best life. To begin, we’ll discuss how to search for what you find meaningful, cultivate gratitude, and let go of what you can’t control.

### Searching for Meaning

Fulfillment is important to living a high-quality life, and according to Carroll, **what makes us feel fulfilled is doing what we find meaningful**. Because meaning isn’t objective and changes over time, it’s impossible to attain using logic or reason. Carroll says you can find meaning by following your curiosity—if you feel curious or excited about something, it’s a sign that you’ll be fulfilled if you decide to pursue it.

(Shortform note: Curiosity may be one way to find fulfillment, but there are other strategies you can try. For example, you could focus on helping others, reflect on which of your past experiences felt the most meaningful, practice gratitude for what you have, or nourish your relationships with others.)

Carroll claims that, unfortunately, we tend to search for fulfillment in the wrong places, preventing us from living our best lives. He says that **culture has misled us to believe that we can achieve fulfillment through action**. In particular, he argues there’s a widespread belief among millennials that they can achieve fulfillment through self-improvement. Because of this, they’re spending twice as much as boomers on things like gym memberships, online courses, and skincare, but they don’t feel any more fulfilled.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll doesn’t explore the specific ways in which culture has misled us with regards to finding fulfillment, one contributing factor could be the rise in messaging that focuses on “following your passion” and “finding your purpose.” These phrases have pressured people, especially millennials, into feeling like failures when they don’t discover those things quickly. As a result, they see fulfillment as a goal they need to dedicate all their time and energy to rather than something they’ll discover naturally through experience.)

Additionally, he argues that **society has convinced us that fulfillment and happiness are one and the same** , or that the ultimate goal in life is to be happy. Carroll says that companies take advantage of this mindset and market pleasure as a form of fulfillment. Because humans are built to prioritize pleasure, this leads us to spend time and energy searching for whatever makes us feel good.

Because true fulfillment comes from doing what we find meaningful, Carroll claims these strategies—chasing self-improvement and pleasure—don’t give us the results we’re looking for. **Simply doing things because our culture pressures us to do them doesn’t lead to fulfillment**. What’s more, happiness isn’t a state of being that can be achieved but an emotion that comes and goes. Carroll argues that by constantly pursuing happiness, we lose sight of the things that may actually bring fulfillment.

> **Attracting (Rather Than Pursuing) Happiness**
> 
> In addition to losing sight of what could truly make you feel fulfilled, research shows that pursuing happiness can make you less happy. Studies show that seeking out happiness can become self-defeating because the more we value happiness, the more likely we are to feel disappointed when we don’t experience it. Therefore, we shouldn’t prioritize happiness as our ultimate goal.
> 
> That being said, there may be certain changes you can make in your life to attract more happiness without actively pursuing it. In _The Happiness Hypothesis,_ Jonathan Haidt explores some of the different conditions that make us happier, including having a sense of autonomy, maintaining meaningful connections with others, making progress toward goals, and spending money on things we find intrinsically valuable. Focusing on enriching these aspects of your life may ultimately make you happier than you’d be if trying to pursue happiness itself.

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll says that you can use your Bullet Journal to guide you in your search for meaning. To do this, he recommends **visualizing what your life would look like in two possible futures** : one based on familiarity, comfort, and permanence, and the other based on newness, risk, and growth.

(Shortform note: The exercise that Carroll recommends here is common, but there are plenty of others that can also help you think about meaning and purpose. For example, you could write your life philosophy in 100 words or less or pretend to describe yourself to a stranger. You could also write out the schedule for your ideal life with a focus on what you’re doing, where you are, and who you’re with.)

As you begin to visualize, Carroll suggests **writing an obituary for each possible future** in a new customized section **and asking yourself what your life would have looked like if you had chosen one over the other**. Focus especially on what you might have accomplished living in that way. Then, Carroll continues, write a letter to yourself on the next spread of pages that addresses the emotions you felt while considering each life. Once you’ve finished, decide which one appeals to you most, as well as which accomplishments excite you most, and add them to your goals.

(Shortform note: There are many other interpretations of the obituary exercise, and each has its own tweaks that you may find useful. For example, another version of the exercise asks you to write within a gravestone template for a touch of authenticity. It also focuses on a wider set of questions to help you more clearly visualize your life, such as how you made the world a better place, how others will remember you, what you said “no” to throughout your life, and who will miss you the most.)

### Cultivating Gratitude

To get the most out of life, Carroll recommends taking time to appreciate our achievements and experiences because doing so helps us better understand their value. This is especially important because **due to our busy lifestyle, we tend to lose sight of meaningful moments that make our lives worth living**.

(Shortform note: Carroll’s argument for appreciating our day-to-day achievements and experiences is supported by research. Studies show that not only do we overestimate our ability to remember present moments, but when we take time to document and revisit those mundane parts of our lives—such as a random music playlist, a recent conversation, or a question from a school exam—we also experience more joy in reminiscing than we would expect.)

Additionally, the way we conceptualize productivity prevents us from seeing a deeper meaning in the tasks we complete. **It’s difficult to recognize the value of what we’re doing when we view productivity solely as a list of completed tasks**. Intentionally cultivating gratitude helps reconnect us to that deeper meaning.

(Shortform: Motivational speaker Tony Robbins defines this conceptualization of productivity as “movement,” because it’s all about moving through an endless list of tasks that keeps you busy rather than working toward things that matter to you.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll says there are two primary ways you can use your journal to cultivate gratitude. The first is **being deliberate about celebrating when you complete a task**. In doing so, you build a sense of accomplishment rather than getting swept up in your remaining responsibilities. Specifically, the author recommends tailoring your celebration to the magnitude of the task you completed (like taking a much-deserved break after completing a small task) as well as keeping track of your achievements by writing them as events in your daily record.

(Shortform note: Carroll may not draw a line between celebrating and rewarding yourself here, but psychologists say that understanding the distinction can help us foster different types of motivation. When we celebrate our success through rest and reflection, our focus is on appreciating the process. Therefore, it helps us cultivate intrinsic motivation—or motivation that comes from within. On the other hand, when we reward our success with external prizes like gifts or money, our focus is on the outcome. This cultivates extrinsic motivation—or motivation that comes from outside sources. While both types of motivation can be good, intrinsic motivation is what fosters joy and appreciation for our efforts, regardless of outcomes.)

The second way to cultivate gratitude, continues Carroll, is to **take time out of your day to consider what you’re grateful for**. Spending even a few minutes reflecting on this can help you see things from a new perspective, and according to research, practicing gratitude can improve your relationships, health, self-esteem, and ability to empathize.

Carroll gives two recommendations for implementing a gratitude practice in your journal: Write the things that you’re grateful for in your daily record during your nightly review, or **write gratitude entries in a customized section in your journal that you can add to over time**.

> **Developing Your Gratitude Practice**
> 
> Writing down what you’re grateful for is just one of many strategies you can use to cultivate gratitude. In _The Happiness Project_ , Gretchen Rubin explores additional ways you can bring more gratitude into your daily life. For example, you can make a deliberate effort to remind yourself of life’s fragility—such as by reading memoirs, watching documentaries, or even visiting graveyards—or practice pausing to reframe your perspective in difficult moments.
> 
> However, as you focus on developing your personal gratitude practice, be aware that it has some drawbacks: First, it can trigger unwanted social comparisons as you compare what you have to be grateful for to what others have. Second, if you live in a collectivist culture that prioritizes community over the individual, feelings of guilt and indebtedness over experiencing joy when others don’t can overshadow feelings of gratitude. Finally, people struggling with depression can end up feeling like a failure if they’re unable to find things to be grateful for.

### Letting Go of What You Can’t Control

Carroll says that learning to differentiate between what we can and can’t control is vital to living a high-quality life. **By letting go of things outside of our influence and choosing to focus instead on how we _respond_ to them, we can shift our mindset from reactive to responsive**. Of course, Carroll acknowledges, letting go can be difficult because there are many displeasing things outside of our control: world events, other people, and even our own feelings.

(Shortform note: In explaining the importance of differentiating between what we can and can’t control, Carroll doesn’t explore _why_ we feel such a strong need to control things. According to research, feeling as if we have control makes us trust ourselves as competent beings with agency. It also reassures us that we aren’t under the control of others. Research shows that both of these beliefs positively affect our well-being.)

Yet another obstacle in our way, according to Carroll, is our fear of change; **although we understand that change is inevitable and often uncontrollable, we are nevertheless afraid of it and often resist it**.

(Shortform note: According to psychologists, despite our fear of change, humans are highly capable of adapting thanks to resilience. Rather than something you’re born with, resilience is a skill that you can develop over time by working on four core components—building connections with others, maintaining overall wellness, developing healthy ways of thinking, and finding purpose.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Despite these challenges, Carroll argues that it’s possible to adjust your mindset and let go of the uncontrollable. One way to do this is to **use your daily record to reflect on situations after they’ve occurred**. He argues that by putting your thoughts on paper, you can see things more clearly and prevent yourself from acting irrationally.

(Shortform note: How exactly does writing help you clarify your thoughts? Writing allows you to frame your ideas in a cohesive way, prioritize the most important information, reconcile different viewpoints, and solidify your argument. All of these are important when deciding how to respond to a situation.)

Instead of immediately reacting to a triggering uncontrollable event, Carroll suggests that you pause to allow yourself to process what occurred. Then, during your nightly review, **write a letter to yourself in your daily record, using it as a safe space to express your feelings and consider your options for how to respond** to the situation.

For example, your first reaction after being stood up on a date might be to send an angry text message to the person. After putting your thoughts down on paper, however, you may realize that you shouldn’t make assumptions about why they didn’t show up for the date—perhaps they had an emergency.

(Shortform note: Research on the benefits of expressive writing has provided some evidence in support of Carroll’s strategy. In one study, for example, participants who had recently lost their jobs were divided into three groups: One group wrote about their emotions surrounding their job loss, one group wrote about topics unrelated to traumatic experiences, and one group didn’t write at all. The results showed that those who specifically wrote about their job loss were re-employed more quickly, presumably because writing expressively helped them to change their perspectives on the situation and move on positively.)

Another strategy Carroll recommends for adjusting your perspective is reframing**tasks that are outside of your control**. He says that often, the reason tasks seem outside of your control is because they’re focused on the outcome, which you may have no power over. For example, a task like “cook a healthy meal that my kids like” is focused on the preferences of others, which you can’t control.

To shift that focus, Carroll suggests that you **break such tasks down further into smaller, actionable steps**. This is because smaller steps tend to focus on the process rather than the outcome and thus are within your control. For example, you could break down “cook a healthy meal that my kids like” into something smaller like “find a new healthy recipe to make this week.” This task, in contrast, can be completed successfully regardless of your kids’ opinions.

> **Outcome vs. Process Goals: Is One Better Than the Other?**
> 
> Carroll encourages readers to break down outcome-focused tasks into processed-focused steps. However, this suggestion seems to imply that goals focused on outcome should always be avoided. This begs the question: Is there ever any use for outcome goals?
> 
> According to experts, outcome goals are helpful if you use them in tandem with process goals, where process goals define the steps necessary to achieve the desired outcome. For example, if your outcome goal is to run a marathon, your process goals would be smaller actions you could take to work toward that achievement, such as weight training twice a week.
> 
> The benefit of setting both types of goals is that you can clarify what you hope to ultimately achieve while avoiding the overwhelm of trying to do too much at once. Additionally, you can challenge yourself to rise above what you ever thought possible while maintaining a clear sense of how to get there.
