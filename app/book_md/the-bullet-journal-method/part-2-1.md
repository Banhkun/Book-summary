## Part 2.1: Bullet Journaling Basics | Getting Started

In Part 1, we discussed how the Bullet Journal Method can help you become more organized, self-aware, and intentional in your day-to-day life. In Part 2, we’ll go over the Bullet Journaling basics, beginning with how to get started with your first journal.

According to Carroll, **the only tools Bullet Journaling requires** **are a notebook and a pen, and there are no limits to which ones you choose**. As previously discussed, one of the advantages of Bullet Journaling is that it provides flexibility that technology can’t, including in the tools you use. Whether your notebook is large or small and your pen fountain or ballpoint, Carroll says you’re free to decide what will work best for you.

(Shortform note: Even with the freedom to choose the tools you like best, you may be wondering if Carroll has any personal recommendations. In a previous interview, he mentioned that he prefers to use a dot-grid notebook. He even teamed up with the makers of one of the most popular dot-grid notebooks for Bullet Journaling—the Leuchtturm1917—to design an official Bullet Journal notebook.)

Additionally, Carroll maintains that the Bullet Journal Method is all about function over form. Although you’re free to design your journal in whatever way suits you, your choices shouldn’t interfere with the purpose behind the journal’s components, your ability to decipher your handwriting, or your capacity to maintain your journaling habits.

(Shortform note: While Carroll's suggestion to prioritize function over form has its advantages, for some, aesthetics _are_ functional. Specifically, certain people may find that the artistic possibilities of Bullet Journaling increase their motivation to journal and encourage creativity, even if they require more time and energy. Joshua Waitzkin echoes this idea in _The Art of Learning_ , where he argues that failing to honor what most resonates with you about a particular activity may cause you to lose your passion for it. Therefore, if your favorite part of bullet journaling is designing artistic layouts, don’t feel you have to sacrifice that in favor of purely functional designs.)

With this in mind, the next step is to set up the main organizational components of your notebook. Let’s discuss each of these in order, focusing on what they are, how to set them up in your journal, and how to use them.

### Index

Carroll explains that the Bullet Journal’s index is a hybrid between a table of contents and a traditional index. **It’s a set of pages at the front of your journal that keeps a running list of all the instances of a particular topic** , no matter where or how often it appears. Therefore, you’re neither limited to a certain number of pages per topic nor prevented from stepping away and returning to a particular topic at a later point in the journal.

Carroll argues that by keeping the index at the front of your journal, **you can find specific pages efficiently and see an overview of how you’re spending your time** by scanning the list of topics.

> **Carroll’s Index: What Makes It Unique?**
> 
> Despite calling his index a hybrid, Carroll neither describes a typical table of contents or index nor contrasts them with his own version. So what sets them all apart?
> 
> Generally, a table of contents is a set of pages at the front of a book that lists all of its chapters or sections and the page numbers on which they begin in linear fashion.**** On the other hand, an index is a set of pages at the back of a book that keeps track of all of its topics in alphabetical order and the various page numbers on which you can find them.
> 
> Carroll’s index pulls specific aspects of each of these—the page-tracking function of the typical index and the placement of the typical table of contents—to create a tool that lets you track instances of a particular topic and easily find them whenever you need.
> 
> Why did Carroll choose these specific features? Although he explains the utility of page-tracking thoroughly (as previously discussed), he never justifies his decision to place the index at the front like a table of contents. While you could potentially argue that placing the index at the back risks running out of pages as your index grows, you could make the same argument for placing it at the front, since Carroll instructs you to set aside only four pages. Therefore, it’s unclear why he would choose to adopt this particular feature of a table of contents for his hybrid index.

#### Setting Up and Using Your Index

Since the index sits at the front of your journal, Carroll suggests you set it up first. To do so, turn to the front of your notebook and number the first four pages 1–4. Then, title the first page “Index.”

Carroll explains that **as you fill your journal, you’ll populate the index by listing new topics and their corresponding page numbers**. For example, let’s say you decide to start a personal coding project. Once you turn to a fresh page of your journal and title your project, you’ll add it to the next line of your index followed by its page numbers (such as “Coding Project: 20–21”). And if you ever take a break from working on the project and need to come back to it on a later page in your journal, you can easily add this page number to your index (for example, “Coding Project: 20–21, 28”).

> **Carroll’s Index: Limited in Functionality?**
> 
> As Carroll explains, the index keeps track of all the sections you add to your journal by listing their titles and page numbers. The benefit of this approach is that the clear correspondence between titles and index entries makes big-picture topics easy to find.
> 
> Unfortunately, however, this also means that the functionality of Carroll’s index is limited in one very important way: It can’t help you find anything other than the high-level sections of your journal. Whereas a traditional index keeps track of _all_ key terms and topics, no matter where they’re found on the page, Carroll’s index only includes titles (which is more like a table of contents). Therefore, if you wanted to search for any notes related to “school,” for example, you couldn’t use the index to locate them.
> 
> As a potential solution, add important or frequent topics or keywords to your index along with section titles. That way, you can keep track of everything you’re likely to return to without overwhelming your index with too many entries.

### Future Planner

For tasks and events more than a month away, Carroll recommends using the “future log” (which we’ll call the “future planner”). **The future planner acts as a waiting list for all future tasks and events you don’t want to lose sight of**. For example, if you’re currently in the month of May, your future planner might house tasks like “Buy Christmas gifts” or events like “Real Estate Conference, Oct. 10–13.”

Carroll argues that **the future planner aids your planning by showing you what will require your attention in the months to come**. It provides plenty of foresight, which lets you change plans and goals as your needs and values shift. For example, imagine that when examining your future planner, you notice that there are numerous weddings scheduled for the summer. Because you’ve realized this far in advance, you can avoid over-committing yourself and prioritize attendance at the ceremonies of only your closest friends.

> **The Benefits of Planning Ahead**
> 
> Carroll praises the future planner’s ability to give you perspective and adjust your plans accordingly. However, there are additional benefits of planning ahead that he doesn’t discuss.
> 
> First, planning ahead can boost your productivity. Planning on paper holds you accountable and keeps you motivated, presumably because you’ll see your goals every time you open your journal. Additionally, spending a few moments planning ahead saves you time that you can then spend on the things that matter most.
> 
> Planning ahead can also improve your mental health in several ways. First, it can reduce stress by encouraging you to take an active (rather than passive) role in your life. In addition, it can help you live with more intention because writing out your thoughts and plans forces you to slow down and be in the present moment. Finally, planning ahead can be a significant mood booster because it reminds you of all the good experiences you have to look forward to.

#### Setting Up and Using Your Future Planner

According to Carroll, your future planner follows your index and spans from pages 5–8. To set it up, title the first page and add it to your index (for example, “Future Planner: 5–8”). Next, divide each of the four pages into 3 boxes, totaling 12 for the entire year. Then, label each box with a separate month.

To utilize your planner, explains Carroll, **you’ll add any future tasks and events that fall outside of the current month into the appropriate boxes**. Future tasks could include scheduled obligations (such as “call to wish Grandma a happy birthday”) or goals (such as “read the collected works of J.R.R. Tolkien”).

(Shortform note: While Carroll’s instructions can serve as a helpful guide, you aren’t limited to his format when setting up your future planner. Many Bullet Journalers have created variations on the traditional setup to suit their own needs that you can look to for inspiration. For example, for a more minimalist design, create a yearly calendar on a single page and color in dates that have important events or tasks rather than writing them out. Or, if you desire more space, dedicate an entire page to each month rather than dividing each page into three boxes as Carroll recommends.)

### Monthly Overview

Carroll describes the “monthly log” (which we’ll refer to as the “monthly overview”) as **a tool that** **summarizes your available time and upcoming responsibilities in the next month**. The monthly overview utilizes both a calendar and task list where you can log events and track your upcoming tasks for the month.

(Shortform note: Carroll doesn’t specifically address why he chose to separate the calendar from the task list, but it’s easy to see why this might be beneficial. First, separating events from tasks prevents overcrowding on specific calendar dates, which is a common issue for traditional planners or standalone calendars. Additionally, in some cases, it may not be necessary to assign tasks to a specific day, meaning that a calendar format would be a hindrance rather than a help.)

In Carroll’s view, the benefit of the monthly overview’s overhead perspective is that it**keeps you aware of both your available capacity and the way you’re allocating your time**. This prevents burnout and offers opportunities for reflection.

(Shortform note: Carroll’s focus here may be time capacity, but your energy capacity is also important in deciding how to plan out your life. Even if your calendar is empty and your task list is short, you still may not have the energy to allocate to new commitments. Therefore, while the monthly overview may be a good reference point when planning, make a point to check in with your energy levels before committing to anything more.)

#### Setting Up and Using Your Monthly Overview

According to Carroll, the first monthly overview should follow the future planner. To set it up, turn to the spread of pages after the planner and number them 9–10. Then, title both pages with the current month and add them to your index (for example, “January: 9–10”).

Next, Carroll says to set up your calendar and task list. To create your calendar, **list all of the calendar dates vertically along the left side of the left page, followed by the first letter of the day of the week** it falls on. For visual clarity, add horizontal dividing lines between individual weeks.

Carroll explains that to populate the calendar, **you’ll add events either by transferring upcoming events** from your daily record during daily review (which we’ll discuss shortly) **or by recording them after they’ve occurred** —it’s up to you.

For the task list, Carroll says you’ll populate the page once you’ve identified relevant tasks for the month (a process we’ll discuss shortly). Just as with the calendar, you’ll continue to add to your task list as new tasks come up in your daily record.

> **Variations on the Monthly Overview**
> 
> Just as with the future planner, you aren’t limited to the monthly overview layout and method that Carroll recommends. Although he doesn’t include specific examples of others’ variations on this element, many Bullet Journal users have created innovative designs that work better for their needs—and they may suit your preferences too.
> 
> For example, some journalers have reverted to a more traditional calendar format to track events, with tasks listed either within the calendar or below it. Others have chosen to include comprehensive habit trackers (which we’ll discuss in Part 3) as part of their monthly overview layout, tracking everything from exercise to social media usage. To customize the overview even further, some have included additional components—like bills to pay, monthly goals, and wish lists—depending on what information they prioritize as part of the overview.
> 
> In addition to these ideas, one concept that’s quite popular among the Bullet Journaling community is customizing the layout of each month’s overview according to the needs of that specific month. For example, in December, you might add a holiday shopping list to your overview. Or, in January, you could include your New Year’s resolutions. Similarly, in June, you may want to have a packing list for your summer vacation.

### Daily Record

Carroll explains that your “daily log” (which we’ll refer to as your “daily record”) is for**capturing any information, thoughts, or ideas that come up throughout the day** in the form of _tasks_ , _events_ , and _notes_. According to Carroll, tasks are things that you need to do (such as “schedule doctor appointment”), events are experiences that have either already happened or are scheduled to occur (like “Greg’s birthday June 18”), and notes are facts, ideas, or observations that you want to remember (such as “Amy seemed distracted”).

(Shortform note: As previously mentioned, Carroll argues that one of the main benefits of the Bullet Journal is that it acts as a standalone organizational tool that eliminates the need for separate mediums like to-do lists, sticky notes, and productivity apps. While for some this strategy may reduce overwhelm, for others, it may only increase it. If keeping everything in one place stresses you out, a tool like the daily record—which documents tasks, events, _and_ notes simultaneously—may not be ideal.)

Over time, Carroll says the entries in your daily records serve as data points that add context to your recollections of the past. For instance, **your record of tasks acts as an archive of all you’ve accomplished** , **and** **your record of events provides insight into your experiences** , especially when your memory fails. You may even notice patterns that can help you be more intentional about your choices (such as noticing that you feel better on the days you order a morning latte from Starbucks).

Similarly, Carroll says that **your record of notes can remind you of details that you would have otherwise forgotten** , which helps you build stronger awareness in your day-to-day life (like realizing that a friend hasn’t been as supportive as you thought).

> **Additional Takeaways From the Daily Record**
> 
> Carroll mentions a few advantages of keeping a daily record, but there are additional benefits you can take advantage of. For example, having a record of your accomplishments can be especially useful at work when trying to justify a raise or promotion during a performance evaluation. Moreover, keeping a written record of your days could be a helpful recall tool. Research shows that our memories are often inaccurate due to imperfect perception, the impact of new experiences and emotions on how we view past events, and the inadvertent blending of two separate memories.
> 
> There is, however, a downside to maintaining a consistent record of your day that Carroll doesn’t touch on: Research suggests that we’re more prone to forget things when we write them down. This means that for your daily record to aid your memory, you might need to review your notes frequently.

#### Setting Up and Using Your Daily Record

Carroll says that your first daily record should follow your first monthly overview. To set it up, turn to the page after the overview and number it 11. Then, title the page with the current date. Carroll advises that **you shouldn’t add any of your daily records to your index** because they would overwhelm the other entries, and you’ll eventually transfer any actionables or future events from your daily records to other parts of your journal.

(Shortform note: While Carroll’s reasoning for excluding daily records from the index makes sense in the case of actionables and future events that are moved to other journal pages, it doesn’t hold true for notes and past events, which remain in the daily record. Because you don’t transfer these entries, they’re difficult to find without the help of an index if you want to look back at them.)

**Throughout the day, you’ll write down tasks, events, and notes that are relevant to you** , using as much space as you need. You’ll repeat the same process each day, creating new daily records as part of your nightly or morning review (which we’ll discuss a bit later).

(Shortform note: Having to set aside time to create a new daily record every morning or night could be a disadvantage for those who prefer advanced preparation or have especially busy schedules. If you’re one of these individuals, try preparing a few daily record pages in advance when you have time.)

##### Jotting

To record information in the most efficient way in your journal, Carroll recommends using a method called “rapid logging” (which we’ll refer to as “jotting”). **Jotting is a streamlined method of taking notes that focuses on only the most essential information**.

For example, in a traditional notebook, an entry might look like this: “My boss said to prepare a presentation on last quarter’s profits for the Sept. 20th meeting.” Using the jotting method, it could look like this: “Presentation on Q2 profits for 9/20.” Although jotting greatly condenses the task description, it maintains all of the important information: what the presentation is about and when it’s due.

> **Tips for Writing Clearly and Concisely**
> 
> Although Carroll _defines_ jotting as a note-taking method meant to convey only the most essential information, he doesn’t provide _specific recommendations_ for how to do it effectively. When it comes to writing clearly and concisely, there are several tips to keep in mind.
> 
> First, choose constructions that contain fewer words (for example, replacing “let Sam know” with “notify Sam”). Second, eliminate unnecessary words, such as “a” and “that,” which don’t add any essential information. Third, use abbreviations where possible, like “ASAP” or “TBD.” And finally, when jotting tasks, eliminate the first verb and start instead with the noun that defines the task—for example, “Homework for Friday” rather than “Do homework for Friday.”
> 
> Even with these tips, you may find that jotting isn’t working for you, as different situations sometimes call for different tools. For example, if you’re taking notes in class, you may prefer to use the Cornell Method because it systematically encourages reflection by leaving space for later notes in the margin. Depending on your specific needs, there are plenty of note-taking techniques that you can try, including mind mapping, the Outline Method, the Charting Method, and the Maria Popova Method.

##### Bullet System

Carroll explains that the practice of jotting uses bullets, which lend themselves well to capturing concise and objective thoughts. In the Bullet Journal Method, **you use different kinds of bullets to organize information in a way that you can easily understand at a glance**.

(Shortform note: While bullet points have long been a preferred note-taking method, their origin is heavily debated. Some say their usage dates as far back as the invention of the first movable-type printing press in the 15th century and that their shape is meant to resemble the munitions of cannons and muskets. While bullets first began as a tool for writing and publishing, their use has expanded to fields like copywriting and computing.)

In Carroll’s system, different bullet types (and in some cases an accompanying set of symbols) correspond to the different categories of information—tasks, events, and notes—that you capture while jotting. The purpose of using these symbols is to convey meaningful information in the quickest way possible. Let’s review each category:

**_Tasks_**

Carroll says **the basic solid bullet (•) corresponds to tasks**. Because tasks are meant to be accomplished, this bullet type acts as a sort of checkbox that you can combine with other symbols to communicate the status of each task:

  * The solid bullet on its own (•) represents a task that you need to do.
  * An (x) represents a task that you’ve completed.
  * The greater than symbol (>) represents a task that you’ve transferred to the monthly overview or another project section in your journal.
  * The less than symbol (<) represents a task that you’ve transferred to the future planner because it’s not time-sensitive.
  * A struck-through task (~~task)~~ is one that’s no longer relevant. 



**_Events_**

Carroll explains that **the empty bullet (◦) corresponds to events**. Events can be experiences that have already happened or ones that are scheduled to occur at a later date. Although the event category doesn’t use any additional symbols, you can combine it with notes to add details you want to remember about specific events.

**_Notes_**

According to Carroll, **the dash (-) corresponds to notes**. In addition to adding notes to events, you can combine them with tasks to capture further details about a responsibility.

**_Additional Symbols_**

In addition, Carroll mentions other symbols you can use to quickly add context to your entries. For example, use the star (*) to mark a priority or the exclamation point (!) to mark an inspiring idea or insight you want to remember.

Carroll says **you can also create custom bullets that serve your unique situation**. For instance, if you’re in a position of leadership, use a forward slash (/) to mark a delegated task. Or, choose your own symbol to indicate a personally recurring task. (For instance, a teacher might use G to indicate a task related to grading.)

> **The Bullet Journal System vs. the Dash/Plus System**
> 
> While Carroll’s bullet system has its unique points, it draws heavy inspiration from another note-taking system called Dash/Plus. Similar to the origin of the Bullet Journal Method, Patrick Rhone created Dash/Plus in 2006 as a solution to keep track of his lists and notes.
> 
> Just as the Bullet Journal Method is based on the bullet, the Dash/Plus System centers around the dash (-). On its own, the dash signals a task you need to complete, and when you turn it into a plus (+), it signals that you’ve finished the task. To indicate that you’re waiting on a certain action before completing a task, you turn the dash into a right arrow (->). On the other hand, to show that you’ve delegated the task to someone else, you turn the dash into a left arrow (<-). In addition to these variations, the system uses a circle surrounding a dash (⊝) to signify that you’ve moved a task or pushed it forward to a later date and a triangle (▵) to signal a data point you want to remember.
> 
> In terms of similarities, both systems use symbols to show some of the same things, such as a completed or delegated task. In this way, their basic structures are comparable. They also use a few of the same symbols, albeit with different uses (for example, the use of arrows).
> 
> As for differences, the Dash/Plus system focuses almost exclusively on tasks, with only one additional symbol (the triangle) that indicates data points. On the other hand, the Bullet Journal system makes use of additional symbols that cover things like events, notes, and priorities. Moreover, whereas the Dash/Plus system is a standalone note-taking method, the Bullet Journal’s bullet system is part of a larger organizational framework that’s meant to not only improve productivity but also your overall quality of life.
> 
> Ultimately, despite their similarities in form and function, the two systems have their separate advantages. In particular, the Dash/Plus system is arguably better in a work environment due to its simplicity and task-focused nature, while the Bullet Journal system may be more suitable for day-to-day use because of its flexible use of symbols and overarching organizational framework.
