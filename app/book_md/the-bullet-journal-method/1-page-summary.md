## 1-Page Summary

After years spent perfecting his own organizational techniques, author Ryder Carroll devised the Bullet Journal Method—**a single-notebook system designed to help him add structure to his life, set goals, and gain clarity on what was important to him** through comprehensive planning of and reflection on tasks and events.

Carroll developed the method after growing tired of struggling to maintain focus and keep up with his responsibilities. After realizing the method’s potential to help others, he decided to formalize it, streamline it, and release it to the public through online resources and the eventual publication of _The Bullet Journal Method_.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss Carroll’s argument for why you should start Bullet Journaling. Then, we’ll dive into the method itself, detailing both its main components and how to get started. Finally, we’ll explore how to use the practice of Bullet Journaling to improve both your productivity and quality of life.

### Why You Should Start Bullet Journaling

According to Carroll, despite living in a society that glorifies productivity, research has shown that **we’ve become _less_ productive with the rise of technology.** Although technology has revolutionized the way we live in countless ways, it has also overloaded us with information, resources, and connections. With so many things fighting for our attention, we can’t possibly focus on all of them. As our attention scatters, our productivity plummets.

(Shortform note: Carroll doesn’t explore why we can’t focus on so many things at once, but research suggests it may be because the brain only has two hemispheres available to manage tasks. Therefore, it can only focus on two things at the same time, making juggling more than two responsibilities an impossibility.)

#### Bullet Journaling as a Solution

According to Carroll, the solution to this productivity problem is to use the Bullet Journal Method, **an organizational tool that helps you be intentional about how you spend your time and energy**. It’s a system that archives your life—past, present, and future—tracking not only the day-to-day details but also your choices, your actions, and how you’ve changed over time.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll argues for Bullet Journaling as a _solution_ , psychologists say that journaling can negatively affect your well-being if you’re not careful about how you use it. In particular, it can make you passively observe your life instead of living in the moment, focus on blame rather than solutions, get swept up in negativity, or become self-obsessed. Note, however, that these potential effects apply to journaling in general, and they may not be as relevant to Bullet Journaling specifically.)

Carroll claims that Bullet Journaling can aid you in three areas: getting organized, living in the present moment, and finding clarity on what’s important to you. Let’s discuss each of these in more detail.

##### Get Organized

According to Carroll, one of the main benefits of the**** Bullet Journal Method**** is that**it** **can help you get organized by providing a single outlet to declutter your mind**.

(Shortform note: This benefit of Bullet Journaling is arguably important because when we _fail_ to stay organized, psychologists say we can experience consequences such as decreased subjective well-being, poorer eating habits and mental health, and less efficient thinking and visual processing.)

Additionally, because the method utilizes a notebook, it offers flexibility that technology can’t. Whereas tech tools either have an excess of features or narrow functionality, a notebook is customizable to your specific organizational needs.

(Shortform note: The excess of features in tech tools that Carroll refers to is a common phenomenon in product design called “feature creep” or “scope creep.” In an effort to create the best product and please the widest audience, designers sometimes unintentionally overcomplicate a product by adding too many features. Fortunately, just as Carroll describes, feature creep isn’t a problem in Bullet Journaling, as only _you_ are in charge of the journal’s design and use.)

##### Live in the Present

Another primary benefit of the Bullet Journal Method, according to Carroll, is that**it encourages you to slow down and focus on the present moment** **by requiring you to write by hand**. Because handwriting is less efficient than typing or dictating, it forces you to pay closer attention to what you’re writing and therefore changes the way you engage with what you’re writing about, whether that’s your thoughts or the world around you.

(Shortform note: Handwriting doesn’t just _change_ your engagement with what you’re writing—it _increases_ it. According to research, the act of writing by hand activates more complex neural connections than typing. Furthermore, researchers say that the precise movements involved in writing by hand benefit the brain’s learning processes.)

##### Find Clarity

According to Carroll, a final fundamental benefit of the Bullet Journal Method is that **it helps you determine what’s important to you** **by encouraging a regular habit of introspection.** In particular, by using your journal to track your experiences and actions over time, you can reflect on your life and clarify what matters to you—for example, the tasks you find most fulfilling. Once you’ve found that clarity, the method can aid you in setting and working toward meaningful goals that can help you become more productive than ever before.

(Shortform note: While introspection can be beneficial, it has some potential pitfalls. According to psychologists, if you don’t practice introspection in the right way, it can negatively impact your mental health. Specifically, if introspection becomes an obsessive habit, it can cause stress, anxiety, and depression.)

### Getting Started

Now that we’ve discussed why you should consider Bullet Journaling, we’ll help you take the first steps to getting started with the method.

According to Carroll, **the only tools Bullet Journaling requires** **are a notebook and a pen, and there are no limits to which ones you choose**. He notes that the Bullet Journal Method is all about function over form. Although you’re free to design your journal in whatever way suits you, your choices shouldn’t interfere with the journal’s purpose, your ability to decipher your handwriting, or your capacity to maintain your journaling habits.

(Shortform note: While Carroll's suggestion to prioritize function over form has its advantages, for some, aesthetics _are_ functional. Specifically, certain people may find that the artistic possibilities of Bullet Journaling increase their motivation to journal and encourage creativity, even if they require more time and energy. Joshua Waitzkin echoes this idea in _The Art of Learning_ , where he argues that failing to honor what most resonates with you about a particular activity may cause you to lose your passion for it. Therefore, if your favorite part of bullet journaling is designing artistic layouts, don’t feel you have to sacrifice that in favor of purely functional designs.)

With this in mind, the next step is to set up the main organizational components of your journal. Let’s discuss each of these in order, focusing on what they are and how to use them:

#### Index

Carroll explains that the Bullet Journal’s index is a hybrid between a table of contents and a traditional index. **It’s a set of pages at the front of your journal that keeps a running list of all the instances of a particular topic** , no matter where or how often it appears. As you fill your journal, you’ll populate the index by listing new topics’ titles and their corresponding page numbers (such as “Coding Project: 20–21, 42–44”).

(Shortform note: As Carroll explains, the index keeps track of all the sections you add to your journal by listing their titles and page numbers. However, this means it can’t help you find anything other than high-level sections of your journal—whereas a traditional index keeps track of _all_ key terms and topics, Carroll’s index only includes titles. As a potential solution, add important or frequent topics or keywords to your index along with section titles. That way, you can keep track of everything you’re likely to return to without overwhelming your index with too many entries.)

#### Future Planner

For tasks and events more than a month away, Carroll recommends designating four pages in your journal as the “future log” (which we’ll call the “future planner”). **The future planner is a waiting list for all future tasks and events you don’t want to lose sight of**. It aids your planning because it shows you what will require your attention in the months to come and gives you enough foresight to let you change plans and goals as your needs and values shift. To utilize your future planner, organize all future tasks and events by month so that you can see an overview of not only each month but also the year as a whole.

(Shortform note: Carroll praises the future planner’s ability to give you perspective and then adjust your plans accordingly. However, there are additional benefits of planning ahead that he doesn’t discuss: Planning future tasks and events on paper can help you hold yourself accountable, keep you motivated, and save you time that you can then spend on the things that matter most. In addition, it can reduce stress by encouraging you to take an active role in your life, help you live in the present moment by forcing you to slow down while writing, and boost your mood by reminding you of all the good experiences you have to look forward to.)

#### Monthly Overview

Carroll describes the “monthly log” (which we’ll refer to as the “monthly overview”) as a two-page tool that summarizes your available time and upcoming responsibilities in the next month through a calendar and task list. He argues that the monthly overview’s overhead perspective helps**keep you aware of both your available capacity and the way you’re allocating your time** , preventing burnout and offering opportunities for reflection.

(Shortform note: Carroll’s focus here may be time capacity, but your energy capacity is also important in deciding how to plan out your life. Even if your calendar is empty and your task list is short, you still may not have the energy to allocate to new commitments. Therefore, while the monthly overview may be a good reference point when planning, make a point to check in with your energy levels before committing to anything more.)

#### Daily Record

Carroll explains that your “daily log” (which we’ll refer to as your “daily record”) is for**capturing any information, thoughts, or ideas that come up throughout the day** in the form of tasks, events, and notes. According to Carroll, tasks are things you need to do, events are experiences that have either already happened or are scheduled to occur, and notes are facts, ideas, or observations you want to remember.

Over time, Carroll says **the entries you keep in your daily record serve as data points that add context to your recollections of the past**. Specifically, your record of tasks acts as an archive of all you’ve accomplished, your record of events provides insight into your experiences, and your record of notes can help you remember details that you would have otherwise forgotten, which helps you build stronger awareness in your day-to-day life.

> **Additional Takeaways From the Daily Record**
> 
> Carroll mentions a few advantages of keeping a daily record, but there are additional benefits you can take advantage of. For example, having a record of your accomplishments can be especially useful at work when trying to justify a raise or promotion during a performance evaluation. Moreover, keeping a written record of your days could be a helpful recall tool. Research shows that our memories are often inaccurate due to imperfect perception, the impact of new experiences and emotions on how we view past events, and the inadvertent blending of two separate memories.
> 
> There is, however, a downside to maintaining a consistent record of your day that Carroll doesn’t touch on: Research suggests that we’re more prone to forget things when we write them down. This means that for your daily record to aid your memory, you might need to review your notes frequently. Additionally, because Carroll recommends writing tasks, events, _and_ notes in your daily record, the record could become overwhelming for people who prefer not to keep everything in one place.

##### Jotting

Carroll explains that throughout the day, you’ll write down tasks, events, and notes that are relevant to you, using as much space as you need. To record this information in the most efficient way, he recommends that you use a method called “rapid logging” (which we’ll refer to as “jotting”). **Jotting is a streamlined method of taking notes that focuses on only the most essential information**.

For example, in a traditional notebook, an entry might look like this: “My boss said to prepare a presentation on last quarter’s profits for the Sept. 20th meeting.” Using the jotting method, it could look like this: “Presentation on Q2 profits for 9/20.” Although jotting greatly condenses the task description, it maintains all of the important information: what the presentation is about and when it’s due.

> **Tips for Writing Clearly and Concisely**
> 
> Although Carroll _defines_ jotting as a note-taking method meant to convey only the most essential information, he doesn’t provide _specific recommendations_ for how to do it effectively. When it comes to writing clearly and concisely, there are several tips to keep in mind.
> 
> First, choose constructions that contain fewer words (for example, replacing “let Sam know” with “notify Sam”). Second, eliminate unnecessary words, such as “a” and “that,” which don’t add any essential information. Third, use abbreviations where possible, like “ASAP” or “TBD.” And finally, when jotting tasks, eliminate the first verb and start instead with the noun that defines the task—for example, “Homework for Friday” rather than “Do homework for Friday.”

##### Bullet System

Carroll explains that the practice of jotting uses bullets, which lend themselves well to capturing concise and objective thoughts. In the Bullet Journal Method, **you use different kinds of bullets to organize information in a way that you can easily understand at a glance**. Different bullet types (and in some cases an accompanying set of symbols) correspond to the different categories of information—tasks, events, and notes—that you capture while jotting:

  * The solid bullet (•) represents a task that you need to do.
  * An (x) represents a task that you’ve completed.
  * The greater than symbol (>) represents a task that you’ve transferred to the monthly overview or another project section in your journal.
  * The less than symbol (<) represents a task that you’ve transferred to the future planner because it’s not time-sensitive.
  * A struck-through task (~~task)~~ is one that’s no longer relevant. 
  * The empty bullet (◦) represents an event. 
  * The dash (-) represents a note. 



> **The Bullet Journal System vs. the Dash/Plus System**
> 
> While Carroll’s bullet system has its unique points, it draws heavy inspiration from another note-taking system called Dash/Plus. Similar to the origin of the Bullet Journal Method, Patrick Rhone created Dash/Plus in 2006 as a solution to keep track of his lists and notes.
> 
> Just as the Bullet Journal Method is based on the bullet, the Dash/Plus System centers around the dash (-). In this way, their basic structures are comparable. Both systems use symbols to represent some of the same actions, such as a completed or delegated task. They also use a few of the same symbols, albeit with different uses (for example, they both use arrows).
> 
> As for differences, the Dash/Plus system focuses almost exclusively on tasks, with only one additional symbol (the triangle) that indicates data points. On the other hand, the Bullet Journal system makes use of additional symbols that cover things like events, notes, and priorities. Moreover, whereas the Dash/Plus system is a standalone note-taking method, the Bullet Journal’s bullet system is part of a larger organizational framework that’s meant to not only improve productivity but also your overall quality of life.

### The Role of Reflection

Now that you understand the basic components of the Bullet Journal Method, let’s discuss the essential role of reflection in the method and how it’s integrated into the system.

Carroll explains that, unlike other productivity systems, **the Bullet Journal Method encourages you to not only record information but also re-engage with it**. Rather than passively listing tasks and reminders, you actively assess what you’ve written through a process he calls migration (which we’ll refer to as transferring).

(Shortform note: Although the Bullet Journal Method may be unique in the _specific_ way it encourages you to re-engage with information, it’s not the only productivity system to have that functionality. Evernote, for example, is a digital app that helps you record information from a diverse set of file types—including notes, voice recordings, photos, and documents—and organize and search them with ease. Such effortless access to information incentivizes you to re-engage with the records you store.)

Carroll describes transferring as moving content from one part of your journal to another (or one journal to another) through daily review, monthly review, and yearly review. The purpose of this relocation is to encourage you to reflect on every entry you record, which helps you spend your time and energy with intention. **Without this built-in reflection, you’re likely to lose track of not only what you’re doing but also _why_ you’re doing it**. And if you don’t understand the purpose behind your actions, you’re at higher risk of making bad decisions that misalign with your purpose.

(Shortform note: Carroll doesn’t explicitly claim that transferring guarantees reflection, but his argument implies that transferring requires you to pause and consider the purpose of each entry before moving it. While it could certainly provide _opportunities_ for reflection, it’s also possible that in building the habit of transferring, you could fall into a reflexive pattern of moving entries without re-evaluating them. Therefore, to fully benefit from this aspect of Bullet Journaling, don’t take these reflection opportunities for granted and be mindful as you transfer content.)

### Customizing Your Journal

Having nailed down the basics about creating and reflecting on your journal, let’s talk about how you can customize your journal to fit your needs.

In addition to the four core components—the index, daily record, monthly overview, and future planner—Carroll explains that you’re free to create other collections for your journal (which we’ll refer to as “customized sections”). **Customized sections are optional journal components in which you can explore new topics** or dig deeper into information you record within the four core components. While you can create whatever suits your needs, Carroll mentions that some common customizable sections include plans for projects (personal, such as a bathroom renovation, or professional, such as a new ad campaign), habit trackers, budgets, and class notes.

Customized sections, Carroll argues, are an integral part of the Bullet Journal Method’s flexibility. **There are no limits to what you can create as long as it serves a purpose**. For example, don’t track all the movies you’ve watched just to track them. Only record information that adds context and value to your life (like tracking what you watch to increase the amount of female-directed movies you stream).

> **What’s Valuable and What’s Not?**
> 
> Carroll argues that you should only track things that serve a purpose or add value to your life. However, for many of us, something’s purpose or value isn’t always clear. What’s more, we can measure value in different ways.
> 
> In _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ , Marie Kondo suggests that you determine the value of a possession primarily by functionality and emotional attachment. In other words, it’s worth keeping if it’s useful or brings you joy in some way. However, she also acknowledges that it’s easy to get caught up in prioritizing function over all else, which results in keeping things that are useful, but that you don’t actually like—and when you don’t like something, you’re less likely to use it.
> 
> So how can this information help you with Bullet Journaling? When deciding whether the content you’ve created is valuable, consider both its functionality and its capacity to bring you joy. Even if you’re tracking information that could theoretically be useful—such as the amount of water you drink—if you aren’t excited or curious about it, it’s probably not worth keeping in your journal.

### Putting Productivity Into Practice

Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals of Bullet Journaling and added your customized sections, Carroll suggests putting the method into practice to become _truly_ productive. One of the primary challenges in mastering productivity that he discusses is learning to set proper goals.

Goal setting is a fundamental component of productivity. However, Carroll argues, **if we don’t have continued personal investment in the goals that we set for ourselves, we’re likely to lose motivation** and ultimately face disappointment.

(Shortform note: According to a popular theory of goal-setting developed in the 1990s, personal investment is just one of five principles of successful goal setting. The other four principles are the goal’s specificity, level of challenge, and level of complexity, as well as the presence of feedback.)

Unfortunately, Carroll says, **we tend to set goals based on misguided parameters that lack meaning** , which makes personal investment difficult or impossible. In particular, we choose goals based on others’ experiences (like aiming to save for a house because that’s what your peers are doing), goals that are reactionary (like deciding to run a marathon because your friend said she thought you couldn’t), and goals that are too lofty (like trying to open a tattoo parlor with no prior experience).

(Shortform note: Setting goals based on the meaningless parameters Carroll lists isn’t the only goal-setting obstacle we can run into. In _Goals!_ , Brian Tracy outlines crucial goal-setting pitfalls to avoid to ensure you choose relevant and fulfilling goals. Specifically, he advises that you steer clear of goals that are too vague or unquantifiable, goals that fail to push you out of your comfort zone, goals that have no time frame for completion, and goals that conflict with each other. Even if you avoid the misguided parameters Carroll notes above, you likely won’t successfully meet fulfilling goals if you fall victim to any of these pitfalls.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

To help you be more intentional about choosing goals that genuinely motivate you, Carroll suggests a series of exercises that encourage you to explore what sparks your curiosity, prioritize what matters most, and devise a plan for how to take action. First, he recommends that you **brainstorm a list of personal and professional goals and add them to a goals-focused customized section**.

(Shortform note: If you’re not sure how to get started with brainstorming, there are several methods you can try. The first is to write down every goal you can think of in stream-of-consciousness fashion. Another is to ask yourself goal-specific questions to inspire additional steps or ideas—for example, if your goal is to knit a scarf, asking yourself what specific skills you need can lead to a preliminary goal of mastering the garter stitch. Or, if you prefer something more visual, you can try mind mapping, which involves drawing a “map” that starts with one central goal and branches out to related goals.)

Next, Carroll suggests that you **set timelines for your goals by categorizing them as short, mid, or long term**. This helps you reflect on the effort required to accomplish them, which is important for maintaining motivation. Once you’ve categorized all of your goals according to your desired timeline, Carroll says you should prioritize them even further, choosing only a few important goals to pursue, because **committing to too many goals at once can cause overwhelm and decreased motivation**.

(Shortform note: In addition to overwhelming and demotivating you, setting too many goals can negatively affect your ability to prioritize. According to management experts, when we have many different goals, we’re prone to prioritizing the easiest ones. As a consequence, we ignore or abandon the goals that are more difficult to achieve—but are potentially the most worthwhile. Therefore, aim to focus on a limited number of goals at any given time.)

### Living Your Best Life

Carroll insists that Bullet Journaling can go beyond merely improving your productivity—it can also encourage you to live a higher-quality life. One way it can do this is by helping you let go of what you can’t control.

According to Carroll, learning to differentiate between what we can and can’t control is vital to living a high-quality life. **By letting go of things outside of our influence and choosing to focus instead on how we _respond_ to them, we can shift our mindset from reactive to responsive**. Of course, Carroll acknowledges, letting go can be difficult because there are many displeasing things outside of our control: world events, other people, and even our own feelings.

(Shortform note: In explaining the importance of differentiating between what we can and can’t control, Carroll doesn’t explore _why_ we feel such a strong need to control things. According to research, feeling as if we have control makes us trust ourselves as competent beings with agency. It also reassures us that we aren’t under the control of others. Research has shown that both of these beliefs positively affect our well-being.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Despite this challenge, Carroll argues that it’s possible to adjust your mindset and let go of the uncontrollable. One way to do this is to use your daily record to reflect on situations after they’ve occurred. Instead of immediately reacting to a triggering uncontrollable event, first pause to allow yourself to process what happened. Then, when you’ve had time to think, **write a letter to yourself in your daily record in which you express your feelings and consider your options for how to respond** to the situation.

For example, your first reaction after being stood up on a date might be to send an angry text message to the person. After putting your thoughts down on paper, however, you may realize that you shouldn’t make assumptions about why they didn’t show up for the date—perhaps they had an emergency.

(Shortform note: Research on the benefits of expressive writing has provided some evidence in support of Carroll’s strategy. In one study, for example, participants who had recently lost their jobs were divided into three groups: One group wrote about their emotions surrounding their job loss, one group wrote about topics unrelated to traumatic experiences, and one group didn’t write at all. The results showed that those who specifically wrote about their job loss were re-employed more quickly, presumably because writing expressively helped them to change their perspective on the situation and move on positively.)

Another strategy Carroll recommends for adjusting your perspective is to **reframe tasks that are outside of your control**. He says that often, the reason tasks seem outside of your control is because they’re focused on the outcome, which you may have no power over. For example, a task like “cook a healthy meal that my kids like” is focused on the preferences of others, which you can’t control.

To shift that focus, Carroll suggests that you **break such tasks down further into smaller, actionable steps**. This is because smaller steps tend to focus on the process rather than the outcome and thus are within your control. For example, you could break down “cook a healthy meal that my kids like” into something smaller like “find a new healthy recipe to make this week.” This task can be completed successfully regardless of your kids’ opinions.

> **Outcome vs. Process Goals: Is One Better Than the Other?**
> 
> Carroll encourages readers to break down outcome-focused tasks into process-focused steps. However, this suggestion seems to imply that goals focused on outcome should always be avoided. This begs the question: Is there ever any use for outcome goals?
> 
> According to experts, outcome goals are helpful if you use them in tandem with process goals, where process goals define the steps necessary to achieve the desired outcome. For example, if your outcome goal is to run a marathon, your process goals would be smaller actions you could take to work toward that achievement, such as weight training twice a week.
> 
> The benefit of setting both types of goals is that you can clarify what you hope to ultimately achieve while avoiding the overwhelm of trying to do too much at once. Additionally, you can challenge yourself to rise above what you ever thought possible while maintaining a clear sense of how to get there.
