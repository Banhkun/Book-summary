## Part 5.2: Living Your Best Life—Self-Awareness, Clarity, and Imperfection

In this final part of the guide, we’ll examine the last three ways in which Carroll argues you can use Bullet Journalling to live a happy and fulfilling life: by building self-awareness, gaining clarity on the purpose behind your actions, and embracing imperfection.

### Building Self-Awareness

In our pursuit of living the best quality life possible, we can’t forget about the world around us—after all, our lives don’t exist in a vacuum. Carroll argues that **because our actions can affect others, we have a responsibility to build self-awareness** , increasing the likelihood that we’ll influence others in a positive way.

(Shortform note: Despite Carroll’s argument that we have a responsibility to become more self-aware, research suggests that very few people are. In one study that assessed managers’ perceived versus actual leadership effectiveness, only 10 to 15% were accurate in their self-assessments. In other words, only a fraction was truly self-aware.)

At the same time, Carroll acknowledges that it’s easy to forget how _greatly_ our actions impact others. Whether positive or negative, **what we put out into the world has consequences that affect the quality of our lives and the lives of those around us**. What’s more, research shows that negativity travels especially easily—when we’re exposed to it, we can unintentionally spread it to the people around us.

(Shortform note: The fast spread of negativity is especially evident on social media. A recent study, for instance, sought to discover whether people engage with more positive or negative news on Twitter. The results showed that although the majority of users’ personal content is positive, negative news draws more attention. Not only do news organizations tend to tweet more negative news, but people also share that news more broadly.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll recommends three ways that you can use your journal to build self-awareness:

##### 1) Practicing Self-Compassion

First, Carroll says that a part of building self-awareness and positively impacting others is learning to be kind to yourself through self-compassion. **In being kind to yourself, you’re more likely to be kind to others**.

(Shortform note: Why are we more likely to be kind to others when we’re kind to ourselves? According to research, when we have self-compassion, we’re not only more caring and accepting people but also grant ourselves and others more freedom and autonomy.)

To practice self-compassion, Carroll suggests that you imagine you’re talking to a kind and encouraging friend as you reflect on entries in your journal. Like a friend, **your journal can provide you with evidence to combat your negative thoughts and self-doubt**. During your daily reviews, he recommends that you look at your daily record and gratitude entries, which can encourage you through evidence of your accomplishments and experiences.

(Shortform note: Although self-compassion can help you combat negative thoughts, it’s not meant to alleviate suffering entirely. According to researcher Kristin Neff, the goal of self-compassion is to embrace yourself with the support and comfort needed to bear your pain. What’s more, for some people, pain actually increases when they begin practicing self-compassion, because opening yourself up to love also makes you more vulnerable to your trauma.)

##### 2) Taking Notes on Interactions

Carroll says you can also use your journal to get a clearer picture of your relationships. He explains that you should be aware of who you spend your time with, as not only do you influence them, but they also influence you. One way to do this is to **take notes on your interactions with people in your daily record** , noting both who inspires you and who drains your energy.

(Shortform note: Once you take notes on your interactions with others, what should you do with that information? To evaluate the quality of your relationships as you reflect on them, ask yourself questions such as “Do they invest as much time and energy as I do?”, “Is it easy or difficult to connect with them?”, and “Do we listen to and encourage each other?”)

##### 3) Reflecting on Learning

Finally, Carroll argues that continual learning is one of the best ways to encourage self-awareness, personal growth, and positive impact. **By making learning an important part of your life, you can grow in ways that positively influence the people around you**.

(Shortform note: According to experts, the relationship that Carroll observes between learning and self-awareness works the other way around, too. Specifically, lifelong learning and personal development depend heavily on our awareness of who we are. Without self-awareness, we’re at greater risk of feedback-avoiding behavior that negatively impacts the way we gather, perceive, and learn from information.)

Carroll says you can better integrate learning into your life by making it a part of your daily review. As you reflect on your day, ask yourself questions that help you determine what you’re currently learning and what you want to know more about. Additionally, he recommends that you create a customized section in your journal where you can **list the things you want to learn and brainstorm actions you can take toward learning them**. Once you’ve determined which steps to take, turn them into tasks to add to your daily record, monthly task list, future planner, or another customized section.

(Shortform note: While Carroll’s strategy of setting learning goals has the benefit of being direct, there are more subtle changes and additions you can make in your day-to-day life to encourage learning. Some examples include reading often about a variety of topics, surrounding yourself with intelligent and talented people, taking time to teach or mentor others, and joining discussion groups that expose you to new ideas and perspectives.)

### Gaining Clarity

To live our best lives, Carroll argues that **we must make a deliberate effort to pause and reflect on the _why_ behind our efforts**. This is because when we run on autopilot and act without intention—which we so often do—our actions and experiences lose their context. (This is especially true for responsibilities that aren’t enjoyable, such as doing the dishes or paying bills.) And without context, our lives can start to feel meaningless.

(Shortform note: You may wonder why running on autopilot makes us lose sight of meaning. Mindfulness experts suggest that it relates to two systems in the brain that govern how we spend our time and energy. While the exploration and growth system focuses on meaning, possibility, and connection, the habitual survival system—the brain’s default system—encourages us to repeat familiar behaviors in the name of survival. Without deliberate effort to pursue what really matters to us, we default to what feels safe and comfortable, even if it isn’t meaningful).

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll says there are a couple of ways you can use your journal to gain clarity on why you’re doing what you’re doing:

##### 1) Focus on the Benefits of Difficult Tasks

The first strategy Carroll recommends is to create a customized section dedicated to finding clarity. Its purpose is to help you rediscover the reasons behind your efforts.

To do this, Carroll explains, **scan your daily records for the most difficult tasks**. When you find one, write how completing that task makes you feel on the left side of the spread (for example, “I hate meal planning for the week because it’s so frustrating to have to decide what I want to eat all the time”). Then, on the right side, **write down how that task ultimately benefits you despite how you may feel about it** (for example, “Planning ahead makes it easier to choose healthier options and prevents me from exceeding my grocery budget”).

If this is particularly difficult, Carroll suggests focusing instead on how completing that task benefits the people around you (for example, “Meal planning allows me to cook a little of something that everyone in the family likes, which makes them happy”). He acknowledges that **although this exercise may not make these tasks any more enjoyable, it can make them easier to bear**.

> **Additional Ways of Reframing Tasks**
> 
> Carroll’s suggestion focuses on just one way you can alter the way you think about difficult tasks. However, there are additional ways you can reframe them so that they’re easier to manage.
> 
> An alternative to focusing on the benefits of a task is to focus on _choice_. Instead of thinking about difficult tasks with the mindset of “I have to,” think “I _choose_ to.” Although unpleasant responsibilities tend to feel like obligations, at the end of the day, it’s something you’ve chosen to do for one reason or another. (For example, you may hate mowing the lawn, but maybe you choose to do it anyway so that your child has a place to practice soccer.) Whatever the reason behind your action, bringing it to the forefront of your mind can give you a sense of autonomy that will help you see past the burden of the task.
> 
> Another way to change your mindset surrounding difficult tasks is to think about _why_ they’re important or how they fit into the bigger picture. For example, you may dread folding laundry, but forgoing that step will leave you with wrinkled clothes. While that may not seem like a big deal, it becomes significantly more problematic when you need to make a good first impression, such as in a job interview or on a first date. Keeping these details in mind when dealing with difficult tasks can provide enough justification to keep you motivated.

##### 2) Track Your Progress Through Transfers

The second strategy Carroll recommends is to **track your progress through your journal transfers**. Because it can be hard to see the significance in a given task initially, he says that observing your progress over time gives you the distance needed to see things from a different perspective. For example, although you may dread making student loan payments each month, looking back to see how much you’ve paid off can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivate you to keep going.

(Shortform note: There are a couple of different measures you can use to observe your progress as Carroll suggests. On the one hand, as demonstrated in the student loan payment example, you can consider your progress by looking at how far you’ve come. This strategy is especially useful when you’re only part of the way toward reaching your goal. On the other hand, you can take the opposite approach and look at how _close_ you are to finally accomplishing your goal, which is ideal when you need a final push of motivation.)

**Even with these two strategies, Carroll acknowledges that you may still struggle to find meaning in certain tasks**. If that’s the case, it’s likely that those things aren’t adding value to your life, and you should either let them go or find an alternative task if necessary. For example, if you can’t see the purpose behind your daily morning run, consider cutting it out of your routine or finding an alternative activity that inspires you, such as yoga.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, letting go of a task, or even finding an alternative, isn’t an option; we simply have to do things we don’t want to do. For situations like this, it can be helpful to find other ways to manage your responsibilities. For example, you can learn to set a limit on your daily unpleasant tasks. Whether that’s only doing these tasks at a certain hour of the day or only scheduling a certain number of tasks, establish a boundary you can stick to. Similarly, make a habit of evaluating your current task load before taking on more. Using these strategies can make necessary tasks more bearable and help you avoid burnout.)

### Embracing Imperfection

Carroll says that a final hurdle to living our best lives is our focus on perfection. He argues that **it’s only when we embrace our imperfections and focus on continual improvement that we’ll see a change in the quality of our lives**. Specifically, instead of striving to reach perfection, we should see ourselves as students in the process of learning and free to make mistakes.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll argues that embracing imperfection will improve the quality of your life, he doesn’t provide specific examples of how it will help you. According to mental health experts, embracing imperfection leads to higher resilience to failure, increased self-esteem, less judgment of others, improved emotional well-being, and healthier relationships.)

**Despite recognizing the impossibility of perfection, we still hold ourselves to unrealistic expectations** in many aspects of our lives, like in our health, relationships, or goals. What’s more, we tend to see perfection in terms of all or nothing—either we’re perfect or a failure, with nothing in between.

(Shortform note: Why do so many people fall prey to perfectionism? While unrealistic expectations may be to blame, there’s more to the story. Psychologists say that society’s increase in social media use, as well as greater academic and professional competition, have caused a spike in perfectionistic tendencies over the last 30 years.)

What’s more, Carroll argues, **in trying to achieve perfection, we end up sabotaging our potential**. When we don’t meet our impossibly high standards, we experience self-loathing, abandon our plans, and return to old, counterproductive behaviors.

(Shortform note: While high standards of perfection may be self-sabotaging as Carroll states, some argue that raising our standards to a reasonable degree is necessary to achieve our goals. By having higher expectations for ourselves, we raise our level of performance to meet them, and better performance naturally leads to greater achievement.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll recommends two primary ways to change your mindset and avoid perfectionism. First, use your daily, monthly, and yearly reviews to **track your progress by noting what you’ve accomplished and learned as well as how you can improve moving forward**. (For example, maybe you managed to read two books last month, but this month you’d like to aim for five.) Then, record new goals and tasks based on your reflection.

(Shortform note: Carroll suggests that we can combat feelings of self-loathing by focusing on progress rather than perfection. However, this strategy places exclusive focus on our actions and sends the message that our worth comes solely from our achievements. As a more self-accepting alternative, Brené Brown, author of _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , recommends overcoming perfectionism by practicing self-compassion and changing the way we respond to feelings of shame and judgment. With this strategy, we can embrace imperfection _regardless_ of what we do or don't accomplish.)

Additionally, Carroll suggests that you **create a customized section in your journal that focuses on imperfection** and acts as a space where you can let go and focus on the present moment. While you can use the space however you want, he recommends focusing on activities that will make your notebook feel flawed: Draw with your eyes closed, write with a different pencil grip, or scribble random shapes and designs.

(Shortform note: While Carroll’s suggestion could be useful for the average person, those who struggle deeply with perfectionism would likely have a hard time getting started because of their stubborn resistance to flaws. Because of this, they may benefit from something like the _Wreck This Journal_ series, which encourages creativity and mess-making through a series of guiding prompts that ask journalers to poke holes, color outside the lines, and even deface photos.)
