## Exercise: Reflect on Technology’s Role in Your Life

Consider the role that technology plays in your life to see how Bullet Journaling can benefit you.

* * *

Thinking about the effect of technology on your own life, how has it positively impacted you? (For example, maybe it has helped you stay in contact with your grandparents who live far away.)

On the other hand, how has technology negatively impacted you? (For example, perhaps you spend too much of your workday scrolling on social media.)

Think back to a time when you didn’t have as much access to technology—it could be an earlier period of your life or even a weekend camping trip without electronics. How does that time compare to life with technology? How did you feel then versus now?

Now, specifically consider technology’s effect on your productivity. How does it decrease or increase your productivity? (For example, maybe you’ve noticed that certain apps have had a positive impact on your ability to stay organized.)

Keeping all of this in mind, how do you think the Bullet Journal’s analog method can positively impact your life? (For example, perhaps spending more of your day writing and reflecting—rather than scrolling on social media—will help you build self-awareness.)
