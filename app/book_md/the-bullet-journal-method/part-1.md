## Part 1: Why You Should Start Bullet Journaling

After years spent perfecting his organizational techniques, author Ryder Carroll devised the Bullet Journal Method—**a single-notebook system designed to help him add structure to his life, set goals, and gain clarity on what was important to him**. In just one notebook, he could plan out his days, jot down ideas, and even create illustrations when inspiration struck.

Carroll developed the method after growing tired of his struggle to maintain focus and keep up with his responsibilities. After realizing its potential to help others, he decided to formalize, streamline, and release it to the public through online resources and the eventual publication of _The Bullet Journal Method_. Since then, **countless individuals—from overwhelmed mothers to veterans battling PTSD—have told Carroll that Bullet Journaling has transformed their lives**.

Before diving into the nuts and bolts of Carroll’s system, the first part of this guide will summarize his argument for why you, too, should start Bullet Journaling. Specifically, we’ll talk about how technology has made you busy rather than productive and why Bullet Journaling is the perfect solution. Then, in the remaining parts, we’ll explore how the method works, how to get started with your journal, how to customize your journal, and how to use the practice of Bullet Journaling to improve your productivity and quality of life.

### The Effect of Technology on Productivity

According to Carroll, despite living in a society that glorifies productivity, research has shown that **we’ve become _less_ productive with the rise of technology**. This is because although technology has revolutionized the way we live in countless ways, it has also overloaded us with information, resources, and connections. With so many things fighting for our attention, we can’t possibly focus on all of them. As our attention scatters, our productivity plummets.

(Shortform note: Carroll doesn’t explore _why_ we’re unable to focus on so many things at once, but research suggests it may be because the brain only has two hemispheres available to manage tasks. Therefore, it can only focus on two things at the same time, making juggling more than two responsibilities an impossibility.)

Technology has also taken a toll on our ease of living. Carroll acknowledges that technology has brought us a variety of tools that simplify our daily lives. However, this infinite set of options causes decision fatigue; **instead of focusing our attention on what matters to us, we waste time and energy on trivial choices**. Carroll argues that despite the endless access to information that technology gives us, unlimited access comes at a cost: We feel perpetually distracted and overwhelmed. Studies show that **the average American spends almost half of their waking hours in front of their screens**.

Moreover, Carroll points out that even though technology has allowed us to connect with family members, friends, and others across the globe, maintaining all of these relationships requires time and energy; **we become glued to our devices and social media accounts** in an effort to keep up.

In short, despite our efforts to complete our task lists and accomplish our goals, our overreliance on technology makes us feel overwhelmed and stuck in a perpetual state of “busy” that doesn’t actually move us forward.

(Shortform note: Technology inhibits productivity in several ways that Carroll doesn’t cover. For example, receiving notifications interrupts our workflow and makes it difficult to re-enter a state of concentration. We also sometimes waste valuable time trying to complete tasks in the most technologically efficient way—for example, you may spend hours trying to automate a spreadsheet instead of just filling it out by hand.)

> **Technology Affects More Than Productivity**
> 
> While Carroll’s observations about the effect of technology focus specifically on productivity, there are additional consequences of its omnipresence that he doesn’t cover.
> 
> First, because technology has made life easier, we’ve forgotten how to do things that we once considered basic and essential. For example, thanks to autocorrect tools on computers and cell phones, many people have forgotten how to spell common words. In addition, digital contact lists have practically eliminated the need to remember phone numbers.
> 
> In addition, our screen-time habits are negatively impacting our brains in a variety of ways. For instance, according to the Harvard Medical School, every time we interact with our screens rather than reality, our brains miss out on important stimulation that they normally receive from the world around us. Moreover, when we use our digital devices before going to sleep, the blue light they emit disrupts our sleep patterns and reduces the amount of deep REM sleep we experience, which negatively affects our memory and mental processing.
> 
> Finally, despite spending a lot of time connecting on social media, research shows that people are feeling more alone than ever before. In particular, the data show that those who spend the most time on social media—people under the age of 35—feel the most lonely of all age groups.
> 
> These examples show that the negative effects of technology extend beyond productivity into many areas of daily life.

### Bullet Journaling as a Solution

According to Carroll, the solution to this productivity problem is to use the Bullet Journal Method, **an organizational tool that helps you be intentional about how you spend your time and energy**. It’s a system that archives your life—past, present, and future—tracking not only the day-to-day details but also your choices, your actions, and how you’ve changed over time.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll argues for Bullet Journaling as a _solution_ , psychologists say that journaling can negatively affect your well-being if you’re not careful about how you use it. In particular, it can make you passively observe your life instead of living in the moment, focus on blame rather than solutions, get swept up in negativity, or become self-obsessed. Note, however, that these potential effects apply to journaling in general, and they may not be as relevant to Bullet Journaling specifically.)

Carroll claims that Bullet Journaling can aid you in three ways: getting organized, living in the present moment, and finding clarity on what’s important to you. Let’s discuss each of these in more detail.

#### Get Organized

According to Carroll, one of the main benefits of the**** Bullet Journal Method**** is that**it** **can help you get organized, therefore eliminating the overwhelm that’s hurting your productivity**. This is especially useful because, as mentioned earlier, there are so many possibilities vying for our attention that we simply don’t have the mental capacity to keep track of everything. In an attempt to manage it all, we resort to multitasking, which often results in spreading our notes, ideas, and reminders across any number of phone apps, sticky notes, dry-erase boards, and notebooks.

(Shortform note: Aside from overwhelm, there are other potential consequences of disorganization and clutter that Carroll doesn’t mention. According to psychologists, both physical and mental clutter can significantly hinder your ability to function. Specifically, you may suffer decreased subjective well-being, poorer eating habits and mental health, and less efficient thinking and visual processing.)

Fortunately, Carroll says, the Bullet Journal Method **solves this problem by providing a single outlet to declutter your mind—and your desk**. Additionally, because the method utilizes a notebook, it offers flexibility that technology can’t. Whereas tech tools either have an excess of features or narrow functionality, a notebook is customizable to your specific organizational needs.

(Shortform note: The excess of features in tech tools that Carroll refers to is a common phenomenon in product design called “feature creep” or “scope creep.” In an effort to create the best product and please the widest audience, designers sometimes unintentionally overcomplicate a product by adding too many features. Fortunately, just as Carroll describes, feature creep isn’t a problem in Bullet Journaling, as only _you_ are in charge of the journal’s design and use.)

#### Live in the Present

Another primary benefit of the Bullet Journal Method, according to Carroll, is that**it encourages you to slow down and focus on the present moment**. This is important because our endless distractions and urgency to keep busy make us feel like life is passing us by. We’ve become so consumed by our day-to-day lives that we’re now largely unaware of our surroundings.

(Shortform note: Research seems to support Carroll’s claim that we’re prone to living with little awareness of the present moment. One study, for example, showed that 96% of people in the UK admitted to making decisions on autopilot. What’s more, 39% say that the place where they’re most likely to slip into autopilot is at home, which is ideally where we engage the most with our lives and the people we love.)

So how can the Bullet Journal Method help you slow down? Carroll says it’s by requiring you to write by hand. **Because handwriting is less efficient than typing or dictating, it forces you to pay closer attention to what you’re writing** and therefore changes the way you engage with what you’re writing about, whether that’s your thoughts or the world around you.

(Shortform note: Handwriting doesn’t just _change_ your engagement with what you’re writing—it _increases_ it. According to research, the act of writing by hand activates more complex neural connections than typing. Furthermore, researchers say that the precise movements involved in writing by hand benefit the brain’s learning processes.)

Carroll argues that **by focusing on the here and now, you can build not only stronger _self_ -awareness but also awareness of what’s going on around you**, which helps you increase your productivity.

(Shortform: Increased productivity isn’t the only positive outcome of building stronger self-awareness. Psychologists point to a variety of additional benefits of this practice, including increased empathetic responses, self-regulation, creative achievement, self-esteem, and ability to handle failure.)

#### Find Clarity

According to Carroll, a final fundamental benefit of the Bullet Journal Method is that **it helps you reflect on your life and get clear on what’s important to you**. He argues that this is crucial because our state of perpetual busyness creates distance between our actions and beliefs. We lose sight of why we’re doing what we’re doing, essentially running on autopilot.

(Shortform note: While he observes that perpetual busyness can indicate that you’re living on autopilot, Carroll doesn’t acknowledge how hard this autopilot mode can be to recognize or point to signs of autopilot you should look for. According to psychologists, you may be living on autopilot if you have a predictable routine, tend to worry about pleasing others, feel like you constantly lose track of time, and believe you’re missing out on meaningful experiences.)

With the Bullet Journal Method, however, Carroll says **you can form a regular habit of introspection by tracking your experiences and actions over time**. This record gives you opportunities to reflect and clarify what matters to you—for example, the tasks you find most fulfilling. And once you’ve found that clarity, the method can aid you in setting and working toward meaningful goals that can help you become more productive than ever before.

(Shortform note: While introspection can be beneficial, it has some potential pitfalls. Psychologists say that if you don’t practice introspection in the right way, it can negatively impact your mental health. Specifically, if introspection becomes an obsessive habit, it can cause stress, anxiety, and depression.)

### Additional Benefits of Bullet Journaling

In addition to the advantages already mentioned, Carroll explains that the analog nature of the Bullet Journal Method provides further benefits that other tools and methods can’t offer. For example, because **notebooks** **are 100% customizable, they** **foster creativity and inspiration** , which are easy to lose sight of when you’re burnt out by demands on your time. The promise of a fresh page each day reminds you that life is full of possibility—every day is a blank slate, and it’s up to you to make something of it.

(Shortform note: Why is fostering creativity important? Research shows that creativity benefits us in different ways. For example, one study suggests that engaging in just one creative activity a day, such as playing music or drawing, boosts positivity. There are indirect benefits of creativity too—a 2010 survey of more than 1,500 CEOs from 60 countries and 33 industries found that executives value creativity more than any other business skill.)
