## Exercise: Identify Your Niche

In the first section of the guide, we discuss Lavingia’s advice for finding your niche. Try a brief exercise to get you started.

* * *

List your hobbies and interests, including anything you do by yourself or with a group. Then make notes next to each entry about any associated groups you belong to, either in person or online.

Now, visit social media sites and search for your communities, using the search tool or hashtags. Join a few and start exploring! As you explore, take notes on any posts, topics, articles, or discussions that pique your interest. What made you most excited? Can you use those topics to narrow or shift your focus and find more groups?

Once you’ve narrowed your focus to a few communities you're really interested in, read more carefully through posts and discussions and try to identify any problems you see people mentioning. Make note of those, as well as any potential solutions that people mention or that you can think of.
