## 1-Page Summary

When you experience a negative or stressful event, do you think through your responses carefully and act exactly as you want to? Or do you find yourself caught up in the emotions of the moment, acting in ways that you later feel embarrassed or ashamed of? Are your emotions knee-jerk reactions that you can't seem to control?

In _Emotional Agility _(2016), clinical psychologist and management consultant Susan David explains that **most people react instinctively __ to the way they _perceive_ events**—and these perceptions are based on emotional, often-untrue narratives explaining why those events took place.**** Driven by their narratives, people often react in ways that don't match the practical needs of the moment—like blowing up over their spouse's simple mistake—and don't align with their values, the things most important to them in life.

David argues that **you can break free of your controlling narratives through _emotional agility,_ the skill of seeing events and your emotions objectively. **It allows you to choose your responses—rather than reacting based on emotion-driven instincts—and thereby manage negative events with calm clarity. You’ll live more intentionally within your values.

(Shortform note: While David focuses almost exclusively on the control _negative_ emotions have over you, it’s important to consider how _positive_ emotions control you, too. Research suggests that emotions usually seen as positive __ can also negatively impact your choices. For example, optimism can make you more likely to take risks—for example, a feeling of optimistic excitement at the casino may drive you to spend much more money than you’d intended. Throughout the guide, consider how emotional agility’s principles can apply to _both_ the negative _and_ positive emotions that control your behavior.)

This guide will cover David’s ideas in three parts:

  * **Part 1: The Controlling Power of Narratives** explains what narratives are and how common methods of dealing with them _negatively_ impact your life.
  * **Part 2: Developing Emotional Agility** details how you can replace your controlling narratives with an objective __ perspective on your emotions and the events in your life. This will give you the freedom to _respond deliberately_ to events, rather than _reacting instinctively._
  * **Part 3: Living Your Life to the Fullest Through Emotional Agility** covers how you can live in alignment with your values when your narratives no longer control you.



In commentary, we’ll explain the origins of David’s ideas, the scientific evidence behind them, and how to apply them to your life.

> **The Origins of Emotional Agility**
> 
> David first discussed emotional agility in a 2013 _Harvard Business Review article_. In the article, David explains that her emotional agility principles are derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The ACT model's principles are meant to help patients view their thoughts objectively, be more self-aware, and set goals based on their values.
> 
> ACT was developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Steven C. Hayes and his colleagues, and it’s been taught by many mental health professionals since. For decades,__ Hayes and others have referred to the practice of ACT’s principles as “psychological flexibility.” David’s term “emotional agility” is perhaps more approachable, reminding you to be wary of how your _emotions_ control you—instead of having the academic connotations of the word “psychology.” Similarly, her use of “agility” may remind you to act deliberately, while “flexibility” might suggest a more passive reaction __ to your emotions.
> 
> In 2020, Hayes published _A Liberated Mind_ , which takes a deep, technical approach to ideas similar to those of _Emotional Agility_. After familiarizing yourself with ACT’s principles in _Emotional Agility,_ you might consider reading _A Liberated Mind_ to gain a more academic perspective and learn about additional topics such as integrating ACT’s principles (which deal with the spiritual concept of the self as separate from the body, sensations, and emotions) with religion.

### Part 1: The Controlling Power of Narratives

Your brain is programmed to take in sensory information and interpret it through _narratives_ explaining**** how and why the world works. David explains that **people instinctively believe these narratives are true because they’re informed by _emotions,_** which we’re wired to pay attention to. Emotions serve the evolutionary purpose of creating a physiological reaction __ in your body in response to external stimuli _._ You may not need to run from danger like your ancestors, but your brain is still neurochemically wired to react to emotions—and their associated narratives.

(Shortform note: The human brain contains hundreds of millions of pattern-recognizing neurons—in other words, it’s constantly seeking to find meaning in the information it processes. Because it’s so good at this, it’s prone to seeing patterns where there aren’t any—a phenomenon called apophenia. Because apophenia drives us to associate irrelevant pieces of information with one another, it often leads to irrational narratives. For example, if you happen to place badly in two marathons while wearing your favorite blue shirt, you might draw the conclusion that the blue shirt is “bad luck” and _caused_ you to do poorly.)

If you’re walking home at night and consider using a long, unlit street for a shortcut, your brain might draw upon a narrative that dark streets are dangerous. Your brain also gives you sweaty palms and a feeling of dread to encourage you to listen and avoid the shortcut.

(Shortform note: Although human emotions evolved as a survival mechanism, that same neurochemical system can backfire in the modern day, allowing your emotions to control you in a physical way. Your brain can’t tell the difference between physical dangers like a charging lion and the abstract “danger” of a looming work deadline—it just perceives a threat and puts you into fight-or-flight mode. This creates physiological responses throughout your body, including the release of stress hormones like cortisol. Consistently high levels of cortisol can disrupt many of your body’s systems, so this “survival mechanism” can actually cause you physical harm.)

#### When Narratives _Don’t_ Help You

Your brain often makes mistakes __ when interpreting meaning from sensory information—and, because it relies on these faulty interpretations to form narratives, the **narratives it creates don’t always reflect objective reality.**

For example, a middle schooler might fail a test because he played video games instead of studying. His parents express disappointment __ at his __ priorities—which the student's brain misinterprets as anger at his failure. He forms the narrative, "If I fail at school, my parents will hate me." As the student grows older, he views professional life through the old narrative’s lens: "If I fail in my work project, my boss __ will hate me." This leads to an unfounded fear of his boss, anxiety over failure, and risk aversion.

(Shortform note: Not only does your brain’s misinterpretation of stimuli affect the narratives that inform your emotions, but research suggests that the reverse may _also_ be true: A negative emotional state can alter—or impair—your visual perception, potentially causing your brain to miss important information when forming a narrative. This can become a feedback loop: Misinterpreted stimuli can alter your perception, and this altered perception causes you to _further_ misinterpret stimuli.)

Narratives deliver information through an **internal stream of consciousness that constantly** **fills your mind with thoughts, associated memories, and emotions**. When you reflect on these thoughts, this inner voice also drives you to judge _yourself_ through the lens of your narratives. David says these self-judgments create emotions of inadequacy and frustration.

For example, if you experience a setback at work, your inner voice might whisper that you'll _never_ succeed—prompting shame and self-loathing. If you instinctively believe and act according to this narrative and these emotions, you might avoid risks that could lead to growth and fulfillment.

(Shortform note: If you’re in the throes of self-judgment, it can be difficult to know if your feelings of inadequacy and frustration are warranted or not. In _The Stories We Tell Ourselves,_ R. Scott Gornto offers a simple technique to see the bigger picture and judge the accuracy of your narratives: After you make a narrative-driven assumption, compare it to the real-life outcome. If your narrative says you’ll never succeed at work, acknowledging your successes proves this to be an irrational narrative you shouldn’t listen to.)

#### Unhealthy Responses to Your Controlling Narratives

When you feel negative emotions about an event, past or present, you may be tempted to use one of two common—but unhelpful—methods to deal with the pain: stifling and wallowing. In this section, we’ll explore each method and explain David’s reasoning for why both methods fail.

##### Stiflers

**Stiflers attempt to avoid feeling or acknowledging negative emotions that arise from their narratives**. They believe only weak people are affected by emotions and choose to reject them. David explains that you can ignore your emotions temporarily, but they’ll grow stronger as you push them away—until they eventually explode. For example, after many months of stifling hurt at your spouse’s tendency to forget important events, you unexpectedly blow up at them for forgetting to pick up garlic at the store as you asked.

(Shortform note: While studies seem to support the idea that emotional repression may be linked to heightened aggression—or in some cases, violent behavior—it’s worth noting that the “explosion” may not always affect _others_. As Dr. John Sarno explains in _The Mindbody Prescription_ , repressed emotions—especially the emotion of rage—can manifest in chronic, sometimes debilitating, physical pain.)

Moreover, **Stiflers miss out on the ways emotions can be valuable.** Remember that your emotions not only help you avoid danger, but they can also allow you to thrive. For example, working a dead-end job might frustrate you because you believe the narrative that you deserve more fulfilling work. _Stifling_ that frustration so that you don’t feel daily discomfort can also leave you unmotivated to find something better.

(Shortform note: Many people associate the idea that emotions are weakness (and that emotionlessness is strength) with Stoicism, an ancient Roman philosophy that’s regaining popularity today. However, this is a mistaken interpretation of the philosophy. Stoicism advocates creating your best possible life by using logic to free yourself from the control of your emotions and choosing to live wisely and courageously. In fact, Stoicism teaches that some emotions, like feeling joy in the presence of a loved one, are a valuable part of life.)

##### Wallowers

**Wallowers** **ruminate on their narratives and negative emotions rather than stifling them.** They often fixate on past negative experiences, repeatedly reliving the emotions associated with those events. These emotions and experiences can range from traumatic (hating a drunk driver who caused your long-term injury) to annoying (complaining to your spouse about a coworker’s irritating habit). David says that those who wallow in one __ area likely do so in many other __ areas of life, using wallowing as a general approach to handling negative emotions.

David says that **Wallowers often believe they’re working through their emotions** in a healthy way by thinking about them over and over. However, the strategy of wallowing never moves past an eternal loop of “think about it some more,” which only intensifies the negative emotions and takes up mental space you could otherwise use to improve your life. Without a way to move on from painful emotions, merely thinking about __ them can’t free you from __ them.

> **Other Motivations for Wallowing**
> 
> Although David describes wallowing as a strategy people use to try and work through their emotions about an event, research shows that the reasons for wallowing may be a bit more nuanced.
> 
> First, in some cases, people aren’t purposely ruminating on past experiences. People with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) _do_ revisit traumatic events and emotions from the past, but they do so _involuntarily_. ACT’s focus on accepting your emotions can help alleviate these symptoms—suggesting that ACT is helpful whether or not your wallowing is deliberate.
> 
> Second, research shows that not everyone wallows because they think doing so will help them work through their emotions. Instead, some choose this strategy because they're not sure how to feel about an event. Others wallow in emotions that aren’t clearly attached to an event in an effort to understand what caused __ them.

### Part 2: Developing Emotional Agility

The good news is, you don't have to let your narratives—or your emotional responses to them—control you. Instead, David advocates cultivating the skill of _emotional agility_ —viewing events and emotions objectively and responding deliberately.

David describes four steps for developing emotional agility:

  1. **Label your emotions.**
  2. **Accept your emotions.**
  3. **View your emotions objectively.**
  4. **Choose your values.**



Let’s explore each step in detail.

#### Step 1: Label Your Emotions

The first step to achieving emotional agility is**_labeling your emotions_** —that is, **using honest, specific language to describe what you’re feeling.** David argues that the combination of honesty and specificity forces you to understand the exact nature of your emotions, no matter how uncomfortable. Otherwise, you might feel tempted to ignore them or to use vague words to avoid painful vulnerability.

(Shortform note: While David focuses on the importance of fully understanding _negative_ emotions, as we noted earlier, it’s also important to understand and engage with your _positive_ emotions. Research suggests that doing so can improve your resilience to stress by helping you consider more creative solutions to problems in life—whereas negative emotions cause you to fixate on the issue at hand. For example, if you’re feeling apprehensive about major restructuring at your job, try changing your perspective by labeling the positive emotions you’re feeling: “I’m curious about what opportunities this will create, and I’m excited about the new skills I’ll learn.”)

For example, you might carry a decades-old burden of shame for never completing your education. You’ve previously talked about these feelings in a way that lacks specificity: “I wish I’d ‘done things differently’ in life.” Based on this generality,, you think __ a career change will make you feel better—but this doesn’t address your feelings of shame and therefore doesn’t help. On the other hand, labeling your emotions precisely might mean saying, “For decades, I’ve regretted dropping out of college. I’ve felt shame for failing and wasting my parents’ money. Every day since then, I feel sick at the mention of school or career growth.”

> **Problems With Labeling Your Emotions**
> 
> While labeling your emotions is the foundational step of developing emotional agility, some people have great difficulty doing so, due to alexithymia, or emotional blindness.
> 
> While David seems to suggest that people with alexithymia can learn to label their emotions just like anyone else, alexithymia may be a more serious issue requiring professional help. Research suggests that alexithymia is a depression-like personality trait that may increase your risk of serious health concerns like substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidal behavior. While applying principles from ACT like labeling your emotions, self-compassion, and introspection can help, you should seek the help of a mental health professional if you think you suffer from alexithymia.

#### Step 2: Accept Your Emotions

Once you’ve labeled your emotions, you can begin the second step of developing emotional agility: _accepting your emotions._ This means**compassionately giving yourself permission to feel, struggle, and fail.** You’ll acknowledge that neither the act of feeling unwanted emotions—particularly guilt and shame—nor the act of believing inaccurate narratives make you less of a person.

To achieve acceptance and self-compassion, David encourages you to look at your own faults and flaws as you would those of a loved one or a young child—with forgiveness. This strips away the accusatory power that self-narratives often hold.

In our example of feeling guilty about dropping out of college, you might be telling yourself that failing in the past makes you a failure. Self-compassion in this case might mean saying, “I regret my past decision, but I can still learn from it and make different choices in the future.” You acknowledge your past mistakes without believing the lie that you should feel guilt or shame _forever_.

David notes that accepting your emotions can help you use them for their evolutionary purpose: prompting behaviors that can improve your life. Regret from dropping out of college might prompt reflection and planning for a return to school or an attempt at moving up in your career— _without_ the fear that you’re a failure who’ll never succeed in new ventures.

> **The Importance of Accepting Your Emotions**
> 
> David emphasizes the power of self-compassion, but it may be even more important than she claims. Research suggests that mindfulness and facing your emotions—crucial components of emotional agility—might _only_ be effective for positive mental and physical health outcomes when paired with acceptance. In one study, participants who paid attention to and accepted their emotions reduced their stress hormone and blood pressure levels. Participants who _only_ paid attention to their emotions but _didn’t_ accept them saw a much weaker improvement.
> 
> Research also shows that _exposure_ to a source of stress (through exposure therapy) is effective for reducing physiological responses to the stressor. This helps your brain understand that the source of stress isn’t actually a physical danger. Similarly, accepting negative emotions and realizing they’re not a threat to you can help you feel less stress when you experience those emotions.

#### Step 3: View Your Emotions Objectively

Labeling and accepting your emotions goes a long way to reducing their intensity and power over you—which makes it easier to take the third step of developing emotional agility: **viewing your emotions from an objective perspective**. David says when you’re able to look at your emotions—and the narratives they come from—from a rational, objective standpoint, you’ll be able to see the flaws in your narrative and in your emotional reactions to it.

For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might feel anger as your brain forms the narrative, "He _deliberately_ cut in front of me!" For the rest of your commute, you wallow in your anger. However, if you think about the situation objectively, you’ll realize that the other driver likely _wasn’t_ trying to mistreat you—he simply didn’t see you—and there’s no reason to be so angry.

(Shortform note: Some people may find it more difficult than others to see their emotions objectively. Research shows that people with Major Depressive Disorder have lower activity in the part of the brain responsible for voluntary emotional regulation, and injuries to the frontal lobe can hinder your ability to recognize your emotions.)

Additionally, **understanding that your emotions are temporary _experiences,_ not absolute _truths_ about your life helps lessen the power of the narratives you hold about yourself**.**** For example, the fact that you feel sad __ in reaction to an event doesn’t mean you can’t handle stress or that your situation is hopeless. It only means that, at that moment, you feel sad.

David offers two techniques for gaining an objective perspective: _mindfulness_ for handling your present emotions and _journaling_ for handling your past emotions.

> **How Emotions Relate to Personality**
> 
> While David says that your emotions are only temporary and aren’t _truths_ about you and your life, some psychological trait researchers emphasize a link between your personality traits and the emotions you frequently feel. One study describes a link between various emotions (and emotional regulation strategies) and the classic “big five” personality traits:
> 
>   * **Openness to experience:** More curious people tend to be more accepting of their emotions.
> 
>   * **Conscientiousness:** More organized people tend to be more mindful of their emotions.
> 
>   * **Extraversion:** More outgoing people are more likely to experience positive emotions.
> 
>   * **Agreeableness:** More compassionate people are more likely to feel positive emotions toward others.
> 
>   * **Neuroticism:** More nervous people are more likely to experience negative emotions.
> 
> 

> 
> However, while these traits are useful descriptors, they don’t _define_ you. In _Personality Isn’t Permanent, _psychologist Benjamin Hardy says your personality changes throughout your life—in response to both major life events and your daily habits and choices. Indeed, studies show that as people grow older, they tend to become more outgoing, organized, and agreeable.

##### Handle Present Emotions With Mindfulness

Mindfulness is the act of **paying attention to your senses, emotions, and surroundings without judgment.** David suggests that by paying attention to the stimuli in your surroundings—and the emotions that arise from your thoughts about these stimuli—you can weaken your instinct to believe your narratives. Your brain avoids mindfulness to save you mental energy in everyday life: If you can __ pour a glass of water without paying close attention, you’ll likely do so on autopilot every time you’re thirsty. While on autopilot in this way, you’re more susceptible to your narratives and emotions controlling you.

However, David says you don’t need to be mindful at every moment in order to ward against narrative and emotional control. Instead, pay deliberate attention to your surrounding stimuli from time to time throughout the day. You’ll gradually become more mindful with practice.

> **A Buddhist Perspective From _Mindfulness in Plain English_**
> 
> David briefly mentions that you shouldn’t judge your emotions and perceptions while practicing mindfulness. Looking into the original Buddhist principle of mindfulness clarifies the importance of a nonjudgmental perspective. In _Mindfulness in Plain English,_ Buddhist monk Gunaratana describes a few characteristics of mindfulness as they relate to being aware of—but not assigning value to—your emotions and surroundings:
> 
>   * Mindfulness is nonconceptual awareness. There is no _conscious_ thought, where judgment happens.
> 
>   * Mindfulness is nonjudgmental awareness. You can’t be aware if you’re judging all of the stimuli around you.
> 
>   * Mindfulness is awareness of change. However, while it watches this change, it doesn’t comment on it.
> 
> 

> 
> While David’s principles of mindfulness align with Buddhist principles, her practical suggestions differ slightly. She says you can practice mindfulness by intensely focusing on objects or actions for a period of time. On the other hand, Gunaratana argues that mindfulness isn’t the same as concentration: Unlike mindfulness, which should have an element of ease, concentration requires effort and force.

##### Handle Past Emotions With Journaling

Journaling means writing down your experiences, feelings, and thoughts—or narrating them into a voice recorder. Unlike mindfulness, which deals with present emotions, journaling is a technique for processing _past_ emotions and narratives. David says journaling naturally leads you to label and accept your emotions, offering you a more objective understanding of __ those emotions. Journaling can reduce the power of lifelong emotions and narratives, preparing you to actively choose your responses to emotions in the future.

> **Consider _The Bullet Journal Method_**
> 
> While journaling can be a helpful practice, research suggests that it can easily turn into a form of wallowing if you journal about stressful events themselves instead of your emotions related to those events. One journaling method that may be particularly well-suited to enable emotional agility instead of wallowing is bullet journaling.
> 
> In _The Bullet Journal Method,_ Ryder Carroll suggests the following techniques:
> 
>   * Write by hand. Writing by hand is usually slower than typing or speaking, so you’re more likely to mindfully pay attention to your emotions and surroundings while writing.
> 
>   * Reflect on the past. Carroll encourages you to reflect on past experiences by writing about them daily, considering your feelings and different ways you could have chosen to respond to events.
> 
>   * Plan for the future. Regularly revisiting your goals for the future helps you think ahead to what you _want_ to do, and planning your goals far enough in advance allows you to tweak them as you discover what values you want to live by (which we’ll explore next).
> 
> 


#### Step 4: Choose Your Values

Now that you’ve learned how to take back control from your narratives and emotions, you can move on to the final step of developing emotional agility: choosing your values. Values are the **guiding principles that shape your behaviors and decisions, the things in life that you believe are most important.** David explains that _everyone_ has values, whether they realize it or not—though for most people, many of these values are intrinsically tied to unconscious narratives.

For example, your extended family might consider “family” a core value—and look down on you for cutting an abusive parent out __ of your life. You might then feel tempted to believe the narrative that you must always remain in contact with your family, no matter what.

David recommends **contemplating the values others impose on you.** Examine your behavior across different settings in your life. Do you act or speak differently around friends, family, and others? If so, why? Does this arise from a desire to appease __ or impress __ others who value certain behaviors more __ than you do?

(Shortform note: In _101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think,_ author Brianna Wiest suggests that the compulsion to adopt others’ values as your own comes from the need for external validation. Early in life, you likely created a narrative that conforming to the expectations of others was the only way you could experience comfort and happiness: If you acted according to their desires and expectations, you were rewarded—for example, with extra attention and affection. On the other hand, if you acted against their desires and expectations, you were punished—for example, with rejection or social humiliation.)

##### Choose and Pursue Your _Personal_ Values

David says that besides the values you receive from others, **you also carry a set of _personal, unique_ values that, when pursued, will give you a sense of fulfillment and purpose.** When you objectively understand your emotions, you don’t instinctively believe what your narratives and emotions say you _should_ value.__ You’re free to purposely determine—and live by—your personal values.

David gives advice on how to determine your values: **Ask yourself what life you’d pursue if you had no obstacles or stress standing in your way.** When you go to bed each night, think over your day and decide what parts of it were valuable and which didn’t feel fulfilling. Imagine what your future self might think of your current values—and where those values will lead you in the future.

(Shortform note: It can be intimidating to consider every aspect of your life to determine what you value within it. In _Designing Your Life, _Bill Burnett and Dave Evans suggest an exercise to guide your thoughts. Think of your values in terms of four categories: health (mental, physical, and spiritual), work (both paid and unpaid), joy (what makes you happy and relaxed), and interpersonal relationships. Contemplate how satisfied you feel in each category. If you don’t feel satisfied in a category, think about what would improve your satisfaction—this will highlight where your current value set may be falling short.)

> **Choose Value-Based Goals**
> 
> Once you have your values in mind, how do you set goals that honor your values and make them a more central part of your life? Simon Sinek's _Start With Why_ offers a way to set value-based goals. He explains that truly great companies start with a “why” _—_ values that inspire you and give you a feeling of purpose—instead of starting with a “what,” or their products and services. Though Sinek wrote this book to help companies __ make values-based goals, you can adapt his principles to choosing personal __ goals as well. Let’s explore how:
> 
> Once you’ve determined your personal values, decide the actions you're willing to take to pursue your values—and note actions you’re _not_ willing to take, or actions that contradict your values. For example, if you value “family,” consider what you’re willing to do to honor this value. Would you be willing to adjust your work schedule to attend a child's extracurricular activities? Are there some actions you won't take because they'll harm __ one value, even if they serve __ another?
> 
> Then, choose your goals based on these reflections. Sinek suggests turning a value into a concrete action: The value "family" might become, "Eat dinner with my family every weeknight."

### Part 3: Pursuing the Life You Want

Even after you develop the skill of emotional agility, your past still affects you—a past shaped by narratively and emotionally driven decisions. Changing the life you spent years building according to your narratives won’t be easy, but living by a couple of David’s principles will put you on the right path:

  1. **Grow through gradual change.**
  2. **Live for the future, not the past.**



We’ll explain how these principles can help you start living by your values while avoiding falling back into the trap of narrative and emotional control.

#### Principle #1: Grow Through Gradual Change

Though emotional agility gives you techniques to choose how you act and respond to events in your life, **shifting from living by your _narratives_ to living by your _values_ involves making many small, deliberate choices every day that serve your values.**

Studies show that setting small __ goals for change is more likely to result in success than committing to huge, life-changing goals all at once. When your goals are smaller, the stakes for failure are lower. David says that because you won’t be held back by emotions that often accompany failure, like fear of shame or embarrassment, you’ll be more likely to succeed.

(Shortform note: You don’t have to abandon long-term goals in lieu of __ setting smaller ones. Instead, consider breaking down large goals into __ smaller goals—giving you the benefits of smaller goals while still letting you work toward a larger one. In _The 12 Week Year,_ Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington offer advice for how to do this efficiently, suggesting that you set specific metrics and deadlines for your smaller goals. This helps you track your progress and see where you need to make adjustments if you want to ultimately succeed at your larger goal.)

**David emphasizes three avenues for successful, gradual change: your belief in your abilities, your attitude toward change, and your routines.** Let’s explore each in detail.

##### Avenue 1: Your Belief in Your Abilities

To escape controlling narratives of fear and helplessness, David urges you to choose to believe that you’re capable of change and growth. Studies show that **you’re more likely to succeed in your goals for change when you believe that capacity is within your power.**

However, David doesn’t advise simply believing you will succeed at _every_ goal regardless of its scope or the obstacles that stand in your way. Instead, she suggests approaching _low-stakes_ goals with the belief that you will succeed. Over time, you’ll build a new narrative that you’re truly capable of success.

(Shortform note: While researchers agree that believing in your ability to succeed is an important foundation for achieving goals, it’s important to avoid _over_ confidence, especially when you lack the skills to approach a certain problem. This can lead you to make dangerous mistakes, like trying to wire your own home despite knowing little about electrical safety. Psychologists note the common mental bias of the Dunning-Kruger effect, the tendency for people to overestimate their knowledge or expertise in an area. To avoid the Dunning-Kruger effect, ask yourself how your assumptions might be flawed, and ask people with expertise in the area of your intended goal for feedback and critique.)

##### Avenue 2: Your Attitude Toward Change

The work of pursuing your goals—spending hours job hunting, for example—can feel like an unpleasant chore. This can make you less likely to follow through with your goals in the long term. To combat this frustration, **reframe your responsibilities and tasks as things you genuinely _want_ to do**—and as stepping stones toward goals that you also _want_ to achieve.

David says you’re more likely to feel motivated and committed in the long term when you approach tasks in this way.

(Shortform note: Researchers agree that reframing responsibilities to emphasize that you _want_ to take them on is a powerful way to keep motivated. However, you should be careful when reframing—you don’t want to fall into a _new_ controlling narrative by ignoring the negative elements of your situation or telling yourself that you have to stay positive. After all, your responsibilities _won’t_ always be free of negative emotions, and an objective view of your situation will include the bad along with the good.)

##### Avenue 3: Your Routines

In addition to prompting your emotional reactions to narratives, your body and brain also drive you toward instinctive actions __ requiring little to no conscious thought: _routines._ When you repeatedly make the same desired choice—perhaps choosing fruit over candy if your value is “healthy eating”—that choice gradually becomes an instinctive routine.

**David offers two ways to sculpt your routines to promote a gradual change that will serve your values:**

**1) Adjust your environment.** Change how easily you can access things that help or hurt your values. If you want to journal instead of looking at your phone first thing in the morning, keep your journal by your bedside and leave your phone on a charger at the other end of the house.

**2) Adjust an existing routine.** It’s easier to change an _existing_ routine __ than to create a _new_ one, so a fairly simple way to add your values into your life is resolving to do a values-supporting behavior at the same time as a step in your routine. For example, if you want to show your partner you love her, you can add “write a caring note” to your current routine of preparing coffee.

David adds that if you habitually struggle with certain negative emotions, you can add the extra step of coming up with a positive response to your emotion. For example, if you frequently feel exasperated at your child’s behavior, you can tell yourself, “When I feel frustrated, I’ll stop, decide how I want to respond, and _then_ answer.”

David warns you to stay aware and critical of your routines—even the new ones that serve your values. Falling too deeply into any routine puts you at risk of falling back into mindless behavior and automatic reactions.

(Shortform note: It can be difficult to remain mindful of your routines and whether they continue to serve your values over time. One way to do so is by conducting a regular audit of your routines—asking yourself questions that reveal whether they continue to support your values: Does this routine still serve a purpose, or is it just a habit? Do you care more about following the steps of the routine than about its original purpose? Does a change of plans that interrupts your routine put you in a bad mood? Does your routine feel boring? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, take a closer look at that routine’s place in your life.)

> **How Habits Work**
> 
> Understanding how __ routines and habits work can help you adjust them when necessary. In _The Power of Habit, _Charles Duhigg describes three essential elements for how a habit works:
> 
>   * **Cue:** This is a trigger that signals the starting point of your habit and tells your brain to move into automatic mode to execute a specific routine. For example, you see a cookie and feel the urge to eat it.
> 
>   * **Routine:** You act out the physical, mental, or emotional sequence of behavior that your brain has stored. For example, you pick up the cookie and eat it.
> 
>   * **Reward:** This is the result of your routine and signals the end of your habit. For example, you feel a sugar rush from eating the cookie.
> 
> 

> 
> You can deliberately _add_ rewards to habits (like taking a short walk outdoors or eating a small piece of candy) to engineer the reward phase of a habit you’re trying to build. This principle also applies when adjusting an existing routine. If you’re trying to cut down on a habit of eating cookies, you might try drinking a cup of tea instead—and perhaps drinking it with less sugar over time.

#### Principle #2: Live for the Future, Not the Past

David warns against believing the sunk-cost fallacy when pursuing your goals. The sunk-cost fallacy is a narrative that insists you should continue pursuing a goal no matter what to avoid wasting the time, money, and other resources you’ve already spent pursuing it.

Perhaps you find your career unfulfilling. You might still feel reluctant to leave a position it took years to reach. Even if another career seems more satisfying, your narrative might provoke feelings of loyalty to your company, fear of the unknown, and perhaps even guilt at the idea of “wasting” years of your life.

The sunk-cost fallacy can be a difficult narrative and set of emotions to view objectively. Nevertheless, David urges you to consider an alternative perspective: Instead of considering what you’ve _invested_ in a goal, consider what you _stand to lose_ by continuing to pursue that goal. If you don’t change your situation, what opportunities might you miss? By acknowledging that _keeping_ your current goals could mean _wasting_ opportunities, you strip the sunk-cost fallacy of its controlling power.

(Shortform note: At its foundation, the sunk-cost fallacy is about your emotional investment in a decision. So, while you might be able to “outsmart” your logic by considering potential loss, you can also try applying the principles of emotional agility to the emotions surrounding your investment: Label _precisely_ why you’re having a hard time shifting your goals, objectively consider the pros and cons of staying the course, and mindfully consider how your current goals are or are not aligned with your personal values.)
