## Chapter 3: Twin Peaks and Cop Rock

As head of ABC Entertainment, Bob Iger’s job was to catch up to the prime-time leader, NBC. ABC had a few well-performing shows, like _Roseanne_ and _The Wonder Years_ , but NBC was far ahead, with their hits in _The Cosby Show_ , _Cheers_ , and _LA Law_.

More specifically, Iger’s job was to greenlight shows that would be ABC’s next big hits. As the head of one of the big three networks, he was placed into one of the most powerful roles in television. The problem: **he didn’t come from entertainment, and he didn’t know how to pick good scripts**. Everyone in the industry knew this too, including the creators he was meant to greenlight, and they questioned his appointment and scrutinized his decisions.

Instead of posturing, **Bob admitted how clueless he was and sought help from his number twos** , Stu and Ted. They were veterans in television, and they warmly supported Bob, in large part because of how Bob didn’t come in acting like he knew it all. They taught Bob how to dissect scripts and find what was missing.

> **Management Principle: Admit When You Don’t Know**
> 
> Continuing the theme of being authentic—be honest when you don’t know something. If you fake being more knowledgeable or competent then you are, you’ll lose trust immediately once other people find out.
> 
> It’s far better to know who you are, admit it, and then work hard to improve from there. Admit you don’t know something and ask lots of questions.
> 
> Be careful not to be so humble that you don’t lead. If you’re honest with who you are, then you’ll know where your strengths lie and how you’ll lead from that position.

In one case, TV producer Steven Bochco (who had created _Hill Street Blues_ and _L.A. Law_) had signed a deal with ABC to develop ten new series. Bochco came to them with _Doogie Howser, M.D._ and was excited about the young actor Neil Patrick Harris. Iger saw video of Harris and wasn’t sure Harris was strong enough to make the show successful. Bochco suggested Iger didn’t know anything. Moreover, under the terms of his deal, Bochco was given creative carte blanche of his shows; if his show didn’t make it on air, he’d be paid a kill fee of $1.5 million. Iger greenlit the show, and _Doogie Howser, M.D._ turned out to be a 4-season success.

Despite his formal inexperience, Bob found that he’d learned plenty from ABC Sports and Roone Arledge about what made for good television—structure, pacing, clarity—and he soon felt more comfortable trusting his instincts.

Twin Peaks

When stepping into the role, Iger knew that big changes were happening in television, and ABC needed to adapt. Network television was no longer the automatic first choice for people’s time—cable television had greater creative license to show edgier content, video games competed for attention, and the VCR changed how freely people could access content. In this environment, ABC needed to change how they thought about television. He kept Roone’s old adage in mind: “Innovate or die.”

One project that came across Iger’s desk was _Twin Peaks_ , a surreal show by filmmaker David Lynch. Upon seeing the two-hour pilot, **Iger knew it was unlike anything that had ever aired on television, and that they _needed_ to develop it**. _Twin Peaks_ had mediocre showings in test screenings, among ABC execs, and even with the Capital Cities owner Tom Murphy. Everyone thought it was a huge risk to air. But Iger knew the problem wasn’t that it was a bad show; it was simply unfamiliar, and unfamiliar and boundary-pushing was what ABC needed. Iger greenlit the show for a full season.

_Twin Peaks_ debuted in April 1990. It had generated curious buzz during its development and was promoted by ABC; its pilot airing was watched by 35 million people. It quickly became a cultural phenomenon, gracing magazine covers and becoming one of ABC’s hottest shows.

Beyond the critical and commercial success, _Twin Peaks_ established ABC as a new cultural force in entertainment. ABC started talking with superstar creators like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to develop their own shows. And Iger’s reputation changed—once seen as a bland suit from New York, he was now an innovator willing to take big creative risks.

> **Management Principle: Don’t Manufacture Trombone Oil**
> 
> At Capital Cities, Dan Burke gave Iger a note cautioning him not to get in the business of making trombone oil. They might make the world’s best trombone oil, but the world only needs a few gallons of it a year.
> 
> The point was to avoid focusing on small projects that don’t yield much in return. Instead, focus on big projects that can produce big gains.

_Twin Peaks_ didn’t keep its momentum. The show centered around the murder of a teenager girl, Laura Palmer, and the mystery around who the killer was drove viewers to tune in. But over time, as a viewer, Iger grew impatient with how slowly the key plot point was being resolved, and he worried audiences would get frustrated too. If David Lynch had had his way, the murder might never have been resolved, and the show would revolve around the town and its characters. But Iger coaxed David Lynch to resolve the murder in the middle of the second season. After this, the intrigue had been let out like air out of a balloon; the show continued on in a meandering direction, and the ratings fell precipitously.

Today, Iger isn’t sure it was the right creative call to resolve the murder. He still thinks David Lynch was an undisciplined storyteller for television, but he acknowledges his own tastes might have been old-fashioned.

> **Management Principle: Treat Creators Empathetically**
> 
> When giving feedback to creative people, understand that they pour their souls into their works. They may understandably be sensitive to feedback, especially if you seem to be trampling on their vision.
> 
> When giving feedback, Iger always starts out positively. Then he focuses on the big picture, not with nitpicking small items.
> 
> For example, when giving notes to young director Ryan Coogler for _Black Panther_ , Iger first made clear that he thought the film was special and that the entire company had faith in him.

### Cop Rock and NYPD Blue

When you take risks, not every move is going to work.

In addition to _Doogie Howser_ , Steven Bochco pitched _Cop Rock_ , a police procedural set to music. Buoyed by the success of _Twin Peaks_ and feeling the need to continue taking big risks, Iger greenlit the show. It was a colossal failure; the mixture of serious drama with actors bursting out into song was too bizarre. Iger was unapologetic about the failure—taking big risks necessitates failure.

> **Management Principle: Make It OK to Fail**
> 
> Playing it safe never leads to greatness. To be great, you need to take big risks. And if you take big risks, you will inevitably have big failures.
> 
> You should personally accept that failure will come when you aim for greatness. Then you should push your team to take risks and accept the possibility of failure; when they do fail, support them through it and prepare them to take more risks.
> 
> The owners of Capital Cities Dan and Tom sometimes disagreed with Iger’s creative choices, but they had faith in him and encouraged him to take chances.

In the aftermath of _Cop Rock_ , Steven Bochco pitched a new show idea: the first R-rated show ever to be put on network TV. From a business perspective, this would be a big risk—advertisers wouldn’t want to put ads next to edgy content. But the idea was creatively intriguing, and to compromise with business needs, they settled on pushing the boundaries of a PG-13 show. They figured out what curse words they could use and how to show nudity without getting fined by the FCC. The result was _NYPD Blue_ , which became a hit show and is still considered one of television’s best dramas.

### More Promotions

Bob Iger got plenty of credit for ABC’s rising success, and late in 1992 Tom and Dan made clear Iger would be replacing the retiring president of ABC. On January 1, 1993, he assumed the role at 43 years old.

This necessitated moving back to New York. By this time, he’d separated from his first wife Susan, and he welcomed the chance to spend more time with his daughters.

His rise through the ranks was dizzying. **Just 8 years ago, he was still reporting to Roone Arledge; now Roone reported to him.**

This wasn’t the end. At the end of 1993, within a year of Iger’s taking the role, Tom Murphy shared that his partner and COO Dan was retiring, and he needed someone as his number two. He wanted Iger to do it. Even though Iger habitually accepted every new opportunity, this was too fast—he needed to stabilize his work at ABC. Iger demurred, but Tom returned in 1994 and repeated his request. This time Bob accepted, and he became president and COO of Capital Cities/ABC.
