## Chapter 2: Being Acquired by Capital Cities

In 1985, Bob was 34 years old and, after spending 12 years at ABC, was vice president at ABC Sports. That year, ABC was acquired by a company called Capital Cities Communication for $3.5 billion. This was an acquisition where a minnow swallowed a whale—ABC was four times as large as Capital Cities.

Capital Cities was run by two savvy business operators, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. The company had begun as a single TV station in Albany. Over time, they acquired station after station until they had assembled a large portfolio of TV stations, radio stations, and newspapers.

Their consistent strategy was to find a new TV station and increase profits by 1) investing in programming to raise revenue, and 2) cutting unnecessary costs. They’d then use the profits to acquire more stations. (Shortform note: Read more about the growth strategy of Capital Cities in our summary of The Outsiders.)

Capital Cities immediately went to work making changes at ABC. First they clamped down on perks, like executive limos and first-class flights. While some executives complained about the penny-pinching, in retrospect this was the right strategy—competition was getting tougher, and margins were slimmer; to survive, they’d need to be smart about their spending.

### Humble Values

Despite their operational shrewdness, Tom and Dan were folksy, down-to-earth people. Unlike the hotshots at ABC Sports, Tom and Dan didn’t have deep connections to Hollywood and talked about humble values. To ABC executives, they seemed like country rubes. In reality, they simply cared about operating good businesses and wanted little of the glamour.

To Bob Iger, **Tom and Dan embodied strong, admirable values** :

  * They were consistently authentic with low egos. They gave their time generously and wanted to help whoever needed it.
  * They were respectful and empathetic to their staff. They didn’t pay as much as the competition, but their respect was earnest, and that earned people’s trust.
  * They had strong integrity. They knew what was right and wrong, and they operated by that instinct.
  * They believed in decentralization. Instead of having a central corporate headquarters that controlled every decision, they put smart people at the head of business units and gave them autonomy.
  * When choosing who to promote, they chose intelligence and ability over experience. They trusted that smart people without experience would be able to figure out the job on the fly, and the unfamiliarity would push them to improve more than they thought possible.



Over time, Tom and Dan’s humble values spread throughout ABC and transformed its culture.

### Promotions

As part of the acquisition, Tom and Dan asked Roone Arledge, who at the time was managing both ABC Sports and ABC News, to choose one department. Roone chose News, and Capital Cities brought in their own executive to run Sports.

Bob Iger was soon promoted to senior vice president of programming, where he’d be in charge of all sports programming. This was a big break for him, and especially because Bob’s new boss was a humble manager who let Bob take the spotlight. Embodying Tom and Dan’s values, his boss let Bob lead conversations with senior management and sang his praises to Tom and Dan. Bob made a strong impression.

#### 1988 Winter Olympics

Around that time, the big event in the sports world was the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. Bob was the senior program executive, in charge of the detailed logistics around running all the televised coverage and negotiating with the Olympics committee.

The first few days went normally, but then warm winds raised the temperatures to the sixties, melting the snow and ice and ruining the outdoor events. Suddenly ABC didn’t have events to televise during primetime hours. Each day was a panic. Bob desperately called the Olympic committee to reschedule events to air during primetime. The ABC team went out hunting for human-interest stories to fill the air, and landed on hit pieces like the Jamaican bobsled team. The work was anxiety-inducing but also invigorating—each day they focused on just making it through the night.

Despite the emergencies, the ratings were an all-time high, and Tom and Dan were **impressed with Bob’s steely performance under pressure**.

#### Moving Up in ABC

A few weeks after the Olympics, Tom and Dan promoted Bob to executive vice president of ABC Television, the number two job at ABC TV. Bob would be in charge of daytime, late-night, and Saturday morning television, and manage business for the whole network. Not only that, Dan told Bob this was just a temporary position—they had bigger plans for Bob.

With this move, Bob joined Tom and Dan’s inner circle. He learned how they made decisions and how they evaluated people.

In 1989, Tom and Dan fired the head of ABC Entertainment for being a bad culture fit, and they offered Bob the job.

This was another big promotion—he’d be in charge of picking new primetime shows and become a major creative force in the company. Despite Bob’s tendency to say yes to opportunities, this seemed like too big a leap. This was a major creative role, and, unlike typical heads of entertainment, **Bob didn’t come from the entertainment industry and hadn’t read scripts since college**.

Bob flew out to Los Angeles and met with the two heads of primetime, Stu and Ted. They were veterans in entertainment and had developed hit shows like _The Wonder Years_ and _Roseanne_. While they could have hated the clueless guy who was promoted above them, they were instead relentlessly supportive, telling Bob they’d teach him and things would work out fine. This gave Bob confidence that they’d be able to succeed together.

The final obstacle was his family. Bob and his then-wife were both long-time residents of New York, and their children were established there. Now they’d have to move to Los Angeles. However, his wife supported him, urging him to take the adventurous path in life.

Everything was set. Bob took the job and started a few days later.
