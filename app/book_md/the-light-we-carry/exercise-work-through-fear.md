## Exercise: Work Through Fear

Obama explains that fear is one of the biggest obstacles to nurturing your personhood or living up to your potential for positive change. Thus, it’s important to learn to work through your fears—especially restrictive fears.

* * *

Describe a fear you have that’s _restrictive_ —that prevents you from growing and having positive experiences, and that isn’t really helpful or rooted in a genuine threat to your safety. Go into detail: How long have you had this fear? Where, when, and why did it begin? Note: Remember, the more time you spend analyzing your fearful self, the better you’ll be able to work through your fears. (For example, you might have a fear of public speaking that started in middle school after you messed up a speech and your peers laughed at you.)

What threat is this restrictive fear protecting you from? How likely is that threat to occur? What actions could you take to protect yourself from this threat? (For example, to protect yourself from the threat of messing up the speech and facing ridicule, you can practice in front of smaller groups of people before giving a presentation.)

Make a list of the benefits of facing your fear. This could be greater freedom, peace of mind, improved confidence, and so on. Making this list helps you face your fear by showing that the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks. (For example, overcoming a fear of public speaking can help you get a promotion, be a better manager, and share your ideas more effectively.)

Next, make a list of the risks of facing your fear. This could be shame, embarrassment, rejection, and so on. Making this list helps you face your fear by showing that the risks aren’t as serious as you might think, while also giving you a chance to brainstorm ways to mitigate any other risks. (For example, the risk of public speaking going wrong could be embarrassment or seeming incompetent. Realizing that you won’t die from embarrassment or lose your job over one awkward presentation can help you overcome your fear.)

Finally, make a plan to face your restrictive fear. Be specific: What action will you take to face your fear? When exactly will you do so? (For example, you’ll practice your presentation in front of five people on Monday, then 10 people on Wednesday, then 15 people on Friday.)
