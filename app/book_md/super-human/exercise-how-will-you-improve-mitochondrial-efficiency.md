## Exercise: How Will You Improve Mitochondrial Efficiency?

Asprey suggests a number of methods to help improve mitochondrial efficiency. In this exercise, consider how you might implement his advice.

* * *

Think about the six causes of mitochondrial efficiency: inflammatory foods, imbalanced gut bacteria, excess metals in your body, sleep deprivation, hormonal imbalances, and stem cell deficiencies. Which one of these factors do you think contributes the most damage to your cellular health?

Consider Asprey’s description of this particular factor and write down any habits you have that might exacerbate it. (For example, you might think inflammatory foods contribute the most damage to your cellular health because you eat lots of sugary and fried foods.)

Think about Asprey’s methods for addressing this factor. What one method can you immediately adopt? (For example, you might start taking antioxidant supplements.)

Which of Asprey’s methods for addressing this factor might be the most difficult to adopt? Explain why. (For example, you might find it difficult to follow a ketogenic diet because you don’t want to give up eating carbohydrates for five days a week.)

Which of Asprey’s methods do you plan on adopting over the _long term_ and how will you incorporate them into your life?
