## 1-Page Summary

Most people believe that mental and physical deterioration go hand in hand with aging. They assume that, with every year that passes, they’ll look and feel older, suffer more aches and pains, and become more susceptible to debilitating diseases that nudge them closer to death.

Entrepreneur, Silicon Valley investor, and best-selling author Dave Asprey argues that you can grow older in years and extend your lifespan _without_ suffering these ill effects. In _Super Human_ , he draws on advancements in anti-aging science to explore ways to **slow down and reverse the aging process, optimize your mental and physical health, and extend your lifespan.**

(Shortform note: In the same vein, biologist and geneticist David Sinclair (_Lifespan_) argues that aging is a _disease_ that we should attempt to overcome and that age-related deterioration doesn’t have to be an inevitable consequence of growing old. He predicts that anti-aging medicines and technologies will eventually increase our lifespan and years of health until we no longer have a maximum lifespan—meaning that we’ll stay young and healthy forever.)

Asprey argues that age-related deterioration doesn’t result from getting older in years, but from getting older _biologically_. According to him, your biological age doesn’t mirror your chronological age. Rather, it mirrors the health of your cells: **The healthier your cells, the more efficiently your body can protect your overall health.** This _decreases_ your biological age, makes you feel more youthful, and prolongs your lifespan. On the other hand, unhealthy cells prevent your body from maintaining your health. This _increases_ your biological age, makes you feel older, and reduces your lifespan.

This guide explores Asprey’s thoughts on cellular health and biological aging in two parts:

  * In **Part 1** , we’ll explore the role your cells’ mitochondria play in managing cellular health and how their effectiveness impacts your overall health and biological age.
  * In **Part 2,** we’ll outline the factors that cause mitochondrial inefficiency and present Asprey’s solutions for overcoming them, optimizing cellular health, and decelerating biological aging.



Additionally, we’ll expand on each of Asprey’s ideas with research, advice, and actionable ideas from health practitioners and longevity specialists.

### Part 1: Inefficient Mitochondria Accelerate Biological Aging

**Asprey argues that mitochondrial efficiency plays a key role in biological aging.** In this part of the guide, we’ll first explore the role of mitochondria. Then we’ll discuss how efficient mitochondria _maintain_ cellular health while inefficient mitochondria _degrade_ it. Finally, we’ll clarify how mitochondrial efficiency impacts overall health and biological aging.

#### Principle #1: Mitochondria Manage Cellular Health

According to Asprey, mitochondria—tiny organelles that live within your cells—manage cellular health and functionality through a number of processes, including:

  * Extracting energy from your body’s metabolic processes to power your cells
  * Killing off and disposing of dysfunctional cells that would otherwise clog up your system
  * Replacing dead or dysfunctional cells with healthy cells



(Shortform note: The number of mitochondria required to manage different cell types varies. This is because, while mitochondria do manage multiple cellular processes, their primary role is to produce energy that powers your cells (which, in turn, generates more than 90% of your body’s energy). As such, the number of mitochondria in each cell depends on how much energy that particular cell requires to function. For example, heart cells have the most mitochondria (nearly 5,000 per cell) because the heart requires more energy to function than any other organ in the body. In contrast, red blood cells have no mitochondria because their structure allows them to draw on cytoplasm to fuel their minimum energy requirements.)

Asprey argues that**the more efficiently your mitochondria manage these processes, the better your cells are at maintaining your mental and physical health**.

(Shortform note: Cellular health is key to maintaining good health because cells are the basic building blocks of all living tissues and organs (your body is made up of over 75 trillion of them), and they directly affect every process that happens in your body. If your cells don’t function properly, your body can’t function properly.)

#### Principle #2: Inefficient Mitochondria Damage Your Cells

According to Asprey, when extracting energy from your body’s metabolic processes, mitochondria create two by-products:

  * **Free radicals:** These molecules initiate a chemical reaction (oxidation) that damages the structure of your cells.
  * **Antioxidants:** These molecules inhibit the damaging effects of free radicals and keep your cells in good health. 



**When your mitochondria function efficiently, they create sufficient antioxidants to counteract the damaging effects of free radicals** and keep your cells in prime condition. On the other hand, _inefficient_ mitochondria are unable to produce enough antioxidants to defend your cells against free radicals—resulting in cellular damage.

> **Free Radicals: Lonely Electrons Wanting to Feel Complete**
> 
> Research backs up Asprey’s description of the interplay among mitochondria, free radicals, and antioxidants. It also provides insights into _how free radicals cause cellular damage_ and the role antioxidants play in preventing this damage.
> 
> Free radicals are formed when molecules gain or lose electrons—resulting in _incomplete_ molecules with unpaired electrons. (Think of a group of friends made up of two couples. One of the friends abandons the group, leaving three friends in the group—one couple and one single person.)
> 
> **The unpaired electrons from these incomplete molecules (the free radicals) then attract and pair with electrons from other,_complete_ molecules——making these other molecules incomplete. **(Think of the single person left in the group, feeling alone and jealous of the remaining couple. To avoid feeling left out, this single person steals a partner from another quartet of friends, leaving _that_ group with one couple and one single person.)
> 
> The process of unpaired electrons seeking out electrons to pair with sets off a chain reaction that alters and weakens the structure of multiple cells. (Think of how heartbroken and unstable all of these groups of friends are.)
> 
> **Antioxidants, on the other hand, don’t become unstable when they gain or lose electrons.** This means that they can donate electrons to free radicals to make them complete and stable—which prevents the damaging chain reaction that weakens multiple cells. (Think of a dating service that seeks out singles and provides them with their perfect match without inflicting unnecessary drama.)

##### Excess Free Radicals and Cellular Damage Cause Chronic Inflammation

Asprey explains that when excess free radicals damage your cells, they inhibit a key mitochondrial process—removing dysfunctional cells from your body. These **dysfunctional cells linger in your system, secreting inflammatory proteins that accumulate in your body and cause chronic inflammation**.

According to Asprey, **chronic inflammation makes you more susceptible to diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease**. This is because it creates hormonal imbalances that weaken your immune system, raise your blood sugar levels, slow your cognition, and lead to an increase in fat around your organs. Each of these effects contributes to a vicious cycle that causes further cellular damage:

  1. Insufficient antioxidant production results in an excess of free radicals that damage cells and create inflammation. 
  2. This inflammation damages more cells, overloads mitochondria with even more dysfunctional cells to process, and creates more inflammatory proteins in the body.
  3. Because cellular damage and inflammation inhibit mitochondria from working efficiently, they cause mitochondria to produce _fewer_ antioxidants and _more_ free radicals—which results in even more cellular damage and inflammation.



> **Free Radicals and Dysfunctional Cells Provide Health Benefits Too**
> 
> Research suggests that excess free radicals lead to chronic inflammation and various diseases due to a build-up of dysfunctional cells. However, that doesn’t mean that _all_ free radicals and dysfunctional cells are detrimental and should be eliminated—having _some_ of these substances in your body actually benefits your health in numerous ways:
> 
> Free radicals play a significant role in regulating the heart: They stimulate cell contractions that help the heart pump blood throughout the body with the correct force. This means that eliminating free radicals from heart muscle cells would negatively alter the force of the contractions required to keep the heart and body healthy.
> 
> Free radicals help the immune system kill pathogens in the body: The immune system takes advantage of free radicals’ cell-damaging qualities by targeting them toward disease-causing organisms such as bacteria and viruses.
> 
> Dysfunctional cells support immune system functioning: The reason these cells release inflammatory proteins is to alert the immune system to their presence so they can be removed. Additionally, some of these cells also _monitor tissues for injury and stimulate nearby stem cells to initiate repairs_ (by releasing inflammatory proteins). This means that, in some cases, removing these cells would slow down the body’s natural healing process.

#### Principle #3: Mitochondrial Efficiency Determines Your Biological Age

Asprey argues that the key to living a long and youthful life is to ensure that mitochondria work efficiently enough to optimize cellular health. This is because **efficient mitochondria _decelerate_ biological aging:** By supporting cellular health and function, they keep you in good mental and physical health, maintain your immunity against illness and disease, and help you look and feel younger than your age.

On the other hand, **inefficient mitochondria _accelerate_ biological aging:** Because they damage cellular health and function, they weaken your mental and physical health, make you more susceptible to illnesses and diseases that wreak further havoc on your cells, and make you look and feel older than your age. According to Asprey, these effects trigger the mental and physical deterioration that we associate with old age—such as memory loss or aches and pains.

> **What’s Your Biological Age?**
> 
> Research supports Asprey’s claims about the link between mitochondrial efficiency and biological aging: The impact of mitochondria on cellular health lies at the heart of many anti-aging research studies. Scientists in the field agree on four things:
> 
>   * Mitochondrial health impacts cellular health.
> 
>   * Cellular health determines your biological age, your overall health, and your life expectancy.
> 
>   * Your lifestyle impacts your cellular health and your biological age.
> 
>   * You can improve cellular health and lower your biological age by making healthy lifestyle changes.
> 
> 

> 
> As such, many scientists claim that knowing your biological age helps you make appropriate lifestyle decisions to lower it. But, **how can you find out your biological age?** A number of facilities can analyze the cells in blood or urine samples to determine your biological age. Alternatively, there are online calculators that claim to provide this information based on how you respond to various questions. However, the information these calculators require varies greatly: Some ask for detailed medical information while others ask only a few simple lifestyle questions.

### Part 2: Improve Mitochondrial Efficiency and Decelerate Biological Aging

We’ve just discussed how _inefficient_ mitochondria initiate a cycle that accelerates biological aging. According to Asprey, there are six factors that contribute to this damaging cycle, which we’ll discuss throughout the rest of this guide:

  1. Inflammatory foods
  2. Imbalanced gut bacteria
  3. Excess metals in your body
  4. Sleep deprivation
  5. Hormonal imbalances
  6. Stem cell deficiencies



Fortunately, according to Asprey, **it’s possible to overcome each of these factors and replace a damaging cycle with a more rejuvenating one** —one that repairs cellular damage, optimizes overall health, decelerates biological aging, and extends your lifespan. We’ll explain how you can achieve this—by making dietary changes, adjusting your lifestyle, or seeking medical interventions—throughout our exploration of the six causes of mitochondrial inefficiency.

### Factor 1: Inflammatory Foods

The first cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **consuming inflammatory foods**. Asprey explains that the food you eat directly impacts the amount of inflammation in your body. Recall that inflammation damages cells and overloads your mitochondria, resulting in fewer antioxidants and more free radicals in your body.

According to Asprey, foods that cause inflammation include wheat, grains, gluten, sugar, charred meat, fried foods, and crops sprayed with herbicides that contain glyphosate.

(Shortform note: The foods Asprey mentions cause inflammation because they contain unnatural substances that your body classifies as threats to your immune system. To protect itself, your body produces and sends out inflammatory cells to trap and neutralize these threats. The more unnatural substances you consume, the more inflammatory cells your body releases in response. These inflammatory cells build up and eventually start attacking healthy cells, tissues, and organs—resulting in chronic inflammation. In other words, **your body’s attempt to protect your immune system from unnatural substances actually weakens it**.)

Asprey suggests that, in addition to eliminating inflammatory foods, you can reduce inflammation in your body by implementing four dietary changes: Consume antioxidant-rich foods, replace trans fats with omega-3 fats, balance your protein intake, and metabolize glucose and ketones. Let’s explore each of these dietary changes in detail.

#### Dietary Change #1: Consume Antioxidant-Rich Foods

The first dietary change for reducing inflammation is to **consume antioxidant-rich foods**. This will support your mitochondria in reducing the number of free radicals and damaged cells in your body. According to Asprey, good sources of antioxidants include coffee, tea, berries, herbs, spices, and dark chocolate. Additionally, he suggests that you can eliminate excess free radicals from your body by taking antioxidant supplements such as pyrroloquinoline quinone or the Chinese herb he shou wu.

> **Possible Side Effects of Consuming Antioxidant-Rich Foods or Supplements**
> 
> While research suggests that the foods and supplements Asprey recommends can help reduce the number of free radicals in your body, it also reveals possible side effects to consider before adding them to your diet:
> 
>   * Coffee can impede your body’s ability to absorb minerals such as calcium, worsen high blood pressure or irritable bowel conditions, increase risk of miscarriage, and cause fetal anomalies.
> 
>   * Tea can impede your body’s ability to absorb iron; trigger feelings of anxiety and stress; cause nausea, headaches, or heartburn; disrupt your sleep cycle; and increase the risk of complications during pregnancy.
> 
>   * Some berries such as blueberries can lower your blood sugar to dangerous levels, which puts diabetes sufferers or those due to have surgery at risk.
> 
>   * Herbs and spices can cause allergic reactions, react with certain medications, and cause blood thinning.
> 
>   * Dark chocolate can raise blood sugar levels, trigger migraines, increase feelings of anxiety, lead to acid reflux or irritable bowel syndrome, cause fetal anomalies, and react with certain medications.
> 
>   * Pyrroloquinoline quinone hasn’t been rigorously tested. However, toxicology studies indicate that high doses might cause kidney damage.
> 
>   * He shou wu can cause diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, and it has also been linked to liver disease.
> 
> 


#### Dietary Change #2: Replace Trans Fats With Omega-3 Fats

The second dietary change for reducing inflammation is to **replace trans fats with omega-3 fats**. Asprey explains that fats are essential for cellular health because they help form the protective lining of your cells. However, trans fats don’t provide the necessary nutrients to form healthy cell linings. As such, when your body attempts to process these fats, it forms defective cell linings that exacerbate inflammation in your body.

(Shortform note: Research reveals that trans fats provide no nutritional value (so it’s safe to exclude them from your diet), and clarifies exactly how these fats disrupt cellular health. To function correctly, cell linings need to be permeable enough to absorb or excrete the substances they need to maintain electrolyte balance. They also need to be flexible enough to adapt to different conditions—for example, by changing their shape or the way that they interact with other cells. However, trans fats change the composition of cell linings, making them too rigid and stiff to fulfill these basic functions.)

According to Asprey, omega-3 fats (found in foods such as olive oil, walnuts, and cold-water fish) are anti-inflammatory and provide the necessary nutrients to form healthy cell linings—which promotes cellular health and mitochondrial function.

(Shortform note: While ongoing research suggests that omega-3 fats contribute to healthy cell linings, it also reveals that excessive consumption can impair the immune system, weakening its ability to fight viral or bacterial infections. While there isn’t enough data to confirm a recommended daily allowance of this fatty acid, the National Institutes of Health suggests that women can safely consume 1.1 grams while men can consume 1.6 grams.)

#### Dietary Change #3: Balance Your Protein Intake

The third dietary change for reducing inflammation is to **balance your protein intake**. Asprey explains that protein is essential for cellular health because it helps repair tissues and maintain muscle mass. However, when your body metabolizes protein, it creates more cellular waste than it does when metabolizing fats or carbohydrates. Therefore, consuming _excess_ protein creates a surplus of cellular waste that clogs up your cells, overloads your mitochondria, and causes further cellular damage.

(Shortform note: It’s common knowledge that protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, muscles, and organs. However, you may be surprised by Asprey’s explanation that it creates _waste_. In fact, metabolizing it creates _three different waste products that your body must excrete_ : urea, ammonia, and creatinine. When you eat the right amount of protein, your kidneys can easily process and eliminate these waste products through your urine. However, consuming excess protein can overload your kidneys—which then makes them less effective at excreting these waste products.)

Asprey recommends eating 0.5 grams of protein a day for every pound you weigh (reduce this figure down to 0.35 grams if you’re overweight). According to him, good sources of protein include wild fish, hemp, and products derived from grass-fed animals.

(Shortform note: There’s no consensus on how much protein we should consume. Some dieticians suggest that men should consume 56 grams a day while women should consume 46 grams. Others suggest that everyone should consume 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight—but that those trying to build muscle mass should consume more. Meanwhile, a third group argues that you should pay more attention to the type of protein in your diet rather than the amount—for example, by reducing your consumption of red meat and increasing your consumption of salmon, yogurt, or beans and pulses.)

He also suggests that you supplement your daily protein intake with 20 grams of collagen powder to help maintain the connective tissue that supports your skin, teeth, bones, cartilage, and organs.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that taking collagen supplements may increase skin elasticity and hydration, relieve joint pain, prevent bone loss, boost muscle mass, and promote heart health. However, you’ll need to be patient: Researchers claim that it can take between eight weeks and 12 months of daily intake to experience noticeable results.)

#### Dietary Change #4: Metabolize Glucose and Ketones

The fourth dietary change for reducing inflammation is to **metabolize glucose and ketones**. Asprey explains that the energy mitochondria extract from your body’s metabolic processes takes one of two forms—glucose or ketones—depending on how much sugar there is in your bloodstream for your body to metabolize.

  * When there’s sugar in your bloodstream, your body metabolizes it to produce glucose. 
  * When there isn’t any sugar in your bloodstream, your body metabolizes your stores of fat to produce ketones. 



According to Asprey, mitochondria work more efficiently when they’re able to switch between extracting glucose and ketones to power your cells. Alternating between the two energy sources promotes the growth of new mitochondria while also providing _existing_ mitochondria with the necessary raw materials to maintain cellular function.

> **Glucose Levels Impact Cellular Health**
> 
> Research expands on why mitochondria work more efficiently when they have access to both glucose and ketones. While glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, particularly those in the brain, there are a couple of downsides to relying on it as a sole source of energy. First, having too much glucose in the bloodstream can cause hyperglycemia, which damages nerves, blood vessels, and organs. Second, it provides less cellular energy than ketones: Metabolizing 100 grams of glucose generates 8.7 kilograms of energy-carrying molecules. Metabolizing 100 grams of ketones generates between 9.4 and 10.5 kilograms of energy-carrying molecules.
> 
> While it’s clear that ketones provide more cellular energy than glucose, relying on it as a sole source of energy would result in _no_ glucose in the bloodstream—which would affect the central nervous system and cause cellular dysfunction or death. Therefore, as Asprey says, you’re more likely to keep your blood sugar levels stable and maintain cellular health when your body metabolizes both glucose and ketones.

##### Two Approaches for Producing Glucose and Ketones

Asprey recommends two dietary approaches that will adjust your blood sugar levels to produce both glucose and ketones: Restrict _what_ you eat and restrict _when_ you eat.

**Restrict _what_ you eat** by following a ketogenic diet for five or six days a week. This involves avoiding carbohydrates (which release sugar into your bloodstream, thereby producing glucose) and eating foods high in fat (which won’t release sugar into your bloodstream, enabling your body to metabolize your stores of fat to produce ketones). Then, for one or two days a week, add 150 grams of low-sugar carbohydrates, which will release sugar into your bloodstream and help your body produce glucose.

(Shortform note: While this approach helps the body metabolize both glucose and ketones, nutritionists warn that you might find this way of eating more difficult than if you follow a ketogenic diet every day. They explain that, over time, following a ketogenic diet naturally suppresses your cravings for carbohydrates. However, reintroducing carbohydrates back into your body every week prevents you from fully adapting to living without them. This stimulates intense cravings that may tempt you to prolong your “days off,” and to give up on abstaining from carbohydrates for the rest of the week.)

**Restrict _when_ you eat** by practicing intermittent fasting. This involves limiting your food intake to one six-to-eight-hour period each day, during which time the food you consume will raise your blood sugar levels and help your body produce glucose. Toward the end of every 16-to-18-hour fasting period, your blood sugar will be low enough to produce ketones.

(Shortform note: While Johns Hopkins Medicine supports the finding that intermittent fasting can help control blood sugar levels, they advise that the following people shouldn’t attempt it: anyone under the age of 18, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those who suffer from metabolic or eating disorders. If you do intend to practice intermittent fasting, they recommend that you stay hydrated—by drinking water or other zero-calorie drinks (such as black tea or coffee) during your fasting periods.)

### Factor 2: Imbalanced Gut Bacteria

The second cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **having imbalanced gut bacteria**. Asprey explains that gut bacteria help maintain the integrity of your gut lining—the barrier between your digestive tract and bloodstream. Your gut lining plays a massive part in the health of your immune system because it absorbs necessary nutrients from your bloodstream and prevents toxins from your digestive tract from leaking into your bloodstream. However, when your gut bacteria are out of balance, your gut lining breaks down, fails to absorb nutrients, and leaks toxins into your bloodstream.

According to Asprey, various factors cause gut bacteria to become imbalanced, including eating produce derived from animals that have been fed antibiotics or from crops sprayed with insecticides, using antibiotics or antibacterial soaps, and consuming an insufficient amount of fiber.

> **Symptoms of Imbalanced Gut Bacteria**
> 
> While Asprey details the causes and effects of imbalanced gut bacteria, he doesn’t include information on how you might determine whether this is an issue you’re dealing with. Physicians provide a list of symptoms to keep an eye out for:
> 
>   * Autoimmune problems, such as thyroid issues, rheumatoid arthritis, or type 1 diabetes
> 
>   * Digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, or bloating
> 
>   * Excessive sugar cravings
> 
>   * Chronic fatigue or problems sleeping
> 
>   * Skin irritations, such as rashes or allergies
> 
>   * Mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety
> 
>   * Unexplained weight fluctuations
> 
> 


Asprey suggests two methods for rebalancing gut bacteria: Add more fiber to your diet and reduce your exposure to antibacterial products and antibiotics. Let’s explore each of these methods in more detail.

#### Method #1: Add More Fiber to Your Diet

The first method for rebalancing your gut bacteria is to **add more fiber to your diet**. Asprey explains that fiber feeds your healthy bacteria (leading them to multiply) and provides the perfect environment for them to thrive. He suggests that you can maximize your production of healthy gut bacteria by eating lots of fibrous vegetables and consuming 10 to 30 grams of powdered fiber each day.

(Shortform note: Research validates Asprey’s claim that fiber feeds your healthy gut bacteria, leading them to multiply. However, while there’s no disputing the benefit of consuming more fiber, proceed with caution: Gradually introduce fibrous foods into your diet. Research reveals that dramatically increasing your daily intake can cause adverse side effects. These effects include bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, and temporary weight gain. It can also create complications for people with Crohn’s disease or diabetes.)

Additionally, opting for organic foods will reduce your exposure to the damaging insecticides and antibiotics used in the production of processed foods.

(Shortform note: While organic foods are free from insecticides and antibiotics, they do have three disadvantages to consider before making a big change in the way you shop and eat. First, they require higher overhead costs to produce, which makes them more expensive than conventional produce. Second, they’re produced without artificial preservatives, which means they spoil quickly. Third, they’re not entirely free from contamination—for example, various studies show that organic foods play a part in foodborne disease outbreaks such as _E. coli_ infection.)

#### Method #2: Reduce Your Exposure to Antibacterial Products and Antibiotics

Asprey suggests that, in addition to eating more fiber, you can stimulate the production of healthy gut bacteria by reducing your exposure to antibacterial products and replacing antibiotics with ozone therapy—a treatment that administers ozone gas directly into your body to aid self-healing.

(Shortform note: While some doctors agree that reducing exposure to antibacterial products and antibiotics promotes healthy gut bacteria, they express concerns about how little research exists regarding the safety and effectiveness of ozone therapy. Some possible side effects of this therapy include air embolisms that can lead to a stroke or a heart attack, abdominal cramping, and flu-like symptoms. Due to the lack of substantial evidence regarding both the benefits and side effects of ozone therapy, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to authorize or regulate it. However, it has issued a warning against using ozone therapy.)

### Factor 3: Excess Metals in Your Body

The third cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **having excess metals in your body**. Asprey explains that the energy-extraction process mitochondria use to power your cells is an electrical process. Since metals have high electrical conductivity properties, having too many of them in your body interferes with this energy-extraction process and often results in mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial death.

(Shortform note: Research briefly expands on how excess metals disrupt mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are particularly rich in minerals. While it’s not yet clear exactly what role these minerals play in mitochondrial function, what is known is that excess metals displace these minerals—which then disrupts mitochondrial physiology, preventing them from fulfilling basic functions.)

According to Asprey, you’re more likely to have excess metals in your body if you eat food derived from crops planted in thallium-rich soil, consume high quantities of oceanic fish, have dental fillings, or spend a substantial amount of time under fluorescent lighting. Therefore, avoiding such things can reduce the levels of metal in your body to a safe level.

(Shortform note: While it’s true that avoiding these things might help lower the levels of metal in your body, there’s no way to completely avoid them—metals are everywhere, in our soil, water, and air. And the more you’re exposed to them, the more they accumulate in the soft tissues in your body. Over time, this accumulation can cause muscular and neurological degeneration, mimicking symptoms associated with age-related diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Unfortunately, these symptoms prevent many people from getting the correct treatment—because they assume that they’re suffering due to their age rather than from excess metals.)

#### Solution: Consume Binding Agents to Detox Your Body of Excess Metals

In addition to avoiding exposure to excess metals, Asprey suggests that you can **detox your body of existing metals by consuming binding agents** such as glutathione or activated charcoal. These substances work by binding themselves to the metals in your body. Your body then eliminates these metals through your urine and stool. However, Asprey warns that these binding agents can also bind to and inactivate useful substances, such as prescription medications or vitamins. Therefore, he recommends that you seek medical advice before consuming them.

(Shortform note: There isn’t enough research to confirm if either of these supplements can _safely_ detox your body of excess metals. Reported side effects of _glutathione supplements_ include cramping, bloating, and allergic reactions. Furthermore, researchers aren’t sure if these supplements cause adverse reactions in pregnant people or those breastfeeding. Additionally, researchers aren’t sure if _activated charcoal supplements_ effectively treat _any_ medical conditions. As such, medicinal use has not been approved by the FDA. Reported side effects include severe constipation, black stools, heartburn, a sore throat, dehydration, and dizziness.)

### Factor 4: Sleep Deprivation

The fourth cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **suffering from sleep deprivation**. According to Asprey, sleep deprivation results from missing out on _good-quality sleep_ that maximizes your time in deep sleep (otherwise known as “delta sleep”). This phase of sleep provides many health benefits: It regulates your hormones, improves your cognitive abilities, reduces your stress levels, and helps your mitochondria eliminate cellular waste.

(Shortform note: Research expands on why deep sleep offers so many health benefits. During this phase of sleep, your neuronal activity decreases, reducing your body’s energy expenditure. This enables your body to divert more resources toward regulating your metabolism and hormones and managing your cellular health. One key benefit of these extra resources is that they enable mitochondria to extract significantly more energy to power cellular function than they can while you’re awake or sleeping lightly.)

Asprey suggests that you can improve the quality of your sleep by making two lifestyle changes: adapting your lighting and tracking your sleeping patterns. Let’s explore each of these methods in detail.

#### Lifestyle Change #1: Adapt Your Lighting

The first lifestyle change for improving your sleep quality is to **adapt your lighting**. Asprey explains that **you’re more likely to suffer from sleep deprivation if you’re regularly exposed to blue light** from LED bulbs and screens. This is because your body’s natural sleep cycle is designed to match the rhythm of the sun: During sunlight hours, your body releases chemicals that make you feel alert and active. When the sun goes down, your body releases chemicals that make you want to sleep and recover. However, **blue lighting disrupts this sleep cycle by making your body think that the sun’s out all the time**.

(Shortform note: Research supports what Asprey says and reveals that blue light exposure may have _twice the impact on children’s sleep cycles_ than it does on adults. This is because children have larger pupils and are more sensitive to light than adults.)

Asprey suggests that you can minimize this disruption to your sleep cycle by replacing the lighting in your environment with red bulbs, turning off all screens and dimming your lights two hours before you plan to sleep, and wearing glasses that filter out blue light. He also recommends that you spend ten to twenty minutes in the sun each morning (before the sun’s at its most powerful) to balance your exposure to artificial light sources.

(Shortform note: Many health practitioners offer the same advice for reducing blue light exposure. Additionally, some suggest that you can give yourself even more protection by taking carotenoid supplements. Research suggests that these supplements may strengthen the cells around your retina and boost your natural ability to block blue light.)

#### Lifestyle Change #2: Track Your Sleeping Patterns

In addition to adapting your light sources, Asprey suggests that you can improve the quality of your sleep by **tracking your sleeping patterns**. Asprey recommends using a sleep tracker that also gathers data from your daytime activities. This type of tracker will reveal how your daytime activities impact the quality of your sleep—providing information that will help you make lifestyle decisions that maximize your time in deep sleep. For example, it might reveal that you benefit from more time in deep sleep when you exercise or eat certain foods during the day.

(Shortform note: Sleep trackers may worsen sleep due to _orthosomnia_ —an obsession with improving sleep tracker data instead of actual sleep quality. Ongoing research suggests that sleep trackers can’t accurately interpret all sleep metrics. However, people with orthosomnia overestimate the accuracy of their sleep data, which leads them to misunderstand how well they’re actually sleeping. They then set **misplaced sleep goals that improve sleep tracker data to the detriment of actual sleep quality**. For example, in one study, some participants attempted to manipulate their sleep tracker data by staying in bed for longer periods. This preoccupation with inaccurate data often creates anxiety that interferes with good-quality sleep.)

### Factor 5: Hormonal Imbalances

The fifth cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **hormonal imbalances in your body**. Asprey argues that hormones play a key part in how well mitochondria function because they help maintain your _overall_ health (thereby reducing the damaged and dysfunctional cells mitochondria must deal with).

As you age, your body slows down its production of certain hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, resulting in an imbalance that can cause many of the undesirable symptoms we associate with old age. These symptoms include mood swings, weight gain, poor sleeping patterns, low fertility levels, and sexual dysfunction.

(Shortform note: According to research, the body produces over 50 different hormones, all of which contribute to essential bodily processes. While age does _decrease_ the production of some of these hormones, it also _increases_ the production of others. In addition to testosterone and estrogen, hormones that decrease with age include aldosterone, calcitonin, growth hormone, renin, and prolactin. The hormones that increase with age include follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, norepinephrine, and parathyroid hormone. People can experience several different symptoms depending on what type of hormonal imbalance they have.)

Asprey claims that old age isn’t the only cause of hormonal imbalances. Various other factors can disrupt your hormones, such as a lack of sleep or nutrition, a sedentary lifestyle, using personal care products made with hormone-disrupting chemicals, and taking prescription medications or hormonal birth control.

(Shortform note: According to research, there are many possible causes of hormonal imbalances. In addition to Asprey’s list, these causes include high stress levels; damage to the endocrine gland; eating disorders; tumors and/or chemotherapy treatments; an underactive or overactive thyroid; and autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s, Graves’ diabetes, or Addison’s.)

#### Four Methods for Rebalancing Your Hormones

Asprey suggests four methods that, in addition to all of the advice we’ve already discussed, can help you prevent or reverse hormonal imbalances.

1) Practice high-intensity exercises a few times a week.

(Shortform note: While high-intensity exercise can boost levels of muscle-maintaining hormones (such as testosterone), it can also lead to elevated levels of stress hormones (such as cortisol). Medical professionals suggest that you can benefit from high-intensity exercises _and_ curb your stress hormone levels by taking time to recover in between workout sessions.)

2) Replace chemical-laden products with natural ones.

(Shortform note: It’s challenging to know what commercial products to avoid, since they use numerous variants of and names for hormone-disrupting chemicals. Instead of trying to come up with a list of the _thousands_ of ingredients and names to look out for, simply try to avoid any products containing three main hormone disruptors: formaldehyde, bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates. Additionally, health practitioners recommend that you avoid any products that include “fragrance” or “parfum” in their list of ingredients.)

3) Check the effects of any prescription medications.

(Shortform note: According to hormone specialists, there are three types of prescription medications that are notorious for disrupting hormones: analgesics (for treating pain), steroids (for treating inflammation), and isotretinoin (for treating acne).)

4) Find replacements for hormonal birth control.

(Shortform note: There are a variety of non-hormonal contraceptive options available, including condoms, sponges, cervical caps, diaphragms, spermicides, and non-hormonal IUDs. Additionally, surgical procedures include vasectomies for people with penises and tubal ligations or occlusions for people with vaginas.)

##### How to Rebalance Hormones if Lifestyle Changes Don’t Work

If changing your lifestyle doesn’t help to rebalance your hormones, Asprey recommends undertaking bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT). Bioidentical hormones are chemically identical to those your body naturally produces—which makes it easier for your body to assimilate them into your hormonal makeup. These hormones can be administered in various ways—through injections, by taking pills, or by putting on patches or creams.

(Shortform note: Bioidentical hormones are marketed as “natural,” and therefore safer and more effective than hormones used in traditional hormone therapy. However, though bioidentical hormones originate from natural sources, such as plants or animals, they require heavy processing—meaning that by the time the hormones are ready for treatment, they’re no longer natural. Further, according to the FDA and several medical specialty groups, there isn’t any evidence that proves bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than hormones used in traditional hormonal therapy.)

### Factor 6: Stem Cell Deficiencies

The sixth cause of mitochondrial inefficiency is **stem cell deficiencies**. We previously touched on how mitochondria are responsible for replacing dead or dysfunctional cells with healthy ones. Asprey explains that mitochondria rely on stem cells to initiate the creation of all healthy replacement cells.

As you age, your stem cell reserves dwindle, slowing down the replacement of dead or dysfunctional cells with healthy ones. This causes tissues throughout your body to lose more cells than they can replace. According to Asprey, this tissue loss is a prime cause of age-related deterioration, resulting in symptoms such as cognitive decline (from the loss of brain tissue) and impaired healing abilities (from the loss of muscle tissue).

> **Two Types of Stem Cells: Embryonic and Adult**
> 
> Research suggests that stem cell deficiencies are both the result of getting older chronologically and a prime cause of biological aging—because, as Asprey says, a stem cell deficiency leads to tissue loss that produces further cellular damage. The research also expands on the two different types of stem cells in the body: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.
> 
> **Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent** , which means they have the potential to become any one of the 220 different cell types in the body. As such, they’re present during the body’s earliest stage of development during the zygote’s cell-division phase.
> 
> **Adult stem cells are multipotent** , which means they have the potential to turn into a specific type of cell but are limited to specific regions of the body. For example, neural stem cells can become different kinds of brain cells but they can’t become heart cells. Adult stem cells arise once the embryo fully develops.

### Undertake Stem Cell Treatments

Asprey suggests that you can**increase your stem cell count and prevent tissue damage by undertaking stem cell treatments**. During these treatments, a practitioner extracts and processes healthy stem cells from your subcutaneous fat or bone marrow before reinjecting them into specific areas of your body that require healing. Asprey also recommends freezing healthy stem cells when you’re young so that you can benefit from them when you’re older.

> **Why Stem Cell Treatments Don’t Always Work**
> 
> While stem cell treatments can boost your stem cell count and help regenerate damaged nerves, tissues, and organs, there are three factors that determine their effectiveness.
> 
>   * **The severity of your injury:** Minor injuries are easier to heal than major ones. For example, a partial muscle tear requires fewer treatments to aid healing than a complete tear.
> 
>   * **Your current healthy stem cell count:** Injected stem cells promote healing by encouraging _existing_ healthy stem cells to multiply and create additional ones. The fewer healthy stem cells you have to start with, the less impact injected stem cells can have on your count—and the more treatments you’ll need before you can benefit from them.
> 
>   * **Your lifestyle:** Unhealthy habits such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption impact the effectiveness of stem cell treatments in two ways: First, they negate the quality of the stem cells extracted from your body—which means that these stem cells might not be healthy enough to reinject into your body. Second, they inhibit your body’s ability to recover and benefit from the treatments.
