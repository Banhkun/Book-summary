## Exercise: Maintain Objectivity

Objectivity is one of the most important aspects of living according to the Tao. If you allow your personal biases to influence your decision-making, you wonâ€™t be able to truly engage with the world around you.

* * *

Describe a time that you allowed your personal bias to influence your decisions in a negative way.

Knowing what you know now, how did the _reality_ of the situation differ from your _perspective_ on the situation?

With these differences in mind, if you had the opportunity to relive this situation, how would you have approached it differently?
