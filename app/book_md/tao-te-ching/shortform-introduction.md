## Shortform Introduction

**The _Tao Te Ching_ is one of the foundational texts of Taoism, written between the 4th and 6th centuries. **This summary is based on the Stephen Mitchell translation, which modernizes much of the text.

While we have done our best to research the text and offer an accurate representation of the _Tao Te Ching_ , areas of this summary are based upon interpretation. The piece is written as poetry and, as such, even Taoist scholars have different perspectives on what the language represents.

This summary is structured thematically, with each section pulling information from various sections of the text to best explain the ideas introduced in the work.

**This summary breaks down the text as follows:**

  * Introduction: the concept of the Tao and the nature of its power
  * Sections 1 and 2: engaging with the Tao
  * Section 3: the benefits of the Tao from a personal and leadership perspective
