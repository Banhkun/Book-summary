## Exercise: Examine Your Relationship With Alcohol

Reflect on your relationship with alcohol, how it might be influenced by outside factors, and whether you might want to change it.

* * *

What do you consider “normal” drinking—how frequently and much does that mean to you? Do you feel you consume a “normal” amount of alcohol? Note your thoughts below.

Whitaker believes alcohol companies market their products to encourage consumers to view drinking as normal. With this in mind, can you point to any messaging—from alcohol companies, peers, or other outside sources—that has shaped your above views on alcohol? Do your coworkers drink heavily, and has that influenced how much drinking you consider “normal?” Do social media ads give you the impression that everyone drinks?

Finally, now that you’ve considered how much your relationship with drinking is influenced by others, do you think you might like to drink less or differently? What might that look like?
