## Introduction

Everyone wants to make a living doing meaningful work that harmonizes with their values and makes them happy. But many people feel stuck in the wrong life doing unfulfilling work with no way out. Some hope that if only they can find their “true passion,” everything will magically fall into place. Both attitudes—the defeated one and the magical passion one—are false. What we need is a clear-cut process for _designing_ our lives, a learnable approach to building a fulfilling career.

_Designing Your Life_ provides that process. This is a book about _life design_. Everything surrounding you, from furniture and electronics to indoor plumbing and toothbrushes, was _designed_. People created each of these things in response to a problem. **Just like you can see the benefits of design thinking all around you, you can reap the benefits of such thinking by applying it to your life to create more meaning and joy.**

### Design Problems vs. Engineering Problems

Design problems are distinct from engineering problems. Engineering problems focus on achieving a clear goal, like creating hinges for laptop computers that will last for years. By contrast, design problems have no predetermined goal. They simply seek to address a problem in some effective way.

The ultimate design problem may be the realm of aesthetics. For example, the different appearances of a Porsche and a Ferrari represent two different design approaches to solving the “problem” of creating a beautiful car. The central concern of aesthetics is human emotions, and design thinking is the best tool for effectively addressing this. Likewise, finding happiness and fulfillment in life represents an aesthetic/emotional problem, not one with a concrete goal that you know in advance. Thus, for creating a successful, productive life, design thinking, not engineering thinking, is the best approach.

### Design Thinking

Doing life design requires thinking like a designer. A core principle of design thinking is that you make progress by _building_ , not by _pure thought_. Designers build and test prototypes.

There are five basic mental attitudes in design thinking that underlie what you’ll learn in the chapters that follow:

  * **Curiosity:** Be curious. Explore.
  * **Experimentation:** Try things out. Get off the bench and in the game. Welcome change, and don’t get attached to any particular outcome.
  * **Reframing:** Get a different perspective on problems. Reframe wrong, false, and dysfunctional beliefs by recognizing your biases.
  * **Embracing process:** Recognize that you’re on a journey. Enjoy creating multiple prototypes. Enjoy the process instead of focusing on some hypothetical end goal.
  * **Deep Teamwork:** Recognize that design is a fundamentally collaborative activity, unlike a solitary artist creating her work.



When you apply these to your life, you’ll increase your luck. Opportunities start arising on their own. You hear about jobs and meet people in strangely serendipitous ways. Yes, you put in hard work, but the return on your investment of time and effort is disproportionately large. In other words, you get back more than you put in.

#### More About Reframing

One of the most important aspects of the design approach is to reframe or pivot. As stated above, this is when you take new information and restate your point of view in a different way that leads to new thinking and prototyping. In the world of commerce, an example might be starting out thinking that you’re designing a new product but then realizing that you’re actually redesigning the _experience_ of that product, like Starbucks did for coffee.

**Like many people, you may wrongly believe there’s one “perfect” life for you.** Reframing this defective belief involves the realization that there are many possible versions of yourself, that none of them is better than all the others, and that your life is about growth and evolution instead of reaching some final, static destination. Life design reframes the old question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” and asks instead, “ _What do you want to grow into?_ ”

Other defective beliefs to reframe include:

**Defective belief:** Your college degree determines your career.

  * **Corrected belief:** Three-quarters of college graduates work in a field unrelated to their major.



**Defective belief:** Conventional “success” will make you happy.

  * **Corrected belief:** Designing a life that works for you, personally, makes you happy.



**Defective belief:** You’re too late to design your best life. Your life is already set in stone. You missed your chance.

  * **Corrected belief:** It’s never too late.



#### More About Deep Teamwork

To fully benefit from life design, you need to gather a “design team,” a group of people who will read this book and do the exercises with you. Bringing together different people’s knowledge and perspectives can generate more solutions for everybody than any one person could generate on their own. You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 11.

### Passion and Coherence

The design approach to life rejects the popular notion that everything will work itself out if you just “find your passion.” Many people can’t even say what their passion might be. Nor is it true that most people have a single dominant passion. In fact, passion is something that you develop by trying things out, not something that you know ahead of time. **Passion isn’t the _cause_ but the _result_ of intelligent life design. **Using the design approach to prototype possible lives for yourself will lead you to the work you love.

The bottom line for what constitutes a well-designed life is this: It makes sense. All of its parts—even (and sometimes especially) its failures—cohere and give meaning to each other. At any point, you’re able to accurately answer the question, “How’s it going?”
