## Conclusion: Designing for the Rest of Your Life

In this guide, you’ve learned how to design your life by understanding where you are, building a compass (your work and life philosophies) to guide you, wayfinding in your life, generating ideas, prototyping your future, approaching the job market intelligently, becoming immune to failure, and creating a life design team.

Going forward, as you use your new skills to continually design the rest of your life, remember to apply the five design attitudes (from the introduction) whenever you encounter situations that call for them. This will bring a continuous flow of information for you to incorporate into your design activities.

  * Be curious. Ask how things work and why people do what they do.
  * Experiment. Figure out what you want to know more about, and create ways to learn it and try it out.
  * Reframe your troubles. Become aware of your perspective, and consider what others there might be.
  * Embrace process. Understand the steps involved in whatever you’re doing. Keep track of your questions. Enjoy the journey.
  * Practice deep teamwork. Create your team and cultivate a community. Ask for help when you need it. 



Also remember to refer frequently to your life compass to assess how things are going: Are you remaining true to yourself? Is your life remaining coherent?

Finally, commit fully to a practice for tuning into non-cognitive forms of knowing, as you learned about in Chapter 9 on choosing happiness. Whether it’s journaling, meditation, tai chi, or another, the discipline of engaging regularly with one or more of these practices will help keep you centered and in touch with your whole being. You’ll have a clearer mind and spirit as you design a joyful and fulfilling life.

**Defective belief:** After I’ve designed my life, everything will be wonderful.

  * **Corrected belief:** Life design never ends. It’s a joyful lifelong project.
