## Chapter 5: Designing Multiple Lives

In Chapter 4, you learned how to create a mind map for generating multiple ideas to solve life design problems. You also learned how to use reframing to deal with problems that are entrenched. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to design _multiple life plans_ for yourself. You’ll develop “prototype” models for three separate lives that you could live.

**Defective belief:** I have to identify, plan, and execute _my one best life_.

  * **Corrected belief:** I have multiple wonderful lives and life plans inside me. I can choose which one to build next.



It’s amazing what can happen when you stop trying to “get it right” by building what you conceive as the only right life for you. You can get wonderful results—and often _unexpected_ results, ones far better than you could have planned for—if you intentionally think through multiple potential life paths and life designs for yourself.

### Three Adventure Plans

To apply this principle, develop three separate Adventure Plans, each one detailing a different life that you could live, including both career factors and non-career factors. Limit each to a five-year period, which seems to be a natural rhythm; most people’s lives unfold in three- to five-year “seasons.” Considering making at least one of your plans “unrealistic” or even “wild,” like living off the grid in a tent in the Amazon rainforest (if that’s your thing).

**Your first Adventure Plan will center on something you’ve already got in mind.** It will be either the life you’re actually living (imagined forward by five years) or a good idea that you’ve been developing for your life.

**Your second plan will describe what you’d do if the area you currently work in or have been planning to work in disappeared.** For example, if you’re a management consultant, what would you do if suddenly that industry just dried up and went away?

**Your third plan will describe what you’d do if money and reputation didn’t matter.** What would you do if you knew for certain that: A) it would support you materially, and B) nobody would laugh at you?

Each of your five-year adventure plans will need the following components:

  1. A six-word title that captures the plan’s essence.
  2. A visual timeline that includes not just work events but personal events that you hope to experience—marriage, running a marathon, or whatever.
  3. A dashboard to gauge the following:
     1. Your resources: Do you have the time, money, skill, and other necessary resources for the plan?
     2. Your “like” level: How much do you like the plan?
     3. Your confidence level: How confident are you about this plan?
     4. Coherence: Is the plan internally consistent, and does it resonate with your work and life philosophies?
  4. Two or three questions the plan raises. 



### The Final Step

The final step of designing your multiple lives is to share them with a group of supportive people. You can’t always see yourself accurately. You need other people’s input. You’ll learn in Chapter 11 about putting together a life design team. For now, just pick a handful of people (three to six) whom you trust and who will provide honest and constructive reactions to your three Adventure Plans. Share your plans with this group, and write down what they say. Let their feedback inform your decisions.
