## Chapter 3: Finding Your Way

In Chapter 2, you built your life compass and discovered your true north. Chapter 3 teaches you how to _find your direction_ by using the ancient art of wayfinding. You’ll learn to create a journal to follow the clues of your involvement, energy, and joy.

**Defective belief:** Work shouldn’t be enjoyable

  * **Corrected belief:** Enjoyment will guide you to the right work for you.



### Wayfinding Your Life

Wayfinding helps you know where you’re going without a firm destination in mind. All you need is a compass and a direction. It requires you to pay attention to clues. For wayfinding in your life, the clues are involvement, energy, and joy.

#### Involvement

Notice how involved and engaged you feel with your work. **What makes you feel interested, focused, and excited?** On the other end, what makes you feel bored and dull?

Pay attention to the intensified state of involvement known as _flow_. Being “in flow” means total involvement in an activity, combined with a sense of euphoria, clarity, peace, and the disappearance of time. It can happen with almost any activity—playing a sport, chopping an onion, designing a business plan. Flow relates back to the “play” gauge on your life dashboard, because flow makes you enjoy the pure _doing_ of something.

#### Energy

Start paying attention to your energy level. How vital and alive do you feel? Also notice the activities you’re involved in whenever you feel highly energized, as well as the ones that make you feel exhausted.

#### Joy

Joy is a feeling of aliveness, engagement, and delight when an activity seems intrinsically fun. **Pay attention to the activities that bring you joy, and also the ones that steal it.**

### Your Wayfinding Journal

To make use of these clues of involvement, energy, and joy, keep a journal consisting of two components:

  * An activity log to record times when you feel involved and energized (or bored and drained)
  * Reflections that describe what you’re learning from the activity log



#### Activity Log

Your activity log is where you keep a list of your main daily activities and indicate how involved and energized they made you feel. The point is to figure out which things motivate you and which ones demotivate you. Write in this journal frequently—at least twice a week, but ideally every day.

When you get the hang of paying detailed attention to your daily activities, you’ll have learned to “catch” yourself having a good time, and the knowledge of what produces this effect will be invaluable.

#### Reflections

The reflections section of your Wayfinding Journal is where you write down what you learn from examining your activity log and noticing any themes, insights, or surprises about what does and doesn’t make you feel involved and energized. Before starting to do your reflections, build up a substantial activity log, at least three weeks’ worth. That way you’ll have enough material to identify real patterns. Then start writing weekly reflections on blank pages of your activity log.

Be specific in these reflections. **“Zoom in” mentally and identify the exact components of your activities that involve or bore you, energize or drain you**. Did you really enjoy the whole staff meeting, or was it just the part where you restated someone’s point better? If it was just that part, did your enjoyment come from restating the point artfully or from the fact that you helped to facilitate group consensus? The answers to such questions give you actionable data for designing your life (as subsequent chapters will teach you).

To help with your reflections, use the following questions:

  * **Who:** Who were you with? How did they affect your experience, either positively or negatively?
  * **What:** What were you doing? Was the activity structured or unstructured? Did you have a specific role or just a general presence?
  * **Where:** Where were you? How did that environment make you feel?
  * **Interactions:** What were you interacting with—people, things, machines? Was the interaction formal or informal? If it was objects or devices, what were they? How did they make you feel?



#### Mining Your Memories

You can create a Wayfinding Journal from your past experiences as well as your present ones. Just apply your new journaling technique to memories of past work experiences where you entered flow, reached peak energy, and experienced joy. Using these peak memories can be especially helpful when your current situation doesn’t offer much material for your journal, or when you’re just starting your professional life and don’t have much experience to draw on. You can use school projects, volunteer work, and so on.

#### Using Your Wayfinding Journal

Subsequent chapters will teach you how to use your Wayfinding Journal for various aspects of life design. Right now, **you can use it to strategically plan your daily life.** For example, in reflecting on his activity log, one of this book’s authors found that he experienced flow from his office hours and his drawing lessons, and that he felt energized from going on date nights with his wife and teaching classes. For activities such as faculty meetings, his involvement and energy depended on the topic at hand. He was surprised to find that one activity he thought he liked actually drained him. So he redesigned that activity to work better, and he rebuilt his schedule to maximize his energizing activities and carefully manage his draining activities.
