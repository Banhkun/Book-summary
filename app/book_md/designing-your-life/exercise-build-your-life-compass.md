## Exercise: Build Your Life Compass

Chapter 2 introduced you to the “life compass,” which consists of your work philosophy and your life philosophy. This exercise leads you through the process of creating this tool.

* * *

Briefly write out your work philosophy (up to 250 words). What do you think work means? What is it for? How does work relate individuals to society? What makes work good or worthwhile? Does it involve service to others? What’s the place of money? Does it have anything to do with fulfillment, growth, or use of talents?

Briefly write out your life philosophy (up to 250 words). What is life’s meaning? Why are you (and everybody else) here? What’s the relationship between individuals and family, country, humankind? What are good and evil? Is there a God or higher power? What’s the role in human life of such things as justice, injustice, love, hatred, and conflict?

Where do your work and life philosophies complement each other?

Where do your work and life views clash with each other? (If noticing these clashes makes you want to go back and revise what you’ve written, feel free. Just make sure you write your philosophies honestly, stating how you really see and think about things.)
