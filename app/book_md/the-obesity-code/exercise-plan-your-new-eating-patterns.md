## Exercise: Plan Your New Eating Patterns

After laying out his theory, Fung explains that you can beat obesity by changing what and when you eat. In this exercise, sketch how you might implement his recommendations.

* * *

First, consider your diet composition (what you eat). Recalling Fung’s explanations of the main culprits—refined carbs and added sugars—list anything in your regular diet that might contain these ingredients. For instance, you might eat grocery store white bread or pasta sauce with added sugar.

Next, consider what you can swap them for. Fung stresses that healthy foods should _replace_ unhealthy foods, and that you shouldn’t simply add them on top. Given this, how might you swap the above items for healthier options? For instance, you might learn a simple tomato sauce recipe to cut out the added sugar.

Second, consider your meal timing. Below, briefly sketch out when and how often you tend to eat. As an example, you might have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus a snack here and there.

Recalling Fung’s explanation of how frequent eating causes constantly high insulin, how might you change your meal timing to promote weight loss? (You might try intermittent fasting, or simply cut out snacks.)
