## 1-Page Summary

_Manage Your Day-to-Day_ is a collection of essays edited and curated by Jocelyn K. Glei, creative consultant and director of 99U, a resource platform and conference series that empowers creative professionals. Compiling advice from creative professionals and creativity experts, Glei shows that **consistent, disciplined work habits are the true foundation of creativity**. The essays offer strategies to optimize your productivity, focus, and creativity in today's fast-paced world, as well as practical tools to enhance your daily routine, overcome distractions, and unlock your creative potential.

Glei is an American writer and creative consultant. In addition to managing 99U’s online content and the annual 99U Conference, an event that brings together visionaries and thought leaders from various creative fields, Glei also hosts the podcast Hurry Slowly and offers a four-week online productivity course called RESET. For _Manage Your Day-to-Day_ , Glei curated essays from some of today’s best-known creative minds, including Cal Newport (_Deep Work_), Steven Pressfield (_The War of Art_), and Gretchen Rubin (_The Happiness Project_ and _The Four Tendencies_).

In this guide, we’ve divided the contributors’ wisdom into three areas: how to develop a routine that supports creativity, how to improve your focus, and how to hone your creative mindset. We’ll supplement the advice from the essays’ authors with insight from other experts like Daniel Pink (_When_), Chris Bailey (_Hyperfocus_), and Nir Eyal (_Indistractable_). We’ll also provide more detailed explanations of why the strategies work and advice on how to implement them.

### How to Develop a Routine That Supports Creativity

Many of the contributors suggest that the first step to becoming more creative is prioritizing creative work. The best way to do this is to **build a routine around your creative projects**. Without an intentional routine, they argue, it’s unlikely you’ll ever make significant progress on your biggest and best ideas.

#### Step 1: Identify When You Are Primed for Creative Work

Poet and creativity coach Mark McGuinness suggests that **your routine should center around your periods of highest focus**. He explains that everyone has a circadian rhythm that determines your level of mental alertness throughout the day. He recommends aligning your routine with your energy level to ensure that you work on your creative projects at the times you’re most focused.

> **How to Identify Your Focus Period**
> 
> In _When_ , Daniel H. Pink goes into detail about how your circadian rhythm, your natural sleep/wake cycle, impacts your focus. He explains that over the course of a day, **most people experience a predictable pattern of energy** : a crest (what Pink calls a peak), a slump (a trough), and a recovery (a rebound). The crest is when most people are at their most focused.
> 
> Pink clarifies that while this pattern of crest, slump, and recovery is common to all people, **the time of day that the pattern begins varies depending on our chronotype**. Your chronotype is the individual expression of your circadian rhythm; it impacts when you wake and sleep and when you’re most alert. Pink outlines three common chronotypes:
> 
>   * Morning Types (referred to as “larks”) tend to rise early. They hit their crest mid-morning, their slump mid-afternoon, and their recovery in the early evening.
> 
>   * Night Types (referred to as “owls”) are the opposite. They're most alert at night, lag in the morning, then gain momentum in the afternoon.
> 
>   * Intermediate Types (referred to as “third birds”) are the most common, and their ideal schedule falls somewhere in between the first two categories.
> 
> 

> 
> According to Pink, **knowing your chronotype will give you greater insight into your daily rhythm** (crest, slump, and recovery) and allow you to be more strategic about how you use your time. After learning more about your chronotype, Pink recommends adjusting your schedule accordingly. You can learn more about your chronotype here.

The author of _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport, advises that after identifying your focus periods, you block them out in your calendar. Scheduling this time, as you would an important meeting, not only reminds you that time is saved for your creative work, but also allows you to focus on those projects without interruption. He emphasizes that once you schedule your focus block, you shouldn’t allow anything to intrude, whether it’s phone calls, emails, or spontaneous interruptions.

> **How to Schedule Focus Blocks**
> 
> Your most important creative projects likely qualify as what Newport terms deep work—cognitively demanding tasks that require undistracted focus. In _Deep Work_ , he elaborates on four ways to schedule your focus blocks for deep work, depending on your preference, lifestyle, and other obligations:
> 
> **1\. Seclusion** : This schedule involves dedicating long, uninterrupted periods of time to deep work, often lasting several days or even weeks. It requires isolating yourself from distractions and immersing in deep work for extended periods, typically in retreat-like settings.
> 
> **2\. Periodic** : The periodic schedule involves splitting your time between deep work and shallow work. It entails designating specific days or periods solely for deep work while allowing other days for regular, shallow tasks, meetings, and administrative work. This approach allows for concentrated deep work sessions without neglecting other responsibilities.
> 
> **3\. Daily** : The daily schedule involves creating a daily routine where specific time blocks are consistently dedicated to deep work. It could be a few hours each morning or a consistent block of time every afternoon. The key is establishing a predictable schedule that becomes a habit, allowing you to regularly engage in deep work.
> 
> **4\. Ad Hoc** : The ad hoc schedule is more flexible and adaptable. It involves fitting deep work into available time slots whenever possible, based on the demands of the day or week. This approach requires flexibility and the ability to seize opportunities for deep work as they arise, even if the schedule isn't consistent.

#### Step 2: Be Consistent

Once you establish a routine, **be consistent**. According to Gretchen Rubin, author of _The Happiness Project_ and _The Four Tendencies, _creativity thrives on consistency. She explains that consistency works because it’s realistic, allowing you to work on your creative projects a little bit every day while also managing your other personal and professional responsibilities.

(Shortform note: As detailed in _Daily Rituals_ , numerous creative professionals—from Pablo Picasso to Anne Rice—attribute their accomplishments to their consistent daily practice. However, a 2021 study revealed that 58% of people still believe that creative achievement is the result of spontaneous inspiration.)

Rubin adds that consistency isn't only realistic, but it also fuels creativity. Working on a project a little bit every day keeps ideas fresh in your mind and makes it easier to start work every time. It also alleviates pressure and anxiety by ensuring steady progress and fosters a more playful mindset, increasing the likelihood of inspiration striking regularly. The beauty of consistency is that it's self-reinforcing because consistently working on a project strengthens your belief in your ability to make progress on your creative work, instilling a sense of accomplishment and fueling your motivation to keep going.

(Shortform note: To help you stay consistent with your creative work, James Clear, author of _Atomic Habits_ , recommends using what he calls “The Seinfeld Strategy.” Allegedly the secret to comedian Jerry Seinfeld’s consistent success is that he writes every day and uses a calendar to check off each day he’s written. His goal is to not “break the chain” of daily writing. The Seinfeld Strategy helps shift the focus from individual performance to producing consistently and making your consistency visible. Clear emphasizes that for the strategy to be effective, your daily creative task must be meaningful and manageable, for example writing three pages every morning or completing at least one sketch a day.)

#### Step 3: Make Time for Rest and Rejuvenation

As you develop a consistent routine, many contributors emphasize the importance of incorporating periods of rest. This means not only having boundaries to your work day to avoid burnout and ensure adequate sleep, but also incorporating smaller breaks throughout your day. Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, suggests taking a break every 90 minutes of work to ensure peak productivity.

(Shortform note: Integrating regular breaks into your work routine is essential for maintaining optimal brain function and overall well-being. Numerous studies have found that without regular breaks, your brain can become fatigued, leading to decreased cognitive abilities and impaired decision-making. Additionally, prolonged work without breaks can increase stress levels and cause physical discomfort.)

### How to Improve Your Focus

It's not enough to establish a routine for your creative work; you also need to _focus_ on your creative projects when you’re working on them. While the reality of constant connectivity can make it difficult to focus, it’s still possible. **Maintaining focus and avoiding distractions is a skill you can develop with practice**. With improved focus, you'll be able to engage more deeply in the creative process, increase your productivity, and more effectively generate new ideas.

(Shortform note: While you can enhance focus with practice, some doctors also suggest adopting a healthier lifestyle to further improve concentration. By combining regular exercise and a nutritious diet, you can optimize your focus and support cognitive well-being. For example, engaging in regular exercise, such as brisk walking, can stimulate brain chemicals that facilitate the formation of new connections, alleviate stress, and promote better sleep. Moreover, studies indicate that following a Mediterranean-style diet, which includes abundant fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and olive oil, along with moderate red wine consumption, is associated with reduced cognitive decline.)

#### Step 1: Be Intentional

Often the decisions you make that cause you to lose focus—to check email, answer a text message, or grab yet another cup of coffee—are unconscious choices. According to behavioral economist Dan Ariely (_Predictably Irrational_), most of the choices we make are unconsciously determined by what he refers to as choice architecture, the arrangement of options that influence our decision-making.

(Shortform note: According to Chris Bailey, author of _Hyperfocus_ , before you change any behavior, you must first become more aware of these unconscious choices. To increase your self-awareness, he suggests setting an attention alarm, or “hourly awareness chime,” to go off every hour. When it rings, note where your attention is at that moment. Specifically, Bailey recommends asking yourself questions like: What am I doing right now? Is this what I want to be working on? If you find that your focus isn't on your priority task, refocus your attention on what matters most to you. If you notice things about your environment that are consistent sources of distraction, change them.)

Ariely explains that by organizing your environment to minimize distractions and setting defaults that encourage focus, **you can create environments that help you concentrate better** and avoid choices that hinder your ability to pay attention. For example, if you often find yourself getting distracted by social media, you can change the choices available by turning off your phone. This change in the choice architecture will reduce the temptation to check your phone and keep your attention focused on your creative work.

> **Other Sources of Distraction**
> 
> While Ariely explains how minimizing environmental distractions will improve your focus, Nir Eyal, author of _lndistractable_ , points out that up to 90% of our distracted behaviors are due to an internal trigger or discomfort, such as anxiety, stress, or boredom. He suggests several steps to help develop your ability to deal with internal discomforts before they become distracted behaviors:
> 
> First, take time to meaningfully reflect on your triggers and make more deliberate choices about your response to them. For example, if you notice you reach for your phone to distract yourself when you feel overwhelmed, try taking a few deep breaths instead, or engaging in a short mindfulness exercise or another activity that helps you address the underlying anxiety in a healthier way.
> 
> Second, rethink how you label yourself. You naturally align your behavior to fit the way you see yourself, so refrain from labeling yourself in a self-defeating way—for example, “easily distracted” or “incapable of deep focus.” Finally, relabel yourself as “focused” or “able to sustain deep work” in order to prompt more focused behaviors.

In addition to setting up your environment to encourage focus, **practice focusing for longer periods of time**. Newport suggests identifying a concrete task and then focusing on that task for one hour. If you're able to sustain focus that whole time, without succumbing to any distractions, then add 15 minutes to your focus time every two weeks. If you get distracted, he suggests stopping and trying again later. This will train your mind that distractions are unacceptable.

(Shortform note: According to Newport, another way to improve your focus is to embrace boredom. In idle moments, like waiting for the bus or standing in line, most people reflexively pull out their phones to scroll through social media or check their texts. Newport says when you always fill these low-stimuli moments with high-stimuli activities, you deplete your brain’s ability to tolerate boredom. He suggests building your brain’s “focus muscles” by consciously letting yourself be bored in low-stimuli moments. For example, if you’re waiting outside of a bar for your friend, consciously resist taking your phone out. Instead, just sit still and take in whatever’s going on around you.)

Another way to practice focus is through meditation. According to Leo Babauta, author of _The Power of Less_ , being still and focusing on your breath will improve your ability to sustain attention. This practice also cultivates heightened self-awareness, allowing you to recognize distracting thoughts and resist the pull of distractions, enabling you to stay present in the moment.

(Shortform note: Meditation can be intimidating for people who have never tried it before. In _Mindfulness in Plain English, _Bhante Gunaratana __ offers a beginner’s guide to starting a meditation practice. He says the goal of meditation is to cultivate awareness, the ability to listen to our own thoughts without getting caught up in them. He explains that the first step in a meditation practice is to find a comfortable seated position. Then sit motionless, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. If your mind wanders, just gently bring it back to your breath. He recommends starting for a short period of time, but he assures that your stamina will increase over time.)

#### Step 2: Manage Distractions

For many of us, technology is the number one source of distraction. James Victore, designer, filmmaker, and author of _Feck Perfuction_ , explains that many of us have allowed our devices, with their constant alerts and buzzing, to determine our priorities. He insists that the key to developing a healthy relationship with technology is to remind yourself that **you're in control of how you focus your attention** and to make sure you're using technology in service of your priorities.

> **Why Is Focusing So Hard?**
> 
> While you're in control of how you focus your attention, Bailey (_Hyperfocus_) explains why staying focused feels so hard. While our world has changed rapidly due to advances in industry and technology, our brains haven't kept up. According to Bailey, we have three biological tendencies that make our brains ill-prepared for the modern world.
> 
> **1.We default to autopilot mode.** Instead of proactively choosing what to focus on, our brains tend to react to external triggers that catch our attention. Bailey explains that we have a natural inclination to respond to novel, potentially dangerous, or gratifying stimuli. While this instinctive response can be beneficial, it also makes us highly susceptible to distractions.
> 
> **2.We can only pay attention to a limited amount of information**. Our brains can only process and focus on a finite amount of information at any given time. With an overwhelming amount of stimuli competing for our attention in today's fast-paced world, our limited attentional resources can easily become strained, leading to difficulty maintaining focus.
> 
> **3.We love to task-shift. **Our brains have a natural propensity to seek out new and different experiences, often leading us to switch from one task or activity to another. While this adaptability can be advantageous in certain situations, it also hinders sustained focus and productivity when we constantly shift our attention from one thing to the next.

Social media and email are often the worst sources of distraction, easily pulling our attention away from more important work. Lori Deschene, founder of Tiny Buddha, says that it’s important to **pay attention to when and why you engage with social media**. Social media can be helpful as long as you make sure you're using it intentionally in a way that serves you and your work.

(Shortform note: In addition to setting time limits on your social media and removing apps from your home screen, you can be intentional about how you curate your social media feed. One social media director suggests looking through your feed with the goal of editing it. Only follow accounts that are informative or those that leave you feeling inspired or joyful, and unfollow or block any toxic content that doesn’t serve you or your goals.)

Aaron Dignan, founder of The Ready and author of _Brave New Work_ , has a similar suggestion for how to manage email. He suggests considering every email through the lens of your long-term goals by following two simple rules:

First, **keep your long-term goals in mind**. Email often pertains to how we manage the minutiae of our day, but, according to Dignan, most of those smaller tasks connect to larger goals. If you're clear on your long-term goals, you can mentally organize your email according to how the correspondence impacts those goals. For example, if your long-term goal is to launch a successful startup, you can prioritize emails related to funding, partnerships, and product development over less impactful messages. He suggests writing your goals down somewhere visible and reviewing them every couple of months to make sure they’re still accurate.

Second, **give yourself permission to say no.** You’ll inevitably get emails that don’t have any connection to your goals or priorities. Don’t let distracting opportunities pull you away from what’s most important. You can’t do everything, so don’t try. If you get an opportunity or request that will distract you from your goals, say no, and move on.

> **Changing the Culture of Email**
> 
> While Dignan offers individual strategies to address the challenge of navigating a relentless inbox, in _A World Without Email_ , Newport advocates organizationwide changes to minimize the number and frequency of emails you receive.
> 
> For example, one of the systemic changes he calls for is establishing clear communication protocols within an organization. Newport argues that by implementing specific guidelines for when to use email versus other forms of communication, such as instant messaging or face-to-face meetings, you can significantly reduce the influx of unnecessary emails. This not only streamlines communication but also encourages more focused and productive exchanges.
> 
> Additionally, Newport suggests adopting collaborative tools and project management platforms to centralize information sharing and task coordination, reducing the reliance on email for these purposes. By embracing these organizational changes, he explains, people can foster a culture that values efficient and purposeful communication, ultimately transforming the way we use email and improving overall productivity and well-being in the workplace.

#### Step 3: Stop Multitasking

One of the ways we lose our focus is by trying to do too many things at once. Christian Jarrett, psychologist and editor of _Psyche_ magazine, argues that if you want to improve your focus, you should stop trying to multitask. He explains that the ability to multitask is a myth. People who claim to multitask are in fact task-switching, shifting attention quickly from one task to another, which gives neither task full focus. Task-switching over the course of a day or several hours can also negatively impact your focus because it requires constant mental readjustment and can lead to decreased productivity and increased cognitive fatigue.

(Shortform note: In _Eat That Frog_ , business consultant Brian Tracy goes into greater detail on the impact of task-switching. He explains that when you switch from one task to another, it takes an average of 17 minutes to refocus on your original task, potentially increasing the time it takes to complete that task by up to 500%. Moreover, the more interruptions you experience and the more often you switch tasks, the more mistakes you're likely to make.)

Jarrett explains that starting a new task before the first is finished can leave what scientists call “attentional residue” where your brain is still at least partially occupied by the unfinished task. He suggests that if you have to leave a concrete task unfinished, try to pause at a logical stopping point that leaves at least one portion of the task complete.

(Shortform note: While Jarrett’s suggestion seems intuitive, a psychological phenomenon known as the Zeigarnik Effect suggests that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. Therefore, some psychologists suggest that stopping a task in the middle of a flow, in a “bad stopping place,” can increase your motivation and ability to get started again the next day. They even suggest getting started on the next task for a minute or two before stopping, as the unconscious brain will continue to work on it until you return.)

### How to Hone Your Creative Mindset

As you give yourself more time to work on creative projects, you also need to practice honing a creative mindset that keeps you inspired and helps you better work through challenges and creative blocks.

#### Step 1: Prioritize Unstructured Creativity

Todd Henry, founder of Accidental Creative, suggests that the key to sustaining creativity is to **make time for unstructured creativity** (what he calls “unnecessary creation”), creative projects or activities that may not have a specific practical purpose or immediate outcome. He explains that while it may seem counterintuitive to invest valuable time in something seemingly purposeless, doing so will nourish your creativity and keep your motivation alive.

(Shortform note: In _The Artist’s Way_ , artist and educator Julia Cameron suggests that tapping your creative potential also requires you to seek out new sources of inspiration. She suggests scheduling a weekly “Artist Date,” a designated time to take yourself on a solo excursion that stimulates your creativity. These outings could include visiting art galleries, exploring nature, attending a live performance, or simply indulging in a hobby or interest—anything that inspires your creativity.)

Henry writes that when creative people only apply their skills within the confines of their job, they can become frustrated by the restrictions and judgment attached to their work and eventually lose inspiration. Unstructured creativity, on the other hand, allows you to break free from constraints and external demands and tap your true creative potential. It fuels inspiration by making room for the exploration of new ideas and the development of new skills and perspectives, reconnecting you with your intrinsic drive to create.

(Shortform note: While creativity can be unintentionally squashed in the workplace, this doesn’t have to be the case. According to the _Harvard Business Review_ , organizations have the potential to inspire creativity in the workplace by matching people with assignments that align with their expertise and interest, allowing autonomy on projects, providing the necessary resources, and promoting diverse teams that bring different perspectives.)

To prioritize personal creative projects, Henry suggests dedicating regular blocks of time for unstructured creativity. He also suggests maintaining a list of exciting projects to work on during that time and keeping a notebook to capture intriguing questions and ideas. That way you’ll always have an idea you can be working on.

(Shortform note: If you're looking for a more structured system for managing your time and keeping track of creative ideas, _The Bullet Journal Method_ offers a structured approach to nurture and evolve creative projects. For example, using a daily log allows for quick recording of insights and thoughts, while integrating creative prompts fosters idea generation; an index acts as a valuable tool to capture random thoughts and sketches, preventing loss of these ideas and promoting curiosity. And when you move content from one part of your journal to another during the migration process, reviewing and revisiting entries facilitates idea development.)

#### Step 2: Reject Perfectionism

Even when working on purely personal projects, many creative people still struggle with perfectionism, but, according to Elizabeth Grace Saunders, author of _The 3 Secrets to Effective Time Investment_ , **perfectionism is the enemy of creativity**.

(Shortform note: Some studies support the negative impact of perfectionism on creativity. For example, ​​a study published in the _British Journal of Psychology_ found that participants who aimed for excellence instead of perfection exhibited greater originality and openness to experiences while perfectionists displayed fewer original ideas and were less open to new experiences.)

She explains that there are typically two contrasting approaches to creativity: striving for flawless execution or valuing practicality over perfection.

Those who strive for flawless execution refine every detail and seek the elusive ideal of perfection. They can be highly critical of their own work and may be hesitant to share it until it meets their lofty standards. Perfectionism not only prevents them from taking risks, but often prevents the work from ever being completed or shared.

(Shortform note: Why do so many people fall prey to perfectionism? While unrealistic expectations may be to blame, there’s more to the story. Psychologists say that society’s increase in social media use, as well as greater academic and professional competition, have caused a spike in perfectionist tendencies over the last 30 years.)

On the other hand, those who value practicality and progress prioritize taking action, embracing imperfections, and iterating on their ideas. Rather than being hindered by the fear of failure or the pursuit of an unattainable ideal, they focus on experimentation, learning, and adapting their work along the way. They understand that imperfections and mistakes are integral to the creative process and use them as stepping stones to refine and improve their creations.

(Shortform note: Not only will a more practical approach improve your creativity, but according to mental health experts, embracing imperfection leads to higher resilience, increased self-esteem, less judgment of others, improved emotional well-being, and healthier relationships.)

Acknowledging that we all want to do our best work, strive to value practicality and progress. You'll produce more creative work and be less stressed in the process.

(Shortform note: While Saunders argues that high standards of perfection constrain your creative potential, others suggest that raising our standards to a reasonable degree is necessary to achieve our goals. By having higher expectations for ourselves, we raise our level of performance to meet them, and better performance naturally leads to greater achievement.)

#### Step 3: Lean Into Challenges

Whether a perfectionist or a pragmatist, you’ll inevitably feel stuck sometimes. Creativity coach Mark McGuinness explains that while these moments can feel paralyzing, they have the potential to inspire rather than frustrate.

He argues that **understanding the type of creative block you're facing can be a powerful tool in overcoming it**. Here are several common types of creative blocks and suggested strategies to move through them:

**Lack of inspiration:** If you find yourself lacking inspiration for a project, take a break and allow your unconscious brain to continue working on it in the background, even if your conscious mind isn't actively engaged. (Shortform note: Other experts recommend doing the opposite, and just diving in whether or not you feel inspired. In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ ,**** David J. Schwartz says by simply going through the motions inspiration will come. For example, if you’re a writer, just start writing, jotting down any ideas that come to mind. Sooner or later, the act of writing will spur creative thinking.)

**Extrinsic motivation:** The pressure for success can be overwhelming and hinder creativity. Create a dedicated space or time solely for creative pursuits, free from discussions about business or money, to protect and nurture your creative process. (Shortform note: Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, you could be working on a project where you were intrinsically motivated because you like the work, but extrinsically motivated because you’re getting paid for it.)

**Emotional block:** Sometimes, an emotionally intense or intimidating project can lead to procrastination. Remind yourself that you have the ability to create whatever you desire, and ultimately you have control over who will eventually see your work.

**Personal issues:** While challenges in your life can block creativity, the reverse can also be true: Your creative projects can serve as an oasis from life challenges. Embrace the opportunity to gain fresh perspectives by temporarily stepping away from the issues you're wrestling with.

**Limited resources:** Whether it's a lack of financial resources, time, or knowledge, you can make a virtue of necessity by setting yourself the creative challenge of achieving as much as possible with what you have. Remind yourself that more resources don't always lead to better results.

> **Why Some People Navigate Challenges Better Than Others**
> 
> Whether it be grappling with personal trauma, navigating the weight of personal responsibilities, or a lack of financial resources, everyone at some point encounters challenges to their health and happiness that make creative work challenging.
> 
> In _Flow_ , Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains why some people are still able to focus on their work regardless of what they're facing. He explains that there are three factors that affect your ability to effectively manage challenges.
> 
> **1\. Outside support** : Even if you face challenges, having support from family or friends can help you overcome them successfully. For example, a loved one who understands and encourages your creative pursuits can provide emotional support, offer a listening ear, or assist with practical tasks, thereby alleviating some of the burdens you may be facing.
> 
> **2\. Psychological resources** : Having certain mental skills may help you overcome challenges. For example, developing a growth mindset, where you view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning rather than obstacles, can also empower you to persevere and find innovative solutions.
> 
> **3\. Positive coping style** : A positive coping style allows you to set aside frustration or disappointment to objectively assess a situation and decide how to proceed. According to Csikszentmihalyi, a positive coping style (also called transformational coping) has three components: self-assurance, an outward focus, and a solution-oriented mindset.
> 
> While you may not always be able to control your level of outside support, you have the ability to cultivate psychological resources and develop a more positive coping style that can change how you deal with challenges when they occur.

#### Step 4: Take Opportunities to Unplug

Finally, to hone your creative mindset, **take breaks from technology**. According to Tiffany Shlain, filmmaker and author of _24/6_ , disconnecting from screens allows you time to focus on your relationships, personal reflection, and creativity. She advocates for a “technology shabbat,” a practice of turning off all screens for one day a week. As Scott Belsky, Adobe's chief product officer and co-founder of Behance, explains, disconnecting from the constant flow of information and communication will empower you to tap your imagination, be more in touch with your instincts, and take advantage of unexpected opportunities and connections that you might’ve otherwise missed.

(Shortform note: The negative effects of technology, specifically smartphones, may be more insidious than mere distraction. Psychologist Jean Twenge, who researches generational differences, has observed that children born after 2005 have experienced a sharp increase in mental health crises, including depression and suicide, coinciding with the rise of relying on their phones and social media as their primary source of human interaction.)
