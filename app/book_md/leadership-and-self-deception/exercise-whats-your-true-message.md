## Exercise: What’s Your True Message?

Regardless of what management technique you use, people pick up on and respond to the feelings behind your actions (your feelings toward them). If you convey insincerity or disrespect, they’ll resist or respond in ways that make matters worse.

* * *

Think of a time when someone asked for your opinion on something, and you sugar-coated your response because you didn’t want to offend them. Did they pick up on your true feelings? How do you know this?

How could you have conveyed your true feelings honestly, without offending them?

Think of a situation at work where you’ve held back until now from saying what you think. How can you convey your views in a constructive way?
