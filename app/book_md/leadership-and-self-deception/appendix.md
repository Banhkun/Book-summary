## Appendix: How to Use This Book

The ideas in this book can help organizations succeed and improve personal satisfaction and relationships. The following are areas where you can apply the concepts:

  * **Applicant interviewing and hiring** : Ask job applicants to read; then discuss the concepts and how they apply to company practices and expectations. Use this to evaluate whether candidates have the characteristics necessary for success.
  * **Leadership and team building** : Teach leaders how to be out of the box so they can help and lead others to get results. Also, teach the concepts to improve cooperation and teamwork.
  * **Conflict resolution** : Because most conflicts are rooted in blame, you can reduce them by teaching people how to stop being in the box/self-deceived and blaming others. Teach them to instead focus on others’ needs. Problems can’t be resolved until people understand their role in creating them in the first place.
  * **Building accountability in organizations** : Teaching leaders to be out of the box encourages initiative, responsibility for results and for responding to others, and accountability.
  * **Personal development** : Getting out of the box increases happiness and satisfaction. It improves self-esteem, treatment of others, and the ability to change.
