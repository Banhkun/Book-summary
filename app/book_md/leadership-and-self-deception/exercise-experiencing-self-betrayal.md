## Exercise: Experiencing Self-Betrayal

You betray yourself when you don’t do something you feel you should do—for instance, not apologizing when you know you should. Once you’ve betrayed yourself, you feel guilty and try to justify it—for instance, by exaggerating other people's faults.

* * *

Think of a situation at work or at home where you thought of something you should do, but you didn’t do it. How did you feel immediately after choosing not to act?

What rationale or justification did you come up with to make yourself feel better for not doing it?

If you had done what you felt you should at the outset, how would you have viewed the situation differently?
