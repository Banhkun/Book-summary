## Exercise: Activate Your Subconscious Mind

According to Rotella, activating your subconscious mind allows you to perform at your best, whether you’re giving a speech or playing a competitive match. Consider ways you can quiet your conscious mind and let the quality of your training shine through.

* * *

Think of a recent time you had to put your skills to the test and felt like you could have performed better. What were you consciously thinking about at the time? Did you feel pressured or doubt your skills?

How did your emotions or thoughts affect your performance? For example, did your doubts cause you to rush through an important presentation?

What is one way you could detach from the outcome of the event next time? What might you imagine you were doing instead? For example, if you were giving a speech, you could pretend that you’re in a book club discussion with friends.
