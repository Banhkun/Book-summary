## 1-Page Summary

In _Cynical Theories_ , authors and academics Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay discuss _social justice_ , or attempts to address inequalities based on factors like class, race, gender, and so on. They argue that over the last few decades, advocates for social justice on the left have become increasingly radical and authoritarian in their beliefs and methods. The contemporary _Social Justice Movement_ rejects core tenets of Western liberalism—namely freedom of speech and belief in science—in favor of their own methods of critiquing and policing culture. Pluckrose and Lindsay make the case that these liberal tenets are preferable for battling inequality and improving society since they allow for open discussion and scientific progress.

(Shortform note: While the term Social Justice Movement sounds like it refers to an organized campaign or political faction, many authors, cultural critics, and politicians view the Social Justice Movement less as a _single_ entity and more as an ideology influencing many different institutions in society—academia, corporations, and even the military. According to these authors, this influence is often top-down, with people in power enforcing the beliefs of the Social Justice Movement in their organizations. Examples of this influence include mandatory diversity training and requiring the use of gender-neutral language.)

In this guide, we’ll explore Pluckrose and Lindsay’s arguments in four parts:

  * **Part 1: How Social Justice Changed** will show how the beliefs and methods of social justice movements changed over the past 50 years.
  * **Part 2: The Social Justice Movement Rejects Science** discusses the specific anti-science beliefs of the Social Justice Movement.
  * **Part 3: The Social Justice Movement Rejects Freedom of Speech** describes how the methods of the Social Justice Movement repress free speech. 
  * **Part 4: Why Society Should Return to Liberalism** outlines why academia and society should return to the values of liberalism.



(Shortform note: Pluckrose and Lindsay primarily focus their critiques on the academic world, arguing colleges and universities are the source of the Social Justice Movement. The title of _Cynical Theories_ is a play on academic language— _critical theory_ refers to the general style of left-wing cultural critique used by the Social Justice Movement. The cynicism, on the other hand, comes from the Social Justice Movement’s repressive and authoritarian tendencies.)

### Part 1: How Social Justice Changed

Authors, academics, and cultural critics Pluckrose and Lindsay begin by discussing the history of social justice in politics and scholarship over the past century or so to show how it went from a positive force to its current form. They separate this history into three main phases:

#### Phase 1: Material Approaches

For a long time, social justice movements focused on _material issues_ , or concrete political and economic advances. Advocates for social justice had specific goals—women’s suffrage, an end to legal segregation, or legalized gay marriage, for example. The authors outline two main forms of scholarship that take material approaches to social justice: liberalism and Marxism.

(Shortform note: In addition to liberalism and Marxism, religion was also an important part of many early social causes. Religious groups provided not only the organization necessary to advocate for a cause but also common, relatable rhetoric around equality and charity. In the United States, for example, early social justice movements from the abolitionist movement to some feminist groups to the civil rights movement were based in large part on the ideals of Christianity.)

##### Liberalism

Liberal scholars and activists believe society should be run according to reason, logic, and evidence-based arguments. Just as science uses evidence and reason to arrive at objective truths about the world, liberals argue that empirical evidence and rational debate can determine the best path forward for society. **Liberal activists advocate social justice through concrete legal and political advancements, fighting for universal rights and equal treatment under the law.** This ensures everyone is on an equal playing field in society.

For example, 18th-century liberal philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft (_A Vindication of the Rights of Woman_) argues men and women alike are rational individuals and that when given the same education, both are equally intelligent. She therefore suggests a rational society would extend political and property rights to women as well as men.

(Shortform note: While Pluckrose and Lindsay argue liberalism such as Wollstonecraft’s has declined in social justice scholarship and activism over the last several decades, parts of the ideology still hold sway over politics. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc in the late 20th century, there were no longer any significant challengers to the global liberal status quo. And while some aspects of liberalism have come under attack since, like democracy and free speech, others like free-market capitalism and secularism are still prevalent in global politics today.)

##### Marxism

Marxist scholars and activists believe in _historical materialism_ , or that **all of politics and history is based on economic forces and class conflicts.** This includes social inequalities. Marxists therefore argue the best way to address _social_ inequality is _economic_ change, using revolutionary means if necessary. On a larger scale, they argue socialism will create total economic equality, which will then lead to total social equality. On a smaller scale, Marxist academics study how social oppression comes from and relates to economic inequality and capitalism.

For example, from a Marxist perspective, Americans didn’t enslave Africans _because_ Americans believed in racial superiority. Instead, they enslaved Africans because free labor created an incredible amount of wealth for them. Slave owners used the idea of racial superiority as a way to justify this economic exploitation. In other words, the cultural belief was caused by economic circumstances and not the other way around.

(Shortform note: While _Cynical Theories_ suggests Marxism and postmodernism or critical theories (which we’ll discuss in the next section) are separate fields, some academics and commentators view both as part of a larger whole: a revolutionary ideology looking to try and establish leftist totalitarian rule like that of the Soviet Union. For example, Mark Levin’s _American Marxism_ describes critical theories and Marxism as the same thing, since both employ indoctrination and censorship to achieve their goals. Others, including Lindsay himself in his later work _The Marxification of Education_ , argue that postmodernism _evolved out of_ Marxism and therefore contains many of the same goals and views on society.)

#### Phase 2: Postmodern Deconstruction

Pluckrose and Lindsay explain that beginning in the 1950s, a new understanding of social justice began to emerge: _postmodernism_ , an intellectual and artistic movement focused on challenging existing understandings of the world. Postmodernists focus not on concrete material issues, but instead on how power is expressed through _culture_.

(Shortform note: To better understand what postmodernism is, we can look to what it rejects: modernism. Modernism was an artistic movement popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it tried to make sense of the massive changes caused by industrialization. The modernist movement believed society could make progress and improve over time by embracing technological innovation and rejecting old, “outdated” traditions. In addition, modernists tried to define the meaning of life and morality without relying on religion or strict reason and logic. Postmodernists, on the other hand, argue this cannot be done and that society does not in fact “progress” toward anything.)

Though postmodernism can prove difficult to define, Pluckrose and Lindsay identify two main postmodern tenets:

##### 1) Deconstruct All Truths

**Postmodernism, the authors explain, rejects the idea of objective truth.** According to postmodernist thought, anything considered to be objective truth is in fact a biased _narrative_ , or view of the world created by a specific culture. These narratives often exist to the benefit of people in power since those with the most power have the most control over the shaping and creation of culture. Postmodern scholarship attempts to discover power dynamics behind claims to objective truth and then _deconstruct_ those claims by pointing out their biases and inconsistencies.

This is the foundation of postmodernism’s critique of liberalism and Marxism. Both philosophies believe people can uncover objective truths about the world—liberals through rational thought and Marxists through analyzing class conflict. Postmodernists argue these are both _metanarratives_ , or biased cultural lenses people use to create other narratives about the world.

> **Deconstruction in Action:_Madness and Civilization_**
> 
> To see how deconstruction works in reality, we can look to foundational postmodernist philosopher Michel Foucault and his work _Madness and Civilization_. In it, Foucault deconstructs the categories of “mentally healthy” and “mentally ill.” He claims these categories are part of a narrative _created_ by those in power (doctors and psychiatrists in this case) rather than objective truths about people. These categories allow those in power to justify their biases about who is an acceptable member of society—and give them a justification to control those deemed unacceptable by limiting their rights or imprisoning them in mental hospitals.
> 
> To _deconstruct_ this narrative, Foucault discusses how society’s conception of mental illness changed over time as a result of _social forces_ and how these changes served those in power. In medieval Europe, he says, the “mad” were respected for their unique perspective and insights about the world—insights far more compatible with the era’s religiosity. However, the Enlightenment emphasized a worldview based on perception and empirical evidence rather than religious belief. Under this new dominant narrative, the unique perception and insights of the mad were not a boon but instead a challenge or threat to those in power. Therefore, the mad went from being respected to persecuted.

##### 2) Challenge Cultural Hierarchies

Postmodernists believe hierarchies of power exist within every social class as well as between them—people reinforce narratives through social interactions and conversations, often without realizing it. This occurs even on the level of specific language and word choices as people talking to one another imply hierarchies or echo oppressive narratives created by those in power. Because these hierarchies are everywhere at once and constantly being reinforced, postmodernists didn’t have an answer to how they could be addressed or how society could be improved. Therefore, unlike the Social Justice Movement, early postmodernists stuck to academic analysis as opposed to activism.

For example, early postmodernist Roland Barthes’s work _Mythologies _provides an in-depth analysis of how dominant groups create certain associations or _myths_ that the population at large then repeats and passes on to one another. Advertising does this all the time—Jeep ads associate the vehicle with outdoor adventure and exploration, Gatorade with athleticism and competition, and so on. But while _Mythologies_ shows how myths work and how they can perpetuate social inequality, Barthes doesn’t offer much in the way of concrete advice to address them beyond simply noticing they exist.

(Shortform note: Marxist critics of postmodernism argue it focuses on cultural hierarchy as opposed to class hierarchy because it is inspired far more by middle-class discontent than by the plight of the poor, working-class people. According to these critics, postmodern academics who were securely middle class viewed culture as the main issue threatening equality because they weren’t involved with labor movements fighting for economic equality—labor movements characteristic of previous left-wing scholarship and activism.)

#### Phase 3: Critical Theories

Pure deconstructive postmodernism, the authors explain, wore itself out after only a few decades. Because early postmodernists didn’t believe in objective truth, they couldn’t make any arguments about how things are or should be, causing the mostly academic movement to stagnate. However, a newer generation of academics, artists, and activists in the 1990s through the 2010s _modified_ postmodernism into _critical theories_ , or academic fields that aim to “critique” culture by noticing and challenging specific hierarchies—for example, the academic field of critical race theory “critiques” the idea of race as a whole, challenging those who believe in it.

Pluckrose and Lindsay suggest critical theories became popular because many of the main political goals of past activists were achieved—homosexuality was decriminalized, workplace sexual harassment was made illegal, and so on. Modern social justice activists therefore turned away from material approaches and flocked to the culture-and-language-based approach of postmodernism.

(Shortform note: To show how critical theorists abandoned and critiqued past approaches to social justice, we can look to legal scholar and critical race theory founder Derrick Bell’s view of Brown v. Board of Education. The case is a good example of a liberal approach to social justice since it used an existing institution—the US Supreme Court—to achieve a specific legal goal—outlawing racially segregated schools. But according to Bell, Brown v. Board of Education failed to truly provide equal education to all races. He argues that using the law to further integrate schools is the wrong approach to equality. Instead, he says society should invest more in both desegregated and majority-black schools to improve both.)

The authors outline two main components of critical theories:

##### 1) Postmodern Methods

While critical theories **don’t subscribe to the total deconstruction of pure postmodernism, they still use methods influenced by postmodern thought.** Critical theories still deconstruct dominant narratives and look for hierarchies within language, culture, and everyday interactions at all levels of society.

(Shortform note: While postmodernism has heavily influenced _how_ critical theories study aspects of culture, it doesn’t limit _what_ critical theories study. Instead of being confined to a specific discipline like postmodernism is to philosophy, critical theories can serve as a sort of lens or framework to examine and critique a vast number of different disciplines. Critical theorists have used this general framework to examine topics from film to psychology to economics.)

##### 2) New Doctrines

Critical theories differ from pure postmodernism in that **they establish their own “truths” instead of trying to tear down the concept of truth entirely.** Instead of being content with questioning or deconstructing a dominant cultural narrative, they argue using that cultural narrative is morally wrong. Non-dominant cultural narratives—usually the views and experiences of minority groups—therefore must be morally correct truths.

For example, a pure postmodernist deconstructs the femme fatale trope, arguing it represents a dominant narrative of the danger of women in control of their sexuality. They are content just to point this out, though. A critical theory, on the other hand, might go further and argue that using the femme fatale trope is morally wrong because it enforces this dominant narrative. Therefore, the critical theory suggests people shouldn’t put femme fatales in fiction.

(Shortform note: While the concept of truth changed massively during the development into and out of postmodernism, one component remained consistent: an emphasis on the individual. Liberalism, modernism, postmodernism, and critical theories alike all place individual perceptions at the center of what it means for something to be true—whether those perceptions are the “empirical evidence” behind science or the “lived experiences” behind critical theories. This contrasts with more community-focused philosophies like Ubuntu or communitarianism, which argue the world can only be understood through the lens of different communities of people.)

### Part 2: The Social Justice Movement Rejects Science

Now that we’ve explored how the influence of postmodernism changed social justice, we’ll discuss Pluckrose and Lindsay’s critiques of the modern Social Justice Movement. **Part 2 of our guide will focus on how the Social Justice Movement’s ideology rejects science**. The authors argue this is counterproductive, as scientific research provides the understanding necessary to improve people’s lives in concrete ways (we’ll discuss their arguments on behalf of science further in Part 4).

(Shortform note: Though Pluckrose and Lindsay mainly focus on areas where scientific research and the Social Justice Movement conflict, other critics of the Social Justice Movement suggest it’s negatively influencing science instead of rejecting it entirely. These critics note many math and science institutions have adopted certain ideals of the Social Justice Movement: Requiring diversity, focusing on women and non-Europeans in the history of science, and accepting the idea that the scientific method is inherently oppressive. While this influence is subtler than an outright rejection of science, critics of the Social Justice Movement believe it’s just as dangerous to society.)

Pluckrose and Lindsay cite two main areas as representing the Social Justice Movement’s rejection of science:

#### Gender and Sexuality

Pluckrose and Lindsay explain that the Social Justice Movement believes **gender and sexuality have nothing to do with biology** , instead claiming that gender and sexuality are entirely culturally constructed narratives. Society determines what it means to be a certain gender, assigning certain activities, qualities, and things as signifiers of gender. Then, it assigns genders to people at birth and has them “perform” their gender through these signifiers. For example, a dress isn’t inherently feminine or womanly—it’s just pieces of fabric arranged in a certain way. But society decided to associate dresses with womanhood, and so now women and girls are encouraged to wear them to signify their gender.

The Social Justice Movement argues **the narratives of gender and sexuality are inherently oppressive.** People in power—cisgendered straight men—use strict categories of gender and sexuality to define themselves as the “default” or “ideal,” and everyone else as “inferior” or “abnormal.” The Social Justice Movement believes science is often a tool of this oppression, used to argue straight, cisgendered people are the norm and everyone else is disordered somehow. Therefore, the movement rejects science that claims gender and sexuality are based on inherent, objective qualities (genetic factors or brain chemistry, for example) rather than purely on cultural narratives, viewing this research as an attempt to legitimize oppressive cultural narratives.

(Shortform note: Many liberal and conservative skeptics of transgender rights tend to define what’s acceptable based on specific medical science versus cultural belief. For example, Douglas Murray (_The Madness of Crowds_) suggests some transgender people genuinely experience gender dysphoria and can benefit from gender-affirming medical treatments. However, he also argues cultural influences—like the Social Justice Movement—confuse others into _thinking_ they want the same treatments or into rejecting the concept of gender altogether. Murray therefore believes society should create different categories to distinguish between genuinely transgender people and those who are just misled.)

#### Disability and Fatness

The Social Justice Movement views “healthy” and “unhealthy” as oppressive cultural narratives created by dominant groups in society—abled-bodied thin people, in this case—to label themselves as ideal or default and the disabled or fat as abnormal or inferior. They view attempts to treat or cure disabilities and fatness as part of this oppression since it is society enforcing the idea that it’s better to be able-bodied and thin than it is to be disabled and fat. In other words, it is society saying able-bodied thin people are superior to disabled and fat people. Therefore, the Social Justice Movement is skeptical or even hostile to scientific research trying to cure disabilities or prove why fatness is unhealthy.

(Shortform note: While Pluckrose and Lindsay argue the Social Justice Movement’s views on disability and fatness stand in contrast to scientific consensus, there is some evidence to suggest scientific opinion on these subjects is by no means unified or set in stone. For example, when the American Medical Association recognized obesity as a disease, they did so against the recommendation of their own research panel. In addition, the definition of disability remains in flux, seeing a number of changes in the legal and medical realms over the past several decades.)

### Part 3: The Social Justice Movement Rejects Freedom of Speech

In addition to rejecting science, the Social Justice Movement also rejects freedom of speech, explain Pluckrose and Lindsay. Part 3 of our guide will show **how the beliefs and methods of the Social Justice Movement are anti-free speech.**

#### Anti-Free Speech Beliefs

Pluckrose and Lindsay explain that **the Social Justice Movement is anti-free speech because they believe access to knowledge is based on identity—race, gender, and so on—instead of on reason and evidence.** According to the Social Justice Movement, people of marginalized identities have more knowledge than everyone else about power and oppression because of their experiences. People from dominant groups lack this knowledge, and so the Social Justice Movement believes these people’s ideas about power, oppression, and social justice should be devalued or dismissed. Pluckrose and Lindsay explain this is anti-free speech since it seeks to restrict or devalue ideas based on who says them rather than on merit.

(Shortform note: Some critics of the Social Justice Movement have noted how the movement’s beliefs have led to self-censorship, or individuals and institutions restricting their own speech to avoid controversial subjects. In the publishing industry, for example, some companies are reluctant to publish books where authors aren’t directly discussing their own experiences after a number of high-profile protests. In these protests, books are harshly criticized and even pulled before they’re published due to accusations of racism and other types of insensitivity. This shows how even when the beliefs of the Social Justice Movement aren’t passed into law, they can still limit free speech.)

#### Anti-Free Speech Methods

Pluckrose and Lindsay contend **the Social Justice Movement is anti-free speech in their methods, attempting to police and control people’s language and culture.** Since the Social Justice Movement views oppression as the result of cultural narratives, they try to prevent people from enforcing those narratives in their language and culture.

In practice, this often means ganging up on people with dissenting ideas. The Social Justice Movement is willing to target anyone, according to the authors, because they believe power is exercised on every level of society—a working-class person making an insensitive joke, an academic writing a paper with ideas contrary to the Social Justice Movement, a celebrity making a controversial work of art, and so on. Targets of these attacks may face real-world consequences, losing jobs, being socially alienated, or even receiving threats.

(Shortform note: In academia, fixed doctrines and cliques are nothing new, with many disciplines attacking or censoring dissenting scholars on all sorts of political or even apolitical questions. Fields as diverse as astronomy, linguistics, and psychoanalysis all have their own histories of bitter rivalries, personal grudges, attempts to repress controversial ideas, and insider-outsider mentalities. Therefore, the Social Justice Movement’s anti-free speech tendencies could be symptomatic of a _larger_ problem within academia instead of something unique to the field.)

### Part 4: Why Society Should Return to Liberalism

After outlining historical shifts in social justice scholarship and how they led to the Social Justice Movement’s current beliefs, Pluckrose and Lindsay shift to explain **why liberalism is preferable for addressing social inequality.** They argue that capitalism and democracy—the two cornerstones of liberalism—are self-correcting institutions because they welcome criticism through rational debate and give the people tools (political and economic participation) to address social problems.**** This process of consistent improvement is preferable to the Social Justice Movement, which the authors say aims to shut down rational debate in favor of their own fixed doctrines.

(Shortform note: While Pluckrose and Lindsay view capitalism and democracy as stable, self-improving institutions, some liberal scholars argue they’re relatively fragile and require consistent intervention to function correctly. For example, liberal economist John Maynard Keynes studied the boom-bust cycles of capitalism and concluded for the greatest overall human well-being, governments must supplement the free market with social programs. In addition, many liberal scholars in works like _Why Nations Fail_ and _Making Democracy Work_ argue democracy is very fragile and requires precise circumstances to remain successful.)

To demonstrate why this is the case, Pluckrose and Lindsay show how freedom of speech and belief in science make liberalism better for addressing inequality than the Social Justice Movement:

#### Freedom of Expression

The authors argue liberalism’s emphasis on free and open debate among rational individuals is an excellent way to address social inequality. Freedom of speech and expression allows ideas contrary to dominant narratives to circulate freely and gain traction based on merit, and leads to societal shifts when enough people conclude the status quo is unjust. In addition, emphasis on free and open rational debate encourages people to empathize and cooperate to find common ground—including with disadvantaged groups—helping people address their biases and work together to fight social inequality.

(Shortform note: Instead of just _permitting_ rational, open debate, professor of philosophy Michael Sandel (_Justice_) argues the government should encourage it through public works and community projects. By encouraging people of all backgrounds to work together toward common goals and spend time with one another, Sandel explains, society will develop a greater sense of common purpose and respect. This will then enable more productive conversations around political issues since people who respect one another will be less likely to close themselves off to each other’s ideas or use divisive rhetoric.)

#### Belief in Science

Pluckrose and Lindsay also argue that liberalism’s strong belief in science allows it to challenge dominant narratives and address biases. Since the scientific method relies on evidence-based theories that are rigorously challenged and updated, it enables people to catch and correct their own mistakes—including mistakes resulting from bias. This also means the scientific community is willing to challenge dominant narratives provided there’s evidence to disprove them. The authors suggest evidence-based refutations of dominant narratives are far more convincing to the average person compared to deconstruction or policing language. Therefore, a philosophy based on science is better for getting people to fight social inequality.

(Shortform note: Some philosophers and politicians argue that technical and scientific expertise and knowledge should be the basis of _all_ government decisions. These _technocrats_ on the left and right alike believe rational, scientific thought is the best way to organize society—informing how to address inequality, make the economy more efficient, or even navigate matters of war and peace. Technocrats use logic similar to Pluckrose and Lindsay’s to suggest their system of government is ideal, arguing the scientific method allows the government to get past petty politics and address problems rationally.)
