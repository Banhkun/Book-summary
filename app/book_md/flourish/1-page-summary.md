## 1-Page Summary

Many of us think that happiness is the ultimate goal in life. But is happiness enough for us to _flourish_ —to live well and enjoy our lives to the fullest? In _Flourish_ , psychologist Martin E. P. Seligman argues that **in our quest to flourish as humans, other aspects of life matter just as much as, if not more, than happiness**. He proposes that instead of prioritizing happiness as the gateway to a good life, we—as individuals and as a society—should cultivate _well-being_ , which is a blend of five elements: positive emotion, engagement, meaning, relationships, and achievement. We can fortify these pillars of well-being by applying the principles of positive psychology in our lives and society, so that the whole world can learn to flourish.

Seligman is a psychologist, professor, and pioneer of positive psychology, a branch of psychology that studies how people can experience more positive emotions and lead richer lives. He’s the director of the Penn Positive Psychology Center and once served as the president of the American Psychological Association (APA). His other best-selling books include _Learned Optimism_ and _Authentic Happiness._

In this guide, we’ll first explain why well-being, not happiness, is the key to flourishing in life and explore the five pillars of well-being. Then, we’ll discuss how practicing and teaching positive psychology principles can help you achieve greater well-being. Lastly, we’ll examine the benefits of prioritizing well-being as individuals and as a society. Along the way, we’ll compare Seligman’s insights on happiness and well-being with those of other psychologists and expand on his findings with actionable advice.

### Well-Being Is the Key to Flourishing

We often think happiness is the key to flourishing—to living a rich, joyful, and fulfilling life. That’s what Seligman once believed, too, when he wrote his previous book, _Authentic Happiness_. But now, a decade later, he has a new theory—that **_well-being,_ not happiness, is the key to a good life. **He argues that happiness rests too heavily on having a positive mood, which isn't a reliable indicator of a meaningful life. Well-being, on the other hand, is an interplay of multiple factors that enrich your life, with none being more important than the others.

(Shortform note: Pursuing happiness can actually make you less happy. One study shows that people who value happiness the most have 50% fewer positive emotions, 35% less life satisfaction, and 75% more depressive symptoms than people who prioritize other things in life. This evidence supports Seligman’s multifaceted concept of well-being and suggests that instead of pressuring yourself to be happier, you should pursue other enriching aspects of life. By doing so, you may find that joy and satisfaction come naturally.)

#### The Five Elements of Well-Being

According to Seligman, there are five key elements of well-being:

**1\. Positive Emotions** —Temporary pleasurable experiences such as joy, excitement, and warmth.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor explains that positive emotions cause your body to release dopamine and serotonin, which are brain chemicals that make you feel good. They also stimulate your brain’s learning centers, enhancing your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. These effects help explain why Seligman lists positive emotions as a key element of well-being.)

**2\. Engagement** —A state of flow, which we experience when we're completely absorbed in an activity. This usually happens when we're doing an activity that's challenging, enjoyable, and involves our strengths. For example, you might be in flow while performing music, practicing a sport, playing video games, working on your car, or creating artwork.

(Shortform note: Before you can enter flow and be fully absorbed in a task, you must first set a challenging goal. Having a challenging goal heightens your focus, which is key for flow. The concept of _flow_ originates from the work of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who describes three benefits of flow that might explain why it’s beneficial to your well-being: It boosts your self-confidence, makes your tasks feel more rewarding, and helps you grow into a deeper and more complex person.)

**3\. Meaning** —A sense that we belong and contribute to a purpose larger than ourselves.

(Shortform note: In _Man’s Search For Meaning_ , Viktor Frankl asserts that meaning is something you find _outside of yourself_ , not within. He proposes three ways to find meaning: First, by creating something or performing a deed. Simply having something to accomplish in life can motivate you and give you purpose. Second, you can find meaning through love, which means experiencing and feeling connected with others—whether it’s another person, nature, or art. Lastly, you can find meaning through unavoidable suffering by viewing it as a challenge to overcome and feeling accomplished in how you endure it.)

**4\. Positive Relationships** —Having close, social connections with others. Having positive relationships counteracts loneliness, stress, and depression because humans are social by nature.

(Shortform note: In _The Good Life_ , Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz give an evolutionary explanation for why we’re more stressed, lonely, and depressed without positive relationships: Loneliness triggers a stress response that allowed our ancestors to survive dangers alone, without the protection of others. While this might have helped our ancestors survive in the short term, long-term loneliness is harming the well-being of many people today.)

**5\. Accomplishment** —A feeling of success for having mastered and achieved our goals.

(Shortform note: It may be harder to feel accomplished if you’ve set big goals that take you a long time to achieve. To feel more accomplished while pursuing your goals, researchers suggest you break them down into mini-goals. For example, if your goal is to grow a successful garden, you might set mini-goals like deciding what plants to grow, researching care requirements for the plants, purchasing supplies, and so on. Achieving these mini-goals can give you a sense of progress and accomplishment, which boosts your confidence.)

Seligman asserts that well-being is a more worthwhile measure of a meaningful life than happiness because **it calls for people to build up all five of these pillars in their lives instead of just focusing on _feeling_ good**. You might pursue positive relationships even if they don’t always bring you positive emotions, like when you attend an event you’re uninterested in to support a friend. Overall, the more you build up these pillars of well-being, the more you’ll flourish and lead a rich, satisfying life.

(Shortform note: The elements of well-being might sometimes clash, so how do you choose which ones to prioritize at any given time—for instance, spending time with friends (relationships) versus upgrading your skills (accomplishment)? The solution may be to identify your values, writes Tony Robbins in _Awaken the Giant Within_. To apply his advice to the five elements of well-being, make a ranked list of your current values based on their importance to you and see if changing the order might improve your life. If you value “love” over “power,” you might prioritize positive relationships, even if they limit your time and achievement in your career, for instance.)

#### Well-Being Is Good for Your Health

Seligman writes that **having more positive emotions and high well-being improves your health and protects you from illnesses** —whether it’s cardiovascular disease, cancer, or the common cold.**** He cites research that suggests that people with high well-being have an 18% lower risk of dying from any cause than people with low well-being. According to Seligman, the most notable trait contributing to this better health is _optimism_ , which is a positive outlook on life that increases your well-being.

(Shortform note: There’s ample research that corroborates Seligman’s assertion that optimism wards off illnesses and prolongs your life, with one study finding that optimistic women were more likely to live beyond age 90.)

People who are optimistic tend to be less vulnerable to diseases for several reasons:

  * **They believe their actions matter**. Unlike pessimists who tend to feel more helpless, optimists take action to improve their circumstances, such as caring for their health and practicing good habits.
  * **They have more social support.** Seligman writes that people who express positive emotions more often find it easier to connect with people and form more supportive relationships.
  * **They handle stress better.** According to Seligman, stress tends to impact pessimists more heavily than optimists, and frequent stress has negative effects on your health. For instance, people who have more positive emotions produce less of a substance that causes blood clots.



(Shortform note: In _Mind Over Medicine_ , Lissa Rankin explains why stress affects your body differently depending on your mindset: Negative beliefs keep you in a state of stress and panic, which activates your body’s fight-or-flight response. This response can damage blood vessels, increase your risk of heart attack, weaken your immune system, and lead to stiff muscles if it happens too often or for too long. Conversely, if you have positive beliefs, you relax and brush off stress more easily, which counteracts the effects of the fight-or-flight response. This allows your body to heal and recover, making it more resistant to disease.)

> **How to Think More Optimistically**
> 
> While Seligman lists many benefits of optimism, he doesn’t explain how you can become a more optimistic thinker. Although some research suggests that optimism is partially genetic, there are ways you can cultivate it.
> 
> One of the traits of optimists is that they take more action than pessimists. If you tend to feel helpless in situations, Norman Vincent Peale recommends you practice forming positive mental pictures of how you want things to be. After visualizing your desired outcome, you can take action to make it a reality. By imagining yourself in a better situation and recognizing ways you can change it, you may find it easier to overcome your feelings of helplessness.
> 
> Another trait of optimists is that they have a lot of social support. You can build up your support system by following these steps: First, identify what kind of support you need. Do you need close friends who will listen to you or a professional who can help guide you through your struggles? Second, nurture the relationships you already have. Reach out to your friends and family and spend more quality time with them. Third, if you want to add new people to your life, find others who share your interests. Join groups or clubs that do activities you enjoy to make new friends.

### How to Enhance Well-Being: Practice Positive Psychology

According to Seligman, **we can enhance personal and global well-being by practicing and teaching the principles of positive psychology.** Positive psychology focuses on _cultivating good traits_ and resources that help you get the most out of your life—such as resilience, optimism, gratitude, personal strengths, and so on. It differs from traditional psychology in that traditional psychology focuses on _relieving_ people of miseries, traumas, and other difficulties.

(Shortform note: Positive psychology is a relatively new discipline that was founded by Seligman in 1998. It has its roots in the humanistic psychology movement, which studies how people can achieve their full potential. But while Seligman is often considered the “father of positive psychology,” the term was first coined by humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, who also wanted to shift psychology’s focus to helping people cultivate the _good_ in life. Maslow created a hierarchy of five basic human needs that shares some similarities with Seligman’s five pillars of well-being.)

While helpful to an extent, removing the negative aspects of life doesn’t mean you’ll be happier, Seligman argues. In fact, many methods of reducing negative emotions (such as with psychotherapy or psychiatric drugs) are ineffective or only temporary. Because there’s no lasting cure for conditions like anxiety and depression and no way to eradicate all negative emotions and challenges in life, Seligman writes that we must help people become aware that drugs and therapies only help temporarily, and teach them skills to increase their well-being with positive psychology.

(Shortform note: When it comes to coping with negative emotions, most experts advocate a holistic approach that includes social support and developing resilience but also the use of therapy and medications. They don’t deny the value of positive psychology, but still recognize the importance of managing symptoms and coping with difficulties.)

So, how can the principles of positive psychology help you build the five elements of well-being? There isn’t a step-by-step process to increasing well-being, but Seligman details practices you can use and reflect on for building positive traits, skills, and resources to help you enhance your well-being.

#### Practice Gratitude

Seligman argues that one powerful way to **increase your well-being is to practice gratitude more often.** He explains that humans evolved to dwell on negative things more than positive things. This was useful for our ancestors, who had to regularly navigate life-threatening dangers, but less so for us in modern-day society, where we’re more concerned with leading a satisfying life.

(Shortform note: While Seligman feels that dwelling on the negatives can be harmful for your well-being, Mark Manson argues that being unhappy and dissatisfied is a good thing. In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , he writes that dissatisfaction motivates you to improve your life and pushes you to solve problems, which gives you satisfaction.)

Seligman suggests two ways to counteract our tendency to focus on the negatives and deliberately be more grateful:

**1\. Write down three things that made you happy every day** and include the reason for why they happened. For example, “I set a new personal record at the gym because I stuck with my training and rested well last night.” Seligman notes that regularly writing three good things a day will make you feel happier and less depressed.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor suggests you get other people involved in your gratitude practice. For example, you could start every gaming session with your friends by having everyone share three good things that happened in their day. Practicing gratitude with others exposes everyone to more positive feelings, which boosts well-being even more. It also holds you accountable, which ensures you stick to your practice.)

**2\. Write a gratitude letter.** Think of someone who made your life better and write a letter thanking them. Then, arrange a meeting with that person and read the letter to them. After doing this, you’ll feel happier, and you’ll also have strengthened your relationship with that person.

(Shortform note: Research shows that _expressing_ gratitude—like by writing a gratitude letter—is much more powerful than just _feeling_ grateful for something someone did. When you thank someone, you not only make them feel more satisfied with the relationship, but you also change how you view the relationship. This is because, when you express gratitude, you show that you welcome the other person’s help or support. This increases a sense of dependency in the relationship and makes you view it as more mutually supportive. If you only think but don’t express your gratitude, your relationship doesn’t get the same boost.)

#### Discover Your Personal Strengths

Another way to increase well-being is to**use your strengths and talents more frequently in your life.** According to Seligman, using your strengths is crucial for achieving a state of flow, creating a sense of meaning in your life, and increasing your overall happiness. He recommends identifying your strengths by taking the VIA Signature Strengths Test.

(Shortform note: In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam suggests a different way to identify your natural strengths: Create a bucket list with 100 items and start doing the accessible ones first. Trying different activities can reveal to you what you enjoy and what you’re good at.)

Once you’ve identified your strengths, Seligman suggests you work them into your life more: Schedule a time in the upcoming week to exercise one or more of your strengths. Think of new ways to use your strengths and reflect on how using your strengths made you feel.

(Shortform note: You can take Seligman’s advice one step further and make using your strength a daily routine. Pick one strength and use it at a specific time every day. For example, if your strength is creativity, you can use it every evening by writing or drawing. By doing this, you can turn your strength into a habit, which means you don’t have to rely on motivation or willpower to use it. This can be a simple and effective way to increase your well-being and happiness.)

#### Increase Your Effort and Grit

People often think their ability to succeed is mainly determined by their natural talent or intelligence. But Seligman argues that grit and effort may be more important for success. Grit is a personality trait similar to self-discipline that was identified by psychologist Angela Duckworth. Specifically, it means having a high level of perseverance and passion for a goal. **By exercising _grit_ and spending more time practicing your skill, you can achieve more in your life, regardless of your natural abilities.**

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth explains the two elements of grit—perseverance and passion—in more detail. Perseverance means you don’t give up when you face setbacks, but rather keep trying until you succeed. Passion means you stay interested in a goal for a long time, and don’t get distracted by other things. She also writes that there are two reasons we focus on talent more than effort: First, we usually only see the final results of someone’s work, not the effort they put in to achieve it, which makes us think they’re naturally gifted. Second, we might use a lack of innate talent as an excuse to avoid feeling bad about ourselves if we haven’t achieved the same level of success as someone else.)

While you can’t change your innate talent, you _can_ control how much effort you put into your work.**** According to Seligman, grit is a better predictor of success than IQ. In light of this, he writes that schools must recognize that a lack of self-discipline may be a major factor for why some students struggle to reach their academic potential, and he suggests they adopt programs that build self-discipline and grit.

> **Opportunities Also Affect Your Level of Success**
> 
> In _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell argues that success—in academics and outside of them—is not only determined by skill and effort, but also by opportunities. Opportunity is a factor that’s beyond your control, but it influences whether you reach your goals and potential or whether you face more obstacles. For instance, a student may have self-discipline and grit but no access to challenging school programs and could languish academically for that reason. Gladwell identifies three types of opportunity that increase your chances of success:
> 
> **1\. Having time.** He argues that the amount of time and effort you can devote to your craft depends on your financial privilege. He says that if you have to work more to make a living, you’ll have less spare time to practice your skill, regardless of how much perseverance and passion you have. On the other hand, people with more financial resources can afford to spend more time working on their skills.
> 
> **2\. Gaining practical intelligence.** Gladwell argues that success depends more on practical intelligence than innate intelligence. Unlike innate intelligence (which is the type measured by IQ tests), practical intelligence refers to how well you deal with people. It allows you to navigate social situations and communicate, negotiate, and persuade others to get what you want. Gladwell argues that practical intelligence is developed through effective parenting.
> 
> **3\. Enduring hardship.** According to Gladwell, experiencing and overcoming difficulties can often give you unexpected advantages in the future by teaching you valuable lessons.

#### Foster Positive Relationships

As we’ve discussed, humans are naturally social creatures, and connecting with others makes our lives better. You can improve your well-being by learning to build stronger, more positive relationships in your life. Seligman recommends three ways to do this:

**1\. Learn to celebrate others better.** Strengthen your relationship by improving how you respond to someone’s good fortune or news. He cites the research of Shelly Gable, who explains four main ways people respond to other people’s good news:

  * **Active and constructive** : You engage with and build upon their joy—for example, “I’m so happy for you! How did it make you feel? How do you plan to celebrate?”
  * **Passive and constructive** : You give positive feedback but without engaging—for example, “That’s good to hear.”
  * **Active and destructive** : You engage but focus on the negatives—for example, “But doesn’t that mean you’ll have even more work to do?”
  * **Passive and destructive** : You don’t acknowledge their news at all—for example, “I had a pretty tiring day at work.”



To build flourishing relationships, use the active and constructive communication style: When someone shares something positive that happened to them, validate their joy and ask questions that encourage them to talk more about the situation. By responding this way, you maximize the happiness they feel and learn more about them, which makes you feel more connected.

> **Why Celebrating Better Improves Relationships**
> 
> Researchers explain that celebrating others well amplifies the happiness they feel about the good things in their lives and thus leads to higher-quality relationships with them. People like to share their good events with others so they can feel even happier and more satisfied with the event—a process known as _capitalization_. When you respond enthusiastically when others share good news, you foster a closer and more trusting relationship.
> 
> But capitalization doesn’t work well if the person we share our good news with _doesn’t_ respond positively. A passive or destructive response might signal to the other person that you’re envious of them, which puts distance in your relationship. An active constructive response, on the other hand, signals a lack of jealousy and has many benefits for both the person who shares their good news and the person who responds: It can strengthen the relationship, increase trust and intimacy, and reduce conflict.

**2\. Use more positive statements.** Seligman suggests you pay attention to how often you use positive and negative statements in your relationships, as this predicts the strength of our relationships. He cites research showing that a good relationship requires a 3:1 ratio of positive to negative statements—that is, at least three compliments, encouragements, or appreciations for every criticism or complaint. To improve your relationships, focus on saying more positive than negative things to others.

(Shortform note: We need a higher ratio of positive to negative statements to have good relationships because of the negativity bias. Psychologists explain that humans have evolved to be more sensitive to negative things—you pay attention to them and remember them more than positive things. Because of this, we need more positivity to offset the negativity. If you struggle with remembering to be more positive, in _The Happiness Project, _Gretchen Rubin suggests creating a visual reminder, such as wearing a piece of jewelry or putting up a sticky note.)

**3\. Perform random acts of kindness.** Seligman writes that doing something kind for others can significantly improve your mood and well-being. It can also help you feel connected with others, which researchers argue can actually make you live longer.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found many health benefits to thinking about, doing, or even witnessing kind acts. Performing a kind act triggers your brain to release different neurochemicals, including oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. Oxytocin promotes a sense of connection and helps you live longer by reducing your blood pressure and inflammation, which reduces your risk for diseases like diabetes and cancer. Serotonin and dopamine activate the pleasure centers in your brain and make you feel satisfied. Your brain might also release endorphins, which serve as painkillers.)

#### Strengthen Your Resilience

Positive psychology helps you build the good qualities and emotions of life. But you’ll still face challenging situations from time to time that will trigger negative emotions. Rather than minimize those negative emotions, Seligman argues that you should instead **increase your resilience—your ability to bounce back from hardship.** When you’re more resilient to setbacks, you can cope more easily with the negative emotions that inevitably arise. Many methods for building resilience are the same as those for building well-being, such as developing strengths, cultivating positive relationships, and practicing gratitude.

(Shortform note: People often assume that becoming more resilient means brushing off their negative emotions. But in _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown says that resilience comes from letting yourself feel your negative emotions—allow yourself to cry when you’re sad and try to understand the source of your sadness. She explains that when you try to numb your pain, you also numb your joy. Letting yourself feel negative emotions allows you to fully appreciate the positive ones, and having positive memories can help you cope with future challenges.)

Resilience can improve everyone’s well-being, but it’s especially important for people who face more severe stressors than others, like members of the armed forces, to learn ways to become more resilient. When tasked with improving the psychological fitness of Army soldiers, Seligman uncovered one important avenue for strengthening resilience:_post-traumatic growth_. Post-traumatic growth occurs when someone becomes stronger, wiser, and more capable of overcoming difficulties after experiencing a difficult event.

(Shortform note: Resilience isn’t the only benefit of post-traumatic growth (PTG). According to studies on military personnel, soldiers who experience PTG also see improvements in other aspects of their lives, such as their mental health, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and relationships. Research suggests that certain personal factors can increase a soldier’s likelihood of experiencing PTG, such as being hardy (physically and psychologically tough) and responsible. Soldiers who have stronger social support systems—which include good team relations and healthier relationships with their partner or family members—tend to also experience more PTG.)

Seligman argues that raising awareness of the potential for post-traumatic growth can boost resilience among soldiers. When soldiers know about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but not post-traumatic growth, they may be more prone to developing PTSD. Further, teaching soldiers ways to achieve post-traumatic growth can help them become more resilient to the hardships of their profession.

(Shortform note: You might be skeptical about Seligman’s claim that simply _knowing_ about post-traumatic growth increases a person’s likelihood of experiencing it. But studies support this, showing that the more you think about the traumatic event, the more likely you are to grow from it. This is because growth happens when you’re able to make sense of the trauma and create a new worldview. However, some experts caution against encouraging people to see their trauma as a platform for growth. This can cause people to feel pressured to claim that they’ve grown from their trauma and hide their suffering when they’re still struggling with it. This can lead to a worse decline in mental health.)

### The Future of Well-Being and Positive Psychology

Now that we’ve explored various ways to increase well-being, let’s discuss Seligman’s hopes for the future of positive psychology and how he believes teaching well-being can improve quality of life across the globe. Seligman argues that **we should teach positive psychology and promote well-being not only on an individual level but also on an institutional and national level.**

Seligman discusses ways positive psychology programs have already benefited various institutions, like by improving learning in schools and enhancing psychological wellness in the military. To increase well-being for more people, he advocates that workplaces and institutions (educational, governmental, and so on) adopt the principles of positive psychology. Teaching people the pillars of well-being and arming them with tools to achieve them will enable more people to lead healthier, satisfying, and more productive lives.

(Shortorm note: Some experts argue that, for positive psychology to successfully raise well-being in various domains, the exercises for promoting well-being (such as expressing gratitude or using strengths) should be customized to fit different personal and situational contexts. They claim that the effectiveness of these exercises often depends on variable factors, such as an individual’s motivation, personality, or culture, which may make some interventions more effective or suitable for some people and contexts than others.)

On a national level, Seligman writes that countries should consider well-being as a measurement of their growth and success—in addition to GDP (gross domestic product). He points out that despite human progress, technological advancements, and countries getting wealthier, people aren’t getting happier. The United States has tripled its GDP, but life satisfaction has remained the same, and depression and anxiety have increased. This is because wealth doesn’t lead to flourishing: _well-being_ does. When nations have reached a stable level of prosperity, they should turn their attention toward increasing the well-being of their citizens rather than further expanding wealth.

(Shortform note: While Seligman doesn’t have a specific proposal for how nations can measure well-being in addition to GDP, other researchers have offered recommendations. Some suggest that nations open a democratic dialogue so their citizens can express what issues they care about most. Others propose new indexes that might better indicate a nation’s well-being: For instance, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposes 11 indicators for quality of life with its Better Life Index.)
