## Exercise: Respond Actively and Constructively to Good News

Practice using active and constructive responses to celebrate othersâ€™ successes and improve the quality of your relationships.

* * *

Describe a recent time when someone shared good news with you. What was the good news about?

What did you say in response to their good news? Which of the four response styles did you use?

How did the other person react to your response? Do you think they felt more positive or excited? Or did they seem disappointed?

How could you have responded in a more active and constructive way? What questions could you have asked the other person to allow them to elaborate on the good news?
