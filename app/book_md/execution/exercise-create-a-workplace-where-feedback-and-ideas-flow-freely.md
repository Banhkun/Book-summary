## Exercise: Create a Workplace Where Feedback and Ideas Flow Freely

Bossidy and Charan say that great leaders make decisions based upon accurate, up-to-date information and actively seek input from people at all levels of the company.

* * *

What opportunities are available for people in your company to share their feedback and ideas (for example, performance reviews, company meetings, anonymous surveys, or informal conversations)? Do you wait for people to volunteer their input, or do you explicitly request it? Why?

Describe the last time an employee or colleague disagreed with you or shared an idea you didnâ€™t like. How did you respond? How might your response have encouraged or discouraged future input?

Imagine you could go back and respond to that same situation again. What would you do or say differently, and why? Remember: Every interaction is an opportunity to expand your awareness and develop the critical thinking skills of your people.
