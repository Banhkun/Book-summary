## Exercise: Find Your Story

The way we view our lives has a big impact on what life we are able to live. But changing our lives can be as easy as believing we can write a different story for ourselves.

* * *

How would you describe the story of your life up to now?

What’s one change you could make to your story that would better align with the life you want?

Name one difficult situation you’ve experienced with someone in your life and the feelings you had about that person and the situation?

Knowing what you do now about feelings and life circumstances, how would you change your feelings about that person and situation?
