## Exercise: Use the Keys to Change Your Life

Changing your life for the better involves more than simply feeling love. There are steps you can take to improve your chances of manifesting your dreams.

* * *

Do you regularly show gratitude for the things in your life? Why or why not?

Name three things you are grateful for right now.

What did you dream of becoming as a child? Did that dream come true? Why or why not?

What aspects of your childhood dreams still excite you? How might you use love to incorporate those aspects into your current life?

What do you dream about now? What type of make-believe games might help make that dream a reality?
