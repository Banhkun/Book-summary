## Introduction: The Path to The Power

Rhonda Byrne will never forget September 9, 2004, because that was the day her life changed. She’d been struggling for a while, and it seemed as though her job, relationships, and finances were beyond repair. But on this day, **her daughter gave her a 100-year-old book,_The Science of Getting Rich_ by Wallace Wattles, and her life changed**.

From this book, Byrne created the fundamentals of her groundbreaking book, _The Secret_. The success of that book caused thousands of readers to share how _The Secret_ changed their lives. Through these stories, Byrne saw a common factor— _Love_. This common factor is the basis of _The Power._

You don’t have to read _The Secret_ to understand the guidance within _The Power_. You just have to be open to the possibilities that exist inside of you to make your life what you want it to be through love. **You can have everything you want in this world because you have the ability to love.** This book will help you learn how to harness the power of love for your advantage.

(Shortform note: Read our summaries of _The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace Wattles_ and _The Secret_.)
