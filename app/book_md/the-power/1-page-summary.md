## 1-Page Summary

Love is the way. This concept is well-known and often promoted in religious, philosophical, and humanitarian spheres. But there is another reason leading with love is important—**the amount of love you give to yourself and the world correlates to the circumstances of your life**. Your ability to live a fulfilling and joyful life is dependent on your ability to fall in love with life and feel that love deeply. In _The Power_ , author Rhonda Byrne builds off the concept of the law of attraction from _The Secret_ to explain how _love_ is the determining factor underlying that law. Through love, you can form a lasting and powerful relationship with the universe to attract the things and life you want. (Shortform note: You can find the summary for _The Secret_ here.)

### The Power of Love

Love is not simply an emotion celebrated in movies, songs, and romance novels. Love is a force in nature just like gravity, physics, and magnetic fields. Like those other forces, **the force of love is invisible, but it is present in every decision you make and interaction you have with people and life’s circumstances.**

When you give and feel love for the people and things in your life, you emit a positive energy that connects with the law of attraction. By its nature, the law of attraction receives the pictures of life you send it and returns those pictures back to you as people, circumstances, or events that change your life. Whether those changes are good or bad is based on whether the picture you sent was positive or negative.

#### How Your Thoughts and Feelings Shape Your Life

Life is not random and does not simply happen to you. You create your life every day through the choices you make. Think of life like a big catalogue of all the things it has to offer. Like a clothing or home furnishings catalogue, you flip the pages and see items that you either want to buy or not. Similarly, each day, life presents options to you that you can choose to either accept or decline. The options you see are determined by the frequency you’re on. You only receive options with the same frequency, and you can either choose to sync your frequencies together or move on.

So what is a frequency? A frequency is an energetic signal you send to the universe that activates the law of attraction. You create this frequency through your thoughts and feelings.

**Your thoughts create the frequencies of your life, and your feelings magnetize them so they reach the law of attraction.** Positive thoughts place whatever you’re thinking about on a positive trajectory. For instance, if you want a better job, the way you think about your current job dictates whether your career path will be positive or negative.

  * If you think about how much you love your job and all the good things it brings to your life, you have jumped on a positive frequency with work.
  * If you think about how much you hate your job, you have jumped on a negative frequency regarding work.



You will receive either positive or negative circumstances surrounding your future job prospects because of these thoughts.

Your thoughts only gain power when you attach feelings to them. Feelings strengthen the energetic field surrounding your life. Positive thoughts fill your field with love, and negative thoughts remove love from your field. Whatever charge your field carries is the energy the law of attraction will pick up and send back. **So keep your thoughts positive, because it’s impossible to feel bad when you are thinking good thoughts.**

For example, how you feel about your job determines your job experiences:

  * When you think about the things you love about your job, you magnetize the work frequency positively, and the law of attraction will have no choice but to reflect back more to love about your job. This could manifest as a promotion, more interesting responsibilities, more money, or a dream job. 
  * When you think about how much you hate your boss, the long hours, or your duties, this lack of love is sent to the law of attraction, and it has no choice but to reflect back that lack of love for work. This could come back as more hours, a worse boss, a bad assignment, or a loss of the job. 



You can’t dictate what the law of attraction will send to your life, but you can dictate how you feel. **Keep your thoughts and feelings positive to ensure whatever comes back to you will support your ability to remain positive and find more things to love in your life.**

#### Boosting Positive Feelings

Even if you have a specific desire and project positive thoughts and feelings about it to the universe, you can do more to ensure you’re attracting the most beneficial picture you can by boosting your feelings. **You can supercharge your powers of attraction by filling your life with as much love as possible.**

When you have a desire you want to achieve and set your feelings on a positive frequency, sit with the good feelings to strengthen them. Feel them deeply in your heart until you feel completely full of love for that thing.

Look for other things to love to strengthen the power of your energetic field. Every time you feel love for something, you give love to that thing. **The more love you give, the stronger your magnet becomes to attract love back.** And the more love you attract back, the greater the reward you’ll receive will be. To strengthen your energetic field:

  * Identify all the things you love about your life and feel that love. 
  * Search for the things you love in the world and feel that love deeply. 
  * Pile on as much love to your good feelings about something specific as possible to ensure what you receive is the best version of that thing. 



### The Process of Creation and Unlocking Your Power Potential

You can use your thoughts and feelings strategically to get what you want with the three-step process of creation. First, we’ll cover the three steps to bring what you want to your life: Imagining, Feeling, and Receiving. Then, we’ll explore how to strengthen your ability to attain what you want using three Keys of Love to become the most powerful magnet you can be.

#### Three Steps for Creating Attraction

**1\. Imagining:** Visualize what you want and imagine having that thing now. Use every sensation to make the picture as real as possible. What does what you want look like, and what does your life with that thing look like? **Make the vision as clear as possible in your mind so the law of attraction knows exactly what to reflect back to you.**

  * If you want to travel to Paris, imagine what being in Paris looks like. Imagine the smells of the pastries, the sounds of life on the streets, the feel of the cobblestone streets, the image of people at sidewalk cafes. See yourself in front of the Eiffel Tower, and taste the coffee, wine, and cheeses. The more real you can make the picture, the more you can feel your desire. 
  * Sometimes using a prop can help. Put pictures of Paris around your house to help you visualize it better. Wear a beret so you feel French. 



There are no limitations to what you can have in life, only limitations to what you allow yourself to imagine. The force of love is the greatest force in the universe, which means nothing is too big for it to tackle. **Don’t worry about the logistics or magnitude of what you desire. If you can imagine it, it exists in the universe.** Draw it to you with your imagination.

**2\. Feeling:** Once you imagine what you want, feel the joy of having it. **Believe that what you want is already yours, and feel love for that thing in your heart.** Sit with that feeling and experience the depth of joy you would feel with it. The deeper you can feel that joy, the stronger your energetic field becomes. Don’t stop until you feel your magnetism bursting with the ability to pull your desires to you.

Tips for Feeling:

  * If you struggle to believe you can have what you want and feel the joy of it, draw a circle and place a dot in the middle. Label that dot with your desire so you will see how small of a task it is for the force of love to bring it to you. Every time you look at the dot, feel good about the ease with which your desire will be brought to you. Then feel how happy you’ll be when you receive it. 
  * Focus on the full picture, not just the general idea of having your desire. Feel the joy of each aspect of having that thing. Find all the elements of your vision that you can love, then give as much love as you can to each element. Your feelings will grow stronger, and you will be able to attract more love back to you.



**3\. Receiving:** After you’ve imagined what you want and felt the joy of having that thing, all you have to do is receive it. **Trust that once you create the positive frequency for your desire and magnetize it with love, it will be yours.** The law of attraction will shift the universe to bring you the people, circumstances, and events that support your desire and the life you want.

Tips for Receiving:

  * Don’t deviate from your positive frequency by doubting whether you will really get what you want. Doubt interjects negative feelings, and your frequency has suddenly changed. The bonds are created the moment you think of your desire and feel the joy of having it. Believe and move forward confidently toward the life where you have what you want.
  * Feel your desire deep in your heart. That is the only way to activate the law of attraction to bring it to you. 
  * Keep your desires positive and feelings good to receive positive and good things. If what you desire brings harm to another person, those negative feelings will bring back harm, rather than the thing you desire. 



#### Three Keys for Strengthening Attraction

**1\. Love:** Fall in love with life like you would fall in love with a person. When you fall in love with life, you experience joy on a regular basis. All you see when you look at the world is what you love about it. **The more joy you feel and love you give to the world, the more you fill your life up with love.** You become so full of positivity that you glow and radiate positive energy. You reach your magnetic potential, and your ability to attract what you want becomes instantaneous.

  * Talk about everything you love about life. When you’re walking down the street, comment on how much you love your neighborhood, the trees, the birds, the flowers, the sun on your face, and the people you see. 
  * Look around your life and give love to every aspect of it. Give love for your home, family, electronics that make your life easier, pets, and the clothes you wear. 
  * Look at yourself and give love to what you like about yourself. Give love to your eyes, ears, tastebuds, and nose. Give love to your legs, arms, mind, and soul. Give love for your appearance and style.



The more you look at life through the lens of love, the more joy you’ll feel and the stronger you’ll become in bringing more love to you.

**2\. Gratitude:** When you are grateful for who you are and what you have, you feel love for those things. **Gratitude is the easiest way to give love. It’s impossible to feel bad when you’re showing appreciation for your life.** And all you have to do is say, “Thank you.” Gratitude multiplies to make your world more positive. The law of attraction will pick up your gratitude and give you more to be grateful about. Show gratitude daily to keep receiving more gifts in your life.

  * Show gratitude for what you’ve been given in the past. You can’t have what you have now or be the person you are today without the things that happened in the past. 
  * Show gratitude for what you have in your life now. You can’t expect good things to come into your life if you don’t appreciate the good you already have. 
  * Show gratitude for what you will receive in the future. Be thankful for the things you will receive as though they are yours, and the law of attraction will bring back whatever you’re grateful for. 



**3\. Play: Play make-believe games to envision the life you want, like you did as a child.** Get lost in the fantasy of your perfect world, and make a game of it.

  * Pretend you are a character in your new world, and act like that character. 
  * Put on the clothes or costume that suits the person you want to be. 
  * Perform skits of what you would do in that life. 



Playing is fun and keeps you in a positive spirit, and play helps you deepen your imagination. The law of attraction can’t tell the difference between pretend and real thoughts. It just picks up the energy you feel about that thing and returns that picture back to you.

### Money, Relationships, and Health

The feelings you have about the financial, emotional, and physical aspects of your life have created your current circumstances. To get on a better path for each of these, use specific strategies to change how you feel to change your circumstances.

#### Make Money Stick to You

When you have money, you feel good about money. When you don’t have it, you likely worry about money, which means you feel bad about it. Your current financial situation is based on the feelings you’ve had about money up until now. **If you want to bring more money into your life and make it stick, you need to form a positive relationship with money.** Good feelings make you a magnet for money. Bad feelings make you repel money.

  * Show gratitude for your current financial situation, regardless of what it is. When you are grateful for the money you have, the law of attraction will bring more money for you to be grateful about. 
  * Be thankful for money that comes into your life, no matter how big or small. When you’re happy about receiving money, the law of attraction will return that picture as more circumstances for you to receive money. 
  * Think of bills as payments of gratitude for the services that make your life possible. Write “thank you” on your electronic payment for the way electricity supports your life. If you can’t afford to pay the bill right away, write “thank you for the money” on the bill, and the law of attraction will respond by bringing you the money needed for that specific bill. 
  * **Imagine you have all the money you need and be grateful for it.** Imagine what you will spend the money on, and feel the joy of having those things. If you feel the joy of abundance in your life, the law of attraction will return abundance. 
  * Give love to others when they come into money or get a raise. When you give love for others’ windfalls, you place yourself on that positive frequency and will receive your own windfall. 



**Whatever way you can find to improve your relationship with money by feeling good about money, do it.** If you feel bad about money, all you will receive are more situations that help you feel bad about money, like large bills, car repairs, or bad investments. You must feel good about money for the law of attraction to bring more good into your life.

#### Get the Relationships You Want

Giving love to other people is one of the best ways to harness the force of love. You don’t have to love everyone you know or meet or even love everything about people. But when you give someone, even yourself, love, you project positive energy surrounding your interactions with people in your life. **With this positive energy, you will attract back only positive people and people that make your life positive.**

  * If you blame your partner for your unhappiness or show them anger, it creates negative feelings about that person. Those negative feelings don’t affect that person’s life unless they choose to let them. In contrast, those negative feelings do affect _you_ because the law of attraction will bring more negativity as blame or anger in your life, even if it has nothing to do with the other person. 
  * If your partner is behaving or treating you inappropriately, show yourself love. When you take abuse from another, you feel bad, and you don’t want to attract more bad back. Give love to yourself, and the law of attraction will return that love back to you. Your partner may become a better partner, or you may receive the circumstances that help you find a happier life. You can’t know, but you know it will be right if you have given love. 



Give love to strangers you pass on the street. Give thoughts of abundance to friends and family who need it. **Give love away whenever you can to others. Whatever love you give to others will be returned to you.**

Everyone comes into your life for a reason, and all are emotional allies. Some of them will be kind and loving and make it easy to give them love. Others will be harsh and mean, and those are the ones who are the most significant. If negative people are in your life, it means you’ve been lacking love. Change your feelings for the better. In addition, negative people test your ability to give love even in the most difficult circumstances. When you’ve learned to give love during hard times, it will become easier to do it when things are good.

#### Think Healthy to Be Healthy

Your body is full of trillions of cells that help keep you healthy and strong. You are in control of all of these cells and command them to do what you want. You feel your emotions with your heart, and the heart is the center of your body’s universe. When you feel positively about your health in your heart, the love force in your cells increases, and they work to keep your body in a positive state. When you feel negatively, the life force of your cells drains, making them vulnerable to disease.

Most people fear diseases, but this focus creates a negative frequency regarding their health. **You must think about how good your health is or how good you feel in your body for those pictures to be sent to you.** And showing gratitude for your health is a good way to promote positive feelings about health.

  * Tell your cells how strong and powerful you feel. 
  * Tell your cells how good your hearing or eyesight is.
  * Tell your cells how happy you are that you can eat anything and not gain weight. 
  * Tell your cells how relaxed and well-rested you are. 
  * Be grateful for your health and life. 
  * Be grateful for the body you’ve been given and all the wonderful things it does for you.
  * Be grateful for the nourishment you put in your body, and say thank you for everything you eat and drink. Only eat when you are feeling positive.
  * Be grateful for the medications that help you feel better.
  * Be grateful for your ability to create the body you want through love. 



**Whatever you believe about your body is what will be true.** If you want to lose weight, focus on what you love about yourself and the joy you will feel when you have the body you want. If you show disgust for your body or believe losing weight is hard for you, you will not receive the positive body you want. Be mindful of your beliefs regarding your health and appearance. You only have to be sick, old, and self-conscious if you think you are.

### Moving Forward With Power

If you don’t give love, you can never get love back in return. Your life will be difficult as the wrong people and circumstances come into it, one after the other, until you stop the cycle with love. Every time you choose to show love for someone or something, you add more positivity to the world. Your light shines brighter, and all the good you can imagine will be drawn to it. **You have the power within you to change your life in every imaginable way.**

To move forward harnessing the power of the force of love, use these tactics to stay on a positive path:

  * Show gratitude daily for as many things as you can.
  * Use a symbol to help you understand when you’re on a good frequency. When you see or hear this symbol, you’ll know you’re giving love. 
  * **Be alert to your life and the world around you.** Life is constantly sending you messages or clues about what frequency you’re on and how to get the things you want. For instance, when you see a beautiful car, life is offering that car to you as an option for you to choose with love. If you’re distracted or on autopilot, you’ll miss life’s communications. 
  * Be mindful about labeling the things in your life. Nothing is good or bad until you label it as good or bad. 



**Live your life with pure love and positivity in your heart.** If you do, you will experience the deepest sense of happiness you’ve ever felt and will experience heaven on Earth. The power to have that life is yours if you want it.
