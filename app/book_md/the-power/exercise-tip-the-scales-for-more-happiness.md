## Exercise: Tip the Scales for More Happiness

It’s not easy to stay positive all the time. But to change your life, you only need to be positive most of the time.

* * *

What are some ways you can boost your positive feelings about your life? (For example, name two things you can see right now that you’re grateful for. Or think of one thing you love about your job.)

Name one struggle you’ve faced recently. With what you now know, in what ways could your feelings have contributed to that struggle?

What are two feeling patterns you can change today to tip the scales of positivity for your benefit? How will you change them?

What can you do to act with more intention in life, rather than react to the events of your life?
