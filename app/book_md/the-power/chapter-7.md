## Chapter 7: Love and Relationships

Love rules all relationships, and your interactions with people are the gold standard of the force of love. That is not to say that you love everyone you know or strangers on the street. It means the choice to show love to people is present every time you encounter someone. The law of attraction can’t differentiate between friend, family, or foe. It simply recognizes that you are harnessing your greatest power.

**Show and give love to others through support, friendliness, encouragement, benevolence, understanding, and gratitude.** That force of love will come back to you, and when it does, it can touch all other aspects of your life. The opposite is also true, of course. Give anger, hate, or any other negative feeling to others, and expect the same to return to you.

### Your Relationship Is What You Make of It

Look at your close relationships. Are they good, strong, and loving? Are they in jeopardy, struggling, or negative? **Whatever state your relationships are in today is the result of the love or a lack thereof you’ve been giving.**

Intimate relationships are often your downfall in bringing love to your life. It’s easy to take your frustrations out on those you care about or are close to because you trust that the relationship will continue regardless of what you do. And although the negativity you show that person might not harm the existence of the relationship, it will harm your life by returning to you as negativity.

#### It’s Not Them, It’s You

There’s a tactic promoted in couple’s therapy to avoid “you” statements when attempting to resolve a conflict. The idea is that “you” statements make the other person feel threatened and defensive. Regarding the power of love, “you” statements also place the responsibility of your happiness on another, and that’s simply not how it works.

Remember, there is no one but you for the law of attraction. The law is not a referee or mediator. It only picks up your frequency, and you can’t receive what you don’t give. If you place blame on your partner for your unhappiness, that blame is going to manifest in your life, not theirs. And you can’t tell the law of attraction that you can’t show love to someone because they don’t show it back. Even if your partner, parent, child, sibling, or friend has done something to upset you, your reaction is the only thing that counts.

If you’re in a bad place with a relationship, change it by changing how you feel. **Seek out the things you love about the person, even when angry, and feel that love and show gratitude for those things.** As that gratitude multiplies, the relationship will get better. You may not understand what’s happening, but the other person will miraculously change and provide more positivity for you to love and be grateful for.

#### Love Is Not Possession

You, like many others, have felt unhappy with the choices or behaviors of someone you’re intimately attached to. In those moments, it’s easy to try to force the person to get in line with what you want or expect from them, but this is not love.

You don’t give love when you:

  * Try to change someone to suit your needs
  * Assume you know what’s best for someone and force that belief onto them
  * Refuse to accept another’s perspective that differs from yours 
  * Blame, demean, nag, or ridicule someone 



Everyone has the right to live freely as they will and be who they want to be. **When you try to thwart that freedom, you give negativity because you disrespect their freedom to choose.** What you receive back may not involve that person, but it will involve situations where your freedom is also disrespected.

The most challenging aspect of any relationship is when it ends against your will. You likely have a broken heart or are hurt deeply, but you must continue to give love to that person to move forward. When you try to argue with them or force them back into the relationship, you’re not giving love. You’re not respecting their choices, and you cannot get on a positive frequency.

Giving love to people during this difficult time will be a challenge. And if they’ve wronged you or disrespected you, it will be even harder. **But you only hurt yourself when you become bitter, spiteful, or vengeful.** Instead, give yourself love, for you will need it to heal. And give them love to find whatever they’re looking for. You’ll feel better, and you’ll get over the heartache faster because all of that love will be brought back to your life.

It should be noted that giving love to people is not the same as letting people use or abuse you. If you are used or abused, you do not feel positive, and your suffering is multiplied as those bad feelings attract more back to you. Your abuser does not receive any consequence from your bad feelings. **Change negative relationships by finding all that you can to love about yourself and life.** The law of attraction will present you with people or circumstances that will help lift you out of the bad place.

### Don’t Choose What You Don’t Love

Within the giant catalogue of life, you will be presented with many options that involve people. You can either choose to love them, not love them, or love part of them. You always have the choice to turn away from someone entirely. But **if you choose to love someone,** **love the parts of them you say yes to and turn away from the parts you don’t without judgment.**

You are under no obligation to love every part of someone. But when you fixate on what you don’t love or rally against it, you create a negative frequency. In contrast, when you only engage with the parts you love, you are able to give love, and it will be returned as more to love about that person. The parts you turn away from might disappear or remain, but they will definitely become outnumbered by the parts you love.

**Stay on the love frequency to draw people on similar frequencies to you.** The law of attraction won’t bring a negative person as a response to a positive frequency. If you are always on a positive frequency, you can trust that the people you meet are the right people for your life.

Everyone has good and bad days, and when you feel frustrated or unhappy, you likely interact with other frustrated or unhappy people. **If you want to experience the happy version of others, be the happy version of yourself first.**

#### Each Person Is an Emotional Ally

**One way to stay positive even around negative people is to view them as a personal love trainer.** You will have sessions with relaxed and supportive trainers who make choosing love easy. But you will also have sessions with hard and critical trainers who act like boot camp sergeants. This latter group are also allies because they test your love boundaries and strength. You have to fight harder to choose love with these people, which helps you get better at choosing love always, even when life is difficult.

Don’t be manipulated by trainers who try to push you toward judgment or negativity. It’s a trick to see what you’ll choose. If you absolutely can’t find anything to love, choose to turn away from that person or negative training. Never give in to manipulation. It only hurts you in the end.

When you turn away from something or someone negative, immediately turn toward something you love. Look around for things to love and give love to them to get back on a good feeling frequency. **Look at every challenge as a test of your strength of love, and you’ll gain power over the negative aspects of your life.**

Another purpose of the militaristic trainers is to bring awareness to your current feelings. You would not be in this training session to begin with if you were on a positive frequency. Therefore, as well as challenging you to give love under the worst conditions, these trainers alert you to the bad feelings you’re already living with. Get on the love train, and the negativity of others will not be able to catch you.

### Be Kind to Others

When you celebrate another’s windfall, you become a magnet for that windfall. Likewise, when you celebrate another person’s positive spirit, you become a magnet for that same spirit. **Show admiration and appreciation for others to become a magnet for admiration and appreciation.** Discuss the good qualities of another person to have those good qualities stick to you. Whatever you see and call out about someone else makes you a receptor for the same.

#### Gossip Will Be Your Downfall

A little gossip can be a lot of fun. But gossiping is about deceit and judgment. If it wasn’t, it would just be sharing good news. Deceit and judgment are negative feelings, so guess what comes back to you?

Even if you’re not the one gossiping, you’re still risking negativity in your life. You can’t hear negative things without experiencing a reduction of positive energy. When your family gossips about another family member, your co-workers gossip about your boss or another employee, or your friends gossip about a celebrity, you take in those bad feelings, and they become yours and only yours. **To thwart the negative frequency, stop gossiping or listening and immediately show gratitude for or say something nice about the target of the discussion.**

#### Think Before You Act

Your reactions create your emotions, so it’s vital to think before you react in your interactions with others. **If someone triggers you to react with anger, stop and do your best to immediately switch your feelings.** Even just acknowledging that you’re reacting poorly reduces the power of the negative feelings.

If you can’t get your feelings under control during difficult moments, walk away. Spend a few minutes alone so you are the only influence on your feelings. Seek out 10 things you love and give love to them one at a time until your feelings change and you get on a better frequency.

**You can make any relationship a good relationship in your life by staying aware of your reactions.** Even if you feel like the relationship is doomed or can’t imagine how things can get better, show love. Remember, the logistics of how your life changes are not your concern. The law of attraction will provide what you need to help you get what you want. If you want a better relationship, you will get it. It may not be the relationship you’re currently in, but you will know that it wasn’t the right one for you if you’ve given love and received love back.

One other benefit of staying positive in difficult moments is that your magnetic shield becomes filled with love. Your supercharged magnetic field works like a force field against others’ negativity. Stay positive and repel the efforts of people to harm you.

You can’t change what happens in the external world, but you can change your feelings. **When you change your feelings, you change your world.** As your world changes, the external world will change, too.
