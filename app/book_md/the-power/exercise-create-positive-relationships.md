## Exercise: Create Positive Relationships

It’s easy to want to blame others when our relationships are less than positive, but who we are in relationships is more important than the way others treat us.

* * *

Think of an intimate relationship you have or have had. What are two ways that relationship was successful?

What thoughts and feelings can you find that helped support those positive aspects?

Think of a major issue you’ve experienced in either your current or a previous intimate relationship? What was it?

How did that situation make you feel, and how would you go about changing your thoughts and feelings about it now?

What are two positive aspects of this person? In what ways can you turn away from their negative aspects for future harmony?
