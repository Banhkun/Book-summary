## Exercise: Create a Schedule for Your Project

Brooks explains that often projects fall behind not because workers are lazy, but because they are poor at creating accurate estimates of work times and keeping themselves on schedule. In this exercise, pick a project and put Brooks's advice into action by creating both a schedule and a strategy for meeting your deadlines.

* * *

Pick out a project that you would like to complete. It could be a personal goal or a work project. Once you pick out your project, break it down into steps. Get as detailed as you can. What needs to be done, and in what order, for you to complete this project? Explain your answer.

Brooks argues that people tend to be optimists when estimating schedules and forget everything that can go wrong. Now that you have a list of all the steps required for your project, brainstorm a list of everything that could possibly go wrong, recalling how similar projects have been derailed in the past.

Now, you have a list of tasks, and a list of ways each of them could go wrong. Estimate how long each step will take, assuming things go wrong, and set some goals. Remember Brooks's advice on setting goals: They should be measurable and binary so there is no ambiguity as to whether they've been met.

By this stage, you should have a clear set of measurable goals with enough time planned for all your worst-case scenarios. Now all you need is a system for recording whether each goal has been met on time so you can avoid the accumulation of small delays. Brainstorm some methods for keeping track of your progress and write down your favorite.
