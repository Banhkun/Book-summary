## Part 3: Understand Your Woman

You’ve now explored your masculine core. In this section, you’ll explore the feminine mindset, learn to understand the meaning behind your woman’s words and complaints, and discover how to share your masculine gifts with her.

### Treat Woman and World as You Wish Them to Be

The more familiar you become with your woman and your world, the more your desire and interest in them wane; the excitement of discovery fades, and they become lifeless and unattractive.

A mediocre man would move on, to a new job and a new mistress, rejuvenating his life with fresh energy, excitement, and polarization. But, eventually, the novelty wears off and he finds himself once again inhabiting a lifeless, unattractive world.

**Your loss of interest is not the fault of your career, nor is it the fault of your woman.** It stems from your lack of whole-hearted engagement; how can you expect to be excited and delighted by something you don’t fully embrace? Your familiarity has led you to stop ravishing them, depolarizing your relationship.

A Superior man takes responsibility for his mindset and rises to the challenge, knowing his woman and his world can only look as bright as he’s willing to see them. He knows it’s up to him to revitalize his woman and his world by reclaiming the excitement and attraction that was once born of novelty.

**What to Do:**

Your woman is more sensitive to sexual energy than you are. The instant your attraction and excitement begin to wane, she feels that she is loved and desired less, and begins to wilt. **To recapture excitement and passion, you must repolarize the relationship.**

If you wish your woman to be radiant and delicious, return to treating her—fully and openly—in a way that makes her _feel_ radiant and delicious. **When your interest in the world wanes, change your mindset, reclaim your excitement, and let the world you see adjust itself accordingly.**

### Understand What She’s Getting At

The Superior Man is open to the undercurrent of his woman’s words; he sees the truth she’s aiming for and responds with love. In this section, you’ll learn to understand what your woman means when she confuses you most.

#### Realize That Your Woman Lives in the Now

The masculine respects a history of success and good behavior, but when you let your woman down it doesn’t matter to her that you’ve been perfect every other time. Being an asshole for 30 seconds will hurt her no less if you’ve been perfect for 30 years than it would if you’d been an asshole forever.

**What matters most to her is how she feels in the current moment.**

The Superior Man does his best in every moment, knowing that his woman lives and loves _here_ and _now_.

**What to Do:**

Don’t get angry when she’s upset about one little mistake. Instead, shift the energy of the moment. **Lift her heart with your love** ; surprise her with your humor. Instead of justifying your mistake, restore love and humor to her current moment, and your mistake will become history.

#### Respond to Her Challenges With Love

Your woman tests you because she wants to see that your love is unshakable, that you’re confident in who you are, and that you can be happy without her validation. **It’s your stability and strength that pleases and excites her most** , so she’ll test you in your moments of greatest success—she knows you become vulnerable in the wake of your fulfillment.

A good, strong woman wants a good, strong man. She knows that at your core you are free and powerful, and she won’t settle for anything less than your best self in every moment. She values your ability to maintain your confidence, your joy, and your love for her even when she prods you in your weak spot.

**Her role in the polarity of intimacy is to surrender openly and fully to you and to do that she needs to trust you entirely.** She needs to know that you’ll love her without compromise no matter what she does or says because that’s what enables her to be totally vulnerable to you, body and soul.

The Superior Man accepts his woman’s challenges as opportunities for introspection and growth, allowing her to drive him toward his greatest potential. **Don’t ask her to demand less of you; she deserves everything you’ve got.**

**What to Do:**

Meet your woman’s challenges, criticisms, doubts, and complaints with humor and love. Show her**** your openness, integrity, and strength. Remember that what she wants is to know that you’ll love her wholeheartedly no matter the circumstances and that you won’t stop loving her. **Embrace her, make her feel loved, and appreciate her for pushing you to remain who you are.**

#### Attend to What She Feels, Not Just What She Says

The masculine style of communication is to say exactly what we mean, according to a well-considered stance based on our experience and the events at hand. **The feminine style is to communicate the textural feeling of the moment, not the literal details of the situation.** Emotions and moods are solid, real things, but they pass quickly and change often.

Her words take into account her feeling about your relationship and both the seen and unseen nuances of the situation. There’s often wisdom there that’s unavailable to your way of perceiving the world.

When you don’t clean the garage even though you said you would, that means more to her than you see. She may complain to you that the garage is a mess, but what she means is that she can’t trust your word. She’s attempting to highlight a current instance of an ongoing issue with the way you’re living your life. **The solution she seeks is deeper and broader than the content of her complaint.**

Similarly, she may express disinterest or ambivalence when you ask her if she’d like to see a movie with you, but change her mind after you pick her up, spin her around, and kiss her. Her initial disinterest had nothing to do with the movie. Her feeling of being loved refreshed her excitement about spending time with you, so her interest in the movie changed.

**What to Do:**

Understand that her inability to trust that you’ll do what you say is a huge problem. **If you claim responsibility for the livelihood of your woman, you demand a lot of trust from her.** When you act in ways that diminish that trust, she feels that her life with you is in jeopardy. She can’t trust your masculine direction, or your commitment to your purpose. **Your integrity is critical** ; to trust you with _her_ life, she needs to trust you with _yours_.

**Show her that you’re doing everything you can** in service of your masculine mission, so she doesn’t have to embody her own masculine energy to manage that for you. When you force her to keep track of things you let slip by—when you watch TV instead of paying the bills—she has to compensate for your lack, and can’t relax into her feminine essence. The relationship becomes depolarized, and you jeopardize your intimacy and passion.

**Establish intimacy in the moment** , so that your woman feels loved enough that she may speak openly. Try to differentiate between her sensitive wisdom and her shifting moods. Be responsible for your own decisions, so that you won’t blame her when her mood changes.

### Let Your Woman Follow Her Own Flow

The feminine energy is an ocean. It is vast, unpredictable, and chaotic. It is both destructive and creative, and its course changes according to its own logic.

The masculine enjoys charting a path, making maps, analyzing the tides, setting goals, and following through; we’re the ships on the ocean.

The Superior Man understands that his woman benefits more from reassurance and love than she does from analysis, and doesn’t force her into his masculine mindset.

**The full embodiment of femininity is to be moved by love and life** , to go with the flow and be swept up in the moment. A woman who fully embodies her feminine sexual essence is deeply connected to her energy, sexually and spiritually. When she surrenders her body to you, she does it in the same open, wholehearted way that she surrenders herself spiritually, emotionally, and experientially to the world she lives in.

Your woman will be emotionally chaotic, she’ll change her mind according to a spiritual, energetic sensitivity that is totally invisible to you. And her connection to that energy—the way it fills and moves her body—will delight and excite you as much as it’ll confuse you.

**Don’t ask your woman to be more like a ship** ; asking her to analyze her mood with the goal of fixing it will not serve her well. Her ideal is to relax and surrender, to sink into and embody her internal ocean.

Analyzing and fixing restricts and restrains the fullness of her experience. Her freedom, unlike yours, doesn’t come from analyzing the blocks to her ability to love. **It comes from embracing that love and allowing it to overflow without limits.**

**What to Do:**

Encourage your woman to be as unreadably feminine as she is; be the stable masculine pole and allow her to be the chaotic feminine. The polarity is what feeds your mutual passion and desire. **Let her be who she is fully, without suppressing it** , without asking her to change or calm down or be reasonable. Stand firm in your masculine stability and allow her to flow around you as aimlessly and chaotically as she feels is right. **If you want to be happy in your intimacy, allow the polarity of your sexual essences** ; let her be crazy, mysterious, and irresistible.

Don’t analyze her, and don’t ask her to analyze herself. Instead, allow your analysis of _yourself_ to stabilize _you_ , and allow her to use your stability as a point of reference. **Share your love with her fully** , no matter where her internal ocean takes her, so that she has a safe port to return to. When you give her that, she’ll be able to surrender to her own flow, follow it wherever it goes, and return to your loving safety whenever she needs it.

### Share Your Gifts With Her

In this section, you’ll learn what you can give your woman that she can’t give herself. These are your greatest gifts to her; a Superior Man understands that giving these gifts freely and openly is his role in the relationship.

#### Love Is the Greatest Gift You Can Give Her

Remember that the feminine seeks to be filled with love. This is what drives and motivates her; when you express unconditional love to her, you give her the greatest gift she can receive.

**At her deepest level, your woman’s difficulties arise from a feeling of being incompletely loved.** This is the source of her destructive moods; her anger, sadness, and upset. Because she always lives _now_ , her moods deeply impact her experience. Throughout the day, her feminine side is either opening or closing her heart as her mood fluctuates, making her daily world unpredictable and frightening.

**The Superior Man understands that while his woman _can_ escape her darkness on her own, his loving intervention can brighten her mood far more quickly than she could herself.** He gives his woman the love and support she needs to pursue her own solutions, instead of promoting her feelings of powerlessness and insecurity by bombarding her with advice.

When you refuse to engage with her—when you recoil from her moods in fear and disgust—you teach her that she isn’t always worthy of love. And you practice retreating from challenge, fear, and unpredictability, instead of living at your edge.

You experience the fullness of life when you give your greatest gift in every moment regardless of your fear, transforming the occasion by magnifying love and having no attachment to the outcome. There will always be a cycle of rise and fall, and your options are fear or mastery.

The purpose of intimacy is to help each other grow better than we could alone, in our personhood and love, through mutual gifting. **Your greatest gift to her is to open her heart** , and her gift to you is to provide you with opportunities to face your fear. In this way, you’ll learn that every situation is workable, and she’ll learn that to be loved, all she has to do is be who she is.

By engaging with her, you grow closer to your deepest purpose, and she to hers.

**What to Do:**

When your woman is caught up in her emotions, get involved. Instead of trying to fix the problem, start by addressing the mood. **Assume that what she needs is to feel love, and help the mood pass before seeking the problem.** Your goal is to keep loving freely, openly, and fully no matter what your woman or the world confronts you with.

Breathe fully, deeply, and openly. Join her in the mood she’s inhabiting, embrace her, and lift her out of it. **Love her fiercely and uncompromisingly** ; show your love with humor and physical touch, not just words. Use your body to show her your stability and clarity, and let her feel that she’s safe with you. Communicate your freedom from the fear her intensity throws at you with your body. Release her from her fear that she has moods in which she becomes unlovable by loving her no matter what.

**Practice responding to fear and uncertainty with openness and love** ; if you show your woman you can’t handle her anger, she’ll feel that she’s unlovable when she’s angry. Because she _needs_ to feel loved no matter how she is in the moment, she’ll return to that anger until you fill the emptiness that drives it with your love.

Similarly, understand that the feminine side of your woman thrives on praise and support, not challenge and criticism. When you tell her she could be more attractive if she exercised, she hears that you don’t love her the way she is. Instead, **praise the qualities you want her to grow** , no matter how small they currently are—she will hear that you love what she _is_ , and she will magnify that.

#### Give Her the Benefit of Your Perspective

The masculine enjoys analyzing situations and making the best decision, but giving your woman this opportunity is not a gift. When you expect your woman to make her own decisions and to be responsible for the results, your refusal to share your masculine gift damages her ability to trust you.

**Feminine decisions are based on what _feels_ right**, and masculine decisions are based on an analysis of the possible outcomes of all the options. When your woman asks for your opinion, she’s not asking you to choose _for_ her. Embodying the masculine pole by sharing your analytical perspective enables your woman to embody her feminine energy more fully, deepening the intimacy of your relationship.

Often, her feminine way of deciding will be better for her than your masculine way, but it’ll still be helpful for her to hear what you think.**Her deepest desire in intimacy is to relax and surrender to your direction.** When you don’t share your masculine perspective, you force her to be her own man; to embody the masculine and analyze the situation herself. The more you make her do this, the more she has to neutralize her feminine essence. Instead, give her the opportunity to open herself up to whatever you have set for her, and to relax into simply enjoying what comes.

**Remember that your intimate relationship requires polarity** ; if you want to be the masculine pole and to have her embody the feminine, embody the masculine and be that for her when she needs it.**** Let her be free to make her own choices, but **give her the gift of your masculine decisiveness.** In doing this, you’ll maintain the polarity of your relationship, giving her the comfort of your stability. She’ll be able to surrender to you sexually because you’ll have enabled her to relax into trusting your masculine energy.

**What to Do:**

Always help your woman make decisions by sharing your masculine perspective and telling her what you’d choose. Be clear and decisive, and let her know that in the end the choice remains hers, and that you’ll love her regardless. If the choice she makes isn’t the choice _you’d_ make, don’t be offended; her decisions are based on what feels right for her. **Don’t think your input is wasted if she doesn’t follow it.**

When it comes to planning events, **don’t just ask her what she wants: figure it out yourself.** Learn from experience what she enjoys, what blooms and fulfills her, and give her that without asking. Escort her, lead her, and let her trust your direction. She doesn’t want to do the work of analyzing her options, choosing the best direction, and deciding on an itinerary. Instead, she’d much prefer to relax, knowing that you’ve planned everything out of your love for her. Give her that, and watch her shine.
