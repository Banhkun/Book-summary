## Introduction

As men and women have gained equality, the benefits have come at a price.

In an effort to land in a neutral middle, men diminish their masculinity, and women diminish their femininity. We feel uneasy about who we are and how we should be, so we’re driven by discomfort and fear. When we suppress a core aspect of ourselves, we become unable to be genuine and open, so we can’t relax into the fullness of love. **Neutralizing our essence diminishes our intimacy, our sense of purpose, and our ability to connect with our internal selves.**

David Deida, who conducts spiritual growth and intimacy workshops and has published 10 books in 25 languages, tells us that sexual polarity is the force of passion that arcs, almost magnetically, between masculine and feminine poles. **Polarity isn’t necessary for love, but you need it for sexual passion** ; one partner must play the masculine role, and the other must play the feminine role.

Passionate sex requires one who desires to ravish, and one who desires to be ravished. Most people strongly prefer one role over the other, though some enjoy both or feel differently toward different people. This book is for men who are unabashedly masculine (they desire to ravish) and who are attracted to the feminine (those who desire to be ravished). To determine which role you generally prefer, think about which you are more attracted to:

  * Feeling that your sexual partner is stronger than you, or feeling their physical vulnerability?
  * Pinning your partner, or being pinned by them?
  * Feeling your partner swooning in your arms, or being swept off your feet?



If you chose the former rather than latter options, your role is masculine, and you should aim to become a “Superior Man.” **To embrace his place in the polarity of intimacy, the Superior Man must unite heart and spine, be open to the present moment, and relax into the fullness of love.**

Become a Superior Man by learning to be authentic. In the process, find and prioritize your purpose, understand and fulfill the needs of your woman, discipline your desires and insist on growth, embrace and channel your attraction to the feminine, and prioritize connection over pleasure.

(Shortform note: For the sake of clarity, we’ve reorganized the book’s 8 chapters into 6 parts and grouped principles by theme.)
