## Part 4: Manage Your Relationship

In this section, we’ll explore the differences in priority between masculine and feminine, and what your responsibilities are in your relationship.

### Encourage the Difference in Your Priorities

A masculine man’s primary goal will always be his mission, and a feminine woman’s primary goal will always be to maximize the flow of love in her life—this asymmetry can be a major cause of strife.

The Superior Man understands the difference in his and his woman’s core needs and adjusts their relationship to encourage those differences and promote mutual growth.

Though you’re equal, you’re not the same; **for your relationship to best serve you and your woman, you must support each other in the pursuit of your distinct priorities.**

The intimacy between you will give you what you want only if you’re both fulfilled in the way you most need to be. And when you are, your intimacy will carry you even beyond the hope of joy your relationship represents, into the utter ecstasy of being, existing, and living—genuinely, fully, and openly.

**What to Do:**

Your relationship with your woman will always be a primary determinant of her mood, unless she rejects her feminine core—in which case she will attempt to deprioritize it. This will hurt her core, because it will block the flow of love in your relationship. She needs deep, loving intimacy as much as you need to be engaged and involved in your masculine pursuits. Don’t deny her feminine essence by telling her to be more independent. Though it will certainly benefit her to have other things to engage with, **your relationship is what will fulfill her most; enable her to prioritize it.**

Likewise, don’t feel guilty if your woman is more “into” the relationship than you are. This is a natural consequence of the asymmetrical needs at your cores. Don’t fake a greater interest than you have, and don’t take her love for granted. Pursue your mission and your satisfaction, knowing that when you’re most fulfilled, you’ll be most present in your relationship. **Your success in pursuing your core priority is what enables you to be loving, humorous, and engaged.**

### Fulfill Your Responsibilities Yourself

A healthy relationship requires that you live up to your responsibilities. In this section, you’ll learn what you’re responsible for as a partner and how to ensure you and your woman are growing into the best versions of yourselves.

#### Take Responsibility for Your Growth and Direction

As you get lost in the daily tasks of your business and your duties, your woman will get lost in the cycles of her moods and emotions. It’s _your_ responsibility to cut through both mentalities: to stay awake to your purpose in living and to remove obstructions to your woman’s connection to the love at her core. If you don’t, she will, and her need to embody the masculine pole will depolarize your relationship.

A superior man demands authenticity, humor, and the fullest love of which he and his woman are capable—**he demands they move in whatever direction most serves the growth and happiness of his woman and himself.**

Your consistency and the depth with which you apply yourself are what determine the value of the gifts you give, as well as your capacity to guide your woman to greater happiness and love.

**What to Do:**

Take control of your life and align it around your purpose. **Your laziness, your addictions, and your lack of clarity are your own responsibility** —try whatever techniques are appropriate to eliminate them. You must be committed at all times to aligning your life around your deepest truth, even if you have to discover it first.

**Before you can give your woman the gift of direction, you must find your own.** Ensure that in every moment you’re entirely certain that you’re living exactly the life you need to. When you do, your woman will feel it, and she’ll accept and respect your guidance.

Your intent is critical. You will not succeed if you’d rather masturbate or watch TV than pursue your deepest truth.

#### Take Responsibility for Giving Your Gift

As an adult, you’re responsible for your own happiness, health, and success. You no longer need someone to take care of you. Beyond this, you have a responsibility to give your gift. Growing past your dependence on your partner is only one step to true adulthood—the larger step is to grow beyond your need for autonomy and independence. Simply put, **the stage in intimacy that comes after independence is mutual, loving service.**

When you can give your gift fully in the present moment—alive and awake in your consciousness—you can feel through your connection with your woman into the world. You can see where your gift is needed and how to give it, and you can allow your inward focus to fade away as you attend to your giving.

**What to Do:**

Remember what your masculine gifts are:

  1. **Your ability to lovingly intervene.** Your woman can get lost in her moods and find it very difficult to escape them alone. Don’t be her therapist; be her wake-up call. Open her eyes and heart, remind her of how deeply she’s loved, and lift her out of the dark, shrunken perspective her moods drag her into.
  2. **Your ability to set a goal.** You know where you are, where you want to be, and how to get there. If your woman is stressed, unhappy, and unfulfilled, examine that. Find out where she needs to go and how she can get there. Share that vision with her and help her accomplish it.



Though your woman and the world may resist receiving your gift, give it anyway. Share your love, understanding, knowledge, and vision. **Take responsibility for giving whatever your deepest realization has shown you about the meaning and nature of love to the world, and to your woman.** Feel through your love of woman and world, let go of your inward-focused selfishness and petty self-concern, and let those dissolve in the giving of your gift.

### Regularly Rejuvenate and Reawaken Your Consciousness

The Superior Man pursues growth and encourages it in others, regardless of how uncomfortable the process may be for him.

In your daily lives, ensure you arrange for rejuvenating time, for yourself and your woman. Without it, you’ll depolarize and rot in the stagnation of daily regularity.

**What to Do:**

##### Practice Austerity

Austerity is the practice of removing your comforts and embracing your suffering.**Many of your pursuits are attempts to avoid suffering** ; watching TV, playing video games, eating sweets, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes. These activities are a blanket you wrap yourself in to avoid the suffering of boredom, loneliness, and fear. Your fear of death rests at the core of these pursuits; they distract you from the knowledge that you will eventually die. **Your suffering arises from your attempt to resist that fear.**

Instead, embrace that fear; participate in the sacrifice you were born to be; dissolve in the giving of your gift. Beyond your fear is a core of endless love; **the knowledge of your unavoidable death, and the unavoidable deaths of others, is what motivates you to give, to love, and to fully live.**

Challenge yourself with a commitment. For a week or two, give up your comforts. Remove everything around you that distracts you from all forms of suffering. Don’t watch movies, play games, or read while you sit on the toilet. Don’t disappear into daydreams and fantasies; remain fully present and conscious, and be aware of your discomfort. Sit on the floor and feel your boredom instead of avoiding it. Feel through your boredom to the core of fear that rests beyond it—fear that you’re wasting limited time. **Feel through that fear to the core beyond—the boundless gift of love you yearn to share.**

##### Face Your Fear

**Challenge yourself by giving your gift in ways that are normally blocked by fear.**

If you’ve always wanted to write a novel but have been blocked by fear, challenge yourself to write a chapter every week. Tell your friends that for every week you fail to meet your goal, you’ll give them $100.

**Set up real consequences** for avoiding your fear, so that you _must_ surmount it. When your fear causes you to freeze in the middle of a mountain climb, it is the consequence of a death by falling that motivates you to push past it. Your consequences should be similarly dire—unless all you want is to cling to the comfortable safety net of your superficial pleasures.

##### Spend Time With Other Men

At least once a week, get together with other men and challenge each other. If you see that your friend is wasting his life, let him know. Accept the same level of criticism from him. **Challenge each other in ways that will force you to improve, and set consequences for failure.**

Alternate these kinds of get-togethers with celebrations. Include a challenge that keeps you all conscious and focused. Instead of indulging in shared comfort, make your celebrations a communion beyond fear. Challenge yourselves to swim together in ice-cold water, or to drink to the point of drunkenness and spend the rest of the night discussing the mysteries of existence without allowing anyone to drift away. **Share your fullest gift with these men, and demand their fullest gift in return.**

##### Encourage Your Woman to Spend Time With Other Women

**In the same way you need masculine challenge and companionship, your woman needs feminine release and solidarity.** She should spend time, every day, in open-hearted celebration with other women—dancing, singing, and laughing, fully releasing her mind from any obligation to be directed, controlled, or goal-oriented. In this way, she and her friends magnify each others’ feminine radiance. This is the balm that protects her feminine energy from depression, that rejuvenates her life energy, her sexual desire and enjoyment, and her upbeat disposition.

### Allow Yourself to Be Utterly Released

The Superior Man understands that his core is love, that life is transient, and that nothing is so important that its loss is to be feared.

**Allow yourself to be utterly released.** In every moment, love through your woman and the world. Embrace every instant of your experience as a lover, and trust the direction in which love moves you. Give your gift so open-heartedly that you don’t even realize you’ve lost your need to be self-centered.

Fear is the final excuse that holds you back. **Love through your fear, and let go of it.**
