## Part 1: Be Who You Are

The Superior Man knows there’s no better time to live authentically than right now. He doesn’t wait for his finances to be more secure, for his children to move out, or for his woman to change—**he’s willing to do what’s necessary to give his fullest gift in every moment.** Men who live significant lives don’t wait.

You have a unique gift to share, and you can’t fulfill your greatest potential if you never try. In this section, we’ll explore the masculine core, and you’ll learn how to embrace and embody your true, masculine self, so you can channel your energy into giving your greatest gift, today.

### Engage Wholeheartedly With Woman and World

Engaging halfheartedly leads to conflict and dissatisfaction—we feel incomplete when we settle for “enough” rather than pushing for the limit of what we can achieve.

**The Superior Man approaches all situations in the same way: openly, lovingly, and wholeheartedly.** This is how he achieves superior results in all that he does.

Instead of giving your woman just enough that she achieves orgasm, give her everything you’ve got, and approach the world in the same way. Always embrace your desire to discover your deepest truth, to enjoy the full extent of freedom and love, and to give your fullest gifts.

The masculine core is rooted in openness and confidence—**to be yourself wholeheartedly, you must learn to face your pain and fear without retreating.** In this section, we’ll discuss how to do that, and why it’s important.

#### Don’t Close Your Heart to Avoid Pain

Closing off is an unskilled reaction to pain—it blinds you to the subtle cues and nuances of a situation, and prevents you from acting with your fullest intelligence.

The Superior Man knows that pain is an aspect of living, and doesn’t allow it to impede his growth. **He stays open to ensure he can respond with wisdom, humor, and love** , instead of fear and defensiveness.

**What to Do:**

When you find it difficult to maintain eye contact, when your breathing changes and you hold tension in your chest and solar plexus, **stand straight and breathe deep into your belly.** Open the front of your body, make unguarded eye contact, and feel your pain and the other person with your whole body.

#### Accept and Face Your Fears

A man who is unaware of his fear, or hides it, is untrustworthy. Others can see his fear and his unwillingness to acknowledge it, and they know a man who lies to himself is likely to lie to them too.

The Superior Man is trustworthy and inspirational because he knows what he fears and _leans into it_ , sharing his gift anyway. **His freedom comes from acknowledging, sharing, and facing his fear** —being with what is, and remaining open.

All men are afraid. Some try to escape fear, never realizing their full capacity. Some dive into their fear, becoming too tense and off-balance to appreciate the moment. Your goal at all times should be to remain fully open and aware—**live kissing your fears, not pulling away or aggressively pushing into them.**

Your capacity to grow is limited by your ability to face “death,” in the form of fear. The masculine strength lies in the ability to face that death with humility and courage; **to embody your fullest consciousness and share your greatest love, you must face many “deaths.”**

**What to Do:**

Speak your fear and describe your limit aloud; be honest and acknowledge the fears that lead you to the choices you make. Would you be living the way you do if you were fearless? Are you giving your fullest gift, or are you afraid of how your life would change if you did?

Open yourself to the feelings of fear and uncertainty, and _proceed regardless_. Your woman wants to see you face your fear—of her anger and tension, of losing your safety and security, and of your own death. She wants your fullest, most powerful self. This is the masculine core to which she is most attracted.

#### Release Your Inhibitions

As you learn to face your external fears, don’t neglect your internal fears. Shame holds you back; discard it.

##### Let Go of Your Father’s Expectations

Clinging to your father’s expectations limits you, burdening you with feelings of fear and unworthiness. **To be a free man, you must love your father while allowing yourself to be free of his criticisms and expectations.**

The Superior Man prioritizes his _own_ purpose; he does not allow the expectations of others to sway him from his path.

**What to Do:**

Live the way you would if your father had died. Once a day for three days, pursue an activity your father’s influence led you to suppress or avoid. Don’t judge yourself based on his expectations.

##### Embrace Your Sexual Desires

When you push away your darker desires, they become an undercurrent of your psyche, and you lose the ability to fulfill them in conscious, loving ways.

The Superior Man understands that sexual desire is the root of his bodily energy. He owns his desires, no matter how dark they are, and takes responsibility for fulfilling them lovingly.

**Your natural desire is to ravish** —to break through the resistance of your woman and open her body and heart to ecstatic loving. You derive pleasure from releasing her from everything that blocks her ability to surrender fully to your love; from “taking” and filling her, body and soul.

When you suppress your desire to ravish, you settle for pornographic fantasies of rape and violence. Reclaim this desire properly, and you reclaim your ability to ravish with love.

**What to Do:**

The next time you make love, focus on what your woman is feeling, how she’s breathing and moving. **Give up your ego and fully embrace your love for her** ; release your inhibitions and, from the heart of love, allow yourself to be whatever you want with her. Give her space, occasionally, to let her own desires take you places you’d never have gone otherwise. Yield to the worship of her heart, trust your combined one-ness, and let go of your “self.”

### Ask Your Friends to Challenge Your Mediocrity

The best friends you can have are those who challenge and confront you when you need it. To confront and escape your mediocrity **you must be willing to openly accept guidance and loving challenge** , and to adjust yourself accordingly.

The Superior Man welcomes challenge and criticism; he takes advantage of the opportunities for introspection and growth that they present. His friends are a pillar of support to him, as he is to them.

**What to Do:**

Ask your friends to help you live at the edge of your fear. Be open with them about your situation, your goals, and your worries. Have them suggest things you can do that will grant you more freedom or reveal something you’re missing. **Allow their guidance and criticism to lead you to introspection and growth** , not defensiveness and hurt.
