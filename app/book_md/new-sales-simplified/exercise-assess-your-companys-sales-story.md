## Exercise: Assess Your Company’s Sales Story

Your sales story is the response you give when someone asks you to tell them about your business. It should focus on the problems you solve for customers and the ways your solution is different from and better than anyone else’s.

* * *

What’s your current sales story? Are you satisfied with it? Why or why not?

How much does your sales story focus on the problems it solves for customers as opposed to the company’s history, people, and processes? How can you increase the customer focus?

How does your company’s sales story differentiate it from competitors (that is, show how your solution is different from and better than anyone else’s)? How could you improve this aspect?
