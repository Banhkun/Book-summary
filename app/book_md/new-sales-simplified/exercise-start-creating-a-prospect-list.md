## Exercise: Start Creating a Prospect List

To create a list of viable new-business prospects, identify companies that are similar to your best customers. To come up with a target profile, consider the following questions.

* * *

Who are your companyâ€™s top five customers and what characteristics do they have in common?

What do these companies and their markets look like (for example, are they growing or highly competitive)?

What resources can you use to identify potential customers who resemble your top customers (for example, industry directories or trade associations)?
