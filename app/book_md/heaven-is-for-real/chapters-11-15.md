## Chapters 11-15: Colton First Describes Heaven

Almost as soon as the Burpos returned home from the hospital, Todd and Sonja noticed that their son seemed to have a new-found preoccupation with Jesus. Three notable incidents attracted their attention:

**Incident #1:** Around a week after Colton’s discharge, the bills for his hospital stay began to arrive. The Burpos were in financial trouble even _before_ Colton got sick, so there was no way they’d cover all the bills due that month.

As Todd and Sonja discussed which bills to pay and which to defer, Todd stated that they should prioritize paying their tithes: Doing so was a way to thank God for saving their son. They could pay the hospital bills later. However, Colton apparently disagreed.**He piped up that the family _needed_ to pay the hospital doctor since Jesus “used” him to make Colton better. **

**Incident #2:** Shortly after the tithes incident, Colton got into trouble at a playdate because he refused to share toys with his friend. When Todd sat Colton down to discuss what had happened, he found that Colton already knew that what he’d done was wrong. **Colton stated that Jesus himself had instructed him to be kind to people.**

**Incident #3:** A couple of weeks later, Todd was preparing to minister at a funeral. When Colton heard about this, he questioned Todd about whether the dead man “had Jesus in his heart.” **When Colton learned that the man might _not_ have been Christian, he became distraught, claiming that this meant the man wouldn’t be able to go to heaven.** On the day of the funeral, Colton had to be removed from the church because he wouldn’t stop shouting about whether or not the dead man had “known Jesus.”

These three incidents confused Todd. **Why was Colton acting as if he’d spoken to Jesus personally?** Why was Colton suddenly so obsessed with whether people went to heaven or not?**** However, Todd didn’t give too much thought to these issues—he figured that Colton must have just heard about Jesus, his teachings, and heaven at Sunday school.

### Colton Describes Meeting Angels and Jesus

(Shortform note: The information in this section was originally part of the book’s prologue. We’ve moved it here to keep the sequence of events chronological.)

In early July 2003, the Burpos took a trip to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to visit Sonja’s brother and newborn nephew. It was the first trip the family had taken since the one that ended in Colton’s hospitalization, and they hoped that this one would be somewhat less eventful.

During the journey, the Burpos drove past the turn to Great Plains Regional Medical Center. Sonja decided to ask Colton—now aged 4—if he remembered the hospital. **Colton replied that he did: It was the place where the angels had sung to him.**

Todd and Sonja were stunned by this revelation. Colton had never mentioned angels singing to him before. They decided to press the issue further, so Todd pulled into the parking lot of a nearby Arby’s restaurant and turned off the car’s engine.

After a few minutes of gentle questioning, Colton revealed that:

  * The angels had sung two songs: “Jesus Loves Me,” and “Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho.” (Colton had asked them to sing “We Will Rock You” by Queen, but they refused.)
  * The angels had sung to calm him down, as he was feeling scared.
  * The angels had been asked to sing by Jesus, whose lap Colton had been sitting in at the time.



Astonished by the idea that Colton had met Jesus, Todd pressed Colton further and asked where he’d been when he’d met the son of God. Colton replied that it had been during his first operation at Great Plains. He’d been with Jesus and the angels while Sonja had been on the phone in the waiting room, and while Todd had been praying alone in a room.

In the wake of this revelation, Todd had more questions than answers. How had Colton known what his parents were doing during the operation? Todd and Sonja hadn’t told him—had someone else? **Most importantly, was the experience Colton described a dream, or had Jesus and the angels really visited him?**

### Todd Questions Colton Further

Once the Burpos had returned home from their trip, Todd decided to ask Colton more about his experience with Jesus and the angels. He started with an open question: **What else happened when Colton was with Jesus?**

First, Colton revealed that he’d met not only Jesus, but also Jesus’s cousin. Jesus told Colton that his cousin had baptized him. (Colton said that he didn’t know the cousin’s name, but Todd identified him as John the Baptist.) Then, Colton blurted out that Jesus owned a rainbow-colored horse. Finally, he stated that there had been lots of colors in the place he’d been. Todd asked _where_ exactly that place was. **Colton responded that it was heaven.**

This information floored Todd. Until then, he’d assumed that if Colton’s experience _was_ real, it had been an example of divine visitation: Jesus and the angels appearing to someone on Earth. However, it now seemed that Colton had _traveled to heaven_.

#### Jesus’s Appearance

Next, Todd decided to question Colton on Jesus's appearance. Colton responded that:

  * Jesus had brown hair, a beard, and “pretty eyes.”
  * Jesus had been wearing white, with a purple line across his clothing (which Todd presumed to be a sash).
  * Jesus had been wearing a golden crown with a pink jewel in the center.
  * Jesus had what Colton called red “markers” on the palms of his hands and the bottoms of his feet. Todd interpreted these markers to be the wounds from Christ’s crucifixion.



Todd realized that the description of Jesus that his son had given matched those in the Bible books of Daniel and Revelation. Likewise, Jesus’s apparent wounds reflected those presented in images of the crucifixion. However, Colton hadn’t been introduced to those Bible passages yet, nor had he been shown a picture of the crucifixion. How did he know all of these details? **Todd began to seriously contemplate the idea that his son was describing a real experience.**

#### More Details About Heaven

Later that week, Todd decided to question Colton again—this time, with Sonja there, too. He began by asking Colton what he’d done in heaven. Colton responded that he’d done “homework,” and that Jesus had acted as his teacher. **Moreover, there had been many other children in his heavenly “class.”** (Note: At the time, Colton was able to name many of the children he met in heaven. However, by the time Todd started to write about Colton’s experience, they’d both forgotten the children’s names.)

Next, Todd asked what the people in heaven had looked like. Colton stated that almost everyone had wings that they used to fly around, although he admitted, with some annoyance, that _his_ wings had been very small. **The only exception to this rule was Jesus, who didn’t have wings but could still fly.** Specifically, he could move up and down in the air like an elevator. In Todd’s eyes, this matched the biblical description of Jesus flying up to heaven during the Ascension.

Colton also stated that **everyone in heaven had lights shining above their heads.** Todd inferred that Colton was describing halos, which, he conceded, aren’t mentioned in the Bible. However, the Bible _does_ mention dazzling light surrounding angels, so Todd believed Colton’s description wasn’t completely implausible.

Finally, Todd wanted to know how much time Colton had spent in Heaven. **Colton responded that he’d been there for a mere three minutes.** Todd was baffled: Could so much really have happened to Colton in three minutes? However, he then remembered that Colton couldn’t tell the time yet, so what he thought of as “three minutes” may have been much longer. Likewise, the Bible implies that time doesn’t necessarily work the same way in Heaven as it does on Earth: Three “Earth” minutes may have felt like hours in Heaven.

##### Todd’s Doubt: Did Colton “Die”?

During this conversation with Colton, Todd contemplated a doubt he’d been having about his son’s claims. Todd believed that only people who’ve died could go to heaven.**But according to Colton’s medical records, he hadn’t clinically “died” during either of his surgeries—** so how could he have made it to heaven?**** Was this proof that Colton’s experience _was_ a dream, rather than a real event?

Todd questioned Colton about this issue, and Colton was adamant that he _had_ died—just for a short while. However, Todd felt that Colton said that because he thought it was what _should_ have happened, not necessarily because it was _the truth_. Colton had learned that only dead people made it to heaven, so he _assumed_ that he had died, even though he hadn’t. Todd’s doubts remained.

**Then, Todd remembered various sections of the Bible in which people went to heaven when alive.** Most notably, in the book of Revelation, the apostle John described visiting heaven during a period of exile. Perhaps Colton _could_ have visited heaven while alive after all.
