## Chapters 16-26: Colton Reveals More About His Heavenly Experience

In the months and years following Colton’s initial revelations about his trip to heaven, the young boy slowly revealed more information about his experience. Notably, he described:

  * **Encounters with his dead relatives**
  * **How Jesus called Todd to be a pastor**
  * **God’s and Jesus’s thrones**
  * **The Battle of Armageddon**



### Colton Describes Meeting “Pop”

In August 2003, Colton and Todd were on a road trip to a nearby town when Colton suddenly asked whether Todd had a grandfather named “Pop.” Todd replied that he did—Pop had been his maternal grandfather. He’d passed away in a car accident when Todd was a small child.

Colton responded by saying that Pop was very nice. This struck Todd as unusual: How did Colton know that Pop was nice? Why was he speaking as if he knew him, when Pop had died decades before Colton’s birth? **Todd quickly concluded that Colton must have met Pop while in heaven and asked his son whether this was the case.** Colton responded that it was, and that while speaking to Pop, he’d learned that Todd and Pop had been close—which was true.

Todd was blown away by this latest revelation, which seemed to confirm that we’re reunited with our late relatives in the afterlife. He wanted to assess whether Colton’s claim was true or not, so he asked Colton what Pop had looked like. Colton was evasive, only stating that Pop had large wings and was wearing white with a blue “stripe” across his body (which, again, Todd presumed to be a sash).

#### What _Did_ Pop Look Like?

Some months after Colton first mentioned seeing Pop, Todd once again contemplated what Pop had looked like in heaven. Had Pop been old—as Todd remembered him—or his younger self? Todd decided to approach Colton to find out the answer to this question. **Colton responded that Pop had been his younger self because nobody was old in heaven.**

Interestingly, when shown a picture of Pop as an older man, Colton didn’t recognize him. However, when shown a photo of Pop as a younger man, he recognized him immediately. Todd saw this as proof that Colton must have met the “younger” Pop.

### Colton Describes Todd Becoming a Pastor

The day after Colton revealed that he met Pop, Todd’s mother visited the family. After hearing about Colton’s most recent revelations, she asked her grandson whether Jesus had mentioned how Todd became a pastor. Colton responded that Jesus had:**He’d described reaching out to Todd and telling him that it was his purpose to become a pastor.** When Todd had agreed, Jesus had been thrilled.

Todd was astounded: The event that Colton was describing _had_ happened, and Todd remembered it in detail—although he’d never told Colton about it. When he was 13 years old, he’d attended a youth camp and listened to a pastor speak about how God calls people to do his work. The pastor had mentioned that God could call kids, too—and at that moment, Todd had felt someone or something telling him that he should be a pastor. **He’d known in his heart that this was God or Jesus calling him, and Colton had just confirmed that.**

### Colton Describes Meeting His Late Sister

One evening in October 2003, Colton stated out of the blue that he had two sisters: Cassie, and another. At first, Colton’s parents thought he might be confused: Perhaps he’d started to see his cousin, Traci, as a sister-like figure? However, Colton dismissed this notion. **He insisted that he had a second sister—one who’d died in the womb.**

The Burpos were shocked because Colton was right: Sonja _had_ suffered a miscarriage before Colton’s birth. However, they’d never mentioned this to Colton. When they asked him who’d told him about it, he replied that his late sister herself had: **He’d met her in heaven.**

When pressed for details, Colton revealed that a young girl had run up to him while he was in heaven and started hugging him. She’d said she was his sister and that God himself had adopted her. Todd and Sonja asked what the little girl’s name was. Colton replied that she didn’t have one, since she’d died before her parents had named her. This was true: **The Burpos hadn’t even found out the baby’s sex before she’d passed away, let alone had the chance to name her.**

Until this point, both Todd and Sonja had struggled with the grief of losing their unborn child. However, now, they felt reassured. Thanks to Colton, they knew that one day, they’d reunite with their daughter in heaven.

#### Colton Tells His Babysitter About His Second Sister

Around two years after Colton first spoke of his late sister, he brought her up again—this time, to his babysitter, Ali. Ali told Todd and Sonja that Colton had spent a lot of their evening together crying and saying that he missed his dead sister. **In the process, he’d told Ali all about his trip to heaven.**

Subsequently, Ali revealed to Todd and Sonja that not only did she believe Colton’s story, but hearing him speak of heaven and his late sister had strengthened her Christian faith. Whenever she had doubts about God, she remembered how sincere Colton was when he talked about his experiences, and knew that the Christian path was the true one.

### Colton Describes God’s and Jesus’s Thrones

One night in December 2003, Todd was preparing to read Colton a bedtime Bible story: specifically, a story about King Solomon. While reading the book, Todd noticed an illustration of King Solomon sitting on his throne. This got him thinking about God’s throne, as described in the book of Revelation. He wondered if Colton had seen the throne while in heaven; so, he asked him about it.

At first, Colton was confused: He didn’t know what a throne was. However, once Todd had explained the concept, **Colton confirmed that he’d seen God’s throne multiple times, and said that it was huge.** He also noted that Jesus had a throne next to God’s. The Bible describes Jesus’s throne as being on God’s right side. Todd wanted to know if this was true, but Colton didn’t know left from right yet. So, Todd asked Colton to imagine that his father was God’s throne and to point to the side that Jesus’s throne was on. Colton pointed to Todd’s right side.****

Colton then stated that the angel Gabriel sat on God’s other side and that he himself had sat on a smaller chair, next to God the Holy Spirit. He said that he’d sat and prayed with the Holy Spirit because he knew that his family needed the Holy Spirit’s support during that stressful time.

##### Todd’s Final Test for Colton

**By this point, Todd almost entirely believed that Colton had gone to heaven, since most of the things he'd described matched the Bible's teachings.** However, he wanted to give Colton one last test to check he was telling the truth. So, Todd asked Colton what he did when it got dark in heaven, knowing full well that, according to the Bible, heaven is actually bathed in perpetual light.

Colton passed the test. He told his father that it never gets dark in heaven because God and Jesus create its light. To Todd’s knowledge, nobody had told Colton that: He must have learned it from first-hand experience. Todd let go of his last doubts and decided to believe Colton.

### Colton Refuses to Talk About Satan

One evening in early 2006, the Burpo family watched the recent movie adaptation of _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ together. The film included a long medieval-style battle sequence, featuring warriors wielding swords. Colton loved this type of fantasy action, particularly when good triumphed over evil.

After the film had finished, Sonja joked to Colton that heaven was lacking in one respect: Unlike Narnia’s inhabitants, the people there didn’t have swords. To the family’s surprise, Colton indignantly replied that there _were_ swords in heaven. Sonja asked why the residents of heaven needed swords, and **Colton replied that it was to keep Satan away since he wasn’t yet stuck in hell.** In Todd’s eyes, the idea of Satan not being in hell matched sections of the Bible that described a battle against “dark forces” taking place on Earth.

Until this point, Colton hadn’t mentioned Satan when discussing his heavenly experience, so Todd decided to gather more information. He asked if Colton had seen Satan while in heaven, and Colton replied that he had. However, when Todd pressed Colton further—asking what Satan looked like—Colton became very upset and wouldn’t answer. Furthermore, he wouldn’t speak about his heavenly experiences at all for the rest of the day.**When Todd and Sonja asked Colton about Satan on subsequent occasions, he always had the same reaction.**

### Colton Describes the Battle of Armageddon

A few months after Colton’s revelation about swords in heaven, Todd and Colton were on another road trip, traveling home from a nearby city. **Suddenly, Colton asked Todd if he was aware that a war was coming.**

Todd was confused and asked Colton for more details about this war. Colton explained that in the future, there would be a war pitting Jesus and his supporters against Satan and his monsters. This war would bring about the end of the world.

While in heaven, Colton had seen a glimpse of this future war. The men in heaven had joined the battle—including Todd—and had fought monsters such as dragons using swords and bows. Meanwhile, the women and children had watched from the sidelines. Ultimately, Jesus and the forces of good had prevailed.

After hearing this description, Todd realized that Colton was referring to the battle of Armageddon, as discussed in the book of Revelation. He was struck not only by the fact that Colton had _seen_ the battle take place, but also by the knowledge that he—Todd—would have to participate. The idea of fighting made Todd somewhat nervous. **However, he ultimately decided that if Jesus needed him to fight, he would.**

### Colton Shares Miscellaneous Details About Jesus and Heaven

From 2003 to 2004, Colton shared various other miscellaneous details about heaven, Jesus, and the afterlife:

  * **From late 2003 to early 2004, Colton occasionally gave more information about what heaven looked like** , notably stating that the gates to heaven were gold and had pearls decorating them. Heaven itself was made from a “shiny material,” possibly gold or silver, and was full of beautiful foliage. 
  * **On Good Friday in 2004, Colton revealed that Jesus told him that he died on the cross so that people could go to heaven and meet God.**
  * In late April 2004, Colton got in trouble for running out into the parking lot at a fast-food restaurant. Todd warned Colton that if he wasn’t careful, he’d get hit by a car and killed. **Colton responded that this would be a good thing since he’d get to go back to heaven.**
  * In August 2004, Todd had to visit a dying man who’d been a minister for most of his life. He took Colton with him and explained to his son that the man was preparing to go to heaven. **When they reached the dying man’s house, Colton told the man that the first person he’d see upon arrival in heaven was Jesus.**
  * One night in fall 2004, Sonja encouraged Colton to pray for Todd to get lots of study time in preparation for his sermon that Sunday. **In response, Colton stated that in the past, he’d seen Jesus “shoot power down” to Todd when he spoke in church.** When Todd asked Colton what this “power” was, Colton replied that it was the Holy Spirit.
