## 1-Page Summary

Never underestimate the power of a good story. According to Kindra Hall, telling the right story is the answer to many of the challenges organizations face. **Stories are the tool you need to build the connections that will enable your business to fulfill its purpose.**

Hall is a professional speaker, author, and storytelling strategist. She’s delivered numerous keynotes and workshops for companies and organizations, including Coca-Cola, Hilton, and the United States Army. She's also been featured in _Entrepreneur_ , _Forbes_ , and _SUCCESS_ magazine. Hall is a board member of the National Storytelling Network and a contributing editor to _SUCCESS_. _Stories That Stick_ was published in 2019.

In this guide, we’ll discuss why stories are so powerful, explain what makes a good story, and introduce four core story models that you can start using right away. The guide also includes prompts to help you start building your own stockpile of compelling stories. Along the way, we’ll illustrate Hall’s advice with real-world examples of companies using storytelling effectively in their marketing campaigns and compare Hall’s advice with that of other marketing strategists like Daniel Pink (_To Sell Is Human_) and Seth Godin (_All Marketers Are Liars _and _This Is Marketing_).

### The Role of Stories in Business

In the simplest terms, the purpose of any business is to provide people with something of value. But this isn’t as easy as it sounds, and businesses are always running into challenges in fulfilling that purpose. Hall argues that these challenges are actually disconnections, or gaps, where businesses fail to effectively engage their intended audience, whether that be customers, employees, or investors. For example, anytime a startup is struggling to find investors or a product isn’t selling, there's a disconnection between the company and the intended audience. Hall argues that **stories are the tool you need to build the connections that enable your business to fulfill its purpose**.

(Shortform note: The idea of storytelling as a marketing tool isn't new. Storytelling has been a part of marketing for centuries, but it was not until the late 20th century that it began to gain prominence as a marketing strategy. Seth Godin, author of _All Marketers Are Liars_ , is often credited with popularizing story-based marketing. In the 2005 book, Godin argues that the most successful marketers are those who tell the most compelling stories that resonate with their target audience. This idea has since become widely accepted in the marketing industry, with many businesses and marketers using storytelling techniques to create more engaging and effective marketing messages.)

Storytelling allows you to build connections in three ways:

**1\. Storytelling invites engagement** **because it’s a collaborative process.** As you tell a story, the listener mentally fills in the gaps. They add images, feelings, and context to the details you provide. Instead of being lectured to, the listener is a participant in the storytelling.

(Shortform note: Scientists believe that mirror neurons are responsible for the collaborative nature of storytelling. Mirror neurons are brain cells that allow us to relate to other people's experiences by mirroring their actions, emotions, and sensations in our own brains. These neurons are activated when we listen to a story, allowing us to imagine the story as if we were experiencing it ourselves and to understand and empathize with the intentions and emotions of the storyteller.)

**2\. Storytelling can inspire people to take action because stories are persuasive.** Stories can shift perspectives and attitudes without people even realizing it, causing people to take action they wouldn’t have considered before hearing the story.

(Shortform note: Research has shown that people are often more persuaded by stories than by facts, largely because stories require less processing fluency, meaning it’s easier for us to process new information when it comes in the form of a narrative.)

**3.** **Storytelling has the power to produce lasting change.** Virtuous stories, or noble stories, that are about something bigger than the story itself, are the stories that transform people.

(Shortform note: In his book _Redirect_ , social psychologist Timothy D. Wilson suggests that "story editing," or changing the stories we tell about ourselves, is fundamental to long-lasting behavior change. Wilson argues that we all construct stories about ourselves that determine our thinking and behavior. Reframing these stories or creating new stories has the power to alter mindsets and affect our behavior and decision-making.)

#### Why Storytelling Works

There's a reason people respond strongly to stories—**stories change our brain chemistry.** To make this point, Hall cites the work of Paul Zak, a neuroscience researcher and neuroeconomist who has focused on the neurochemical effects of storytelling on the brain, particularly the role of the hormone oxytocin in enhancing social bonding and trust. Through various experiments, Zak found that a well-crafted narrative stimulates the production of oxytocin in the brain, leading to increased empathy and a stronger emotional connection between the storyteller and listener. He explains that stories make the audience feel more connected and invested in the storyteller, which is why Hall argues storytelling is such an effective marketing tool.

(Shortform note: Not everyone agrees with the research Hall cites on oxytocin. Science writer Ed Yong (_I Contain Multitudes_) once characterized the hype around oxytocin as “dumb and dangerous,” explaining that this hormone has been erroneously linked to trust, cooperation, love, empathy, morality, and more. Yong argues that the evidence isn’t always there, and how oxytocin actually affects the brain is probably a lot messier than the headlines indicate. When thinking about neuroscience, it’s also useful to keep in mind that most studies are very small. This means that many findings are statistically inconclusive. Conclusions that seem correct in a small sample size could be disproven in a study with a larger sample.)

### How to Tell a Good Story

For a story to make an impact, it has to be a good one. Thankfully, according to Hall, there's a simple recipe for crafting a compelling story. Good stories, she explains, must include four key components and follow a logical sequence.

#### The Four Components of a Good Story

According to Hall, all good stories have four key components:

**First, good stories have a character that you’re rooting for** —someone your audience can care about. The thing you're selling, whether it’s financial consulting or the latest electric toothbrush, doesn't count as a character because people can’t relate to a toothbrush. Make sure your story centers on a character that people empathize with.

**Second, good stories rely on concrete details to paint a picture for the listener.** This helps transport the listener to the world of the story, especially if those details are relatable and help the listener recall moments or details from their own life. For example, if you're speaking to an audience born in the ’80s or ’90s, you might make a small reference to shared cultural experiences like Blockbuster or mix tapes.

**Third, good stories are rooted in genuine emotion.** While your story doesn’t have to be overdramatic, it does have to hold emotional weight. Otherwise, it doesn’t matter how the story ends. Make sure the audience has an emotional stake in the outcome.

**Finally, good stories need a moment where something changes** —a turning point. Stories without this pivotal moment are boring because they drift aimlessly without a clear purpose.

> **The Definition(s) of a Good Story**
> 
> There's no single definition of a good story, as evidenced by the varied definitions put forth by marketing experts.
> 
> In _Unleash the Power of Storytelling_ , Rob Biesenbach defines a good story simply as an account of a character who pursues a goal and encounters obstacles along the way. While, like Hall, he highlights the importance of a central character that experiences change, he doesn’t focus as much on the need for concrete details or genuine emotion.
> 
> Daniel Pink, on the other hand, focuses primarily on the emotional impact of a story. In _A Whole New Mind_ , he explains that a good story must elicit empathy in the reader and speak to a genuine experience. This definition is a variation of the ideas presented by Joe Lazauskas and Shane Snow, authors of _The Storytelling Edge_ , who argue that a good story is authentic and emotionally engaging.
> 
> Finally, in _All Marketers Are Liars_ , Godin avoids defining a good story altogether, instead emphasizing that a good story depends on your audience as it must appeal directly to their worldview.

#### The Story Sequence

Now that you have the four elements of a strong story, you need a way to tie them all together. We're taught from an early age that good stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But Hall recommends reimagining this three-part structure as**a before (what she calls “the normal”), the change (“the explosion”), and the after (“the new normal”)**. This structure focuses on introducing tension or conflict that's then resolved, thereby creating an engaging and more memorable story.

(Shortform note: While Hall argues that good stories need a before, a change, and an after, there are effective marketing campaigns that don’t follow this structure. For example, in Nike’s ad, “The Jogger,” a boy jogs slowly along a country road. The ad ends with the slogan, “Find Your Greatness.” This story doesn't have any explicit change or evolution, and the beginning and the end of the story are left up to the audience’s imagination. However, despite the lack of dynamic structure, this ad has been called one of Nike’s most inspirational ads of all time.)

While often overlooked, the beginning of the story is critically important. In order to be emotionally invested in your story, your audience needs to know what the world looked like before everything changed. Your audience will be even more invested if that world, or the characters, is familiar to them. As you begin your story, introduce the characters and add the details that will help your audience connect to the world you’re describing. For example, if you’re speaking to a group of millennials, you could incorporate a reference to ’90s pop music or college debt—any detail that allows the listener to see themselves in your story.

(Shortform note: In _The Storytelling Edge_ , the authors explain that making your story relatable will make it more effective because people prefer stories about people who look and think like them. But the authors say that in addition to relatability, stories need novelty. For example, an audience may easily relate to the teenage life of Marty McFly in the movie _Back to the Future_ , but they wouldn’t watch an entire movie of Marty driving around in his car. The story needs the novelty of Doc’s time machine to make it engaging.)

The next part of the story is the moment when everything changes. It doesn’t matter whether the change in your story is good or bad; your story needs a moment where something happens that marks a difference between what happened before and what happens after. Otherwise, the story will be stagnant.

(Shortform note: In order to be effective, this change must be associated with some kind of conflict. Someone getting a haircut that no one notices would qualify as a change, but it wouldn’t create the kind of tension necessary to move the story forward. Conflict can be either internal or external. Internal conflict refers to the psychological struggle that takes place within a character's mind as they grapple with conflicting emotions, beliefs, desires, or values, while external conflict is a struggle that takes place between a character and an outside force or obstacle.)

In the final part of the story, you describe what happens after the change—how does the central character or the world look different after the change, or how could it look different? For example, after someone buys your product, how is their life better?

> **An Alternative Story Model**
> 
> In _Building a Storybrand_ , Donald Miller introduces the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework. This is an alternative storytelling model that you can use to construct a compelling narrative for your intended audience. Miller’s model loosely follows Hall’s suggestions but includes steps at the end of the story that explicitly outline the actions the storyteller wants the audience to take. (While Miller uses the term customer, we'll use the term audience, because the framework can also apply to stories told to investors, potential donors, and prospective or current employees.)
> 
>   * **Start the story by telling your audience (and protagonist) what they want** and the gap that exists between them and fulfilling that want.
> 
>   * **Identify a problem** standing in the way of your audience achieving their want that your product, service, or company will help them overcome.
> 
>   * **Position your brand as your audience’s guide** in the story, the figure that will help them overcome obstacles and attain their desire.
> 
>   * **Present your audience with a step-by-step plan** to overcome their problem, specifically a plan that involves investing in, purchasing, or implementing your product or service.
> 
>   * **Create a call to action**. Ask the audience to take the first step in initiating the plan you presented.
> 
>   * **Explain the consequences of not taking action**. Miller argues that without understanding the negative consequences of inaction, your audience won't be compelled to take the necessary first step.
> 
>   * **Show the positive outcome (or happy ending)** that will result from investing in or buying your product or service. Miller advises keeping this outcome as simple and specific as possible.
>

### The Four Core Stories

Even following Hall’s recipe for a good story, it can be intimidating to know how to choose the right story for the right occasion. Hall outlines four core stories that you can swap in depending on your audience and your intended goal: the Value Story, the Customer Story, the Founder Story, and the Purpose Story.

(Shortform note: Hall’s list of four core stories isn't exhaustive. _The Leader’s Guide to Storytelling_ author Stephen Denning offers examples of stories that can be used to share knowledge or quell rumors, none of which fit neatly into any one of Hall’s four story models. For example, Denning outlines the framework for a story that focuses on a problem rather than a central protagonist. He also describes the power of a future-oriented story that describes what's possible rather than something that has already happened.)

#### The Value Story

The Value Story is a useful tool when you want to increase sales or market to a new audience. According to Hall, **the purpose of the Value Story is to communicate to your audience that you have the answer to their problem**. It should articulate how your product or service will change your audience’s life for the better.

(Shortform note: In _This Is Marketing_ , Godin explains that people aren't looking for a product, but for a feeling that your product or service gives them. So as you're crafting your value story, think of the problem as what your customer wants to be feeling, but isn’t, and the solution as the feeling your product provides them. For example, if someone wants to feel more adventurous, the answer might be a rugged all-wheel-drive car. That’s the story you have to tell.)

As with all good stories, when you tell a Value Story, follow Hall’s recommended structure—describe the before, the change, and the after. The before should address the problem that your audience is struggling with. The moment of change is when your product or service comes into the picture. Then wrap up your story by describing what happens next—how is life different or better now that your audience has your product or service in hand?

(Shortform note: Not all Value Stories follow Hall’s recommended structure. There are many creative ways to communicate values without telling a traditional story. By using visual elements, slogans, music, or celebrity endorsements, companies can create a memorable and impactful message that resonates with their target audience. For example, in Google’s 2022 “Year in Search” commercial, the company used a compilation of videos to communicate the idea that Google is about imagining what's possible. The video creates emotional resonance even without following Hall’s recommended story framework.)

The 2019 Subaru Forester commercial, “A Parent’s Imagination,” is an example of a well-told Value Story. The ad begins by showing parents imagining the worst-case scenario of their teenager driving off the road or getting into a car accident because they are texting a friend or eating French fries. The problem: Parents are worried about their kids’ driving. But then, something changes—a distracted teenager is reminded by the Forester’s safety mechanism to “keep your eyes on the road,” allowing them to slam on the brakes just in time. The commercial ends with the child returning safely home and a mother breathing a sigh of relief. The message of the story is clear—you're worried about your kids’ driving, but with this car, you don’t have to be.

This commercial also includes the four components of a good story—characters the audience can relate to (parents), specific details (parents looking out the window for their kids while washing dishes), strong feelings (anxiety and fear), and a turning point (the moment the car’s safety mechanism engages).

#### The Customer Story

The Customer Story serves much the same purpose as the Value Story. The only difference is that the story is told by the customers, not the company.

Customers' stories are inherently more reliable than the polished stories produced by companies because they are real and unfiltered. Hall explains that the imperfections are what make the stories credible. The Customer Story can range from reviews posted on your website to interviews with real customers.

(Shortform note: The credibility of the Customer Story has become complicated by the rise of influencer marketing, a type of social media marketing that pays people with a big social media following to promote or endorse a product. Influencers aren't always upfront or transparent about their paid content. For example, in 2021 Kim Kardashian created an Instagram post that implied her support for EthereumMax (EMAX), a new cryptocurrency. It was later revealed that Kardashian was paid $250,000 for her post. While these sorts of ads are a kind of Customer Story, they aren't the unfiltered narratives that Hall describes.)

Warby Parker is a brand that strategically relies on customer stories in its marketing. To promote their home and virtual try-on options for glasses, Warby Parker compiled testimonials from real Warby Parker customers. In the videos, customers try on glasses while talking about the experience. The testimonials feel genuine because they are natural and unrehearsed. The cumulation of these testimonials tells the story that Warby Parker wants to tell—we make buying glasses easier.

Hall cautions that customer stories can be challenging because they’re harder to find and you have less control of the narrative. However, while you can’t control what customers say, you _can_ strategically guide them to shape their testimonials into stories. For example, in the case of Warby Parker, the company might ask customers to talk about their previous experience buying glasses (the before) and then explain how Warby Parker is different (the change and the after).

(Shortform note: To find great customer stories, the US Small Business Association (SBA) recommends starting with your most loyal and long-term customers. Ask them if they’re willing to provide a testimonial. Like Hall, the SBA recommends offering guidance in the form of specific questions and even taking the time to chat on the phone for five- to 10 minutes to help the customer polish their story. Never be afraid to ask your customer to be more specific. The more specific the story, the more effective it will be.)

#### The Founder Story

The Founder Story is useful when you're courting investors, attracting new customers, or recruiting team members to your organization. According to Hall, **the purpose of the Founder Story is to show what makes you stand out from the competition**. This is the story of how your company began and the person behind it all. In this case, you’re not selling a product, you’re selling the person behind the company.

(Shortform note: According to Jeffrey Gitomer, author of the _Little Red Book of Selling_ , the founder isn't the only one in the company whose story matters. In his advice to salespeople, he argues that your customers “buy” you before they buy what you’re selling. For example, they buy your knowledge, your expertise, your humor, or your character. Therefore, he recommends that anyone in sales, not just the founder, develop a story that communicates their personal brand.)

The Founder Story is more prescriptive than the other core stories. Your character must be the founder and the story should convey the passion and perseverance of that person. You want your audience to walk away impressed by how hard the founder worked to get where they are.

(Shortform note: The Founder Story, as described by Hall, closely aligns with the narrative archetype of the hero’s journey. Both narratives follow a similar structure or sequence of events in which the protagonist faces a challenge or obstacle that sets them on a journey of discovery and transformation. Along the way, they encounter allies and enemies, overcome obstacles, and face setbacks and challenges. Eventually, they reach a point of crisis or climax where they must confront their fears and overcome the final obstacle to achieve their goal.)

Procter & Gamble (P&G) is an example of a company that uses its Founder Story to inspire new employees to become more invested in the company and immersed in its culture. For instance, new P&G hires read "The Book,'' which describes the company's history and the founders' core values, and new employees also take time to visit a life-size marble sculpture of William Cooper Procter, who was responsible for growing the Procter family’s business.

Hall emphasizes that you don’t have to be the founder to tell the Founder Story. If you don’t know your company’s founding story, ask! Then, as you retell it, talk about the first time you heard the founder’s story and how it impacted you. The founder’s story is valuable, regardless of who's telling it.

> **When to Avoid a Founder’s Story**
> 
> There are times when the Founder’s Story isn't worth telling. For instance, if a founder is embroiled in controversy or hasn’t delivered on promises, the company is better off focusing on telling a story that doesn’t position the founder as the protagonist.
> 
> For example, Uber couldn’t use this tactic when its founder Travis Kalanick faced a series of scandals related to the company’s workplace culture, treatment of drivers, and business practices. Kalanick was forced to resign in 2017 following allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Instead, Uber chose to highlight the cultural shifts ushered in by the new CEO, who has made headlines for going undercover as an Uber driver in order to better understand drivers’ experience.

#### The Purpose Story

The last of the core stories is the Purpose Story, which is useful when you want to **bring people together around a shared vision**.

(Shortform note: In _First Things First, _Stephen R. Covey emphasizes that a shared vision is only impactful if that vision empowers everyone. Before crafting your story, make sure that your vision focuses on a purpose that everyone is passionate about and addresses everyone’s needs, not just the needs of those at the top. No matter how good your story is, if your vision falls short, your story will too.)

Hall argues that storytelling helps align people around a shared purpose in three ways.

  1. _Shared Challenges_ : A Purpose Story can remind people of their shared humanity, build trust, and open the door to productive dialogue.
  2. _Shared Value_ s: A Purpose Story can help people understand and connect with the values that guide the organization or community.
  3. _Shared Vision_ : A Purpose Story can help people visualize a shared goal or future.



(Shortform note: While a Purpose Story can be a powerful tool for building unity and alignment around a shared goal, organizations may need to do more to address underlying structural issues or conflicts within an organization. Chronic issues often stem from interconnected issues; additional strategies such as conflict resolution, diversity and inclusion training, and community building may be necessary to create a productive and effective team.)

Patagonia is an example of an organization that uses all three strategies to organize people around a shared purpose. In their marketing, Patagonia communicates the shared challenges of overconsumption and climate change, the shared value of environmental responsibility, and the vision for a more sustainable clothing industry and healthier planet, which all contribute to Patagonia’s higher purpose—to protect the planet (and sell outdoor clothing).

Patagonia aligns people around what neuroeconomist Paul Zak refers to as a “transcendent purpose.” Citing Zak’s research, Hall explains that focusing on a transcendent purpose leads to deeper and more sustained levels of motivation and commitment. Focusing on a transactional purpose (exchange for goods and services), on the other hand, leads to shorter-term motivation and less fulfillment. In short, stories that speak to a deeper purpose are more likely to increase brand loyalty by helping customers develop an identity around your company.

(Shortform note: Research suggests transcendent purpose is especially important in workplace retention. The 2016 Deloitte Millennial Survey found that 87% of millennials believed that “the success of a business should be measured in terms of more than just its financial performance.” This included factors such as environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and ethical business practices. In another study by Deloitte, 70% of millennials listed their company’s commitment to the community as an influence on their decision to work there.)

### How to Know What Story to Tell

At some point, you might need any one of the four core stories, but, according to Hall, the trick is finding the right story at the right time for the right purpose. She explains that to pick the right story, **you need to be clear on the message you want to communicate and then find the story that most effectively articulates that message**.

As you're deciding what story to tell, Hall recommends considering the following questions:

  * Who's the story for?
  * How do you want the story to change them? 



For example, if you're speaking to an audience of potential investors and you want them to feel confident about investing in your vision, tell your founder’s story. Help them see the resilience of the person behind the product. Or, if you're speaking to customers and you want them to see that they are part of a global movement, tell a purpose story—connect them to the deeper meaning of your company.

(Shortform note: Implicit in Hall’s argument is the assumption that stories are tools for good. However, stories can also have a dark side: Leaders and organizations can use stories to manipulate people and push them toward extremism. As you craft your own stories, consider their potential impact on their intended audience.)

### How to Collect Stories

Hall argues that to effectively use stories to address the challenges facing your company, you need a stockpile of stories to choose from. Telling a compelling story, she explains, relies on having a bank of stories at your disposal and then pulling out the perfect story at the perfect moment. She recommends starting to build your story bank right away.

(Shortform note: Building your story bank doesn’t have to be a solitary project. Storytelling For Good, a storytelling consulting firm, suggests that team members work together to create systems and structures to collect and organize their stories. The firm says that after identifying a way to archive your stories, you should create a shared taxonomy that will allow you to label and organize all your content and ensure that the database is open, accessible, and searchable by things like keyword, author, date, or place.)

If you think this sounds intimidating, you’re not alone. According to Hall, many people go through life believing that they don’t have any stories to tell or that their stories aren’t worth hearing. Hall adamantly disagrees and emphasizes that everyone has stories worth sharing.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that it’s especially important to share stories from marginalized communities, which are frequently underrepresented in the media. This lack of representation has the potential to lead to stereotypes and unconscious bias in society at large, which can further reinforce the idea some people’s stories aren’t worth sharing. Sharing stories from marginalized communities may interrupt this cycle.)

So where do you start collecting stories? Hall recommends **brainstorming as many story ideas as possible without judging them** or thinking about whether they'll be useful. If you’re feeling stuck, write down a list of important people, locations, or objects, and see what comes up—many good stories are associated with them. Firsts or major obstacles are also often fruitful ground for storytelling. For example, think about the first time you made a public mistake or a time you accomplished something that seemed impossible.

(Shortform note: Judging your ideas will kill your brainstorming process. The goal of a brainstorming session is to generate as many ideas as possible, and judgment and analysis at this stage can stunt idea generation and limit creativity. Instead, go into your brainstorming session with an open mindset and put any judgment and filters aside.)

You can also **gather stories from other people**. You don’t have to be the only source. You can build your list of stories by asking other people questions. Hall notes that general questions about an experience rarely elicit a worthwhile story (for example, “What was summer camp like?”). Specific questions are often more effective (for example, “Who was one of your closest friends at summer camp?”). If you plan on using someone else’s story, make sure you have permission first.

(Shortform note: Gathering stories from other people has the additional benefit of strengthening relationships and building community. Whether or not you use the story you hear, the act of asking someone questions about themselves strengthens your connection to them, which will in turn strengthen your personal and professional network.)

Stories are happening all around us, all the time. Now that you understand the power of storytelling, Hall recommends paying closer attention to the stories you hear so you don’t miss a particularly powerful story when it crosses your path.

(Shortform note: There's a growing appreciation for the power and prevalence of stories in our lives. This trend has been fueled by organizations like The Moth and StoryCorps, which have provided platforms for people to share their personal stories with a wider audience. The Moth stages live storytelling events and produces _The Moth Radio Hour_ , while StoryCorps provides people with the opportunity to record, share, and preserve their stories. Both organizations have helped to raise awareness of the power of storytelling and have encouraged people to share their stories with others.)
