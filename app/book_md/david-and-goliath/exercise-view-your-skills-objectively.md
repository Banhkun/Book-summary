## Exercise: View Your Skills Objectively

Use this exercise to become more aware of how your environment—and the people in it—may be influencing your confidence and keeping you from your goal.

* * *

Have you ever felt like a Big Fish in a Little Pond? When?

Have you had the experience of transitioning from a Little Pond to a Big Pond? (Maybe from middle school to high school, or high school to college.) What did it feel like to make that transition?

Think of a time you felt inadequate. What was the situation? Were you comparing yourself with someone else? Who?

How would comparing yourself to a broader group, instead of just the people around you, change the way you felt about your skills? If you still feel insecure about these skills, what are some ways to reframe the situation to see your skills more objectively? (Remember, if Carolyn Sacks had judged her skills against those of every STEM major in America, rather than just those of her classmates at Brown, she might have seen how truly accomplished she was as a potential scientist.)
