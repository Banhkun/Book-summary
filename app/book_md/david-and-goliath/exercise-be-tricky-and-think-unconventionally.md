## Exercise: Be Tricky and Think Unconventionally

Use the example of leaders of the American Civil Rights Movement to inspire you to tackle tricky problems in unconventional ways.

* * *

What problem are you facing right now that conventional approaches just don’t seem to solve? Perhaps you’ve gotten a lot of advice about how to solve the problem, and none of it is working.

Now list 5 unconventional approaches to the problem, no matter how silly or unrealistic.

Take a look at your list. Which ideas are too radical or off-the-wall to put into practice? Are they really? What do you really have to lose?
