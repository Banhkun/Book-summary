## Exercise: Acknowledge the Upside of Your Fear

As a society, we think of fear as something to be avoided. Use this exercise to reflect on how fear (and, crucially, confronting your fear) has impacted you, both negatively and positively.

* * *

Think of a time when you were afraid of something and you confronted that fear. (The fear could be big or small.) How did the experience alter your fear? Did you realize it wasn’t as scary as you expected?

How has overcoming that fear made you more courageous going forward?

What is one difficulty or trauma that has impacted your life? Is there any way in which it’s made you stronger?
