## Exercise: Compensate for Skills You Lack

There are some difficult situations, like having a learning disability, that you can’t change. But that doesn’t mean they have to hold you back. Reflect on how you have compensated in the past, and how you can compensate in the future, for deficiencies.

* * *

Think about a skill that didn’t come easily when you were a kid. What was it? How did you compensate for your deficiency in it?

What did you learn from practicing or compensating for the skill you lacked?

Think of a goal that’s important to you. What’s a deficiency that you feel is limiting your ability to reach this goal? How can you compensate to get past this deficiency?
