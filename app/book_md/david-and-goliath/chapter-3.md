## Chapter 3: The Advantages of Being a Big Fish in a Little Pond

Would you rather be a “Little Fish in a Big Pond” or a “Big Fish in a Little Pond” of your own choosing?

When applying to college, we want to attend the most prestigious university possible (and, therefore, be Little Fish in a Big Pond). Most would agree, when given a choice between two universities, you should choose the “best” one--the one with the most resources, the most accomplished faculty, the smartest students, and the prestige. But what if attending a “better” school could be a _dis_ advantage?

### The Theory of Relative Deprivation

The theory of relative deprivation says we compare ourselves to the people around us. Our feelings of happiness or deprivation, success or failure, are not absolute, but rather **relative to how happy and successful our neighbors are**.

For example, countries in which citizens consider themselves the happiest (Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada) have a higher suicide rate than countries in which citizens consider themselves generally unhappy or neutral. **If you’re depressed in a place where everyone around you seems happy, you feel worse.** However, if you’re depressed in a place where everyone around you also seems a little depressed, you feel normal and things aren’t so bad.

In education, we call this the “**Big Fish-Little Pond Effect**.” When assessing their own academic abilities, students don’t compare themselves to every other student in the world. They compare themselves to the students in their class. **The more elite the school, the more negatively students perceive their own academic abilities.**

For example,**** students who would be at the top of the class at School B (and would feel pretty good about themselves and their skills) might be in the middle or bottom of the class at the more prestigious School A (and feel bad because they compare themselves to students more skilled than they are).

#### Why does how we view our abilities matter?

Our perceptions have real-world consequences. Let’s take a look at the **drop-out rates at Hartwick College and Harvard** to see the “Big Fish-Little Pond Effect” influences graduation rates in STEM fields.

In America, more than 50% of all students majoring in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) drop out before receiving a degree. The majority of those who drop out are in the middle or bottom third of the class (ranked by SAT scores). This is true regardless of the university.

  * Of those with SAT scores in the **top third** of their class, 45-55% will graduate with a STEM degree
  * Of those in the **middle third** , 22-35% will graduate
  * Of those in the **bottom third** , 11-20% will graduate



The fact that dropout-rate distribution is roughly consistent across colleges is surprising. Let’s say you score 569 (out of 800) on the SAT and you’re offered the choice between attending Hartwick College in upstate New York (Little Pond) and attending Harvard (Big Pond).

  * An SAT score of 569 would place you in the **top third at Hartwick**. Because you’d be in the top third, you’d have a 55% chance of graduating (if you’re basing your chances on statistics from previous years).
  * An SAT score of 569 would place you in the **bottom third at Harvard**. Because you’d be in the bottom third, you’d have a 15.4% chance of graduating.



So, which do you choose? Hartwick or Harvard?

The statistics say you’ll have a far better chance of receiving your degree if you choose to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond and go to Hartwick. Additionally, having a STEM degree is arguably one of the best things you can do for job and financial security. Therefore, **choosing Hartwick over Harvard is the statistically smarter choice** for increasing job prospects.

**How can that be?**

It’s all about the “Big Fish-Little Pond Effect” and how we perceive our abilities. When we compare ourselves to our peers at Hartwick, we feel relatively good about our skills. **Our confidence increases our chances of success.** When we compare ourselves to our peers at Harvard, we feel relatively bad about our skills. We lose confidence in our abilities and think we’re not cut out for a career in the sciences.

Gladwell shapes this chapter around the story of Caroline Sacks, a student who chose Brown over the University of Maryland. She dropped out of her STEM program when she felt her skills were inferior to her peers’. Gladwell argues that choosing the University of Maryland would have increased Sack’s chances of achieving her childhood dream of becoming a scientist.

### The Impressionists

The Impressionists offer an example of a group that _chose_ to be Big Fish in a Little Pond, a choice that ultimately secured their place in the history of art.

150 years ago, the Impressionists had to choose between exhibiting their work at the Salon in Paris, the most prestigious art exhibition in Europe, and putting on their own show. At the time, if you were not exhibited at the Salon, you and your work didn’t matter.

The Salon favored graceful, traditional works depicting historical events or stories from classical myths. The Impressionists—including Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cézanne—used visible, audacious brush strokes to paint scenes from everyday life.

To the establishment, their work appeared unfinished and sloppy. The Salon rarely accepted work by the Impressionists, and when they did, the art was hung high up or in the back of the building, where it wasn’t seen.

In this situation, the Impressionists had **two very different choices**.

**Choice #1** : They could continue to attempt to gain viewers and buyers the traditional way, through the Salon.

  * In doing so, they would be Little Fish in a Big Pond (the Salon was 300 yards long and two stories high, hung with three to four thousand paintings).
  * **Pros:**
    * They would have a chance at being recognized and validated by Paris’s esteemed art critics.
    * Their work would likely increase in value if it won awards at the Salon.
    * Choosing the Salon didn’t require the courage of breaking out on their own
  * **Cons:**
    * The crowds at the Salon were big. It was hard to actually see the art.
    * Placed high among thousands of other paintings, their art wouldn’t get much attention (if it was seen at all).



**Choice #2:** They could exhibit at their own show. Here, they would be Big Fish in a Little Pond (the intimate show would display 165 works rather than thousands)

  * **Pros:**
    * They could paint what they liked and valued, rather than what the establishment expected to see.
    * They could show as many canvases as they liked (the Salon set the limit at 3; in the inaugural Impressionist show, Degas exhibited 10).
    * Their works wouldn’t get lost in a sea of others; People would actually see them.
  * **Cons:**
    * The Paris art establishment would mock or ignore them.
    * Their art may not be worth as much as if it had succeeded at the Salon.
    * They might be overlooked because they weren’t exhibiting at the Salon.



After many years of failing to get noticed at the Salon, the Impressionists struck out on their own. Although their exhibitions were controversial at the time, they drew huge crowds and their art was seen. If they hadn’t held their own exhibitions, we may not know the Impressionists today.

(Shortform note: While the Impressionists’ situation provides a good example of the benefits of being a Big Fish in a Little Pond, it is only tangentially related to the theory of relative deprivation. The Impressionists tried many times [largely unsuccessfully] to be Little Fish in the Big Pond of the salon. When they changed course and decided to be Big Fish in a Little Pond, they didn’t do it because they felt inadequate next to their peers, as the theory of relative deprivation would suggest. They left because the conventional way wasn’t working for them. After years of rejection, they were running out of options.)
