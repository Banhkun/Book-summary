## Chapter 5: Desirable Difficulty #2 - Trauma

The second “desirable difficulty” is trauma.

Courage is not innate; it is something you have to earn. You earn it by surviving something you didn’t think you could survive, or confronting a fear and realizing it’s not as scary as you expected.

Because it can result in courage,**trauma actually leaves some people better off than they were before.** How does this work?

  * If the worst has already happened, you’re freed of fear to some extent. Nothing will ever be as frightening as the realization of your worst fear (an event you somehow survived).
  * **Overcoming fear leads to a confidence you couldn’t have earned without it.** You endure the seemingly unendurable, and then you know you can live through it. It gives you a sense of your own invincibility and power.



### Trauma Strengthens Some People and Weakens Others

We tend to believe that trauma affects everyone the same way, and that this effect is universally negative. There are actually **3 general effects of trauma** :

  * **Direct hits** : These are people who don’t survive the traumatic event. 
    * For example, the casualties of the Blitz, Germany’s bombing campaign of Britain during the Second World War, were direct hits.
  * **Near misses** : These are people who are close to the traumatic event, perhaps even witnessing it, but survive. Trauma weakens them. 
    * During the Blitz, these were the people who were wounded or saw the carnage. These survivors remained preoccupied with the horror of the Blitz long after it was over.
  * **Remote misses** : These people are slightly more removed from the traumatic event. They experience it, but not quite as acutely as those in the “near miss” group. **Trauma strengthens them--they benefit from the elation and relief of being spared.**
    * These were the Londoners who heard the sirens and the bombs exploding, and witnessed the ruins in their neighborhood. Most of the Londoners who lived through the Blitz were in this group. 
    * The Germans thought that by bombing London, they would destroy the courage of the Brits. In fact, the Germans created courage in a country that was previously scared. Surviving the bombing, Londoners gained self-confidence and realized that the bombing wasn’t as bad as they had anticipated.



### The Trauma of Losing a Parent

When you’re a child, it’s your worst fear that one of your parents, your providers and protectors, will die. You can’t imagine being able to survive such a loss. We assume that children of deceased parents are worse off than peers who did not lose a parent in childhood. Are they?

A 1960s study showed that 45% of high-achieving people (judged by whether or not their lives filled more than one column in an encyclopedia) had lost a parent before the age of 20. Various studies have repeated these findings among subgroups. For instance, more than half of famous poets lost a parent before the age of 15. 67% of English Prime Ministers, from 1800 to the start of WWII, lost a parent before the age of 16. And 27% of American Presidents, from Washington to Obama, lost a parent while young. (Shortform note: “young” isn’t defined here.)

**Losing a parent is _not_ a good thing**. It’s devastating. Many children of deceased parents experience it as a “near miss.” Trauma harms rather than strengthens “near misses.” For example, prisoners are two to three times more likely to have lost a parent in childhood than people outside the criminal justice system.

However, some children experience a parent’s death as a “remote miss.” **By surviving the unimaginable, they gain confidence in their ability to withstand trauma.** Additionally, their other fears seem smaller and they take bigger risks (because, again, the worst has already happened).

### A “Remote Miss” Example: Jay Freireich

Emil “Jay” Freireich is a doctor who pioneered chemotherapy as a treatment for childhood leukemia. However, he may never have persevered in the face of criticism and threats of being fired if he hadn’t had such a traumatic childhood.

Freireich’s parents, Hungarian immigrants, lost everything in the stock market crash of 1929. Shortly after, Freireich’s father died, likely by suicide. Freireich’s mother worked in a sweatshop eighteen hours every day to support her family until she remarried, at which point she fired the Irish maid Freireich considered his real mother.

When he was nine years old, a respectable doctor removed Freireich’s tonsils, and Freireich, having never had a man in his life that he looked up to, decided to become a doctor when he grew up. Another Hungarian immigrant gave Freireich’s mother $25 so he could go to college.

As a child, he had conquered fear over and over again. **Traumatic experiences trained him to be courageous in his career and overcome consensus opinion and risk.**

While working at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Freireich developed two treatment strategies that horrified his colleagues and ended up being the keys to saving thousands of children’s lives.

#### Treatment Strategy #1: Blood Transfusions

The ultimate goal of Freireich’s team was to cure leukemia, but kids with leukemia tend to bleed everywhere, both internally and externally. Young patients were bleeding to death before doctors could treat their leukemia. Freireich held the radical belief that cancer destroyed his patients’ ability to make platelets. This, he said, was why their blood wouldn’t clot.

  * Roadblock #1: Because Freireich’s platelet theory was unorthodox, the Institute blood bank wouldn’t give him blood, and he had to recruit blood donors himself.
  * Roadblock #2: The conventional tools for transfusing blood were made of steel, rubber, and glass. But platelets stick to these surfaces. Freireich decided to try the new silicon needles and plastic bags.
  * Roadblock #3: Transfusing using the new technology was risky. If done incorrectly, it could result in heart failure. Consequently, Freireich’s boss threatened to fire him if he kept transfusing platelets. Freireich ignored him.



The bleeding in Freireich’s patients stopped. The team could now keep them alive long enough to treat their leukemia.

#### Treatment Strategy #2: Drug Cocktails

At the time, doctors used one of three cell-killing drugs, in limited doses, to treat leukemia. Freireich wanted to use all three at once, plus another derived from the periwinkle plant. All four drugs attacked the cancer cells differently, but doctors still considered combining them extremely dangerous. Freireich’s attitude was, “Why not? They’re going to die anyway.”

  * Roadblock #1: Because combining drugs was unheard of, and the periwinkle drug was a brand-new discovery, Freireich and his colleague Frei had to experiment to hit on the right dosage amounts and timing. Some kids became paralyzed in the experimentation process, and two children died.
  * Roadblock #2: The NCI advisory board refused to approve the treatment, and Freireich and Frei had to wear down their boss to get approval.
  * Roadblock #3: Children started to recover, but then the cancer would come back. Freireich decided to administer chemotherapy every month for a year, even when the children were in complete remission. This was dangerous (and highly controversial)--the drugs wiped out patients’ immune systems, leaving them vulnerable to infections and disease.



Everyone thought Freireich was insane, but he didn’t care. **His traumatic childhood had been much worse than the criticism of his peers.** Today, the standard leukemia treatment is a modified version of Freireich’s strategy and the cure rate is over 90%.

Why was Jay Freireich so successful? As a child, he had conquered fear over and over again. Traumatic experiences taught him courage.
