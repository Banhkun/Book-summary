## Exercise: What Knowledge Could You Create?

Everyone has the capacity to create new knowledge. Think about what knowledge you might have already created and what you hope to create in the future.

* * *

What’s one piece of knowledge you’ve created in your lifetime? This doesn’t have to be some great scientific discovery—a piece of hard-learned advice, a new recipe, or a good trick of your trade are equally valid.

What knowledge would you _like_ to create in the future? Perhaps you want to contribute something to your favorite hobby, or advance your professional field. How do you see yourself improving the world in some small way?

How might you begin to do that? Bear in mind that, as Deutsch says, it’s impossible to know what we’ll know in the future, but you might start by considering your current area of expertise and any exceptional skills you have. What is your first step toward creating new knowledge?
