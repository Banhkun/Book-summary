## Exercise: Identify Negative Patterns in Your Life

The existential kink meditation requires you to reflect on a negative pattern in your life and related feelings and desires. In this exercise, you’ll identify these feelings.

* * *

To begin, identify a negative pattern in your life and its associated desire. Look at the things that happen in your life and identify a recurring circumstance that you think of as bad. Make sure it’s something you have some distance from and aren’t currently grieving. Whatever this circumstance is, it’s the result of your underlying desire, so examine what you’re receiving from that circumstance to identify what desire it’s fulfilling.

Now, consider how this pattern currently makes you feel. These are likely to be negative feelings since you’ve chosen a pattern you view as negative, but try to think of them neutrally for now. Consider writing these down so you know what sensations to focus on once you begin the meditation.

Remember that shame is the number one roadblock to the existential kink process. What aspects of this pattern are you ashamed of? Give yourself permission to let this shame go.

Next, imagine how you might be able to take pleasure from this circumstance. Remember Elliott’s advice that you can take pleasure in everything that happens to you. In what ways can you find joy in this pattern? Take these insights with you as you begin your existential kink meditation practice.
