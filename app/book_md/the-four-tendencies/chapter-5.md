## Chapter 5: Rebels

### Overview

Rebels are the smallest tendency, with the fewest members. **Rebels resist _all_ expectations, internal and external -- they do what they _want_ to do. ** Another way to think of this is the Rebel “motto” that Rubin gives: “It’s so hard when I have to, and so easy when I want to.”

They value choice, freedom, and self-expression or identity, and enjoy bucking convention and expectation. Sometimes this resistance to expectations gets them in trouble though, and they make a choice that goes against their own self-interest or desires.

> **Shortform Example**
> 
> **** A Rebel might want to be a writer, so she starts writing, no problem. But then her friends tell her they love her work and they’re sure she’ll go places. “Have you got an agent yet?” “When are you going to publish?” Suddenly there are _expectations_ \-- more than just her wanting to be a writer, people expect her to do certain things or accomplish certain things.
> 
> Best case scenario, she’ll keep writing but resist following all the conventional expectations such as getting an agent, or seeking to publish. Worst case scenario for a Rebel, the external validation and expectations will interfere with her ability to write, and suddenly she’ll find herself incapable of doing something she _wants_ to do simply because other people have expectations, _and now she does too._

>

> A simpler example: if a Rebel wakes up and feels like doing his laundry, he’ll do it. If a Rebel wakes up and feels like doing his laundry, but then his wife _asks_ him to do the laundry, he probably won’t. If a Rebel tries to keep a to-do list and wakes up that day to “Do the laundry” written on the list, he probably won’t. In the first scenario, it was a whim, an off-the-cuff want. In the last 2 scenarios, there are expectations, either external in the form of his wife asking, or internal in the form of his own to-do list.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Rebels

#### Strengths of Rebels

Because they do what they want, **Rebels are free from the pressures other tendencies succumb to in terms of expectations**. They enjoy challenges if they can choose how to meet them, and do best when there are no expectations.

**They revel in defying expectations:** tell a Rebel she’ll never do something, and she’ll work hard to do that very thing to defy your expectation; tell a Rebel she’d be great at something and she should do it, she’ll deliberately avoid doing that thing to avoid fulfilling your expectation.

If it’s something they want to do, they work hard. **Rebels _with_ a cause can be incredibly useful** \-- they serve as the voice of dissent and an alternative to the status quo. **Rebels teach everyone else that we’re “freer than we think”:** we can do what we want to, and the world will still turn.

Because of their natural tendency to buck convention and expectations, Rebels can actually be very good at resisting harmful socially accepted habits, like smoking, drinking, and so on. And some Rebels are actually drawn to and thrive in highly regulated careers or environments, such as the military, the police force, the clergy, and so on -- either because they’ve realized too much freedom isn’t good for them, or because they like having so many rules to break and conventions to resist.

Careers that allow for individuality and value pushing the envelope can be a good fit for Rebels. For instance, academia is full of Rebels, particularly with tenure. Once they get tenure, Rebels have a secure job but one where they can, for the most part, do things their own way, on their own schedule, and still publish papers or make work that rebels against the existing research and carves a new path.

Some other positive ways to describe Rebels:

  * **Independent**
  * **Think outside the box**
  * **Buck social conventions, or march to the beat of their own drum**
  * **Spontaneous**
  * **Authentic, especially in regards to their desires**



#### Weaknesses of Rebels

Rebels are the most frustrating group to other people. **Rebels are perhaps the tendency that _other_ people want to change the most** \-- they expect Rebels to “grow out of it,” “grow up,” or mature beyond their Rebel nature. But that’s just what it is -- their _nature_ \-- and it isn’t a phase they’ll grow out of, it’s the tendency they’ll have to learn to live with (and so will everyone else).

  * This might make it seem like Rebels will live their lives alone because they frustrate everyone with their tendency, but never fear, Rebels: Rebels are just as likely as any other pairing to end up in partnerships and romantic relationships.



They resist doing anything they’re asked to do: if someone else has an expectation, they reject it. They resist anything that _seems_ like an attempt to control their actions. **The harder you push a Rebel, the harder they push back.**

They want to do things on their own time, and frequently cause delays for other people. They also end up taking advantage of others: they know that if they don’t do it, someone else usually will.

But they frustrate themselves as well: **Rebels are also second most likely to wish they had a different tendency.** Demanding to be free is its own form of control. For example, Rebels refuse to let peer pressure sway their decisions -- but responding to peer pressure by doing the opposite is still _allowing peer pressure to influence their actions._

Rebels don’t like schedules or calendars, and if something’s explicitly planned, they’ll often cancel. They avoid repetitive tasks unless there are serious consequences for not doing them. For example, a lot of Rebels use automatic bill pay and, if they can afford it, services that do routine tasks.

Rebels refuse labels, even accurate ones, and **many find themselves changing jobs often to avoid being trapped in an identity**. They’ll even contradict themselves to avoid feeling pigeonholed.

They don’t like systems where someone else decides what they do. Rubin found that many Rebels had only applied for one college -- they didn’t like the idea of multiple college admission boards deciding where they could and couldn’t go to school.

Even though Rebels are so averse to having others’ expectations or wills imposed on them, **many Rebels will still impose their own will on others**. For example, one Rebel wrote about herself: “I want other people to do what I want, just like I want me to be able to do what I want.” Most acts of Rebel resistance are imposing their will on others: an Upholder husband might want a family schedule, but his Rebel wife refuses to use it. This isn’t just a Rebel dictating how they live, but how others live as well.

Other negative ways to describe Rebels:

  * **Resist being asked to do something**
  * **Uncooperative and inconsiderate**
  * **Have difficulty with routine and repetitive tasks**
  * **Live as though rules don’t apply to them**
  * **Restless and have trouble settling down**
  * **Indifferent to reputation**
  * **Dislike routines and planning**



### Variations on the Rebel

Rebels, like Obligers, vary greatly in how they express their Rebel nature. If a Rebel is more considerate, they’ll perhaps be less likely to take advantage of people or do their own thing at the expense of others. If a Rebel is more ambitious, they might be willing to put aside some of their resistance of expectations to achieve the goals they need to achieve to climb the ladder in their chosen field. If a Rebel is aggressive, their Rebel nature will be expressed more aggressively, and they could end up having a lot of difficulty with other people.

Based on Rubin’s diagram, the Rebel can tip Questioner or Obliger.

#### Questioner Tip

Rebels who tip Questioner will **focus more on fulfilling their internal expectations than resisting external expectations**. These Rebels actually enjoy working for themselves, as long as no one else gets their expectations involved. One Rebel commented that no one cared whether he went to the gym or not, so he went every day because he wanted to.

These Rebels, like their Questioner counterparts, most likely have good reasons for doing the things they want to do, so they might be more resistant to letting others’ expectations interfere with what they want to do for themselves.

#### Obliger Tip

Rebels who tip Obliger have an **extreme difficulty with internal expectations** and experience a lot of pushback against themselves over the things they _want_ to do. Others’ approval of their internal goals makes them _even less likel_ y to fulfill them.

One Rebel recounted that he _wanted_ to have healthier habits, and was trying to implement them. But he could feel his parents’ silent approval when he woke up earlier or ate healthier -- and even this silent approval of his actions, pride that their expectations for him were being fulfilled, made him _not_ want to do the healthy habits he’d started.

### The Rebel’s Challenge: Dealing with a Rebel

We’ve combined these two sections for the Rebel, because their ultimate challenge -- and everyone else’s challenge with them -- is **figuring out how to deal with their tendency, and convincing them to meet expectations.**

#### How Others Can Help Rebels Meet Expectations

**In general, people around a Rebel must figure out how to avoid triggering their sense of opposition when you want them to do something.** Rubin offers a few suggestions for how to do this:

  * Convince them it’s their idea.
  * Use their contradictory nature to, well, _manipulate_ them. This is basically reverse psychology.
    * One mother was worried about her Rebel daughter sitting in front of the TV during one summer. No matter how much she encouraged her to do other things, her daughter would just sit there. Finally, one day, the mom walked into the room and said, “You know what, you’re right. You’ve worked hard, you deserve to relax. I think you should just kick back and watch TV and take it easy.” Her daughter immediately turned off the TV, got up, and walked out of the house.
  * **Resist pushing a Rebel to do something** \-- the more you push, the less likely they’ll be to do what you want. You might become frustrated if you need a Rebel to do something and they’re resisting, but you also have to acknowledge that your pushing on them _creates more resistance_.



A good general rule of thumb for Rebels (and everyone else) is to **present them with information, consequences, and choice.** Give them the information they need to make an informed decision, the consequences they’ll suffer depending on what actions they take, and then the freedom to choose for themselves.

Consequences are absolutely necessary for Rebels, but so is the aspect of choice. If you can give them these three things without nagging, lecturing, or micromanaging, chances are high the Rebel will make the right choice.

  * For example, one Rebel refused to RSVP for a formal charity event, despite pleas from the charity. The Rebel then showed up to the event but hated the table she was sitting at, because her friends were at a different table. Instead of pushing her to RSVP for their purposes, the charity event could have sent her a notice that they needed the final count to make a seating chart (information), and if she didn’t respond by a certain date, she couldn’t choose where she’d be seated (consequences) and the option to respond was open to her (choice).



#### How Rebels Can Help Themselves Meet Expectations

First and foremost, Rebels can help themselves by remembering that **they can do whatever they want to do,** regardless of whether other people want them to do those things. When Rebels resist doing something they want to do because someone else expects it (or they expect it), they hurt themselves and go against their own values.

Because Rebels value identity and authenticity, **they can incorporate habits that might otherwise go against a Rebel nature by aligning it with the idea of who they are**. “This habit doesn’t lock me in, it permits me to be my authentic self” is a mantra Rebels might take up to ease their resistance.

  * For example, one Rebel introduced routines into her life by challenging herself to be a Rebel who could follow a schedule and follow through. She challenged her own identity in a healthy way, and was able to adjust her habits to something she felt was more beneficial. 
  * Another Rebel who hated doing chores made a game out of it: she wrote down chores on slips of paper and put them in a bowl, draw one, and do it. It helped her get repetitive, boring tasks done by making it exciting and a product of chance.



Rebels can also use their rejection of labels to help them push against the Rebel identity: **they can rebel against being a rebel**.

**Rebels can also use negative consequences to help shape their habits for the better.** Though a Rebel might think traffic laws are stupid expectations, it’s better to use your turn signals than get hit by another driver, for instance. Or a Rebel might resist filing their taxes on time -- but filing taxes appropriately is much easier than dealing with the IRS.

Rebels can even impose negative consequences on themselves to reach their goals.

  * One writer kept herself writing by giving away her money once she earned it. She knew that writing for money motivated her, and if she had enough money, she wouldn’t write.
