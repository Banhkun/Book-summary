## Chapter 3: Questioners

### Overview

**Questioners readily respond to internal expectations, but not external expectations.** They’re committed to logic, information, and efficiency, and refuse arbitrary, inefficient, or illogical expectations. They gather information, then make their own decisions and act with good reason. The Questioner responds best to her own internal expectations because she’s already thought through these expectations and made sure they’re justified, achievable, and logical.

**External expectations need to be justified** \-- once they are, the Questioner will view them as internal expectations and will have little trouble fulfilling them. For example, a Questioner might receive a text from her husband asking her to pick up lunch meat on her way home. If that’s all the text says, the Questioner might not do it: her husband can pick up lunch meat if he really wants it, they have plenty of other food in the house. But if the husband texts that they need lunch meat because their daughter has two field trips that week and needs bagged lunches, the Questioner will do it: now it makes sense and has justification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Questioners

#### Strengths of Questioners

**As long as the expectation makes sense to them, they have the self-direction of an Upholder, the reliability of an Obliger, and the authenticity of a Rebel.** Once Questioners decide to act, they follow-through without difficulty. If they don’t agree with an external expectation, they resist it without stress or guilt.

They make up their own minds and question every expectation to make sure it’s justified. They question the most widely accepted and basic assumptions, and can often create change for the better on both a small and large scale. They help themselves, others, and organizations act with as much justification as possible.

Because they value efficiency and logic, **they want to improve any process they’re involved in** (unless it’s perfect in their eyes -- which probably means they designed it themselves). Doing things the wrong way or a harder way is unacceptable in a Questioner’s mind, and they’ll work tirelessly to improve systems.

**They do thorough and exhaustive research** , and make well-considered decisions because of it. Because of this, Questioners also serve as resources for others, and enjoy sharing their knowledge.

Questioners do well in careers that are research or systems-heavy, such as auditors, municipal planners, and scientists.

Some other positive descriptions of Questioners:

  * **Fair-minded**
  * **Efficient**
  * **Buck systems and trends**
  * **Refuse authority without justification**
  * **Data-driven**
  * **Good devil’s advocate**



#### Weaknesses of Questioners

Questioners’ refusal to meet expectations without reason can sometimes lead to trouble, particularly in school where students are expected to do things simply because the teachers ask them to. **Others often find their questions tiring and obstructive** , and feel like they raise needless questions and refuse to respect authority.

Questioners often view their own thought patterns as normal, and get frustrated when others don’t think the same way. They get annoyed when people fulfill expectations that seem illogical or unjustified, and they get annoyed when people get annoyed with their questions.

**Constantly questioning everything can be exhausting for the Questioner themselves.** Rarely is an answer ever good enough unless the Questioner comes to it on his own, which means the Questioner has to do a lot of heavy mental lifting to feel good enough about something to finally act on it. Some Questioners report wanting to be satisfied with basic answers, but needing more and more information to satisfy themselves.

And because of their extensive research and desire to make the best-considered decision,**Questioners can sometimes fall into analysis-paralysis** , where they become incapable of making a decision because they keep researching or the research doesn’t clearly point in one direction. We’ll discuss how to combat analysis-paralysis in a later section.

Careerwise, Questioners might be happy starting their own business so they can do things their own way, but if a Questioner easily falls into analysis-paralysis, they won’t be able to make the big decisions necessary to manage their own business. They also do poorly in work environments where people view questions as challenges to authority or insubordination.

Questioners can sometimes fall into crackpot tendencies if their research comes from unfounded sources, or if they make up their minds with information that seems justified but ultimately isn’t. For instance, Rubin suggests that most conspiracy theorists are Questioners.

Lastly, and somewhat ironically, **Questioners don’t like being questioned themselves** :

  * First, they’ll want to know why they should bother answering your question, though this is right in keeping with Questioner tendencies.
  * Then, because they’ve already put in the time, energy, and thought and reached a conclusion they feel makes sense, they take it personally if someone challenges their own carefully formed decision, or they don’t want to have to go through all the logic they already exhausted themselves with. They’re happy to provide information on something, but if they feel like someone is challenging their rationale, then they get upset. 
  * Lastly, Questioners get annoyed especially when other people, who haven’t done any research on a subject, ask what they consider to be dumb questions. Questioners assume other people know the Questioners would have already discovered flaws in their logic or questionable information, so they get annoyed when people ask questions in this vein.



To summarize Questioner weaknesses:

  * **Impatient with incompetency**
  * **Dislike being questioned**
  * **Refuse to do anything without “good” reasons**
  * **Refuse some helpful social expectations (such as driving the speed limit)**
  * **Analysis-paralysis**



### Variations on the Questioner

The Questioner can tip Upholder or Rebel.

#### Upholder Tip

Questioners who tip Upholder **generally accept social expectations and rules more easily.**

Though their primary allegiance is still to their internal expectations, they’re more likely to fulfill external expectations as well.

(Shortform example: A Questioner with an Upholder tip will be more likely to go along to their spouse’s holiday office party, even if the Questioner doesn’t like socializing or doesn’t understand the point, simply because their spouse cares about it and expects them to go.)

#### Rebel Tip

Questioners who tip Rebel **challenge all expectations with more ferocity.** They also generally reject all expectations more often.

(Shortform example: On the other end, a Questioner who tips Rebel will probably openly question why their spouse or anyone else goes to the party at all, and has probably never gone to a holiday office party simply because someone else would like them to.)

### The Questioner’s Challenge: Analysis-Paralysis and Meeting Unjustified Expectations

#### Analysis-Paralysis

As we already know, **analysis-paralysis happens when a Questioner can’t come to a conclusion, becoming trapped in a paralysis where they can’t make a decision.** Either they’ve done so much research that there seems to be no better answer so they aren’t sure how to pull the trigger, or they keep doing more research to see if they can get closer to the best answer in their minds.

Questioners and people around them can do a few things to **help avoid analysis-paralysis:**

  * Limit over-deliberation by setting guidelines on the amount of research or deadlines for a decision.
  * Focus on the big goal instead of small deliberations.
  * Question your own questioner tendency: “is it helpful to question this much?”
  * Ask more questions to gain more clarity on the situation, which will hopefully help you come to a decision.
  * Seek out people you admire or sources you respect and follow their lead on a similar issue.



#### Meeting Unjustified Expectations

Questioners also have trouble meeting any expectations they feel are unjustified -- but sometimes, in life, there are good reasons to do so.

Here are 3 tips for helping Questioners meet expectations they don’t want to.

**1) It’s _logical_ to meet expectations if someone else really cares about them or if you have a self-interest related to that person.**

  * For example, if your grandmother expects you to dress a certain way when you come over for dinner, your Questioner tendency might make you resist that expectation. But if you love your grandmother and don’t want her to get upset, it’s actually _more efficient_ to just dress the way she expects and let it go.



**2) Focus on the second order of reason** \-- in other words, if something contradicts your Questioner need for justification, there might be a secondary reason that’s as important as making sure something’s justified.

  * For example, a professor might give a Questioner student an assignment they think is unjustified. They won’t want to do the assignment -- but they might still want the respect of that professor, which is justified, and to gain the professor’s respect, they should probably do the assignment.



3) Use this motto: **do what you _have_ to do so you can do what you _want_ to do**. Questioners want to be able to fulfill their internal expectations -- but sometimes external expectations are the wall they need to climb over to have an easier time doing what they want.

### Dealing with a Questioner

At work, Questioners are very useful because they question the way things are done and want everything to be the most efficient it can be. However, **they can get too wrapped up in their questions, or their questioning can come off as a lack of respect for authority.**

Help them restrict their questioning by setting limits, guidelines, and deadlines for decisions. Remind yourself that **their questions aren’t confrontationa** l -- Questioners _need_ the answers they seek to do the work you want them to do.

  * If their questions are overwhelming, suggest resources where they can find the answers on their own.



**Make sure to justify your own questions to Questioners** , which will help them understand why you’re asking.

Questioner spouses have some difficulty in relationships. If your spouse is a Questioner, remember that **the more justifications you give them, the more likely they’ll be to do what you need them to do** \-- _asking_ them to do something is rarely enough to _get_ them to do it.

  * Rubin’s husband is a Questioner and, for example, if she sends him a text just asking him to pick up sliced turkey, he might not do it -- maybe because there’s other food in the fridge, or because he assumes she wants it, so she should pick it up. But sending him a text that says they need sliced turkey because their daughter has two field trips that week and needs bagged lunches gives him the justification he needs to do the errand.



**Questioner children have an even tougher time, specifically in childhood and school** , since one of the common reasons in this time period is “Because I said so!” Remember, there’s nothing wrong with your child wanting answers for why they should do something. Remind them of the second order of reason if you run into something you need them to do that they don’t feel is justified.

**Doctors specifically can have a hard time dealing with Questioners.** Remember to give your Questioner patient _all_ the information and justification for following your orders. Questioners will come with their own research: don’t dismiss it, even if it’s crackpot research -- address why that research is incorrect, giving them the information and justification to the contrary. They’ll also want to customize their treatment plan, so tell them exactly what they can and can’t customize, and why following the directions is important.
