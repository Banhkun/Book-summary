## Exercise: Take Small First Steps

Swart gives many recommendations for how to tap into your brain’s potential and change your life. For this exercise, we’ll start small so you have an idea of the immediate changes you can make.

* * *

First, consider how you can better fuel your brain. Pick one of Swart’s tips for fueling your brain (for example, exercising more frequently, hydrating better, or improving your diet), and identify one small change you can make today to implement that tip. Maybe you can start carrying a water bottle with you or purchase some leafy greens to eat for dinner tonight.

Next, out of the six modes of thinking (emotional intelligence, motivation, physical attunement, intuition, logic, creativity), identify one that you would like to improve. Think about a recent experience you had where you didn’t implement that mode of thinking as well as you would have liked. Describe what happened, then write down what you would have done differently if you had used that mode of thinking. Finally, write what you might do differently in the future to better utilize that mode.

Now consider how you can take on a more abundant mindset. Write down a failure you’ve experienced recently and how it made you feel at the time. Then write down what you learned or gained from it and how it will inform your behavior in the future.

Finally, identify one life goal you want to work toward in your practice of Swart’s four-step process and apply one of the steps to help you achieve it. For example, you could find a picture that represents that goal that you could put on an action board, or write an affirmation to help concretize it in your mind.
