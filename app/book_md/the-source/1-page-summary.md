## 1-Page Summary

In _The Source_ , Tara Swart explains that to achieve the life you want, you must tap into the full power of your brain and all its different neural pathways. She describes how the brain changes itself in response to our experiences, the different modes of thinking, and the major principles of the Law of Attraction. Though the Law of Attraction is often dismissed as pseudoscience or magical thinking, Swart explains the neuroscientific principles that underlie it and make it work. She then offers a four-step process for how to utilize all this knowledge and brainpower—which Swart collectively refers to as “The Source”—to create the future you want and improve your work life, your relationships, and your own personal development.

Swart is a neuroscientist with a background in psychiatry who advises some of the world’s top business leaders on how to achieve and maintain peak brain performance. She’s also a senior lecturer at MIT and co-author of _Neuroscience for Leadership_.

In our guide, we’ll explain Swart’s ideas about how to get the most out of your brain’s functioning to build the life you want. We’ll explore the concept of neuroplasticity and the six major modes of thinking that you need to tap into equally to maximize your brain’s potential. We’ll then explain the most important principles underlying the Law of Attraction, which is what enables you to manifest what you want in life. Finally, we’ll describe Swart’s four-step process for putting these ideas into action. We’ll add ideas from other writers on how to use your brain, as well as scientific context for Swart’s ideas and tips for applying them.

### Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Changes

According to Swart, **understanding how the brain changes itself—a process known as _neuroplasticity_ —is essential to harnessing the full power of your brain**, which in turn allows you to achieve what you want most in life and shape your future. Swart explains that the brain consists of 86 billion neurons—or brain cells—which are interconnected, and these connections are responsible for all our brain’s functions, including all our thoughts and behaviors.

(Shortform note: With its 86 billion neurons, the human brain has as many as triple the number of neurons as the brains of other primates. However, while this number is staggering, research suggests that the number of neurons in a human’s brain isn’t a predictor of intelligence; rather, according to additional research, it’s the size and speed of neurons that determines intelligence. Additionally, while the brain’s neuroplasticity can help you make significant, desirable changes, not all neuroplastic change is positive: _Maladaptive plasticity_ is when the brain changes in a way that produces unwanted symptoms, such as phantom pain. Being aware of how neuroplasticity works can help you both produce desirable changes and avoid maladaptive plastic changes.)

Swart says that these neural connections aren’t set in stone: They can change according to our experiences and our responses to those experiences. These changes include forming new neural connections, strengthening and speeding up existing connections, pruning away old neural connections that are no longer needed, and even creating new neurons (neurogenesis).

(Shortform note: The brain’s neuroplastic potential bodes well for people who’ve experienced trauma: Trauma causes changes in the brain, such as heightening your stress response and impeding your higher-level brain functions. However, through trauma-informed therapy, you can learn to strengthen or form neural connections that help your brain respond appropriately to stress and let it prune away those that developed as a result of trauma.)

According to Swart, **neuroplastic change is time-consuming and takes a lot of energy**. As your brain changes, you’ll find that you often seem to backslide, suddenly struggling again with an aspect of your new skill you thought you had mastered already. When you’re learning, the brain makes short-term changes that don’t immediately translate into long-term changes; the changes only become permanent with repeated practice, so to learn anything new, you must continually commit to learning it.

(Shortform note: Some estimates suggest that it takes an average of 66 days to form new habits, with individual variations ranging from around two weeks to close to nine months. If you’ve only been at it for a few weeks or months and find yourself backsliding, don’t be discouraged: Continue making the conscious choice to develop the new habit you’re working toward. You can also try other tips, such as setting clear, concrete goals (which research shows are easier to meet), finding ways to make practice more fun, and asking for help from your social support networks.)

#### Fueling the Changing Brain

Because neuroplastic change takes up so much energy, it’s essential that you provide your brain with the resources it needs to make these changes. Swart gives the following tips.

##### Rest Your Brain

**Get adequate rest on a regular basis.** According to Swart, sleep gives the brain an opportunity to cleanse itself of toxins that interfere with its functioning. Most people need seven to eight hours of sleep each night, so make sure you’re setting aside enough time each night to get as much sleep as your brain needs. Swart asserts that sleeping on your side is the best position for facilitating your brain’s natural detoxifying process. Also, she recommends that you establish a relaxing routine before bed that helps you get ready for sleep and avoid using screens for one hour before you go to sleep.

(Shortform note: In _Why We Sleep_ , Matthew Walker explains that sleep gives your brain a chance to store important memories and get rid of the ones you don’t need, and also that it improves your muscle memory. Other experts suggest that sleeping on your left side specifically is the most conducive to cleansing your brain because it increases your circulation and lets your stomach rest below your esophagus, which, as an added benefit, can improve your digestion and reduce heartburn.)

##### Feed Your Brain

**Your brain also needs plenty of energy in the form of nourishment** , Swart explains. The brain uses as much as a quarter to a third of the energy from the food you consume, and failing to give it the energy it needs reduces the quality of its functioning. Your diet should include whole grains, plenty of protein, vegetables, and healthy fats from sources like fish and avocado. Highly processed foods, alcohol, and excessive sugar and trans fats are inefficient fuels and make it harder for the brain to function.

(Shortform note: While Swart says our brain uses up to a third of our energy resources, other experts suggest that it’s closer to 20%. Despite this lower estimate, it’s still a significant number considering the brain only makes up 2% of your total body weight. Experts agree with Swart’s recommendations for a healthy diet, and they emphasize the importance of healthy fats in particular, noting that omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are linked to a lower risk of degenerative brain diseases. Fiber deficiency has recently been linked to cognitive impairment as well, so make sure your diet includes plenty of fiber.)

##### Hydrate and Oxygenate Your Brain

Hydration and oxygenation are also essential for healthy brain function. Make sure you drink enough water (half a liter per 30 pounds of body weight each day), and exercise regularly to increase oxygen flow to the brain. However, Swart notes that polluted air can actually harm brain function, so **avoid exercising in areas with high levels of air pollution**.

> **What Other Experts Say About Hydration and Oxygenation**
> 
> Some experts argue that we don’t need to drink as much water as Swart suggests. We get a lot of water from the food and other beverages we consume, which we often fail to consider in estimates of how much water we need to drink. These experts argue that forcing yourself to drink water when you’re not thirsty doesn’t necessarily provide any additional benefits.
> 
> In addition to hydration, Swart discusses the importance of oxygenation, but she doesn’t go into detail about the proper way to get oxygen flowing to the brain. In _Breath_ , James Nestor suggests that most of us don’t breathe correctly—we often breathe through our mouths, which is less efficient than breathing through our noses and can cause cognitive issues by depriving the brain of oxygen. He explains that the nose and sinuses are better designed to filter air, and that breathing through your nose takes less energy than breathing through your mouth.

### How to Make Your Brain More Agile

According to Swart, it’s not enough to fuel your brain well; you also have to **make a deliberate effort to tap into all its different functions** so it can perform at its best and help you achieve the life you want. To get the most out of your brain functioning, you have to improve _brain agility_ : the ability to focus closely on one thing at a time, consider a problem from many different angles, and synthesize ideas from multiple modes of thinking. Swart describes six modes of thinking that together comprise what she calls a _whole-brain approach_. These are emotional intelligence, motivation, physical attunement, intuition, logic, and creativity.

These modes of thinking are interdependent and influence each other. Swart explains that most people predominantly use two or three of these, and they often consider themselves “bad” at the ones they don’t use as much. But she argues that anyone can hone all six of these modes and develop their brain agility, thus making the best use of their whole brain.

> **Comparing the Six Modes of Thinking to Taylor’s Four Characters**
> 
> Swart appears to use the “whole” in “whole-brain approach” to refer abstractly to these modes of thinking, but in _Whole Brain Living_ , neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor uses the term to refer more literally to physical regions of the brain working together as a whole. She suggests that the left hemisphere of your brain is largely responsible for organized thinking like logic, while the right hemisphere is responsible for more creative thinking. She also identifies the limbic system as being responsible for emotions and the cerebral cortex as the seat of higher-level cognitive functions. She uses these distinctions to identify four major types of thinking, which she refers to as _characters_ , that are associated with the four brain areas.
> 
> These characters don’t match up cleanly with any of Swart’s six modes of thinking, but like Swart, Taylor suggests that we often let one of these characters dominate over the others in guiding our thinking and personalities, and she argues that we should strive to use all of them more equally.
> 
> While Swart offers specific exercises for strengthening the modes of thinking you use less, Taylor recommends a single mindfulness technique to get your four characters into greater balance with each other: the BRAIN technique. To apply this technique, you 1) breathe deeply for 90 seconds, 2) recognize which of your characters is currently in the lead, 3) appreciate all your characters, 4) inquire about each character’s perspective, and finally 5) navigate and identify the best decision based on your whole-brain thinking.

#### First Mode of Thinking: Emotional Intelligence

According to Swart, **the most important mode of thinking to strengthen is emotional intelligence** because it’s fundamental to all the other functions of the brain, so it has the strongest effect on the other five modes of thinking. It’s also the mode that people tend to have the hardest time with, because society tends to paint emotions and logic as polar opposites, suggesting that emotions are bad and logic is good.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that society exalts logic over emotion because of the prevailing misconception that men are naturally more logical and women are more emotional. This view is often used to invalidate women’s opinions as irrational and leads us to socialize boys to avoid or suppress their emotions, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health in adulthood.)

Because emotions come from the limbic system, which is one of the most primal parts of the brain, we often feel ruled by our emotions. But Swart explains that **we can control our emotions and use them to our advantage in maximizing our brain’s potential**. Specifically, while we may not be able to determine what emotions we feel at any given moment, we can control our emotional response to anything.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman suggests that people tend to handle their emotions in one of two ways: They either feel engulfed in their emotions and unable to control themselves, or they are overly accepting of their emotions and feel they can’t or don’t need to change them. Neither of these responses reflects emotional intelligence, and Swart and Goleman share the view that there’s a third way of handling emotions—taking agency over them in order to use them to your advantage.)

##### Control Your Emotional Response

Swart describes eight basic emotions that fit into three categories. Five of the basic emotions are _survival emotions_ : fear, anger, disgust, shame, and sadness. Two of the basic emotions are _attachment emotions_ : love/trust and joy/excitement.

Survival and attachment are different types of emotional response states. However, the final emotion is what Swart calls a _potentiator emotion:_ surprise. Surprise allows you to switch between the two emotional response states, meaning you can use surprise to take yourself out of a survival response state and put yourself into an attachment response state (or vice versa). Essentially, **by exposing your brain to something novel and unexpected, you can “shock” yourself into a positive emotional response (attachment)**. This, Swart argues, is how you can master your emotions.

For example, if you’re arguing with someone whose ideas are very different from your own and find yourself getting angry, try taking on the other person’s perspective. Trying out this new outlook exposes you to novel emotions and thoughts, which can surprise you out of your state of anger and into an attachment response state.

> **Other Theories on the Basic Emotions, and Surprise Versus Startle**
> 
> Other experts identify different basic emotions than the eight that Swart lists. Psychologist Paul Ekman proposed that there were six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Another psychologist, Robert Plutchik, identified eight basic emotions, but the ones he identified don’t map well onto Swart’s: joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, distrust, surprise, and anticipation.
> 
> All three of these theories (Swart’s, Ekman’s, and Plutchik’s) include joy (or happiness), sadness, fear, and anger, but there’s less agreement when it comes to disgust, shame, love (or trust), and surprise. Some research suggests that the four emotions shared by these three theories are the only four basic emotions, and that surprise and fear are just different manifestations of the same emotion (as are anger and disgust).
> 
> We should also distinguish between surprise and the startle response, which are often used synonymously. Surprise is the emotion that results from an incongruity between expectations and reality, but the startle response is an automatic physiological reaction to a perceived threat that activates the brain’s fight or flight stress response. Surprise that’s not accompanied by the startle response can allow you to guide yourself into a positive or negative emotional response state, but being startled will likely make you feel worse because it triggers your body’s stress response. To best utilize surprise as a potentiator emotion, use stimuli that your brain won’t perceive as a threat, such as another person’s viewpoint or a fun new experience.

To switch between your emotional response states, you need to be aware of and able to identify what you’re feeling, which Swart refers to as emotional literacy. She recommends that you make a conscious effort to note what you’re feeling when an intense emotion comes up, and that you say the name of the emotion out loud to reduce its power over you.

(Shortform note: While Swart recommends increasing your emotional literacy and being more aware of the eight basic emotions, neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett suggests honing _emotional granularity_ , or your ability to identify more complex emotions (such as insecurity, gratitude, boredom, or envy). Barrett says that being more specific in labeling your emotions can make it easier to regulate them and suggests that writing your feelings down and reflecting on them deeply can help you develop this skill. Barrett’s and Swart’s tips may be particularly helpful for people with _alexithymia_ , which is a difficulty in understanding and expressing one’s emotions. This phenomenon is common in autistic people, people with ADHD, and people with PTSD.)

However, Swart says that sometimes **emotions can feel so overpowering in the moment that we can’t easily switch to a different response state**. If an emotion feels overwhelming, she recommends that you imagine yourself holding up a big stop sign to yourself as a cue to let go of that emotion rather than acting on it. She also recommends exercise and meditation as a way to better connect with your emotions.

(Shortform note: Remember that the stop sign visualization is supposed to prompt you to avoid acting on your feelings, not to suppress the emotion itself. While suppressing emotions can make you appear less emotional in the moment, research shows that it doesn’t actually make the emotion go away, and it can negatively impact your physical and mental health.)

#### Second Mode of Thinking: Motivation

The second mode of thinking Swart describes is motivation, and it’s closely tied to emotional intelligence. **Motivation helps drive us forward when things get difficult** , so learning to tap into it will ensure that you’ll have the resilience to keep progressing no matter what challenges you face.

Your motivation often comes directly from your emotions. Swart says that survival emotions are negative motivators, while attachment emotions act as positive motivators. You can use both positive and negative motivators to help you move forward: For example, if your goal is to earn a promotion at work, you might be motivated both by the excitement of taking on a new role (positive motivator) and the fear of not having enough money to get by in your current position (negative motivator).

(Shortform note: While Swart distinguishes between positive and negative motivators, others describe motivation as either extrinsic or intrinsic. _Extrinsic motivation_ is external, driving you to do something in order to achieve a reward or escape a punishment. _Intrinsic motivation_ is internal, and it occurs when you find an activity personally rewarding without any external influence. In our example above, the fear of not having enough money serves as an extrinsic motivator because you’re attempting to avoid a negative external experience, but being eager to take on a new role is intrinsically motivating because you’re looking forward to this new position for its own sake.)

However, cautions Swart, **be careful not to rely too much on negative motivators, which can override your positive motivators and cause you to self-destruct** : If your fear of having too little money in your current job becomes your sole motivator, you might become so anxious that your work performance suffers, leading you to be passed over for the promotion. When you begin to feel like negative emotions are weighing you down rather than propelling you, you need to challenge them.

(Shortform note: In _The Purpose Driven Life_ , Christian pastor Rick Warren contends that negative emotions like guilt, fear, and the need for approval serve as ineffective motivators that create conflict in your life and argues for the value of a single, positive, faith-based motivator to guide everything you do. If you find yourself overwhelmed with conflicting motivators, simplifying these into a single purpose might help you tap into your motivation more effectively.)

Swart writes that you can challenge your negative motivators by **reframing them through a different perspective**. Take a step back from the problems that are motivating you and consider them through a wider lens. While your problems are valid and meaningful, remember that everyone in the world faces difficult situations, and there will always be people whose situations are worse than yours. Think about how your problem will feel five years from now: Chances are good it won’t matter anymore. These practices help depersonalize your problems so they have less sway over you and your motivation.

(Shortform note: Others recommend talking with others as a way to depersonalize or minimize your problems so they don’t interfere with your motivation. However, people with certain psychiatric conditions might need medical assistance to improve motivation. This includes those with _disorders of diminished motivation_ , who may have a hard time reaching goals due to apathy (considered the mildest syndrome), abulia, or akinetic mutism (considered the most severe syndrome). These disorders can be caused by things like brain injury or stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.)

#### Third Mode of Thinking: Physical Attunement

Another mode of thinking that Swart describes is being attuned to your physical body and senses, which helps you strengthen the connection between your mind and your body. This involves a specific type of sense called _interoception_ , which is **the sense related to perceiving the internal workings of your body**. Interoception tells you when you’re hungry, tired, too hot, or need to go to the bathroom, among other things. Because emotional responses have a strong impact on the body, being out of touch with your emotions can interfere with your interoception. Thus, when children grow up being told to “get over” what they’re feeling, they often lose touch with their physical bodies and have trouble with interoception.

Sart says that improving your physical awareness and interoception requires you to make a conscious effort to get in touch with how your body feels in response to different situations. She recommends keeping a daily journal in which you record 1) what you eat, 2) how you feel, and 3) how many times you move your bowels. This helps you make the connection between your body’s functions and your mood. She also recommends practicing a body scan, which is a meditative activity in which you focus your attention on each part of your body from the bottom up while breathing deeply.

(Shortform note: Issues with interoception are known as _interoceptive dysfunction_ , and they’re often found in people with ADHD, autism, and mental disorders like depression, as well as people with trauma-related conditions. This dysfunction can make it difficult for people to regulate other modes of thinking like emotion and motivation, and it can also contribute to other conditions such as eating disorders. As with the other modes of thinking, Swart’s tips (such as body scanning and journaling) may be useful to some degree, but people with interoceptive dysfunction may need other assistance to improve their interoception, or they may need others to help them manage and accommodate their conditions.)

#### Fourth Mode of Thinking: Intuition

Next, Swart discusses intuition, which is closely related to physical attunement. We often refer to intuition as “trusting your gut,” and while this may seem metaphorical, **research shows that the gastrointestinal and digestive systems actually have a direct impact on our brain’s functioning**. Evidence suggests that a healthy microbiome has a positive effect on mood and reduces negative thinking. Additionally, 90% of the serotonin (the “happy” hormone) in our bodies is produced in the gut, further linking gut health with mood.

(Shortform note: Other research suggests that the gut is responsible for producing as much as 95% of the body’s serotonin, further supporting Swart’s assertion that mood is heavily dependent on gut health. Also, research on drugs that affect serotonin suggests that this relationship may be reciprocal, and that medications like fluoxetine and other antidepressants that target serotonin can directly impact your microbiome and gut health.)

Swart says that maintaining a healthy gut enables good intuition, which leads to better decision-making. To improve your gut health, she recommends you exercise regularly and maintain a healthy diet like the one we described earlier in the “Fueling the Changing Brain” section. Additionally, she says that managing stress well is essential to a healthy gut—chronic stress reduces the amount of energy the body is able to expend for digestion, leading to digestive problems that negatively impact the brain.

> **Intuition, Emotions, and Physical Attunement**
> 
> Rather than viewing intuition as its own mode of thinking, you might consider it a combination of emotional thinking and physical attunement because it involves monitoring physical signals from your gut and connecting them to your immediate emotional responses to help you make decisions. Because of this, interoceptive dysfunction can also impair intuitive thinking, as can issues with emotional intelligence. Thus, Swart’s tips for improving your emotional and physical thinking may also help improve your intuition.
> 
> In addition to the lifestyle advice Swart offers to maintain a healthy gut, you may want to avoid excessive alcohol consumption, which is shown to negatively impact the gut’s microbiome. Excessive drinking can also increase stress and contribute to anxiety and depression, further harming your gut and impairing your intuition.

#### Fifth Mode of Thinking: Logic

According to Swart, **logical thinking is what helps us make good decisions**. When we engage in logical thinking, we’re attempting to use our pattern recognition skills to identify cause-and-effect relationships in our behaviors and actions and then base our decisions on the effects we expect them to have. This can lead to a sense of accountability for our actions (“If I perform [X] action, I’ll get [Y] result”), which is a good thing, but it can also have the negative side effects of making us fear and avoid risk—and healthy risk-taking is what helps us innovate and make daring choices.

We also often think of logical thinking as being isolated from the other modes of thinking, particularly emotion. But, according to Swart, the opposite is true: **Emotion biases every “logical” decision we make** , and the other modes of thinking also impact our logical processes. The key to tapping into our logical mode of thinking is to balance it out with the other modes of thinking, on which it’s dependent, and use all our cognitive faculties when we approach complex problems or decisions.

> **Causal Fallacies and Decision Fatigue**
> 
> Despite popular belief, emotion’s influence on logical decisions doesn’t necessarily impair our logic. However, logical thinking _can_ be impaired when we base our reasoning on logical fallacies, or flaws in an argument that result from faulty logic. Cause-and-effect thinking in particular can be impeded by the causal fallacy, which reflects a misunderstanding of how a cause leads to an effect.
> 
> For example, if you were planning to work out and trying to decide whether to go for a swim, you might think, “The last time I swam, I didn’t feel good afterwards, so I won’t swim again.” However, you may not have enough evidence to conclude that swimming is what made you feel bad last time. There could have been other factors at play, such as what you ate, how you slept, or whether you were fighting off an illness, so this faulty logic could result in you avoiding what could otherwise be a fun and rewarding physical activity.
> 
> Decision-making can also be impaired by _decision fatigue_ , a phenomenon where the more decisions you have to make, the harder it becomes to make decisions because your brain is running out of energy. Consciously employing all the different modes of thinking in each decision you make may cause you to quickly develop decision fatigue. To avoid burning out from making too many choices, try to create routines that reduce the number of decisions you have to make each day—for example, by planning all your meals at the beginning of the week—and see if you can pass off some of your decisions to others where appropriate.

#### Sixth Mode of Thinking: Creativity

Finally, Swart discusses creative thinking. We tend to think of creative thinking as artistic expression, but this is only one part of it. **Creative thinking also encompasses the ability to create a vision for your future and make choices that help you make that future a reality** ,**** as well as the ability to come up with new uses and interpretations for existing ideas and improve upon them. This requires you to be confident in your creative abilities, which is where many people struggle, particularly if they’ve been told in the past that they’re not artistic. (Remember, creative doesn’t equal artistic; some people are naturally more artistic than others, but everyone can be creative).

(Shortform note: Swart’s definition of creative thinking aligns with others’ definition of _divergent thinking_. Divergent thinking involves coming up with new ideas and considering different uses for existing ideas, as opposed to _convergent thinking_ , which is the process of coming up with a single correct answer that can be logically deduced. Drawing on all of Swart’s modes of thinking would mean combining divergent thinking and convergent thinking, which would allow you to engage in _lateral thinking_. In simple terms, lateral thinking allows you to identify the best solution from a number of different possible solutions. Lateral thinking is the type of thought process that goes into solving puzzles and riddles, for example.)

### The Principles of the Law of Attraction

Swart explains that once you’ve figured out how to properly fuel your brain and have maximized your brain agility, you can tap into the Law of Attraction to create the future you want. Many people are familiar with the Law of Attraction as a spiritual or faith-based concept, as it’s the focus of a lot of self-help books and programs, but Swart explains that there are actually neurological reasons why this law works. She explains six principles underlying the Law of Attraction. We’ll highlight the two most important of these below.

(Shortform note: Many people associate the Law of Attraction with _The Secret_ , a book that popularized the concept. But the term first appeared in a book called _Isis Unveiled _by 17th-century spiritualist Helena Blavatsky and continued to appear in the work of such writers as Thomas Troward, Wallace Delois Wattles, and Napoleon Hill.)

#### Principle #1: Abundance

Swart explains that the first step to utilizing the Law of Attraction is to take on an abundance mindset. **An abundance mindset is one that perceives the world and the universe as having enough resources to support all who inhabit it** , and thinking this way leads you to think positively and behave generously. This is opposed to a “lack” mindset, which is one based in the fear that there’s not enough to go around and that you have to work hard to avoid losing what you have.

(Shortform note: While Swart explains how an abundance mindset changes your behavior, leading to positive changes in your life, Rhonda Byrne in _The Secret_ suggests that such a mindset changes the world around you so that the universe will provide you with what you need. Both of these perspectives focus on making internal changes to improve your life, but Byrne’s more spiritual approach asserts that these changes are a means of communicating with the universe and that the universe will respond to that communication with changes in your life.)

Swart notes that the brain focuses twice as much on losses as it does on gains, which means our natural tendency is to go to much greater lengths to steer clear of a loss than we do to achieve a gain. This aversion to risk blocks our ability to change. To take on an abundance mindset, you have to **reconsider how you view failure**. Failure doesn’t mean you should give up so you don’t lose anything. In fact, failure is vital for success. It’s what propels improvement, and an abundance mindset helps you make improvement an intrinsic motivator.

(Shortform note: Some writers suggest that how you view failure is closely tied to how you view your natural talents and the concept of success. In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck argues that the belief that your talents are inborn and can’t be changed leads to a fixed mindset (similar to the Law of Attraction’s lack mindset), because if your talents are purely natural, then success is all about being validated by others, which means failure is final and unacceptable. However, a growth mindset (similar to an abundance mindset) views talent as changeable and failure as a means to positive change, encouraging you to take on risks to help yourself grow.)

#### Principle #2: Manifestation

Manifestation is when your desire and your intentions line up in a way that allows you to attract the things you want in life. Swart emphasizes that this is an action-based concept. It’s not just about thinking happy thoughts and waiting for what you want to magically appear, but rather about **focusing on what you want so you can more easily take the actions needed to make it a reality**. She writes that manifestation relies on two neurological processes: _selective attention_ and _value tagging_.

(Shortform note: In _The Secret_ , Byrne also emphasizes the action aspect of manifestation. She argues that you should specifically engage in _inspired action_ , which is when you allow the universe itself to motivate your behavior. This is opposed to _forced action_ , which is behavior you engage in because you think it will get you a certain result. Forced action feels like labor and can lead you to take on too much because you believe that more work will get better results, but inspired action feels like you’re being guided by the universe and opens you up to receiving what you want.)

Selective attention is when you focus only on important information while filtering out irrelevant or extraneous information. The brain is constantly receiving massive amounts of information, and it can only focus on a small amount at any given moment. If you devote your limited attention to the things you want in life, you’ll soon find yourself noticing those things more and more because you’re priming your brain to watch out for and alert you to them.

> **Brain Processing and Selective Attention Bias**
> 
> Research shows that the brain receives around 11 million bits of information from the senses per second, but it can only consciously process about 50. This means that your unconscious mind is filtering out or compressing millions of bits every second to provide your conscious mind with the information it needs to focus on—and it does so in the space of just half a second.

> When you prime your brain to focus on certain things (for example, the things you want in life), you’re training your brain to focus on those more, which can lead to a selective attention bias (also known as _frequency bias_ or the _Baader-Meinhof phenomenon_). While we usually think of biases as something to avoid, this bias can benefit you by keeping you focused on what you’re trying to manifest.

The second neurological process of manifesting is value tagging. This refers to ascribing emotional value to the information you take in. As explained above, emotion heavily influences our thinking and motivates our actions and decisions, so associating a strong, positive emotional value with things that help you progress toward your goal will gear your behavior toward achieving more of those things.

For example, if you enjoyed going on walks with your family as a child, you’ll probably have a positive emotional value assigned to walking or outdoor areas that resembled where you used to walk. If your goal is to spend more time outside or get more exercise, this positive value can help you progress toward that goal. Alternatively, if outdoor walks were a stressful event for you, you may have an aversion to them—so it may be easier to focus on other activities that have more positive associations for you.

(Shortform note: Swart doesn’t specify how you can control the value that you assign to information. Research suggests that emotional tagging (which seems to share a definition or overlap with value tagging) takes place on a subconscious level and mostly impacts the way you remember things. That said, although you can’t always control the type of emotional values your brain assigns to important information, simply being aware of them could help you pay better attention to information that’s relevant to your goal.)

### The Four-Step Process to Change Your Life

Finally, Swart offers a step-by-step process for utilizing all the above ideas to put your whole brain into action to create the future you want. This is where you’ll apply everything you’ve learned so far.

#### Step 1: Increase Your Self-Awareness

According to Swart, **self-awareness is what helps you identify and take advantage of opportunities for change**. She describes several journaling exercises that can increase your self-awareness.

First, Swart recommends a journaling exercise to increase your awareness of how your childhood continues to influence you today. She explains that **your upbringing, and particularly what you learned from the people you were attached to, strongly influences who you are today**. These relationships served as models for you in childhood. They created neural pathways between triggers (like stress, poverty, and nourishment) and responses, giving you a blueprint for how to deal with the situations in your life. To keep these learned responses from controlling your life, you must be aware of them.

Swart recommends listing things like the roles you and other members of your family played when you were growing up, the secrets your family kept and how they impacted you, the beliefs and values your family held, and how your family viewed boundaries and rules. Consider how these things continue to impact you and write down ways in which you notice them in your life today.

(Shortform note: Other experts also highlight the benefits of reflecting on your childhood experiences and roles to better understand your present. Some recommend creating a narrative account of your childhood using activities like those Swart describes, as well as resources like the Adult Attachment Interview. They suggest the self-awareness you gain from creating such a narrative helps your brain integrate different regions and connections to improve its functioning. Some experts suggest you go even further and create a _genogram_ , a diagram detailing your extended family and their different traits. This can enhance your self-awareness even more and help you understand and deal with generational issues and other family patterns.)

Next, Swart recommends an exercise to help you more deeply understand the patterns and beliefs you picked up from childhood (many of which you’ll have noticed during the first exercise). She suggests listing six beliefs that restrict or obstruct your happiness. Then, for each one, describe the evidence you have to support that belief. Next, write down the evidence you have that contradicts that belief. Finally, reflect on whether these beliefs add or detract from your life, and how you might let go of the ones that don’t serve you.

> **Types of Limiting Beliefs**
> 
> In _Time to Think_ , Nancy Kline describes three types of limiting beliefs. Some limiting beliefs are **statements of facts** , which are objectively true—for example, “I currently don’t have [insert what you want].” While facts may seem absolute, holding onto them as beliefs can limit you by making you think they’re unchangeable, which they often aren’t.
> 
> Another type of belief she describes are **conjectures** , or beliefs about things that might happen—for example, “If I take a risk to try to get what I want, I might fail, and that would be bad.” In addition to misframing failure as a bad thing, this belief assumes that something will go wrong when it might not.
> 
> The third type of limiting belief Kline describes is **core assumptions**. These are the foundational beliefs about ourselves and the world that we often don’t even realize we have—for example, “I don’t deserve [insert what you want].” These are frequently picked up during childhood and thus may be the best ones to address in Swart’s exercise.

#### Step 2: Create an Action Board

For the second step, **Swart recommends creating an action board, or a visual representation of what you want to achieve**. This will prime your brain to create the change you want by reminding you daily of your goals. Using a piece of paper, some poster board, or any other material that gives you a lot of space to work with, paste images from magazines or online sources that embody what you want to achieve in life. Place this board somewhere you’ll see it every day.

(Shortform note: While Swart uses the term “action board” instead of “vision board” specifically because it emphasizes the action aspect of manifestation, some people suggest that such boards only serve as a distraction, and that it may be better to devote the time you would spend making an action board to doing the actual work to achieve what you want. Others suggest that action boards may be more useful for visual learners (as opposed to auditory or kinesthetic learners) and that non-visual learners may get more out of a board that uses text instead of pictures or adapts to their unique learning style in other ways.)

#### Step 3: Become More Mindful

For the third step, Swart recommends that you **deliberately focus your attention on your experiences as they happen** , a practice commonly known as mindfulness but that Swart refers to as _presence_. Staying in the moment like this takes you out of your established patterns, which helps you clear old neural pathways that don’t serve you and create new ones that do.

To become more mindful, Swart recommends practicing mindfulness meditation, which is proven by brain scans to change the structure and connectivity of the brain, which in turn improves your ability to process the information your brain is constantly taking in. This could include a body scan like the one described in the “Physical Attunement” section of this guide. Swart also recommends yoga, or simply taking time a few times a day to deeply focus on the sensory stimulation of a given moment or experience (like eating a meal, taking a walk, or listening to music).

(Shortform note: Mindfulness practices have many benefits in addition to those that Swart describes. Research suggests they can help you improve your ability to sustain your attention and block out distractions, which can help you with the selective attention aspect of manifestation described earlier in the guide. Mindfulness can also enhance your ability to relate to others, improving your relationships. It can be difficult to make Swart’s mindfulness practices a habit, but you can make it easier by joining communities where other people will help you in your practices.)

#### Step 4: Practice

The neural changes Swart describes don’t happen easily or quickly. They require you to **actively and regularly devote your whole brain to establishing and reinforcing these changes**. All of the principles and steps described above will propel you through the final step.

She recommends identifying the barriers lying between you and the life you want. To do this, draw three columns on a piece of paper and write your goals in the first column. In the second, write the behaviors that are interfering with you achieving these goals. Consider the behavioral patterns you see playing out. In the third column, write down the beliefs that are motivating these behaviors. These are what stand in the way of you achieving an abundance mindset, which in turn halts your progress toward your goals.

(Shortform note: Other authors provide different suggestions for how to identify the gaps between the life you have now and the life you want. In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans suggest that you begin by considering your overall satisfaction with four areas of your life: health, work, joy, and relationships. They suggest rating your satisfaction in each of these areas on a scale of one to 10, then comparing these numbers to see where you need to devote your attention. This exercise may work better for you than Swart’s if you’re struggling to prioritize your goals or understand what areas of your life need improvement.)

Swart also recommends creating a list of affirmations. Write down several inspirational quotes (from books or movies, from people you respect, or directly from your own brain), and repeat them to yourself multiple times a day. This will cement them in your brain and help move your goals from your subconscious to your conscious mind.

(Shortform note: To write the best affirmations, some experts recommend writing them in the present tense because it simplifies them and makes them easier for the subconscious to understand. They also recommend keeping them positive, avoiding negators like “not” or words with negative connotations, and keeping them solution-centric rather than problem-centric. Additionally, they suggest placing reminders of your affirmations (through sticky notes or other visual reminders) around your house so you see them frequently.)

Additionally, Swart recommends pushing yourself into new experiences. This will help you overcome the fear of failure that can be so debilitating in creating the future you want. **New experiences trigger neuroplastic change in your brain** and give you a wider understanding of the world around you. These new experiences can be small or large. For example, you could go hiking on a trail you’ve never been on before or listen to a new genre of music.

(Shortform note: New experiences don’t just improve your neuroplasticity: Research suggests they also activate the brain’s reward center, producing dopamine and making you feel happier. They also make you feel more present in the moment, which aligns with Swart’s third step to change your life. However, it’s important to note that the neuroplastic changes created by new experiences may be temporary. If you’re trying to make a permanent change in your brain, you’ll need to repeat the new experience frequently to create and strengthen the neural connections involved in it.)
