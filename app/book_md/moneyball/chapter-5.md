## Chapters 9-10: Making the Trades

Despite Billy’s savvy moves, the 2002 Oakland A’s get off to a rocky start. By mid-May, they are on a losing streak and are six games below .500. **Clearly, they are not on pace to meet DePodesta’s 95-win benchmark for a postseason appearance.**

The trade deadline looms ahead on July 31. After this date, teams cannot conduct trades until the end of the season. The trade deadline is a moment of reckoning for every team in the major leagues, when they must take stock and determine whether they are still in contention for the playoffs or whether they should begin planning for next season. Teams that are doing well might decide to be aggressive at the deadline and give up future assets to acquire star players. Teams that are _out_ of contention, meanwhile, will offload expensive stars in exchange for younger and cheaper prospects.

Billy always excels at the trade deadline. Since 1999, the A’s have always performed remarkably better in the second half of the season, after the deadline, than in the first half. The reason for this is Billy’s shrewdness as a GM and his keen understanding of what his team needs—not to mention the foolishness and shortsightedness of his rival GMs, whose ignorance he consistently exploits.

### Superior Information

**The A’s organization has quantified the value of every player in their system, as well as every player in the systems of the other teams**. They know exactly which players they want to go after, and which players of their own they want to get rid of. Billy’s advantage over his rival GMs is better information: he has a better understanding of value, which enables him to get more from trades than he gives up. Under Beane, the A’s don’t overpay for players and don’t give in to pressure from fans or the media to make desperate deals under pressure—which nearly always lead to a bad outcome.

Oakland’s strategy going into the season is to assemble a roster that is still in legitimate contention at the trade deadline. At that point, Billy will be able to take advantage of other GMs who are looking to offload their stars at a discount. The glut of available players causes their price to drop. **The trade deadline is a classic buyer’s market, and Billy knows exactly how to take advantage of it** , acquiring players that he could never have afforded at the beginning of the season.

Even before the trade deadline starts, Billy is exploiting the irrationality of the other teams. He has on his own roster players who are overvalued by the rest of the league because they have gone on recent hot streaks, making them look better than they actually are. This causes other GMs to overstate the true worth of these players, looking at short-term trends instead of long-term performance. Either way, Billy Beane is happy to let these players’ stocks rise.

One such player is Carlos Pena. At the beginning of the month, Billy deals the overvalued Pena to Detroit in exchange for ace pitcher Jeff Weaver and $600,000 in cash. He then trades the pricey Weaver to the Yankees (who think nothing of his $2.6 million salary) in exchange for two excellent prospects and the highly underrated pitcher Ted Lilly. **It is a classic Billy Beane trade, trading an inferior player for a superior one while cutting costs**.

A few weeks before the trade deadline, Billy shops pitcher Cory Lidle around the league. Lidle has performed poorly all season, but he’s now on a hot streak. This causes Lidle’s stock to rise in the eyes of GMs who only look at the short-term. Billy sees that he is overvalued and knows that the time is ripe to get maximum return for Lidle. To his surprise, the Chicago White Sox are willing to give up All-Star second baseman Ray Durham for Lidle and a Triple-A pitcher.

Beane acquires Durham, however, for different reasons than those valued by his scouting staff. **_They_ like his speed and ability to steal bases, attributes which Billy sees as adding little value to the team. Instead, _Billy_ prizes Durham’s success in getting on base and not making outs.**

Billy knows that Durham, who will become a free agent when his contract expires at the end of the season, will be too expensive for the A’s to retain past 2002. But this is part of the strategy. Durham is a rental, someone who will be used for a deep playoff run this year and then allowed to walk after the season. The A’s will also receive a compensatory first-round draft pick from the team that signs Durham, a valuable opportunity for Oakland to inexpensively replenish their roster.

### Freeing up Cash for Ricardo Rincon

On July 1, a month out from the deadline, the A’s stand at 46-36, good for third place in the AL West, six games behind the division-leading Seattle Mariners. As the deadline approaches, Beane wants to acquire Cleveland Indians pitcher Ricardo Rincon. The Indians, all but eliminated from making the playoffs, are looking to get rid of Rincon, but their GM tells Beane that another team, the San Francisco Giants, is also interested in the pitcher.

**Billy is also hemmed in by financial constraints: Rincon is owed $508,000 for the rest of the season, money that the A’s don’t have**. Billy needs to both outbid the Giants (or at least convince the Indians that his is the better offer) and find a way to pay Rincon’s salary. He needs to shed some money from his team’s current payroll to make room for Rincon.

He decides to auction off pitcher Mike Venafro to other teams that he knows are in the market for Rincon, hoping that they will be willing to settle for the much cheaper Venafro as an alternative. This will also have the benefit of lowering the price for Rincon, as teams will see that there is another viable left-handed pitcher on the market. Most importantly, it will take Venafro’s salary off the books, partially clearing the way for the A’s to afford Rincon.

After calling both the Giants and the Mets with an offer to trade them Venafro in exchange for a minor league player, word gets around the league that Venafro is on the market. Sure enough, the Indians’ GM calls Billy to tell him that the market for _Rincon_ has now softened, and he is now willing to trade him to the A’s for less than he’d initially asked.

Billy wants to send Venafro to New York in exchange for a minor league player and $232,923 in cash (the remaining difference in salary between Venafro and Rincon, which he believes the Mets can easily afford). **The A’s are actually more interested in getting rid of Venafro’s salary than acquiring anything from the Mets** —in fact, when the Mets ask Billy what he wants in exchange for the pitcher, he chooses a player from one of the Mets’ minor league affiliates at random.

But Billy proves unable to actually unload Venafro—it turns out that the Mets actually need the cash. Billy calls up the A’s president, Mike Crowley, and tells him that if he is unable to shed Venafro’s salary this year, he will sell Rincon for twice the price next year. If he falls short of this goal, Billy vows to cover the difference personally out of his own salary—but if he manages to sell Rincon for _more_ than twice the price, Billy will pocket anything over this amount. Billy Beane is taking a personal equity stake in one player. This convinces the A’s ownership to give Billy the greenlight to acquire Rincon from the Indians.

Billy makes the deal for Rincon, only giving up a minor league second baseman named Marshall McDougall. Billy demotes underperforming pitcher Mike Magnante to make room for Rincon on the roster. **It’s all part of Billy’s efficient management of his baseball club—upgrading the team through new assets, and discarding the old ones when they’re no longer of use**.

### The Attempted Cliff Floyd Gambit

That day, as Billy works the phones, he learns through one of his media contacts that Montreal Expos left fielder Cliff Floyd is going to be traded to the Boston Red Sox. In this development, Billy sees an opportunity. For while the A’s could never afford to pay a player like Floyd, he knows that the Red Sox can do so quite easily, and are actually desperate to acquire the left fielder. **The Red Sox have violated one of Billy’s cardinal rules about never making a deal out of a perceived necessity** —they have convinced themselves that they _must_ have Floyd by any means necessary and are willing to pay any price to get him. This naturally puts Boston in a dreadful negotiating position.

Billy doesn’t want Floyd to actually play for the Oakland A’s. Instead, he wants to acquire Floyd to use as trade bait for the Red Sox. **Floyd will be pure leverage—almost ransom—in Billy’s negotiations with Boston, enabling him to take whatever he wants from the Red Sox**. But first, he needs to actually _get_ Floyd, even if it’s only to trade him a few hours later. And that means he has to kill Montreal’s plans to deal Floyd directly to Boston.

When Billy speaks with Montreal GM Omar Minaya, he realizes that Boston’s bid is far better than anything he can offer for Floyd. The Red Sox are willing to give up a slew of coveted major league and minor league players, along with $2 million in cash. Minaya claims to be quite happy with what Boston is offering. Billy’s only hope in this situation is to convince Minaya that the Red Sox are fleecing him and that he could, in fact, be getting far more for Floy.

Billy proposes to Minaya a three-way trade, in which Montreal will get all of the players that Boston is offering, plus another player from the A’s system. All Minaya needs to do is deal Floyd to Oakland and let Billy negotiate directly with the Red Sox. What Billy _doesn’t_ tell Minaya is that he plans to extract _other_ players from the Red Sox beyond those whom Minaya has already secured—and those are the players that Billy would be keeping for himself.

**The player in the Red Sox system whom Billy most covets is Kevin Youkilis, the “Greek God of Walks.”** He is a college player, whose stats had initially jumped out at Paul DePodesta. In 2001, the A’s had targeted Youkilis as a prime draft pickup; the team failed to draft him thanks to the influence of the traditional scouting staff, which still had some say in these decisions at that time.

**Youkilis is Billy’s quintessential dream player**. Because he is overweight, he has been overlooked and discounted by the collective wisdom of baseball traditionalists around the league. But he also possesses a stellar on-base percentage, an extraordinary ability to grind pitchers down and contribute offense. Billy’s plans to get Montreal to trade him Floyd is merely a gambit: he wants to use Floyd as bait to get Youkilis.

But Minaya is still skeptical—he is worried that Billy’s machinations will cause his deal with Boston to fall apart. Billy tells Minaya to simply ask for Youkilis in addition to the package of players he’s already getting. He assures Minaya that the Red Sox will raise no objection to Minaya slightly raising the price of the transaction. Billy is certain that Boston management will not allow themselves to be lambasted by fans and the media for letting an overweight, no-name college player like Youkilis stand in the way of acquiring a star like Floyd.

But Billy has misread the situation in Boston. **The new Red Sox assistant GM, Theo Epstein, is a young Harvard graduate, a number-cruncher and sabermetrics devotee in the mold of Paul DePodesta**. In fact, he is a keen admirer of Billy Beane and the entire Oakland organization. And Epstein has convinced the Red Sox of the true value of players like Youkilis. Once Minaya asks for Youkilis as part of the deal, the Red Sox know that Billy Beane is somehow behind it, and they’re not willing to part with Youkilis. It now seems that other teams are getting wise to Billy’s strategy.

### DIPS: A New Approach to Pitching

But there is more to baseball than hitting and on-base percentage. Pitching still matters a great deal. **The A’s apply their value investing approach to finding pitchers just as much as they do with hitters** , seeking out players with unusual throwing styles or unconventional physical make-up whom they think other teams will look past.

Most other teams look for the athletic equivalent of a sports car or a thoroughbred racehorse in a pitcher. They want speed more than anything, and they treat a pitcher’s average pitching speed as the most important measurement of his performance. Billy believes this to be foolish. Pitchers ought to be judged solely on their success in making outs, preventing runs from being scored against the team, and thus contributing to run differential and wins. Velocity for its own sake is irrelevant.

Years before, Bill James had pointed out that many commonly used fielding statistics, like errors, judged players based on luck. The dreadful state of fielding statistics made it difficult to evaluate these players rationally. By that same token, it would be hard to judge pitchers based solely on their merits, because so much of team defense depends on what the fielders do, not the pitcher. There are too many events on the field that are completely beyond the pitcher’s control.

Although James had never come up with an adequate solution to this problem, one does emerge from an unlikely source—a bored Chicago paralegal named Voros McCracken. McCracken argues that measurements like hits and earned runs against should be heavily discounted when evaluating a pitcher’s performance, as they depend too much on fielding. Instead, **pitchers ought to be evaluated on the basis of the walks and home runs they give up and the strikeouts they earn, as these are aspects of the game solely under their control.**

McCracken proves his theory correct by running the numbers from one season to the next. He sees that there is little consistency between the hits or earned runs a pitcher gives up from one year to the next. But there _is_ remarkable consistency year after year with home runs, strikeouts, and walks. This strongly indicates to McCracken that his theory is accurate and that fielding is padding the numbers for bad pitchers and downgrading them for good pitchers.

**McCracken calls his new statistical model DIPS: defense-independent pitching statistics**. And his theories happen to line up with those of a major league GM with a nose for finding underpriced assets: Billy Beane.

#### Chad Bradford: Sidearm Pitcher

**One pitcher who excels in the DIPS categories is Chad Bradford**. Despite his unusual throwing style, he is a remarkably talented pitcher, one of the best on the Oakland A’s staff and one of the best relief pitchers in the major leagues. And at a meager $237,000, he is a steal. Like nearly all the other A’s pitchers, he has been overlooked or written off by the other teams, as someone who could never succeed in the major leagues. Yet he is a key part of the A’s pitching staff—the best in baseball. They’re seeing something that the rest of the league isn’t—and at a fraction of the price.

Born and raised in Mississippi, Bradford barely makes his high school baseball team. The major leagues seem like a pipe dream for him. During his high school pitching days, Bradford’s coach teaches him to throw sidearm, a throwing style in which the baseball is released from the pitcher’s hand just above the ground, with the torso bent at a nearly horizontal axis. Although highly unusual (and initially uncomfortable), Bradford masters the style and sees that it is effective in striking batters out.

After he fails to receive an offer from any of the Division I schools, Bradford attends a local community college, where he joins the baseball team. While there, a scout from the Chicago White Sox takes notice of him, impressed by how naturally Bradford throws sidearm. To Bradford’s shock, he is taken by the White Sox in the 34th round of the 1994 draft.

Over the next few years, Chad works his way up through the White Sox organization to their Triple-A affiliate in Calgary. He is earning a pittance (he needs to take a side job as a forklift operator just to scratch out a living) but is living his dream by playing professional baseball and has blossomed into an exceptional pitcher by this time. In 1998 in Calgary, he gives up only three home runs in 51 innings pitched, with an earned run average of just 1.94. That same year, he is, at last, called up to the big leagues by the White Sox, where he turns in a similar dominant performance.

But the White Sox never really believe in Chad, attributing his success to mere luck. **They don’t believe someone with such a bizarre style can succeed long-term in the majors**. He just doesn’t _look_ like a pitching ace. They never assign him a full-time spot on the Chicago pitching staff. But Bradford’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed by Billy Beane, who acquires him from the White Sox before the 2001 season for nothing more than a minor league catcher. Billy has stolen another player out from under the nose of a rival GM.
