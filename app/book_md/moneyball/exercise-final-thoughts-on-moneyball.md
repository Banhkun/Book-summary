## Exercise: Final Thoughts on Moneyball

Think about the main lessons from _Moneyball_.

* * *

Why do you think that baseball traditionalists were so opposed to the way in which Billy Beane ran the Oakland Aâ€™s?

Why did old-fashioned baseball statistics like RBIs and batting average inaccurately measure player performance?
