## Introduction

_Drive_ begins with a research study. In the 1940s, operant conditioning was the standard model of behavior. The foundation of this model was that if you give a reward to someone after a behavior, you encourage that behavior to happen again. If you don’t reward a behavior, it extinguishes over time. This idea was borne out in numerous animal studies and also became the model for human management in the workplace.

But in 1949, Harry Harlow, a professor of psychology, discovered a deviation from this standard reward model. His team had created a mechanical puzzle for rhesus monkeys to complete. They placed the puzzles in the monkey cages to habituate them to the puzzle in preparation for the real studies that would happen two weeks later. But strangely, **the monkeys began playing with the puzzles independently, with determination and what looked like enjoyment**. Without any explicit rewards like fruit juice, the monkeys learned to solve the puzzle of their own volition. Classic operant conditioning couldn’t explain this - why would the monkeys do anything without the expectation of a reward?

This breakthrough finding prompted Harlow to offer another model of motivation: “intrinsic reward.” The joy of the task was its own reward - no extrinsic rewards needed to be given

Even more surprisingly, **introducing rewards like food _decreased_ monkey performance** – they made more errors and solved the puzzles less frequently. External rewards seemed to disrupt performance, contrary to standard reward models.

This research was controversial and lay fallow until 1969, when a graduate student named Edward Deci discovered Harlow’s research and tried a new experiment with humans. All participants were tasked with solving puzzles requiring rearrangement of separate plastic pieces into shapes.

The experiment ran in one-hour sessions held over 3 consecutive days. In each session, a participant was given 3 puzzles. When the participant had solved 2 of 3 puzzles, Deci told the participant he had to step out for a few minutes to retrieve the 4th puzzle, and the participant was free to do whatever she liked. Deci stepped out for precisely eight minutes and watched what the participant did when left alone. This secret observation period allowed the researchers to measure motivation – the longer someone played when unsupervised, the more motivated the person was.

Deci split participants into two groups: group A and group B. On Day 1, he treated both groups the same. On Day 2, Deci treated them differently – he told Group A that they’d be paid $1 for every puzzle they solved. Group B got no reward. Then, on Day 3, he told Group A there wouldn’t be enough money to pay for Day 3, so they would be unpaid. Once again, Group B got no reward, just more puzzles.

Here were the results (summarized, not exact):

For Group B, the play time didn’t change substantially over the 3 days. On Day 1 they began engaged (intrinsically motivated), and this persisted day after day. The joy of the task alone was enough to get them to solve puzzles, and this didn’t diminish over time.

But for Group A, Deci found that introducing a **reward gave a _momentary_ boost to motivation** – in Day 2, Group A participants increased their play time by about a minute. But on Day 3, **when Deci removed the reward, play time plummeted** , even below the original Day 1 when no reward was even suggested.

The conclusion: **rewards enhance performance in the short term, at the expense of intrinsic motivation. Once the reward is removed, overall motivation decreases.**

Intrinsic motivation, therefore, is a natural drive. People seek out novelty and challenges and want to learn. But developing intrinsic motivation requires a nurturing environment, one where external rewards don’t quash this spirit.

The author Daniel Pink argues that most businesses haven’t yet reformed in light of these discoveries. They still primarily use money as the primary driver, and they’re confused when it doesn’t work the way they intend. _Drive_ is his effort to repair the gap.

**This _Drive_ summary has 3 parts:**

  * Chapters 1-3 discuss the flaws in the predominant carrots-and-sticks motivational model.
  * Chapters 4-6 explores the three drivers of intrinsic motivation – **autonomy, mastery, and purpose**.
  * Chapter 7 ends with suggestions on how to nurture intrinsically-motivated behavior in yourself, your organization, and your children.
