## Chapter 2A: …and the Exceptions When Rewards Do Work

The author admits that rewards and punishments do work well in certain conditions.

First, workers need a **secure** **baseline** of compensation and work environment. If a worker is constantly anxious about how she’s going to put food on the table, she’ll find it hard to concentrate, no matter how enjoyable the task is.

### Extrinsic Rewards for Routine Tasks

Next, **extrinsic rewards work when the task at hand is routine and doesn’t involve creative thinking**. Here, rewards don’t threaten intrinsic motivation because _there is little intrinsic motivation to be undermined_. Imagine doing a routine job on an assembly line.

You can make this work in your favor by promising rewards for work that is dull. For instance, if you need your team to pitch in on package shipping over the weekend, promise a party at the end.

Even better, supplement the reward with these three items:

  * **Explain why the task is important.** Talk about the larger purpose of the work and how it helps achieve your organization’s mission.
  * **Acknowledge that the task is boring.** This establishes empathy (“the boss knows what we’re going through”) and helps people understand this is the exception in your working relationship.
  * **Allow autonomy in completion of the task.** When the task is boring, give people freedom in how exactly to execute the task. 



### Extrinsic Rewards for Non-Routine, Creative Tasks

Creative tasks are more likely to be driven by intrinsic motivation, which can be undermined by extrinsic rewards. The author gives a few ways to give rewards without dampening motivation:

  * Try to avoid the “if-then” reward, where you announce beforehand that the reward is conditional on completion of the creative task. Instead, **give an _unexpected_ reward given after the task is finished.** Because it’s unexpected, the reward is less likely to undermine intrinsic motivation while the task is being completed. 
  * **Use nontangible rewards.** Instead of cash, give positive feedback, which unlike money can actually _increase_ intrinsic motivation.
  * **Provide useful feedback.** Be specific and praise effort and strategy, rather than the outcome. For example, rather than saying, “great job, you completed the task like I said,” say “The initiative you took was inspiring, and I like your design choice here.”



All these rewards can increase employee happiness without dampening intrinsic motivation.
