## Exercise: Begin Stabilizing Your Glucose Levels

Inchauspé offers many strategies for stabilizing your glucose levels. Think about how you might begin to apply her advice to better your health.

* * *

Describe a time when you likely experienced a glucose spike. What symptoms did you have? (For example, maybe you recently felt exhausted after eating a carbohydrate-heavy lunch, or you were hungry again less than two hours after eating.)

How could stabilizing your glucose levels positively affect your health? (For example, maybe you want to feel more energized during the work day, or you want to start managing a chronic health condition better.)

Which of Inchauspé’s strategies for stabilizing glucose levels do you think would work best for you? Why? (For example, maybe you like the idea of walking after meals because you have a nice park near you, or you want to change the order in which you eat so you don’t have to make any major dietary changes.)
