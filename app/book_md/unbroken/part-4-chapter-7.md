## Part 4 | Chapter 7: The Will to Live

Louie’s fight for his life was far from over, and his will would be tested several times in the months to come. During the winter, Louie and William met Frank Tinker, another officer, and the three spent most of their time together. Winter turned to spring and spring to summer, and the situation at Ofuna continued to deteriorate. **By summer 1944, Louie, William, and Tinker had formed a plan to escape.**

First, the food situation was becoming more dire. Rations had been cut in half that spring, and men were slipping into desperate states. Louie became so desperate for food, he stole an onion and split it with other men. He stole miso paste and chestnuts from the kitchen after dark. He even volunteered to serve as a barber for the guards, despite understanding the consequences if he cut any of them with the straight blade, because the pay was one rice ball per cut.

There were also great infestations of fleas and lice throughout the camp, brought on by the summer heat. Louie and the others were covered in bites and itched like crazy.

More news about the war had also entered camp, and the POWs knew the allies were getting closer. Every day the allies advanced, the lives of the prisoners were put in more jeopardy with the looming kill order.

Finally, Louie learned from another prisoner, Fred Garrett, who was also from Southern California, that he’d been declared dead. **Louie worried about how his mother would handle the news of his death and wanted to be able to tell her he was alive.**

All of these factors were enough to spark the idea of escape in Louie’s mind after he heard airplanes in the distance. He knew there was an airfield nearby, and if he and his friends could make it there, they could steal a plane and flee.

### Actions and Consequences

The plan to escape was meticulously crafted and put into motion, but a couple of events would thwart the men’s efforts.

At first, Louie, William, and Tinker planned to sneak out of camp and hike to the airstrip, but they’d been blindfolded upon entry and had no idea what direction to go in. Then, a friendly guard, working on the assumption that the men didn’t understand Japanese, gave them an almanac so they could look at the pictures. With William’s fluency, the almanac gave them detailed descriptions of Japanese ports, types of vessels, and distances between various locations.

With this new knowledge, they abandoned the plane plan and decided to steal a boat instead. If they could make it to the western shore of Japan, they could take a boat to China. The only issue was the 150-mile hike to the western coast with wasted bodies and distinguishable American features. **They decided they would travel only by night, but even if they were captured, it was better to die trying to survive than it was at the hands of the guards.**

For two months, the men trained. They walked as often as possible to strengthen their legs, studied the shift schedules of the guards, and stole tools. The day of departure was approaching, and Louie was filled with a fearful giddiness. Then, right before they were set to leave, a prisoner at another camp escaped. A new decree was delivered to the men at Ofuna: anyone caught escaping would die, and for each man who attempted or succeeded, several others would be killed in their name. Louie and his conspirators put the plan on hold.

The three men likely would have tried again, but another event ended that possibility for good. One afternoon, William was in another prisoner’s cell discussing the war when the Quack walked in. He saw William holding a hand-drawn map and searched his cell, turning up the other maps, dictionary, and news clippings he’d been hiding. **William was beaten for an hour by the Quack in front of all the prisoners, even after he’d fallen unconscious.**

In the days to come, William would regain consciousness, but he was essentially an invalid and mentally impaired. He didn’t recognize anyone anymore, not even Louie, who helped feed him and get him back on his feet.

Shortly after, Louie, Tinker, and several other men were slated for transfer to a different POW camp. Again, Louie felt the false hope of being delivered to an official registered camp. On September 30, Louie said goodbye to a dazed William, stuck his journal in his clothes, and left Ofuna one year and 15 days after arriving. He had no idea the worst was yet to come.

### The Bird of Omori

Whatever Louie and the other men had experienced at Ofuna would soon pale in comparison to life at their new POW camp: Omori. **A Japanese corporal named Mutsuhiro Watanabe was in charge of disciplinary measures, and none of them, especially Louie, would be spared his wrath.**

Omori was on an artificial island in Tokyo Bay connected to the main city by a bamboo-slat bridge. Watanabe had arrived in winter 1943 and soon became one of the most feared guards in the country. His tactics were so ferocious, Omori became known as “punishment camp.” The prisoners had many names for Watanabe, but the one used the most was “the Bird.”

Watanabe was from an affluent, privileged family. He studied French literature at university and moved to Tokyo to work in a newsroom after graduating in 1942. When Japan went to war, he quit his job and enlisted. Watanabe’s sights were set on becoming an officer, like his brother, and felt his privilege and education made him a certain candidate. But he was passed over for promotions and told he would never move beyond corporal. That decision would be the catalyst for the suffering of hundreds of men in the years to come.

**Bitter and resentful of high-ranking men, Watanabe’s angst grew after he was transferred to Omori.** A post at a POW camp was considered the lowest rung on the military’s ladder. His sense of dismissal unleashed a monster inside, and he took his anger out on the prisoners. He was known for his savage beatings, which left men with broken windpipes, ruptured eardrums, broken teeth, and a torn ear in one circumstance.

Watanabe was a sexual sadist and derived pleasure from inflicting pain on others. He destroyed prisoner’s family photos and burned letters from home in front of them. He’d demand to be called a different name each day and punished those who forgot. He forced men to violate camp rules, then beat them for it. Men would later recall a small sag in his right eye immediately before a violent tirade occurred.

However, underneath the brutality was a desperate need to be liked and accepted. Often, Watanabe would show remorse following a beating, crying and apologizing and offering the men cigarettes and candy to win their affections. But these reprieves never lasted long, and within an hour of apologizing, he’d flare into another rage and another round of abuse. **He had a particular taste for abusing officers and men who’d been successful as civilians, and as an officer and former Olympian, Louie was the perfect target.**

### Obsessed

The Bird’s interest in Louie started from the moment he saw him. That first day, Louie and the other Ofuna prisoners were told to stand outside the front gates of Omori. The Bird lounged against the gates, for several minutes, casually eyeing the prisoners without speaking. Then, he was suddenly in their faces, screaming and demanding their names.

When Louie looked in his eyes, he saw madness and looked away. The Bird punched him in the head and demanded that Louie look him in the eye. When Louie did, the Bird punched him again and said not to look him in the eye. That was the moment the men realized they were dealing with a psychopath and when the Bird started his greatest hobby—terrorizing Louie.

**The Bird referred to Louie as “number one prisoner” and beat him daily.** Louie tried to blend in with other prisoners and hide, but the Bird hunted him like prey and always found him. Louie was desperate for someone to save him, but the only ally the men had at camp was another guard, Private Kano, who often helped the prisoners behind the Bird’s back. He snuck them extra blankets on winter nights, looked the other way when they stole food, and helped sick men visit a POW doctor instead of the merciless camp physician. Despite Kano’s benevolence, there was nothing he could do for Louie.

The abuse weighed heavily on Louie. The Bird was the first thing he thought about each morning, and he fantasized about strangling his abuser. **That same childhood insolence made Louie defiant, and he refused to show weakness during beatings.** To Watanabe, whose mission in life was to command subservience, Louie’s boldness only made things worse.

### Life at Omori

The conditions at Omori were about the same as those at Ofuna. The food was similar in quality and portion size. Louie’s already emaciated condition worsened, as did the other men’s. In total, there were approximately 900 men imprisoned at Omori. Many were from allied countries, such as England and Scotland.

**The main difference between the two camps was the slave labor.** As part of the Geneva Convention, prisoners could be forced to work as long as they were paid, healthy, and not involved in the war effort. Officers were exempt from working. But after meeting Louie, the Bird decided officers would have to work. They were kept at camp and forced to sew materials for the Japanese Army while the enlisted men were sent out to work 10 to 11 hours a day in shipyards, mines, and fields or build railroad tracks throughout the countryside.

Like Ofuna, a subversive movement had formed among the slave laborers that involved sabotage and stealing. Workers put incorrect mailing labels on war supplies, destabilized train tracks, and sunk barges, all under the noses of the distracted guards. They confiscated shipments and destroyed the contents and stole food and sugar from other shipments. When they returned to camp, their pant legs would be filled with confiscated loot. A black market emerged among the prisoners, and the stolen goods helped save hundreds of lives.

Another way Omori differed from Ofuna was that it was a legitimate POW camp. Prisoners were registered with the Red Cross so word could get back to their countries, and up until the Bird arrived, men had been able to write letters home. However, Louie was not registered with everyone else. **The camp officials had something else in mind for him, but Louie wouldn’t learn what that was for some time.**

### A New Weapon of Hope

On November 1, 1944, a new American plane left a base on the captured island of Saipan in the Pacific. The plane was massive, standing at 30 feet tall, almost 100 feet long, and 141 feet wide, making the B-24 look like a private jet. **The plane was the B-29 Superfortress and could make the long trip to Japan and back easily, something the B-24 didn’t have the capacity to do.** B-29s had started appearing over Japan in the previous months, and the Japanese were terrified of it.

That day, pilot Ralph Steakly flew over Tokyo on a reconnaissance mission. At Omori, Louie and other officers were in the yard doing forced exercises when a siren went off. The prisoners were ushered toward the barracks, but before Louie stepped inside, he saw a slim white light flashing over Tokyo. A new POW shouted that it was the new American B-29, and the prisoners cheered. While the POWs chanted B-29, the Japanese stared frozen at the plane.

The sight of the plane incensed the Bird, and he took it out on Louie. Shortly after the flyby, the Bird marched into the barracks and accused Louie of being slow to come to attention, even though he’d jumped up with everyone else. He took his belt off and whipped the large buckle at Louie’s head. The buckle hit Louie in the temple and ear and knocked him to the ground. The Bird handed Louie a tissue and cooed over him until he could stand. **As soon as Louie was on his feet, the buckle connected again, and Louie went down and stayed down.**

For many weeks afterward, Louie was deaf in one ear. The daily beatings continued, and Louie was beginning to disintegrate emotionally and psychologically. Every day, he prayed for God to save him.

### Mettle of Honor

Not long after the B-29 sighting, **two radio producers from Tokyo’s propaganda station approached Louie about doing a broadcast**. His official death notice had been printed in the United States, and they offered him a chance to reach out to his family and correct the wrong. Louie was dubious, but he said he’d do it as long as he didn’t have to read propaganda.

Louie worked on his speech for the broadcast and added specifics only his family would know, the names of other POWs believed dead, and compliments about his captors to ensure the speech was aired. After delivering the broadcast, Louie told one producer about the Bird’s abuse at Omori. The producer said he’d look into it.

Across the Pacific, a woman named Lynn Moody was working the graveyard shift at the Office of War Information in San Francisco. At 2:30 in the morning, a colleague asked her to fill in transcribing Japanese broadcasts while they took a break. Over the airwaves, Lynn heard a voice she knew. She’d been a USC graduate and friends with Louie.

Lynn shouted with joy and typed up the transcript as fast as she could. A copy was mailed to the Zamperinis in Torrance, and the family finally had their answer. Louie was alive. Their jubilation was immense.

Days later, the producers came back and said they wanted Louie to make another broadcast because of his lovely voice. This time, when Louie arrived, they handed him a speech they’d written. The speech was riddled with ridiculous American colloquialisms and ridiculed the American government for falsely declaring Louie dead.

Louie was shocked and refused to read the speech. The producers tried to persuade him with a lavish American meal and a comfortable bedroom with a bed and clean sheets. If Louie gave the broadcast, he could live there and never see Omori again. **But Louie was adamant that he would not become a propaganda tool for the enemy.** Round and round they went, and the request quickly turned to threats. Still, Louie refused, and when he was sent back to Omori, the Bird was waiting for him.

The experience at the radio station gave Louie the answers he’d been looking for since Kwajalein. He’d always wondered why he was spared execution and transferred to Omori to live under the Bird’s thumb. Now he knew that the Japanese wanted to exploit his status as an Olympian to disparage the U.S. government to the American people and had delivered Louie to the Bird to be beaten into compliance. But Louie would never give in.
