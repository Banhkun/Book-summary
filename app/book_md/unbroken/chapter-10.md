## Chapter 10: Redemption

Louie’s desire to find the Bird was not unique. In Japan, a massive manhunt was underway for forty war crime suspects. Among those names was Mutsuhiro Watanabe. More than 250 POWs had provided statements about their experiences, detailing the gruesome abuse and torment they experienced. The Bird’s name popped up in all of them.

The United States government had an 84-count indictment against the Bird in one document that stretched eight feet in length. Only a small portion of his crimes were listed, and Louie’s affidavit only accounted for one count. Still, **Watanabe was a wanted man, and the Japanese working under the authority of the United States hunted him with fervor**.

After leaving Naoetsu, the Bird ran to his mother’s village and hid in her home. But when he learned that he was a wanted man after a couple of weeks, he fled. He knew capture would mean execution, and he decided the best course of action would be to vanish from existence.

Everyone in the Bird’s life became a target in the investigation. The police questioned relatives and monitored their communications. They staked out his mother’s house and questioned associates from all periods of his life, even childhood. They distributed his picture around the country, but nothing worked. **Watanabe had disappeared.**

### The Fugitive

Watanabe had taken the disguise of Saburo Ohta, a Tokyo refugee, after leaving his mother’s house. **He found a job with the farmer that provided room and board and settled into farm life.** In the evenings, he wrote about his saga in a journal. In one breath, he seemed to feel guilty when he thought of the soldiers, but in another, he described himself as powerful and strict and excused his actions as merely part of the job. At no point did he show real remorse.

Fugitive life was stressful, and Watanabe wavered between running and surrendering. But as months passed with no sign of police and a summer spent traveling with the farmer’s son with no one recognizing him, Watanabe started to relax and felt a longing to see his family.

In summer 1946, Watanabe went to his sister’s house in Tokyo. His family told him about being surveilled and daily visits by detectives. They urged Watanabe to leave before the detectives arrived, but the afternoon stretched long, and he was still in the house when the police came. Watanabe hid, and although the detectives stood inches from his hiding spot, he was not found.

After this visit, Watanabe went back to the farm and met a woman. They fell in love, but the pressure of sustaining his fake identity wore on him. He broke things off and left the village.

That fall, two bodies were discovered in the mountains in what appeared to be a murder-suicide. The bodies were of a man and woman. **The police took Watanabe’s mother to see the bodies, and she identified the man as her son.**

### Spiraling Out of Control

In Hollywood, Louie heard nothing about the Bird’s death. **By fall 1946, Louie was a full-blown alcoholic and suffering from severe psychological distress.** His whole world had become dedicated to his mission to kill the Bird.

The following years, 1947 and 1948, saw Louie bouncing between various get-rich-quick schemes to fund his trip back to Japan. Many of the schemes were operated by charlatans, who conned Louie out of thousands of dollars. These failures sank Louie deeper into despair.

At home, Louie was tense and quick-tempered. In public, he was aggressive and humiliating. Cynthia’s sadness about the state of her marriage turned into anger and resentment, and she and Louie fought often. Louie became convinced that God was out to get him, and any mention of religion sent him over the edge.

In spring 1948, Cynthia announced she was pregnant. The news made Louie elated, but it also put more pressure on him to succeed, which made him more anxious. Toward the end of the pregnancy, Louie experienced a night terror in which the Bird was beating him with the buckle. He lunged for the Bird and began strangling him. A second later, **Louie looked down and realized he was strangling his pregnant wife**.

Louie knew he was floundering, but not even the birth of his daughter, Cissy, could bring him out of the darkness. And after Cynthia came home and found him shaking the baby, she prepared to file for divorce.

### Awakening

In late 1949, Billy Graham, a young unknown man at the time, came to Los Angeles and performed a miracle. He set up what would become a massive revival residency. In just a month, he went from having 2,000 attendants at his sermons to 10,000. Word spread around the city and made its way to Cynthia. She begged Louie to take her, but he refused, so Cynthia went by herself.

Cynthia and Louie were living separate lives in the same apartment. She was still planning on filing for a divorce, but **after she attended Graham’s sermon, she came home and told Louie the divorce was off**. She’d had a religious awakening, and she wanted Louie to come next time to experience it. After much persistence, Louie finally agreed to go.

That first night, Louie became angry when Graham asked the congregation how long it had been since they’d prayed. The words poked at a dormant memory fighting to get out, and Louie felt cornered. At the next sermon, which Cynthia again persuaded him to attend, Graham said something that changed everything: “God works miracles one after another…. God says, ‘If you suffer, I’ll give you the grace to go forward.” At those words, Louie’s mind woke up.

Louie saw the morning in the doldrums, when he was certain they’d been led there by divine intervention. He saw the wires entangling his body as the _Green Hornet_ sank and waking to find them inexplicably fallen away. He saw the Japanese plane shooting at their rafts but not one of them hit. He saw the prison camps and all he’d endured. Then his mind landed on the memory scratching at the surface—praying in the raft and promising to serve God if he saved him.

At that moment, Louie felt rain falling from the sky as he hunkered down in the raft. The flashback stopped, and he was suddenly filled with light. When they returned home, Louie threw out every bottle of alcohol and vice he’d used during the last years of despair. That night, he didn’t dream of the Bird. **He would never have a flashback or dream of the Bird again.**

### The Calling

Louie was a new man with a new purpose. When he thought of his past now, he only thought of the graciousness of God to help him survive. He became a Christan speaker, adding his awakening to his previous story. He saved up enough money to buy a small house for his family. But **there was a question he still needed an answer to, and he had to go to Japan to get it**.

A year after the night at Graham’s sermon, Louie stood in front of Sugamo Prison in Tokyo, where his tormentors were being held. He looked over a room full of guards and took in the faces of Jimmie, the Quack, and others he recognized. The person he didn’t see was the Bird.

When Louie was told about the Bird’s suicide, he thought he would feel cheated or relieved. But all Louie felt was sadness. In that moment, he saw the Bird not as a villain, but as a man who’d gone astray down a bad path and never found his way back. **The last thing Louie expected to feel was forgiveness, but it was all he could feel.** Before he left the prison, Louie hugged his former captors, tears streaming down his face. He was free of all the shame, anger, and fear. Louie could finally leave the war behind.

When Louie returned from Japan, he bought an abandoned campsite and created the Victory Boys Camp, a nonprofit wilderness retreat for wayward boys. Louie took troubled youth into the mountains that had helped him find peace after the war. They rode horses, camped, rappelled, and learned survival skills. Louie talked to them about future jobs, and in the evenings, he told his story of survival and redemption around a campfire.

Louie never lost his charm, good nature, and zeal for life. His body remained strong, and in his 60s, he still hiked the mountain weekly and could clock a mile in under six minutes. In his 70s, he started skateboarding. At 85, he went on an expedition to find the bodies of the nine marines at Kwajalein, but it was unsuccessful. At 90, he was still skiing and climbing trees.

Louie received many awards in his life, and his parents’ home was made a historic landmark. He carried the torch at five different Olympics, including one in Japan. **Despite being declared dead in his 20s, Louie outlived his siblings and wife, the last of whom died in 2008.**

### The One that Got Away

When the order to apprehend war criminals was lifted in 1952, Watanabe resurfaced. He was not dead. His mother had lied. As a free man, Watanabe moved to Tokyo, married, had two children, and became a successful businessman, making well into the millions of dollars. **He saw himself as a victim of the war and the lifted order as proof of his innocence.**

In 1995, at the age of 77, Watanabe opened up to a London reporter about his past. He told the reporter he wanted to apologize to the POWs. He said he’d been acting under direct orders and had just been trying to promote discipline. He denied using anything but his fists to punish them.

In 1997, a producer from CBS called Watanabe about a profile he was doing on Louie Zamperini surrounding the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan, in which Louie would be carrying the torch. Watanabe agreed to meet with him, but after the producer grilled him about his treatment of Louie, Watanabe became defensive. Still, when the producer asked if he would meet with Louie, Watanabe agreed.

Across the ocean, the CBS producer told Louie the Bird was alive. Louie almost fell off his chair and said he wanted to see him without hesitation. Before his trip to Japan, Louie wrote the Bird a letter detailing his struggles after the war and his rebirth thanks to Billy Graham. **Louie told the Bird he forgave him and hoped the Bird could find Christ.** Louie took the letter with him on the day the two were to meet, but in the end, Watanabe refused to come. Whether or not Louie’s letter ever reached him is unclear. In 2003, Watanabe died.

Shortly after the failed meeting, Louie stood with the Olympic torch in his hand. He started to jog, holding the torch high as he passed Naoetsu. Where once prison cells stood, now a peace park dedicated to the memories of the POWs and guards stood. Louie ran, smiling and waving to the line of Japanese faces smiling back.

> **The Fate of the Others**
> 
> Pete Zamperini eventually got married and had three children. He coached football at Torrance High, then transferred to a different school and coached track and field. In thirty years as the head track coach, he only had one losing season. When he retired, 800 people came to celebrate him.
> 
> Pete continued to train the neighborhood children well into his 90s, holding races down the sidewalks. The saga of his brother’s life never left him, and he had a fear of the ocean. He remained a champion of Louie’s for the rest of his life and could still recite all of Louie’s race times to the second. He died in 2008 of cancer.
> 
> Phil and Cecy lived in Indiana and worked as teachers at a local junior high. They had two children and led a happy life. Phil rarely spoke of the war, and other than the scar from the crash on his head, the only signs of his experiences were in small quirks. He had trouble eating poultry, ate food straight out of cans, and refused to go near a plane. He also never went back to Japan.
> 
> As an older man, Phil was known for sitting in silence for long periods of time. In the 1990s, illness took over, and he spent his remaining days in an assisted living complex. When the staff learned who he was, they threw an event in his honor. It was the first event that honored him for his journey, not Louie’s. For the first time since returning home, Phil shared his story.
> 
> William Harris regained his mental faculties after the war. He returned home, married, and had two children. He remained active duty, rising to the position of lieutenant colonel in the Marines. He and Louie stayed in touch through letters, and they both promised to try to meet again in the future. But in 1950, William was sent to the Korean war to command a battalion. Before he left, he told his wife he would not allow himself to be captured if things went bad.
> 
> William led a diminished troop into a battle with a much larger Chinese force to allow an American convoy to escape. They lost men, but the battle was successful. In the morning, no one could find him. They searched for hours and came up with nothing. William was never seen again, and he was honored with the Navy Cross for his heroics during that battle.
