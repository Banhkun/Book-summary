## Part 5 | Chapter 9: American Heroes

The atom bombs changed everything. With two cities virtually wiped from existence, the Japanese surrender would follow shortly. Although life at camp seemed unchanged, the POWs could tell something was off. The Bird started making trips away from the camp, and the violence had abruptly ceased. The sudden relief was nearing too little too late for Louie.

Louie spent most days suffering in bed. He was tormented by fevered dreams of battles to the death with the Bird and vomited frequently. When he touched his legs, his fingers left indentations. **Louie had contracted beriberi, a life-threatening vitamin B deficiency that can lead to heart failure, paralysis, and death.**

On August 15, the POWs at the camp and work stations noticed something strange—silence. The Japanese guards had disappeared. At camp, Tinker found them huddled in an office around a radio, but he couldn’t tell what was being said. At the worksite, one guard told a POW that the war was over. The POW told the others back at camp, but no one knew what to believe. Still, for the first time in months, no planes flew overhead and no sirens went off. The men were cautious of this news. The kill date was only a week away.

The morning of August 20, the camp commander gathered the seven hundred POWs in the yard and announced that fighting had ceased. He said they could bathe in the nearby river, something they’d never been allowed to do.

Louie stumbled into the water with the others. Suddenly, a loud rumble thrashed through the sky, and the men looked up to see a bomber heading straight toward them. **It wasn’t until the plane was directly overhead that they saw American emblems on the side.**

The men laughed, cried, and wagged their arms at the waving pilot. They rushed back to camp and set part of it on fire. The pilot dropped bars of chocolate, cartons of cigarettes, and a note that supplies would be delivered soon. Inside the package was also a magazine with a picture of the nuclear cloud over Hiroshima. The cheers died down, and the men stared in shock.

Some of the men went to find the Bird, but he was already gone. At some point over the last day, the Bird had shed his uniform, grabbed a bag of provisions, and vanished. For Louie, the moment was different. He didn’t have enough strength for the jubilant celebration. **Louie stood still, barely able to hold himself up, and thought one phrase over and over: “I’m free.”**

### The Long Wait Is Over

The task of providing supplies to POWs and liberating the camps was a massive endeavor that took time. Being on the far side of Japan, Naoetsu was down on the list of sites. **Six days after the war’s end, supplies still hadn’t come.** Fighter planes flew over and dropped notes stating that they had exhausted their supplies but would be back soon. As a consolation, the pilots performed a 30-minute airshow for the cheering men below.

When the American planes returned, they dropped hundreds of bags of food. The provisions were spread out evenly, but they still weren’t enough. Commander Fitzgerald had men use lime to write a message on the road: “700 PWs Here.”

The message worked. Three days later, the fighter planes were replaced by six B-29s, and pallets of supplies started falling from the sky. There were peaches, vegetables, shoes, medicine, clothing, cigarettes, magazines, and other treats. From the magazines, the POWs learned that the Japanese had hidden the ending of the war from them for five days.

So many pallets dropped that everyone had more than they could handle. **In their euphoria, Louie and the others felt a release of their fear and anger toward their captors and embraced a spirit of love and gratitude.** They shared the excess supplies with civilians and gave packages to the guards to take home to their families.

Louie put on weight and washed the shirt he’d been wearing since the day he climbed aboard the _Green Hornet_. There were other clothes to wear, but his shirt had become part of him.

One morning, a B-29 flew over and turned on a radio broadcast over the speakers. The voice was of an American general aboard the U.S.S. _Missouri_. The man was standing with Japanese officials and other American servicemen. Among them was William Harris. He’d survived Omori. Surrender papers were signed by the Japanese, and on September 2, 1945, WWII ended.

### Going Home

The allied armies were busy arranging trains to transport the POWs to different air bases around the country. The train for Naoetsu was slated to come September 4, but it never showed. Commander Fitzgerald, like the others, was tired of being at the camp. He marched to the train station and demanded a ten-car train be prepared for them the next morning. His fist was persuasive with the Japanese engineer, and the next morning, the train was waiting.

The POWs huddled in the yard, eager to get back to their loved ones. Each man stood with his countrymen behind their flags, and they marched in procession through the gates of the camp with dignity. **Louie turned and looked at the camp one last time, then waved goodbye to it and the war.**

When the trainful of men departed the station, the last thing they saw was a line of Japanese. Civilians and camp personnel stood facing the train, each one with their hands raised in salute. The POWs were finally going home.

> **The Scope of the Tragedy**
> 
> The carnage left in Japan’s wake was astounding. Although official records differ slightly, most provide similar statistics as those that follow:
> 
> More than 130,000 POWs were held in Japan from the United States, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands. Of those, 36,000—or 1 in 4 men—died. Of the Americans held, the death toll totals 37%.
> 
> The causes of death for POWs include starvation, beatings, medical experiments, preventable diseases, and kill-order executions. Some 16,000 men died during death marches or from slave labor, including those who were forced to build the Burma-Siam Railway. Along with those men, approximately 100,000 Asian slave-laborers perished, as well.
> 
> There were at least 215,000 POWs from other countries and thousands more slave laborers. The death statistics for them are unknown, as are the number of men who were killed immediately upon capture or executed at places like Kwajalein.

### Back From the Dead

Louie was taken to an Okinawan hospital after he and the other Naoetsu men arrived at the train station. An American journalist interviewed Louie and heard his entire tale, starting with the crash of the _Green Hornet._ **When the journalist asked if Louie could sum up his experience, Louie said if he knew he had to do it again, he’d commit suicide.**

Louie was still weak and sick with dysentery, and he learned his ankle injury would likely be the end of his running career. After 10 days on the island, Louie was transferred to a hospital in Honolulu, where he was greeted with fanfare, a new uniform, and a promotion to captain. After changing into his new clothes, Louie left his room only to realize later that he’d left his old shirt lying out. When he learned it had been thrown away, he was crushed.

In San Diego, Pete was awoken by a friend on a September morning and given a copy of the _LA Times_. The headline sent him leaping through the air: “Zamperini Comes Back from the Dead.” It would be weeks before Louie was shipped back to the mainland, but when Pete learned he was taken to a hospital in San Francisco, Pete went AWOL and hitched a ride north. In mid-October, the brothers reunited in grand fashion. **Louie was finally healed of dysentery and in good spirits, and Phil’s concerns about Louie’s mental health were assuaged.** The brothers boarded a plane for Long Beach a few days later, and when the plane stopped, Louie jumped from it and ran to the waiting arms of his family.

The family had a hearty celebration waiting for Louie at the house. The table was stacked with a feast and three years of Christmas and birthday presents. They ate, talked, and sank into a long-awaited merriment. No one talked about the war or the prison camps, and everyone was pleased to see Louie doing so well.****

As a surprise, Louise pulled out a copy of Louie’s radio broadcast she’d received from Lynn Moody. There was no way Louise could have known the events surrounding the broadcast or the trauma hearing it would cause her son. When she played it, Louie became undone. He started screaming and shaking and shouted for her to turn it off and break it into pieces. The previous joy was gone.**Louie walked upstairs to his old room and dreamt of the Bird.**

### A Return to the Spotlight

Louie was an instant celebrity back home. Thousands of people wrote him letters, and the paparazzi tracked his every move. The military sent him on speaking tours, and many of them came with awards. Within his first weeks home, Louie gave 95 speeches across the country. **All of the recanting and attention became too overwhelming, and he began to suffer.**

No one knew the extent to which Louie was experiencing PTSD. His dreams were flooded with the Bird, and he started to experience anxiety attacks. The only relief he felt was when he’d drive into the mountains and take in the serenity of nature. But real life always beckoned, and Louie felt the increasing strain of his public life.

At one event, Louie was eating dinner before his speech and had a couple of drinks. He delivered his speech in a tipsy fog and discovered that the alcohol softened his anxiety. At the next speech, he drank three Irish coffees before walking on stage and again felt relieved. A pattern was beginning to form.

Louie’s drinking became more common, and he’d often find himself in bars in the evenings. One spring night in Miami Beach, as Louie drank at the bar, a beautiful blonde entered and stole his heart. **He would later tell his sister that after seeing her, he knew she would be his wife.** Her name was Cynthia Applewhite, and she was the 20-year-old daughter of a wealthy, upscale family.

Cynthia told Louie about seeing the newsreel about his NCAA championship race in 1938, when the other racers had spiked his legs. She’d never forgotten that story. She was smitten, and within two weeks, she and Louie were engaged.

After Louie left Miami Beach, he and Cynthia wrote letters to each other daily. Louie was concerned that Cynthia didn’t know how much he was struggling since the war and tried to warn her, but Cynthia said it didn’t matter. She didn’t know the extent of what he’d been through, but she promised to make it all go away. Louie slipped into the warmth of that promise completely.

In California, Louie threw himself into wedding plans. He stopped drinking and smoking and looked for work. He taught actors how to ride horses at Warner Bros. Studios, but the pay was low, and **with no degree, no skills besides running, and an overabundance of returning vets snatching up jobs and affordable housing, Louie’s future prospects were dim**.

The stress of the wedding and fending off his memories was getting to Louie. To make matters worse, Cynthia’s parents didn’t approve of the marriage. They thought their daughter was acting hastily and wanted her to wait until the fall to marry at the family estate.

But Louie started to become paranoid that something terrible would happen, a symptom of the violence and trauma he’d endured for two years. When Cynthia came to visit California, he accused her of not loving him. To prove her love, she agreed to marry him that night. They drove to a small church, where Louie’s family and a few friends were waiting, and got married on May 25, 1946.

That evening, Cynthia called her mother from their hotel and told her the news. A lengthy and emotional argument ensued, and Louie couldn’t take it. **He popped open a bottle of champagne, drank the whole thing, and fell asleep.**

### Haunted by the Past

Toward the end of 1946, Cynthia would learn just how deep Louie’s pain ran. The couple was having dinner in Hollywood with Phil, Fred Garrett, and their wives. It was the first time Louie and Phil had seen each other since Phil’s departure from Ofuna in 1944.

The evening was off to a great start. Everyone was in joyful moods, and the horrors of the men’s pasts seemed far away. But when the dinners came, Fred took one look at the neat pile of white rice on his plate and lost it. He screamed wildly until the dish was taken away, and although Louie was able to calm him down, **it was clear that their pasts were never out of reach**.

Life moved forward for Cynthia and Louie, but the strain of being a good husband weighed on his shoulders. He was 30 years old with no job, no interest in finding one, and living in a friend’s mother’s home. Louie made several small investments with the money he did have and soon earned enough to rent a small apartment in Los Angeles, but the income was always temporary.

Around this time, Louie started to feel his mind turning to the one thing he knew how to do. The return of the Summer Olympics would be in London in 1948, and Louie wanted to be part of them. His ankle seemed healed, and he’d been hiking in the mountains more and more. He decided if he started training now, he could be ready to compete in two years.

Louie began training with gusto. His body felt strong, and his ankle was holding up. But **where running once felt natural and freeing, now it felt like a chore he labored through**. There was no enjoyment in it. It was a means to an end, and it helped keep the bad thoughts away.

On one training run, Louie wanted to see how fast he could clock a two miles. The first mile went well, but as he headed into the second, he felt pain in his ankle. He knew he should stop, but he couldn’t. By the time he crossed the finish line, he was hobbling. Louie ran those two miles faster than anyone on the coast would that year, but it was all for nothing. He couldn’t walk for a week, and the doctors confirmed that his injury had worsened. His running career and Olympic dreams ended for good.

Without running, Louie was trapped in his mind. Day and night, thoughts of the Bird consumed him. **He was terrified of his dreams and started smoking and drinking again to get by.** His anger took over, and he lashed out at random strangers. Once, he jumped from his car and punched a man for walking too slowly across the street.

His trauma also started showing up in other ways. If he heard a loud sound, he’d cower and shake on the floor. If someone yelled near him, he’d jump to attention and wait to be beaten, hearing the voice of the Bird. He started to experience flashbacks of being back in the camp and could feel the sensation of lice crawling on his skin.

Nothing worked to bring Louie back to a good place. He was floundering and needed something to hold onto. He found it in a single idea that became his obsession. **If he could get back to Japan, he could hunt down the Bird and kill him.**

> **The Aftermath at Home**
> 
> The men who were held by the Japanese, known as Pacific POWs, suffered greatly after the war. Most of them had lost an average of 60 pounds while imprisoned, and the consequences of their abuse left permanent scars on their lives.
> 
> Many came home with tuberculosis, malaria, dysentery, anemia, eye ailments, broken bones, and open sores. Of the Canadian POWs, 84% suffered from neurologic damage, and others had respiratory disorders from long hours of slave labor in factories and mines. Some men were forever physically impaired from poorly set or healed bones, and some went blind from years of malnutrition. For some, the damage was too severe, and they could not be saved.
> 
> Many studies were conducted on the health of Pacific POWs in the years and decades following the war. The first two years after the war, Pacific POWs died four times faster than men their age. Twenty-two years later, these POWs were hospitalized for various conditions eight times more often than European POWs.
> 
> Mentally, the damage was just as severe. Six years after the war, Pacific POWs were diagnosed with psychoneurosis more than any other disorder. Forty years later, 85% still had PTSD. A 1987 study found that 8 in 10 men had psychiatric impairment, 6 in 10 anxiety, and 1 in 5 depression. These men were 30% more likely to kill themselves than the regular population.
> 
> Pacific POWs reported experiencing crippling flashbacks, where they would be transported back to the camps, the sensation as real as the world around them. They suffered from nightmares, night terrors, and violent bursts of aggression. Some couldn’t sleep in beds, were scared of passing planes, hoarded food, and would randomly speak Japanese.
> 
> A quarter of all Pacific POWs were diagnosed with alcoholism, and all of them struggled to reclaim a sense of dignity in their lives. Some never would.
