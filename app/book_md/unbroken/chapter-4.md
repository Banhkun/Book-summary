## Chapter 4: Those Lost and Left Behind

The various crews were exhausted after the Nauru attack, but there would be no rest for the weary. As the men relaxed, ground crews doctored the planes, getting them ready for another mission the next day. _Super Man_ was too badly damaged to make the trip. Louie and Phil were in their tent, like all the others, asleep for the night. Louie awoke to a disturbing sound. A plane was flying back and forth above the island. Louie assumed it was lost and wished them well.

**The next sound Louie heard was the roar of multiple engines and a loud explosion.** Louie and Phil ran down the beach in search of shelter. They found a hut on stilts and dove underneath it. At least twenty men were already hiding there. In the infirmary, Pillsbury was stranded in bed, unable to escape with his bad leg. The small island was rocking from blast after blast, bombs dropping one after the other down the line of tents and base buildings. Louie and Phil’s tent disintegrated shortly after their escape.

When the bombing stopped, some men scurried out of hiding to help the wounded. On seeing Pillsbury stuck in bed, one soldier placed him on a stretcher and pulled him into a cement shelter. Louie and Phil stayed with the others under the hut. They knew the Japanese weren’t finished. They huddled together, terrified.

The enemy bombers came back three more times, targeting the gassed-up B-24s waiting on the runway. As the B-24s exploded, pieces flew through the air and bullets whizzed from the arsenals on board. The American bombs aboard, 500 pounds each, detonated. Then, the explosions stopped. The attack was over.

As morning light crept in, the men saw the wreckage of the island. Buildings had crumbled, planes were charred skeletons, if intact at all, and craters existed where tents had once been. Louie wrote in his diary of one crater that was 35 feet deep and 60 feet wide. Casualties were scattered all over, as were injured men. Others were too traumatized to speak.

### Parting Ways

Louie, Phil, Cuppernell, and two others from their crew were sent back to Hawaii. Pillsbury and the other wounded were sent to Samoa, where a doctor amputated his leg. One of the other men was too badly injured to fight and was sent home. _Super Man_ and its crew were finished.

Louie was in a state of distemper back on the base in Hawaii. With no plane and no missions, Louie drank heavily, listened to music, and ran, trying to turn his mind from Brooke’s dying face to the 1944 Olympics.

A month later, Louie and the remaining _Super Man_ crew were transferred to the eastern side of Oahu and paired with six new men. Everyone was apprehensive, for new crewmembers usually meant mistakes. There was one man named Francis “Mac” McNamara, who had a significant sweet tooth. Other than that, Louie found nothing notable about the others.

**The new crew was given the infamous B-24 bomber known as the _Green Hornet_ , a haggard plane with a treacherous history.** The _Green Hornet_ was known as a “musher,” meaning the tail tended to drag lower than the nose. It was a heavy plane previously only used for errands and had been pilfered of parts for other planes. Louie once rode in the _Green Hornet_ for a brief moment and decided he never wanted to again.

On May 26, a nine-man crew took off in another B-24, piloted by Clarence Corpening. The next morning, Louie woke early to run. He asked a sergeant to pace him in a jeep and discovered he’d run a mile in 4:12 in the sand. He was in prime performance condition. After returning to his barracks, Louie learned that Corpening’s plane never reached its destination.

Phil and Louie were told to take the _Green Hornet_ on a rescue mission to find Corpening’s plane. Another pilot, Joe Deasy, would join them in the _Daisy Mae_. Louie left a note telling his fellow servicemen to drink his liquor if he didn’t come back, then headed out. The _Green Hornet_ ’s crew was ready to fly.

### Rescue Mission

Louie and his crew were given instructions to search a 200-mile circumference around the island of Palmyra, where Corpening’s plane was believed to have gone down. Louie and Phil were concerned about the _Green Hornet_. **Phil was wary of flying a plane he’d never flown before, Louie was worried about its immense weight.** There was also the issue of missing parts, and both hoped that nothing important had been removed.

Louie also checked to make sure survival provisions were on the plane. There was a supply box and two rafts onboard, as well as safety vests for the 11-man crew. Louie put his vest on as soon as he was on the plane.

The _Green Hornet_ and _Daisy Mae_ took off side by side, but because of the _Green Hornet_ ’s propensity for mushing, Louie’s plan fell behind. Phil told the _Daisy Mae_ crew to go ahead and soon lost sight of the companion plane.

During the search, Cuppernell asked to switch places with Phil, a common request during non-combat flights so copilots could gain experience. Shortly after Cuppernell took over, a crewman noticed one engine burning more fuel than those on the opposite side of the plane. Then, **the engine stopped, and the uneven distribution of power caused the _Green Hornet_ to dip to one side and sink**.

Feathering is a technique in which the side of the plane with the dead engine is turned toward the wind to cease propeller rotation. Feathering was the co-pilot’s job, but since Cuppernell was in the pilot seat and Phil was busy trying to keep the plane afloat, a new engineer was brought forward for the task.

On the control panel, each engine has a “feathering” button. The new engineer rushed into the cockpit, flipped open the plastic cover, and slammed down on one button. Unfortunately, he killed the working engine on the same side as the dead one. With maximum power on one side and no power on the other, the plane began to roll through the air. Phil tried to get the good engine started again, but there was no time. He told the crew, “Prepare to crash.”

**Louie jumped into action and commanded everyone to get into crash positions, then pulled out the life rafts.** Mac clutched the supply box. In the cockpit, Phil watched the ocean rising faster and faster toward them. As Louie watched the twirling sky out the window, his final thought before impact was that none of them would survive.

### On Death’s Door

The only sensation Louie felt was the downward pull of the ocean. The plane had burst apart on impact, and as pieces sank, Louie sank with them. **Louie tried to swim free, but he was stuck beneath a gun mount with cables wound around his body.**

With a bleeding head wound, Phil struggled to escape the sinking cockpit. He found an open window and, using his feet and all his strength, shoved himself free. When he reached the surface, he saw pieces of the wreckage and two empty lifeboats in the distance. There was no one else above water. He held onto a piece of the plane and waited.

Far below the surface, Louie continued to struggle against the wires that gripped him. The water pressure caused his ears to pop, and he felt a painful surge through his head and passed out. **When Louie regained consciousness, he was surrounded by blackness, but the wires trapping him were gone.**

Louie’s chest burned as he took in ocean water mixed with oil, gas, and blood. He figured out his bearings inside the sinking capsule, forced his way out, and pulled the engagement string on his life vest. The vest ballooned and pulled him upward. When he reached the surface, Louie swallowed fresh air greedily. He was alive.

### All Is Lost

The ocean surrounding Louie was littered with hunks of the _Green Hornet_. Somewhere nearby, he heard a whisper and turned to see Phil and Mac, without the supply box, clinging to part of the plane. A little ways away sat the lifeboats. Louie reached one raft, then paddled hard with the oar to reach the other. Louie bandaged up Phil’s head, then slid him into one raft. The last thing Phil did before he passed out was turn over command to Louie.

Louie turned his attention to their survival. He took an inventory of supplies on the rafts and found a handful of army-grade chocolate, specially designed to be bitter to curb the desire to consume large quantities. There were also tins of water, a flare gun, sea dye, fishing hooks, wire, two air pumps, patch kits, and a multipurpose tool.

The following year, all B-24 rafts would be upgraded with various life-saving supplies, such as camouflage sun tarps, a mast and sail, sunscreen, first-aid kits, a knife, scissors, compass, a radio transmitter, and other essentials. But in 1943, none of these items was among the B-24 supplies.

**Louie looked at their meager rations and knew their lives would be in jeopardy if they weren’t smart.** They were near the equator, and dehydration would set in quickly. He devised a plan in which each man would get two squares of chocolate and three sips of water a day. This plan was meant to keep them alive for several days, at which time, they should be rescued.

Mac was a zombie. He hadn’t said a word since getting into the raft, just completing Louie’s commands with a distant look in his eyes. With the provisions figured out, Louie had time to register pain throughout his body. What he didn’t know was that he’d broken all of his ribs on impact. He pushed the pain away, as he did thoughts of the other members of his crew.

Louie couldn’t help but think about the mysterious way he became free of the wires under the surface. But all thoughts were put on hold by the arrival of sharks. **Louie saw several sharks, some as long as twelve feet, circling the rafts, testing their strength by dragging their fins along the bottom fabric.** For now, the sharks seemed content to circle without striking.

As night settled, the temperature plummeted. The men were chilled to the bone, so they bailed water into the boats to be heated by their bodies. The only sound on the open water was that of teeth chattering. Phil was still unconscious, and Louie soon drifted to sleep. Only Mac was awake, stricken by fear.
