## Prologue: Lost

In June 1943, Louie Zamperini found himself lost at sea. He was on one of two inflatable rafts with two other American soldiers. They’d been stranded for 27 days and were dehydrated, malnourished, sun-beaten, and exhausted from the constant call to thwart the efforts of circling sharks. Although they didn’t know it, they’d drifted 1000 miles already across the vast sea and into Japanese territory.

Zamperini, 26 years old, was a world-class runner. Just months before, he’d been tapped to be the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. His body, once the grand specimen that competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, was now all but destroyed.

Suddenly, an aircraft flew above them. The three men scrambled to get the flight crew’s attention, hoping to be rescued. Instead, they found themselves under attack from a Japanese bomber.

The men dove overboard and used the raft as a shield. Bullets zoomed past, leaving contrails in the water. The onslaught stopped, and Louie and his mates climbed back into the rafts. But the plane returned a moment later and was heading straight for them. The other two men were too weak to swim again, but Louie went under. It was either the guns or the sharks, and he chose the sharks.
