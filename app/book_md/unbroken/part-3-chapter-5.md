## Part 3 | Chapter 5: Needle in a Haystack

On the island of Palmyra, the _Daisy Mae_ landed as the afternoon sun waned. Their search for Corpening’s plane had been unsuccessful. By early morning, the _Green Hornet_ was also declared missing. Between the two planes, twenty-one men were unaccounted for.

_Daisy Mae_ pilot Joe Deasy estimated that the _Green Hornet_ had likely gone down in a swath of ocean eight hundred miles long. However, because the currents in that part of the ocean converged from the east and west, it was difficult to predict which way the survivors would drift. Air Force planes, along with two Navy air crafts, commenced their search for Louie and his crew.

The next morning, Louie awoke to find Phil still weak in his raft and Mac still silent. When Louie opened the compartment to retrieve the provisions, the chocolate was gone. Louie was confused until he saw the guilty look on Mac’s face. Louie was livid, but he hid his anger, telling the sergeant he was disappointed in him but understood he had acted out of fear. **Their situation was more dire now without food, but Louie was sure they’d be found soon.**

A little while later, the sound of a plane overhead reached the raft. Louie shot a flare and dumped the dye into the water, but the plane continued without seeing either sign. Louie was defeated for more than one reason. Not only had the plane not seen them, but its trajectory told him where their lifeboats were in relation to Palmyra. They were floating west into enemy territory, and search planes would not search in enemy territory. If they weren’t found soon, their chances of rescue would diminish greatly.

Another day passed without rescue, then the sound of another plane was heard. Again, the plane flew away without seeing Louie’s distress signals. Louie didn’t know that the plane was the _Daisy Mae_ , and the crew hadn’t seen the rafts because of thick, low-hanging clouds.

**The only hope Louie had was to hit land, which wouldn’t happen for some two thousand miles in the direction they were drifting.** Even if they made it that far, they would land near the Marshall or Gilbert Islands, both of which were occupied by Japan.

### Wasting Away

Five days at sea without food and little water was beginning to take its toll. No other planes had appeared, and Mac finally cracked. He wailed around like a trapped animal, screaming that they were all going to die. Louie slapped him and Mac stopped shouting, but he returned to his catatonic state. Louie prayed silently for the second time in his life.

The lost men’s proximity to the equator created dangerous conditions during the scorching afternoons. Their bodies burned in the hot sun, their lips ballooned, and their skin cracked. They couldn’t get relief in the water because of the circling sharks, and there was nothing to drink.

Three days after the last of their water was consumed, a storm appeared on the horizon. Soon, the sun was shielded by clouds and rain poured down, providing a little relief. Louie made a funnel with the air pump canvas and filtered water into their tins. Once the rain stopped, the canvas proved to work as a hat. They made two hats and took turns wearing them once the sun reemerged.

**With the days at sea stretching on with no end in sight, Mac’s selfish consumption of the chocolate grew in significance.** Louie found it hard to hide his resentment, but he could see that Mac was stricken with guilt, so he let it slide. However, over the next weeks, starvation settled in, and the men were unable to turn their minds from food.

They survived by catching birds, eating the raw flesh, and using the rest as bait to catch fish. They never caught more than one or two tiny fish, but the meager ration was enough to give them energy and lift Louie’s and Phil’s spirits. Mac’s spirits could not be lifted.

The time between birds and fish was often long, leaving the men toiling for days. Intermittent rainstorms helped replenish their water supplies, but they always ran out before they could collect more. Days and weeks passed with no sounds other than the small ripples in the ocean.

**Louie and Phil knew it was not uncommon for men lost at sea to go insane, and they decided they had to do something to keep their minds strong.** They quizzed each other and told intricate stories about their pasts. Sometimes Phil sang church hymns, and Louie returned the favor by singing Christmas Carols.

Sometimes, they’d describe meals they’d enjoyed, detailing the ingredients, preparations, and flavors. Something about the detailed descriptions brought the food to life, especially when Louie described his mother’s cooking, and the brain was somehow tricked into satiation.

Talks also turned to the future, and Phil and Louie shared their plans for what they would do once they got back home. Talking about life after rescue filled Louie and Phil with hope, but Mac still lingered in darkness.**** He rarely shared stories and only spoke a few times, usually to ask Louie to describe his mother’s dishes.

Louie’s unruly determination as the terror of Torrance served him well on the raft. **As he had in the face of bullies, he turned his insolence about their current circumstances into a resolution to remain undefeated.**

### Enemy Attacks

The morning of the twenty-seventh day brought a sign of hope. The men became aware of rumbling in the sky and saw a plane flying overhead. Again, Louie fired two flares and sprinkled sea dye around their boat. Something marvelous happened. The plane made a loop and headed back in their direction. The men took off their shirts and waved them like flags above their heads.

Their joy only lasted a second. Within moments, a spray of bullets surrounded their rafts. The men lunged over the sides of the rafts and gathered underneath one. **Bullets whizzed through the floor of the boats, streaking past their submerged bodies.** When the firing stopped, the sharks came back, and it took every ounce of strength the emaciated men had to pull themselves back into the rafts, which were now slowly deflating from the bullet holes.

When the plane returned for a second pass, Louie saw the giant red circle of the Japanese flag painted on the side. The enemy bomber would make six passes in total. After the first attack, Phil and Mac were spent beyond movement and could do nothing but lay in the rafts and hope for the best while Louie jumped back into the water.

Underneath the raft, Louie pushed himself down beyond the point when the bullets lost their power, but this tactic brought other trouble. Through the dark water, Louie saw the mouth of a shark closing in. Louie made a threatening face and rammed his palm into the shark’s nose.

When the assault was finally over, Louie climbed into the raft to survey what was left of his companions. **Miraculously, despite the myriad of bullets shot at them, Phil and Mac had survived without a single wound.** The bullets had cut Phil’s raft in half, and the other raft was severely damaged. All three men now had to squeeze into one raft a little larger than a clawfoot bathtub.

The men’s troubles were far from over. The remaining raft was losing air quickly, causing part of it to submerge in the shark-infested waters. Something about the sinking raft gave the sharks more motivation. Where once they had merely surrounded the rafts, they now lunged above water trying to grab the men. Each man took turns knocking the sharks back with oars, but the movement caused the raft to deflate faster.

The process of fixing the boat was threefold. While Louie patched the holes, Mac and Phil took turns either pumping air or beating back sharks. **They worked through the night until they had patched enough holes and pumped enough air for the raft to float again and the sharks to stop attacking.** If one of the men had been lost during the crash or attack, they would not have had the manpower to recover.

### Salvation

Two good things came from the attack. The men were able to use the damaged raft as a sun shelter and blanket, and they had a better idea of where they were. Because the plane was Japanese, Phil reasoned they had drifted about halfway to the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. If they kept going at this pace, they’d likely see land after three more weeks.

Louie became resentful of the circling sharks. A few more had tried to attack them, and Louie decided to give them a taste of their own medicine. **Louie caught two small sharks and split the livers in three. For the first time since the morning they took off in the _Green Hornet_ , the men were full. **

The nourishment worked for a while, but days later, Mac began to deteriorate dramatically. Louie and Phil did what they could to keep him alive, but one night, Mac asked if Louie thought he was going to die. Louie wanted to give Mac a chance to say any final words and said he thought it likely and soon. But Mac didn’t say anything else. Before the morning of Day 33 would come, Mac would release his last breath.

Although Mac had originally put the men in a perilous state, his help on the rafts had been immeasurable. Louie and Phil held an impromptu service over Mac’s body before sliding him into the water. **The next day, without realizing it, Louie and Phil surpassed the record for survival at sea.**

With only two of them, there was more room and more rations to go around when they had some. But even with the extra water and bits of food, Louie and Phil continued to suffer. They were skin and bones, covered in sores, and dying from starvation.

Then, one morning, everything changed. Upon waking, Louie and Phil felt the stillness of the raft, as though stationary on land, and looked around to see a world bathed in placid blue from top to bottom. They had drifted into the doldrums, the colloquial sailor term for the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a swath of ocean near the equator where winds from the north and south converge, creating an intense stillness.

The silence and reflection of the sky on the mirror-like surface of the water transcended reality and brought a sense of peace to both men. **Louie felt they had been provided a mystical gift in the midst of what had seemed like certain death.** It was an auspicious moment, and the two soaked in the essence of that timeless space until sunset.

### Hope

Days passed without any sustenance for the men, and the raft was becoming as ravaged as their bodies. Phil began to see swarms of birds in the distance, but as the sounds crossed the open water, he realized they were planes. There was no doubt the planes belonged to the Japanese, but they were too far away to be of concern.

Then, on July 13, forty-six days into their journey, a great storm swooped in and created massive waves. **The waves lifted the raft high into the air, allowing the men to glimpse a landmass far off in the horizon.** As the waves moved them forward, the men discussed strategies for how to navigate their arrival into enemy territory. They would row toward the islands and scope out an uninhabited area. They pulled out the oars and started their journey toward land.

Suddenly, the great storm turned into a typhoon. The waves grew to immense proportions and tossed the raft like a plastic bottle. Louie and Phil laid flat to maintain a center of gravity, and Louie tied the raft’s rope around their bodies to keep from losing it if they capsized. Both men were more scared than they had been when the _Green Hornet_ went down.

In the pre-dawn hours, the storm ceased, and the water smoothed out. It was still dark, but Louie smelled something he hadn’t smelled in a long time—the earthy aroma of land. As the sun rose, the men saw that they’d been pushed up to the boundary of the island, which was now several small islands. They forced their shoes on and rowed toward the valley between two.

Before long, Louie saw a ship heading in their direction. The men tried to row out of sight, but it was too late. **The boat pulled up next to the raft, and Louie and Phil found themselves caught in the crossfires of several guns held by Japanese soldiers.**
