## Exercise: Set a Positive Expectation

A big idea of _The Expectation Effect_ is that our expectations become our reality. That can be a positive thing or a negative thing, and one advantage of learning how expectation effects influence you is you gain the ability to reframe negative expectations as positive ones.

* * *

First, think about one way that you’re setting a negative expectation that your brain turns into reality. (Maybe you’re pessimistic about your ability to stay focused through the afternoon slump, or you think that a salad can’t possibly be a satisfying lunch.) Write down your negative expectation here.

Next, consider how you can reframe your expectation. What can you tell yourself the next time you’re in that situation to create a more positive reality? Write down your positive expectation here.

Think about how this shift in expectations might change the outcome. (Would being more confident about your self-control and focus make you more productive at work? Would having higher expectations about your healthy lunch make that salad more enjoyable?) Write down the change you anticipate.
