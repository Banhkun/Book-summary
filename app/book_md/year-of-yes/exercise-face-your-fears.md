## Exercise: Face Your Fears

At the heart of Rhimes’s year-long, transformational experiment was her commitment to start facing her fears instead of avoiding them. This exercise will help you clarify what _you_ tend to avoid in life and how you might begin to push yourself out of your comfort zone.

* * *

Reflect on the last month or two—did any opportunities or invitations come your way that you said “no” to right away? If so, what excuse did you make at the time for not taking those opportunities?

Identify one thing you frequently or always say “no” to and write down the usual excuse you give to avoid it. Why do you _really_ avoid this thing? Try to understand the emotions behind your avoidance and write about them.

Imagine what it would be like if you said “yes” to the thing you wrote about in the previous question. What are the worst and best possible outcomes?

How might you use the takeaways from Rhimes’s year to say “yes” to the opportunity or invitation next time it’s presented to you?
