### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Random House

_The Power of Habit_ was published in 2012. It’s Duhigg’s most popular book—it spent more than 60 weeks on the _New York Times_ bestseller list. It has since been translated into more than 40 languages.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

Habits play an important role in our lives. That’s why people are always looking for ways to break bad habits and implement good ones. Consequently, the self-help market is saturated with books that provide productive methods for changing habits in various contexts—personal, professional, financial, creative, and so on. Some of the most popular habit-focused books include:

  * _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear: Offers a four-step process to effectively break bad habits and adopt new ones
  * _The Creative Habit_ , Twyla Tharp: Presents strategies for implementing creative pursuits into your daily routine
  * _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard: Defines the six habits you need to excel in every area of your life
  * _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Stephen R. Covey: Discusses how to prioritize your time, focus your actions, and build relationships to achieve personal and professional success
  * _Tiny Habits_ , BJ Fogg: Demonstrates the power of applying small incremental changes to your routine to create positive improvements in your life



While the majority of books on improving habits discuss what types of habits are beneficial before walking you through specific methods and exercises to implement change, _The Power of Habit_ takes a more theoretical approach. Duhigg argues that the more you understand the nature and influence of habits, the more power you have to change them. Therefore, instead of offering advice on which habits to implement and following up with _how-to_ methods for changing habits, he focuses more on explaining _why_ you rely on habits and how they influence you personally, professionally, and socially.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_The Power of Habit_ enjoys excellent feedback—many reviewers comment that they’ve successfully changed their habits since reading the book. These reviewers find the case studies that Duhigg uses to illustrate his discussion well-written, highly relevant, and engaging.

However, some reviewers hold a contrasting view, commenting that the case studies are irrelevant and laborious to read. Since these studies take up the bulk of the book, these reviewers don’t appreciate having to sift through the “overly-long” examples to find the practical methods they’re searching for.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach and Organization

Each chapter in _The Power of Habit_ focuses on the central argument that habits can be changed if you understand how they work. Duhigg draws on extensive research—academic studies and interviews with scientists and executives—to explore how habits develop into automatic behaviors that influence personal lives, businesses, and communities.

Duhigg tackles these topics in three parts: In the first part, he presents neurological research to explain how habits form and eventually turn into automatic behaviors. In the second part, he explores case studies of various companies to examine how managers can instill productive habits to transform any organization. In the third part, he illustrates how various social movements succeeded by changing ingrained social habits to influence communities and create momentum for their cause.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve extracted Duhigg’s key ideas and restructured them to focus on how your habits form and what you can do to change them. We’ve organized the material into four parts:

  * **Part 1: Habits Are Automatic Patterns of Behavior** explains how your brain’s tendency to rely on automatic routines encourages you to engage in habits without consciously thinking about them.
  * **Part 2: The Anatomy of Habits** breaks habits down into their individual components and clarifies how cravings reinforce your habits.
  * **Part 3: How Habits Influence Individuals, Businesses, and Communities** discusses how advertisers play on your habits to sway your buying decisions. It also examines the influence of collective habits on businesses and communities.
  * **Part 4: How to Change Your Habits** provides actionable steps you can take to redesign your current habits or introduce entirely new habits.



Additionally, we compare and contrast each key concept with up-to-date research on habit formation. We also expand on Duhigg’s advice with actionable methods from other self-improvement authors and psychologists.
