## Exercise: Identify Your Habit

Apply what you’ve learned about the components of a habit to develop awareness around the habits you want to break.

* * *

What is a bad habit that you want to stop? How often do you engage in this habit?

A cue is a trigger that kicks off the habit. What’s the cue for your bad habit? (For example, “When I open the fridge after work, I always grab a beer.” Opening the fridge is your cue.)

The cue kicks off a craving and makes you anticipate the reward. What does the craving feel like? What reward do you want? (For example, you crave something refreshing and relaxing—you want something that helps you unwind at the end of a long day.)

To get your reward, you act out a routine. What’s the routine you take to get your reward? Write out every specific step from beginning to end. Include the steps that don't seem important to you.
