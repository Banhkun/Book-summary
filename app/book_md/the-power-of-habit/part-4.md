## Part 4: How to Change Your Habits

In the second part of this guide, we discussed the three elements of a habit (cue, routine, and reward) and explained how cravings, coupled with your brain’s reliance on automatic routines, compel you to engage in your habits automatically. This information raises an important question: If habits are so strongly wired within you that you act automatically when confronted with a cue, are you responsible for your actions? According to Duhigg, **if you’re aware of your habits, then you are responsible for them**.

(Shortform note: Mark Manson (_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_) adds weight to Duhigg’s argument that you’re responsible for your habits by explaining how your level of accountability impacts your overall well-being. He claims that acknowledging your role in your behaviors (by recognizing that you’re always choosing your responses to your experiences) empowers you to make conscious choices that benefit your overall well-being. On the other hand, ignoring your role in your behaviors (by believing that your habits are too deeply ingrained to change) disempowers you from making choices that’ll ultimately improve your well-being.)

Duhigg argues that, while you can’t delete these unwanted patterns from your mind, through self-awareness and conscious control, you can override them with new automatic patterns that align with the habits you do want to practice. (Shortform note: Recall: Neuroscientists confirm that it’s possible to weaken these permanent patterns so that your brain no longer relies on them.)

In this final part of the guide, we’ll explore how you can apply this understanding to deliberately and permanently redesign your habits.

### Change an Existing Bad Habit

According to Duhigg, once you understand the cues and cravings that drive your habits, you’ll gain conscious control over the behavioral pattern you engage in. This allows you to disrupt your unwanted habit and override it with a new, more productive behavioral pattern. However, **the cues and cravings that fuel your habits aren’t always as obvious as they appear to be**. This is because the longer you engage in a habit, the less aware you become of the specific cravings that motivate your habit.

For example, if you smoke cigarettes, you may assume that this habit is fueled by your craving for nicotine. However, depending on when and where you engage in this habit, you could be motivated by a number of different cravings such as wanting to take a break from your work, the urge to engage in social interactions, or the need for a change of scenery.

> **Mindfulness Helps to Uncover the Root Cause of Your Habits**
> 
> Mindfulness experts agree that you’re often unaware of the specific cues and cravings that drive your habits. However, they argue that **your _emotions_ are the cause of your habits** because they make you susceptible to cues and cravings. They explain that you’re often triggered by an emotional feeling that you seek to alleviate through the use of your habit. For example, if you smoke cigarettes, you're more likely to notice your cues (for example, the smell of tobacco or the lighter on your desk) and give in to your cravings when you feel uncomfortable emotions such as fear or feelings of anxiety.
> 
> However, while engaging in the habit does provide temporary relief, it doesn’t fix the root of the problem—the uncomfortable feeling that you’re trying to overcome. Consequently, it’s necessary to examine the root cause (your emotions) of the habits you seek to change before you attempt to change them.
> 
> According to these experts, there are four main categories of habits that come from underlying negative emotions:
> 
>   * Habits of **wanting** involve cravings and addictions that you rely on to feel better.
> 
>   * Habits of **distraction** include what you do when you’re trying to avoid what you’re feeling or experiencing.
> 
>   * Habits of **resistance** show up as negative reactions to what you’re experiencing, such as impatience, anger, or judgment. They’re an attempt to protect yourself from what you’re feeling.
> 
>   * Habits of **doing** focus on keeping busy in an attempt to feel like you’re in control.
> 
> 

> 
> In addition to experimenting with the cues and rewards as Duhigg suggests, become mindful of the _type_ of habit you’re engaging in and its likely emotional trigger to give yourself a better chance of successfully changing your habits.

Duhigg claims that all successful habit changes begin with a process of experimentation to uncover the specific cues and rewards that drive your habits. He suggests that you follow a four-step process that relies on identifying your routine and experimenting with different rewards so that you can effectively isolate your cue and understand why you engage in your habits. This process will help you to plan effective ways to disrupt and replace the automatic patterns that fuel your habit. Let’s explore the process in detail.

#### Step 1: Write Down Your Habit-Driven Routine

The routine is the automatic behavior pattern that surrounds the habit you want to change. Duhigg suggests that you detail every step of the routine from beginning to end, even the steps you think aren’t important.

For example, you work from home and have a habit of drinking too much coffee. You want to change this because you’re having problems sleeping at night. Your entire routine might look like this: You get up from the desk, walk to the kitchen, put on the coffee machine, play with your dog in the garden for a few minutes, take a bathroom break, make your coffee, and then go back to your desk and drink your coffee.

(Shortform note: Not all habits have a clear-cut routine like the one described above, especially if they’re emotional rather than behavioral. For example, if you habitually feel anxious before you need to drive somewhere, it’s easy to pinpoint driving as a high-anxiety situation. However, you may feel low-level anxiety throughout your day in a number of other situations. This makes it difficult to define a specific start and endpoint for the routine that surrounds your habitual anxiety. In _The Craving Mind_ , neuroscientist Dr. Judson Brewer suggests building self-awareness through mindfulness techniques such as meditation to help develop conscious awareness of the specific routines around your emotional habits.)

#### Step 2: Switch Out Rewards to Discover Your Craving

During this step, Duhigg suggests that each time you recognize that you’re about to engage in your habit, avoid acting out the automatic routine. **Instead,** **change the routine so that it has a new reward**. This will help you to figure out what part of your routine you’re truly craving. Is it the reward you’ve habitually turned to, or is it something else?

Each time you perform this experiment with a new reward, **write down the first three words that come to mind** —this will encourage you to consciously acknowledge your thoughts and feelings (for instance, are you still feeling unsettled and like your craving is unfulfilled?). Then, set an alarm for 15 minutes and, when it goes off, ask yourself whether you still feel the craving. If you’re not, your new reward satisfies your true craving—and you can discover what that craving is by considering what need the reward fulfills.

(Shortform note: According to Gretchen Rubin, author of _The Happiness Project_ , Duhigg’s method of changing the routine and adding a new reward forces your brain to step out of autopilot mode and increases your awareness of how you feel. This process, coupled with writing down three words, encourages you to think about why you’re engaging in your habit, the feelings you’re chasing or trying to avoid, and your justifications for sticking with this habit. This awareness makes it much easier for you to avoid falling into your habitual routines.)

Let’s explore how you could change the reward and complete this step for the coffee-drinking habit outlined in Step 1.

| **Experiment 1** | **Experiment 2** | **Experiment 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Reward** | Eat a cookie.  | Drink some water.  | Play with your dog and drink some water.   
**New routine (instead of drinking coffee)** | You grab a cookie and take it back to your desk.  | You take a glass of water back to your desk.  | You play with your dog for a few extra minutes and take a glass of water back to your desk.   
**Three notes** | Yuk, tired, guilty  | Bored, fed up, gggrrrr  | Good, funny, clear   
**Does the craving still exist?** | Something’s missing.  | You want to get up from your desk but are not sure if you want coffee.  | You forgot about the coffee.   
  
It turns out you just wanted to relax, forget about work, and give your dog some affection: You didn’t really crave the coffee itself.

Obviously, this example simplifies the process. Figuring out what cravings fuel your habits could take multiple experiments over the course of many weeks. Duhigg suggests that you continue to perform these experiments until you find a new routine that feels satisfying to you.

> **Substitute Rewards Can Have Negative Side Effects**
> 
> Many addiction therapists recommend Duhigg’s strategy to simply replace the reward that you’re craving. However, some therapists believe that this method can have negative side effects, especially **when you focus more on _avoiding_ the habit you seek to change and less on what type of habit you replace it with**. They explain that when you deny yourself the reward that you’re craving, you feel like something’s missing. You attempt to fill this void by taking on unproductive habits that induce the same dopamine high. This explains why ex-smokers often turn to overeating, ex-alcoholics turn to marijuana, or ex-binge-eaters turn to shopping.
> 
> Further, therapists warn that even positive substitutions such as exercise or work can have negative effects if you develop unhealthy compulsive behaviors as a means to maintain your dopamine high. They suggest that learning how to manage the thoughts and feelings that underlie your cravings empowers you to make beneficial decisions, and prevents you from lapsing into substitute habits that may do more harm than good.

#### Step 3: Use Categories to Identify Your Cue

The purpose of this step is to figure out exactly what’s triggering you to engage in your habit. Since you’re exposed to so much information and stimuli at any given time, it might be hard to narrow this down. However, Duhigg claims that **all cues fit into one of five categories** : location, time, emotional state, other people, and what’s happening immediately before you engage in the habit. Consequently, he argues that you can isolate the cue to your habit by asking yourself the following questions the next time you feel a craving:

  1. Where are you?
  2. What time is it?
  3. What’s your emotional state?
  4. Who else is around?
  5. What just happened?



Continuing with the coffee example, after asking yourself these questions during the course of a week, you discover that your coffee cravings commonly occur when you’ve been sitting at your desk for over 90 minutes, feel bored, and have difficulty concentrating.

> **Not All Habits Have a Clear Cause and Effect Relationship**
> 
> Duhigg’s method of categorizing cues into five categories seems to work well for habits that have a clear cause and effect relationship: for example, smokers who only smoke when taking a break from work or when out with friends, or shoppers who only make purchases on their lunch breaks. These habits play out at specific times or in particular locations and it’s relatively simple to identify their triggers.
> 
> However, it may seem that Duhigg’s method doesn’t work so well for the habits that people compulsively engage in throughout the day, such as chain-smoking, constant snacking, nail-biting, or anxious thinking. It’s difficult to track and correlate the causes of something you unconsciously engage in.
> 
> But psychologists argue that, at their root, these compulsive behaviors are an attempt to relieve underlying anxieties or other negative emotions. Consequently, they argue that all of Duhigg’s categories help you to track the impact of different situations and people on your emotional state, providing clues about _why_ you feel like you need to engage in your habit.
> 
> For compulsive habits, carry a pen and a small notebook pre-filled with Duhigg’s five questions—or install a habit-tracking app on your phone—so that whenever you catch yourself engaging in your habit, you can immediately take note of what’s happening around you and how it makes you feel. While you may not catch every instance of the habit, the details you do end up tracking will help you to develop conscious awareness of how your cravings fluctuate. This will make it easier to disentangle the subtle cues that trigger your habit.

#### Step 4: Head Off Temptation

Once you’ve completed your experiments and defined the cue, routine, and reward components of your habit, Duhigg suggests that you make a plan to overcome any temptations you might feel to give in to your old cravings. This involves designing your cues to trigger new behavioral routines and cravings for the new reward to come—it could be as simple as removing the cue that triggers your cravings.

For example, you now know that you’re most likely to crave coffee when you’ve been sitting at your desk for over 90 minutes and have difficulty concentrating. You also know that playing with your dog and drinking a glass of water fulfills your need to take a break in the same way that drinking coffee did. Consequently, your plan involves setting a timer every 90 minutes so that you can regularly take breaks to play with your dog and drink water.

(Shortform note: James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) adds to Duhigg’s approach by suggesting that you not only _remove_ the cues for your unwanted habits but also _add_ cues for your new habits. He explains that an effective plan involves shaping the visual cues within your environment to encourage only the new habits you seek to adopt. Visual cues are the biggest instigators for action because they trick your brain into thinking that it’s more convenient to act on them—it’s convenient to drink water when there’s a glass of water on your desk. Consequently, for the coffee example, Clear’s plan would involve removing all cues related to coffee (your mug, French press, or coffee machine) and replacing them with a jug of water, a glass, and dog toys.)

**With repetition, you’ll eventually create an entirely new automatic habit** : The timer (cue) will signal that you’re about to receive a reward (playing with your dog, drinking water) and this will encourage you to engage in this new routine. Eventually, the timer and your new reward will become inextricably linked to create a new craving. As a result, this routine will become automatic, and your new habit will replace your old habit (drinking coffee).

(Shortform note: According to James Clear (_Atomic Habits_), your desired habits can only become automatic and replace your unwanted habits if you practice them at a rate of frequency that either matches or exceeds the rate you engaged in the habits you’re trying to replace. He explains that your current habits were formed from multiple repetitions over the course of many months or years. Every repetition strengthened the neural pathways underlying this habit and ingrained the automatic routine deeper into your brain. To weaken your brain’s reliance on the unwanted habit, you must repeat your new habit as frequently as possible to develop neural pathways that are just as strong.)

### Start a Ripple Effect by Changing One Core Habit

Now that you understand how habits develop and what you need to do to replace them with new habits, let’s examine how shifting just one habit can positively influence many of your other habits.

You may feel tempted to use the four-step process to tackle multiple habits and overhaul your life. Duhigg says that addressing and managing multiple automatic routines will be difficult and, as a result, likely end in failure. Instead, he recommends an easier way to change all of your habits: **Leverage one core habit**. According to Duhigg, when you feel the benefits of changing one core habit, you start a chain reaction that encourages you to change other existing habits or develop additional good habits. In other words, **the rewards you feel from successfully changing this habit influence you to restructure the rest of your habits**.

> **Each Positive Decision Sets Into Motion a Series of Subsequent Positive Decisions**
> 
> Like Duhigg, Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) argues that making one beneficial change in your daily routine sets into motion a series of beneficial decisions and habits that ultimately improve your entire life. He explains that if you try to tackle all of your habits at the same time, you’re more likely to focus on how difficult it is, feel overwhelmed, and resign yourself to staying in the same situation.
> 
> On the other hand, committing to change a single habit allows you to effectively focus your energy and produce successful results. These positive results naturally encourage you to feel more confident about your ability to take control of your behaviors, and they motivate you to improve all of your habits so that you can continue to feel good about yourself.

#### An Example of How Changing One Core Habit Influences Many Habits

Let’s demonstrate how changing one core habit can influence many of your other habits.

Your morning routine is stressful: You don’t have time for breakfast, you can’t find anything clean to wear, you often struggle to get to work on time, you indulge in sweet drinks and snacks to curb your appetite, and then you waste your money on expensive and fatty lunches to see you through the rest of your workday. You come home to an empty fridge, order pizza, and binge-watch TV until you pass out on the couch.

The example above illustrates many unhealthy habits. Let’s apply Duhigg’s theory and explore how changing one habit in your evening routine can have a domino effect on all of your other habits.

In the evening, instead of watching TV, you prepare everything you need for the morning (this is your new core habit): breakfast, outfit, a packed lunch, and car keys. Without the TV to keep you up, you get to bed on time and set your alarm for the morning. When you wake up, you find it easy to get ready and get to work ahead of time. Since you had breakfast, you don’t feel the urge to snack. You eat your packed lunch and use the rest of your lunch break to buy some groceries to take home. You get home and make yourself a healthy meal.

This example is a very simple one but it does demonstrate how changing one habit can create an environment for more healthy habits to thrive. The benefits you feel from changing one core habit motivate you to practice more self-awareness and conscious control over your other habits. As a result, **you naturally feel more motivated to change your other habits** so that you can continue to enjoy the benefits of changing your core habit.

> **Small Steps Overcome Your Mind’s Resistance to Change**
> 
> While it’s true that changing one habit gives you the confidence and motivation to change other habits, this process is not going to work overnight. This is because your brain doesn’t _want_ to have to work hard to overwrite your automatic patterns. It’s going to offer resistance when you first try to change your automatic routines—this resistance may show up as laziness, boredom, or simple forgetfulness.
> 
> So how can you get past this resistance so that you can effectively change your habits and produce the results that you want? In _The Kaizen Way_ , psychologist Rober Maurer claims that you’re more likely to make successful changes if you take very _small but regular_ steps toward the large goal you intend to achieve. This is because small changes are more likely to bypass your brain’s instinctive reaction to resist new behavioral changes. Therefore, consider what small achievable steps you can easily take to improve your core habit.
> 
> In the example above, this may be as simple as leaving your car keys by the door for the first few days. Once this small habit becomes automatic, consider adding the step of preparing your outfit the night before. Again, wait for this to become automatic before adding another improvement. This method will allow you to easily and permanently set positive habit changes into motion without facing mental resistance.

### Create an Entirely New Habit

We’ve just discussed how you can deconstruct your _existing_ habits to understand and replace them with new productive habits. Duhigg claims that you can also apply your understanding of how cues, routines, and rewards underlie habitual behaviors to create _entirely new_ habits.

Let’s explore how to apply this understanding to develop the new habit of walking for an hour every morning:

**Decide upon your cue and your reward** : Duhigg claims that new habits require a clearly defined cue and a reward to become automatic routines. Decide on a cue to signal the start of your habit, such as leaving your walking boots where you can see them. Then decide what your reward is, such as listening to an audiobook you enjoy during your walk, or treating yourself to a cup of hot chocolate when you get back.

(Shortform note: James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) argues that the easiest way to implement this step is to specifically link your new cue and reward to an existing routine. This way, you’ve already completed the hardest part of your new habit—determining the cue and reward—and you simply have to follow through with your intended action. For example, you decide that after brushing your teeth, you’ll put on your walking boots and head out. When you come back, your reward will be to eat breakfast and read a chapter of your book. Because you already brush your teeth, eat breakfast, and read a chapter of your book every morning, it’s easy to link your new habit to the cues and rewards in your existing routine.)

**Develop a craving for your reward** : According to Duhigg, the more positive you feel about your reward, the more likely your brain will want to set up an automatic routine to support your new habit. Duhigg suggests that you find ways to actively develop a craving for your reward—visualizing, anticipating, or imagining this reward.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins expands upon Duhigg’s claim that your reward must _feel_ positive by arguing that **neuro-associations—the way your brain links certain experiences with pain and others with pleasure—influence all of your habits**. According to Robbins, your brain relies on these neuro-associations to direct your behavior _toward feeling pleasure_ and _away from feeling pain_ , and you have to reprogram these associations to create new automatic routines. So, your brain’s more likely to create an automatic routine for your new habit of walking if you remove all pain points from the routine and set it up to feel as pleasurable as possible.)

**Make a plan to overcome obstacles** : You might feel reluctant to go for your morning walk for a number of reasons, such as if you feel tired or if it’s raining outside. Duhigg claims that you’re more likely to stick to your new habits if you predict these obstacles and plan ways to reduce your reluctance. For example, you could go to bed earlier so that you don’t feel tired or invest in a good raincoat and walking boots so that you can go out in any weather.

(Shortform note:**** Brendon Burchard (_High Performance Habits_) claims that the tendency to focus on obstacles and limitations occurs when you don’t have a clear _purpose_ for your actions. This causes you to focus too much on the difficulty of overcoming your present circumstances (unwanted habits) to look to the future (the benefits of your new habits). Burchard encourages you to focus on your purpose—what you’ll gain from overcoming your obstacles—and use this to motivate yourself to move forward with your new habit.)

### Believe That You Can Change Your Habits

Now that you understand how to redesign your habits, let’s discuss how believing in your ability to change improves your chances of successfully changing any habit.

Duhigg argues that **belief is an essential part of overcoming your cravings and permanently changing any habit**. Sometimes your cravings will feel unbearable and you’ll want to fall back into your old habits. During these times, it’s critical to believe that you can overcome your cravings and consciously decide how you want to act.

> **Unrealistic Beliefs Set You Up for Failure**
> 
> The idea that self-belief improves your chances of success is not new—numerous studies prove that positive expectations encourage you to rise above any limitations you face and focus on solutions that move you toward what you want. However, psychologists warn that **unrealistic positive expectations** —such as blindly believing that you’ll easily overcome your habits without effort—set you up for failure because they don’t prepare you to take proactive steps to counter the inevitable obstacles that you’ll face. On the other hand, **realistic positive expectations acknowledge that the road to change requires effort and persistence**. This attitude forces you to take a proactive approach towards making the changes that you want.
> 
> For example, a weight loss study discovered that participants who believed that they’d _easily_ succeed lost considerably _less_ weight than those who prepared themselves for potential challenges. The “easy” group failed to honestly assess challenges such as their cravings for unhealthy snacks or their tendency to find excuses to avoid exercising. Consequently, they weren’t prepared enough to overcome and replace the habits that led them to gain weight in the first place.

One way to bolster your belief in your ability to change your habits is to engage with people who have successfully overcome the same cravings. According to Duhigg, hearing the stories and strategies of people who have successfully changed their habits will increase your confidence and inspire you to stick with your decision to change. Therefore, consider how you can surround yourself with people who can help you stick to your plan.

(Shortform note: We’ve already established how social habits impact individual beliefs and habits. Interestingly, the reverse is also true. Sociologist Nicholas Christakis cites various research studies on smoking, drinking, obesity, divorce, and altruism to explain how individual habits impact social beliefs and habits just as much as social habits impact individual beliefs and habits. He explains that not only do you forge relationships with people who are like you, but also that your behavior spreads to friends, friends of friends, and so on. This eventually influences what complete strangers think of as normal. Consequently, you’re both _vulnerable_ to the influence of social habits, and you have the _power_ to influence the social habits of others.)
