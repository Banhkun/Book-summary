## Exercise: Rewire Your Habit

Experimenting with rewards will help you to redesign the habits you want to change.

* * *

To review the previous exercise, write down the cue, routine, and reward for a habit you want to change.

What other rewards might you be seeking in your current habit, beyond the one you initially identified? (For example, if you have a craving for cookies, you might be seeking emotional comfort rather than a sugar high.)

To change a habit, keep the same cue and the same reward, but change the routine. What new routine can you easily implement to get the same underlying reward that you identified above?
