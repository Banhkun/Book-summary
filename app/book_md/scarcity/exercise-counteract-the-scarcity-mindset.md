## Exercise: Counteract the Scarcity Mindset

Now that you’ve identified ways in which the scarcity mindset might be impacting your life, here’s an exercise to plan how to counteract the negative effects of your bandwidth shortage.

* * *

One of Mullainathan and Shafir’s recommendations is to create helpful reminders ahead of time to disrupt the narrow focus that scarcity creates. Write down when you need reminders the most. For example, do you need reminders to tell you when to shift tasks, to let you know when you’re overspending, or to remind you of appointments?

Write down a plan to ensure that the reminder you described above actively enters your consciousness when you need it the most. You can do this by creating recurring alarms on your phone, using a budgeting app, or getting another person to help hold you accountable.

The authors also recommend creating buffers of time or money to mitigate the negative effects of scarcity. Write a plan to create your own buffers, even if you don’t feel like you have a lot to spare. For example, you could block out an hour each workday to account for distractions and unexpected interruptions, or you could make a plan to automatically transfer a certain amount of money to your savings account each month.
