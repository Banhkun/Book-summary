## Exercise: Identify How Scarcity Affects You

Remember Mullainathan and Shafir’s definition of scarcity: the _feeling_ of having less than we need. Regardless of how much money you have or what’s on your to-do list, _everyone_ is prone to experiencing scarcity in some form or another, and everyone is impacted by the bandwidth shortage it causes.

What scarcity distracts you the most in your day-to-day activities? When do you notice your mind automatically circling back to scarcity-related thoughts?

Describe one instance when that scarcity caused you to neglect something else that you care about. For example, think of a scenario when a scarcity of time or money caused you to miss out on time with loved ones or prevented you from being fully present.

Describe an example of when the scarce resource caused you to engage in a form of borrowing that made the scarcity worse. For example, did you procrastinate on important tasks or borrow money that you couldn’t pay back later?

What were the long-term consequences of the scenarios you described above? How did they impact your relationships, productivity, or physical and mental health?
