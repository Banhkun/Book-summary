## Chapter 11: The Use of Weapons

Weapons are not relegated to guns, tanks, and ammunition. A weapon is any physical element that assists in battle.

### Fire Attacks

**Fire attacks come in five forms: burning people, burning provisions, burning tools, burning storage facilities, and burning arms.** The use of fire should be rational and for a purpose.

**Use fire not to destroy but to create opportunities.** The use of fire should be to cause a disruption or vulnerability in your enemy or confuse them. When using fire attacks, the strategy is to follow-up swiftly to take advantage of the mayhem caused.

  * Once the fire is raging, itâ€™s time to attack.
  * When the fire has died down and people are back in control, the window for attack is closed. 



Understanding when to set a fire means understanding the essential conditions for fire. Even if you would prefer to use fire in a different way, if the opportunity presents itself and conditions are right, take advantage.

  * Fire is best set when the conditions are dry and windy, thereby allowing nature to help the fire grow.
  * If you set a fire upwind, attack upwind. 
  * Do not put your troops in the line of fire. 
  * Do not go rogue and set fires when the conditions are not favorable.
  * Know how to safeguard against a fire attack by using the weather patterns as guides. 



### Arms

The use of arms should be considered carefully and only when all other tactics have been exhausted. **The main goal of conflict is to avoid direct battle and defeat.**

Only mobilize armed forces when there is no choice but to do so. Do not allow anger, pride, or petty grievances to guide your decisions.

Only go to battle when it is advantageous or easy to do so. If it is not, do not advance.

Emotions are malleable. They come and go with the seasons. But a broken nation cannot be rebuilt to its former self, and the dead cannot be resurrected. Remember these solemn truths when deciding whether or not to use arms.
