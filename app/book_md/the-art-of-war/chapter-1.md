## Chapter 1: General Overview of Conflict

Military action encompasses the health of an entire nation, as the success or failure of the action balances life and death. Because of this importance, **military conflict should be examined thoroughly before any action is taken**.

These examinations should happen on home ground and involve **five basic assessments: the Way, the weather, the terrain, the leadership, and discipline**.

### Five Traits of Successful Military Action

**_The Way_** describes the harmonious relationship between the government and civilian populace. When the government treats its people with kindness and concern, the people are more apt to support government agendas and be loyal.

  * This loyalty translates to support of military strategy and the willingness of those tapped to participate in the conflict. 



To ensure success on the battlefield, **generating support at home is vital**. You gain trust in leadership when you treat all people equally, rules are clear and balanced, and punishment is just and distributed consistently and equally.

When support is strong at home, amassing a strong force becomes easier. However, the Way is also essential within the troops.

  * **You ensure compliance when rules and commands are valid and well-articulated**. 
  * You foster respect and harmony among your subordinates when the varied roles within the rank hierarchy are articulated clearly and managed justly. 
  * Subordinates and superiors stand together under the same cause and are courageous in defending it when the Way is strong among the troops.



**_The Weather_** regards the appropriate season for battle. Leading a surge or entering a conflict in winter and summer can create unfavorable natural circumstances. Severe weather, such as blizzards or droughts, can stymie your troops through illness, other weather-related maladies, and depletion. Supplies can be compromised in inclement weather, as well.

**_The Terrain_ **can be understood as “the lay of the land.” Geographical factors to consider include distance to be traversed, type of terrain and accompanying effort required to cross it, land size, and degrees of security or harm encompassed in the environment.

  * Once these elements are known, you can **accurately determine the best strategies to approach the land**. 



**_The Leadership_** relates to the constitution of leaders and how it affects their ability to command successfully. **A good leader should display the combined qualities of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and sternness.**

  * Depending on one quality over another or dismissing one completely creates a broken link in the leader’s ability to be effective. 



**_Discipline_** means the level of structure and organization within the ranks. How troops and officials are organized is as important as material preparations, such as supplies and weapons, for the success of military action.

  * **Both soldiers and leaders need to be disciplined in their training**. 
  * If either is not prepared sufficiently, fear and confusion on the battlefield are likely. 



### Using Knowledge to Gain Advantage

**First, you should assess these five traits regarding _your_ forces.** Then, **assess these five traits for your opponent** to size up the competition.

  * If you understand both your strengths and efficiency and those of your enemy, you can realistically compare the two and predict the likelihood of victory during conflicts.
  * **You should prepare to enter into conflict only when the outcome shows the likelihood of success for your side**. 



Many leaders are aware of these advantageous traits, but only those who incorporate them into their leadership practices will succeed.

  * For instance, if you know your opponent is a savage leader, their relationship with the civilian population will likely include discord.
  * If there is discord between civilians and leadership, there may be a lack of support for your opponent’s actions. 
  * This type of discontinuity can expose vulnerabilities in their tactics, which provides you with opportunities to attack. 



### Assessments and Advantages in Battle Strategy

**The key to any successful battle strategy is the assessment of the five traits so as to know yourself and your opponent fully.** You must be willing to be pliable and adapt, when necessary, based on the information generated by this assessment.

**Strategy should be developed as a consequence of advantage.** A course of action that is not pliable will fail because the strategy cannot adapt to new events. A leader must assess each event that occurs and take advice to see where subsequent advantages lie and proceed accordingly.

Battle strategies covered by Sun Tzu include deception, reading the enemy, wearing the enemy down, and using spies.

#### Deception

**The goal of any conflict is to control your opponent and overcome them.** Controlling their beliefs about your abilities helps you understand their assumptions and plan a strategy accordingly. As a well-known translation of Sun Tzu puts it, “**all warfare is based on deception**.”

Deception includes feigning weakness when you are strong or professing ignorance when you are informed. Appearing to be weak, unprepared, or small in size can lure your opponent into traps and make them susceptible to misguided actions or responses.

For instance, creating a scenario where only a small portion of your force is visible can mislead opponents into thinking they outnumber or outarm you. When they prepare an attack under that guise, they will be ill-prepared for the full strength of your forces.

Another example is allowing your opponent to win small victories or gains. Your opponent may fall victim to greed or an inflated ego, which will confuse and hinder their strategy when the truth is revealed.

> **Historical Example: Manipulation through Deception**
> 
> When a Chinese emperor was strategizing an attack on the Han dynasty, which had joined forces with the Huns, he sent a scout to scope out the Huns’ forces. Ten scouts returned after seeing old and feeble men milling about and reported that the Huns were weak. However, one scout, Lou Jing, saw the placement of these men as a ruse and reported that an attack would be unwise. The emperor punished Lou Jing for this advice and sent a massive force into Hun territory.
> 
> Lou Jing had been right. The hidden Huns forces surrounded the emperor’s men and stranded them for a week without supplies.

#### Reading the Enemy

As stated, knowing the strength of your opponent is vital. **Once you have fully assessed your opponent’s capabilities, you must understand how to use the information to bolster your position.**

If the enemy is operating from a foundation of fullness, meaning all facets of the five traits are viable, you should keep a close eye on them and start organizing your forces. Ensure that your side is equally “fulfilled” and aware of possible conflict. Avoid conflict until your enemy’s situation changes.

  * When your opponent sees that you mean not to engage in the conflict, a gap may open up. They may relax and provide an opportunity suitable for attack. 
  * Also, your lack of action may begin to anger the opposing leadership. 
  * **Continue to find ways to anger and irritate your opponent, for decisions made out of anger are often petulant and rash, which can lead to advantages for you.**



Once you notice that your opponent is riled up or angry, back off to give them the delusion of superiority or success. They may become arrogant or lax in their judgment, from which carelessness extends.

  * **If the enemy deems that you are no longer a threat, they will underestimate you or dismiss you as an opponent.**
  * This arrogance creates the perfect environment for you to successfully attack them. 



#### Wearing the Enemy Down

In addition to manipulating a strong enemy into carelessness, **forcing the enemy to exert energy will create opportunities of advantage for you**.

Strategize your efforts so they are geared toward controlling your opponent’s momentum. These tactics include surprise attacks, retreating when they advance, advancing when they retreat, and maneuvering them in different directions.

For example, you might strike a certain portion of the enemy’s forces to push them down a particular path in defense. When their energy shifts to take up this defense, switch your assault to the enemy troops in the opposite direction. Switching attack positions forces your opponent’s defense to hustle down another path to defend against your advance.

**Moving them back and forth by forcing them to react to conflict, rather than allowing them to initiate conflict, will keep them on their toes and tire them out.**

#### Using Spies and Aggravators

Since no strategy is complete without assessing the enemy, one of the most important aspects of any conflict is the use of spies.

**Send someone to infiltrate the enemy’s ranks to create discord.** These spies can create rifts between the soldiers and leaders or among individual ranks through false information.

If members of the opponent’s team begin to distrust the leadership or covet the spoils they enjoy, harmony among the ranks will be destroyed. **When there is disunity in your opponent’s ranks, you have gained an advantage.**

Likewise, treating the enemy’s populace better than the enemy treats them can swing loyalties and create division. Dissension can also be created between the enemy and their allies, which divides their sources of power.

When the enemy is distracted or distressed by this division, attack.

### Change Your Strategy as Needed

A good leader ensures that their strategy is not open to infiltration or manipulation. Therefore, **a good leader keeps their strategies secret, even from their own troops**.

One way to ensure your strategies remain unknown is through adaptation. **Strategies should be fine-tuned through assessments of enemy action, not completely mapped out beforehand on a drawing board.**

  * If your forces consistently use the same tactics or procedures, regardless of the situation, the enemy will be able to predict your actions. 
  * Instead, use your knowledge of the enemy’s foundation to inform your decisions about how to proceed once you’ve seen how they are preparing.



This is not to say that you should not have a clear plan before battle. You must prepare your forces for victory by developing a rich and focused approach. **Victorious leaders plan their victories ahead of time before entering a conflict.** Only after this foundation is set can adjustments be made strategically.

  * It’s the difference between (a) carrying a full deck of cards and deciding which card to play at different points in the game and (b) starting with one card and picking up the ones you’ll need along the way. Start with a full deck so you have cards to play when needed.
