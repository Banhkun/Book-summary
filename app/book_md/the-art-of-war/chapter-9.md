## Chapter 9: Maneuvering with Advantage

**How you maneuver your troops should be based on advantage.** Be aware of the advantages and disadvantages involved in any action.

### Reading the Environment

#### Water

When a body of water crosses your path, the following advantageous maneuvers should be considered.

  * Avoid the water if possible. 
  * Do not meet an enemy in water. Wait for half of them to cross, then strike.
  * Do not face the current of a river or head against the flow. 
  * Do not anchor your boats downstream -- the enemy may ride the current down the river and destroy your troops on impact.
  * If it rains and the river is white-capped and turbulent, wait for the water to calm down if you must cross.



#### Land

**Use the land to your advantage.** Always keep your back toward the most advantageous direction. Choose level ground, for it is easy to cross. If level ground is not available, take a high position.

  * High ground allows the momentum to swing downward. 
  * Low ground is often overgrown and damp, which can lead to illness.
  * When people are in the dark or are wet for too long, they can become depressed and sickly. Maintain good physical health, and stay close to resources.



**If part of the land is treacherous or barricading, keep to the far side of it and face it.**

  * Your enemy will be forced to remain close to the disadvantageous land and will have their backs to it. 



If you enter dense territory, with deep forests and brush cover, search them thoroughly. The enemy may be hiding in wait.

Study the landscape.

  * If the trees shake, the enemy is advancing. 
  * If the animals stir and birds fly up, there are people lying in wait. 
  * If there is a lot of dust, it means vehicles are moving around. 
  * If there is light dust, it means the enemy is setting up camp. 
  * If the dust is close to the ground, it is caused by foot traffic. 
  * If birds gather in a certain area, there is no disturbance there.
  * If there are disturbances in the undergrowth, be mindful. It may be a trap or misdirection.



### Reading the Enemy

Look out for signs of the enemy’s behavior, interpret them to understand the enemy’s weakness, and react accordingly.

#### Signs of Exhaustion, Thirst, or Hunger

  * If the negotiator is irritable, it means they are exhausted.
  * If the enemy requires fortification to stand upright, they are weak and hungry. 
  * If enemy troops are sent to fetch water for the group and those sent pause to drink first, their entire group is thirsty. 
  * If the enemy hands out numerous punishments, they are trying to motivate tired troops or are reacting to worn-out troops who are not able to follow commands. 



#### Signs of Fear

  * If you see that the enemy has an opportunity to gain advantage but they do not react, they are weary. 
  * If you hear enemy calls in the night, they are communicating fear. Calling out in the night is a way of connecting with each other for security. 



#### Signs of Imminent Retreat

  * If an enemy negotiator shows aggression and strength, don’t react. They may be trying to intimidate you because they aim to retreat.
  * If the enemy hands out numerous rewards to their troops, they are trying to distract them from a loss of momentum. 



#### Signs of Poor Leadership

  * If the enemy’s troops are discombobulated or angsty, their leader is not considered competent.
  * If the enemy’s signals are all over the place, they lack unity and organization. 
  * If enemy troops are seen cavorting among themselves and fall behind in their duties, they are becoming disloyal to their leader. 



#### Signs of Manipulation

  * If an enemy negotiator comes speaking of peace but carries no treaty, be wary. The enemy may be stalling to manage some issue with their troops or distract you from an ensuing attack.
  * If the enemy divides its power and sends half to attack while the other half retreats, they are trying to manipulate you to chase them.
  * If the enemy becomes aggressive but does not attack, be ready for an ambush. They are trying to distract you. 



#### Signs of Enemy Advantage

  * Be mindful of your opponent’s positioning. If they leave from a strong position and move to another, there must be some advantage to them doing so.
  * If the enemy orchestrates a mass of forces, expect their reinforcements to follow shortly.
  * If the enemy depletes their food supplies and abandons essential cooking tools, they are at the end of their rope. The troops now have nothing to lose and will fight to the death.



> Historical Example**: Suspicious Surrender**
> 
> When one of Cao Cao’s rivals surrendered to him, Cao Cao allowed the rival to return home. Shortly after, the rival returned to attack Cao Cao and killed Cao Cao’s son and nephew. Cao Cao also suffered an arrow injury.
> 
> The rival returned again with an armed force, but Cao Cao was successful in defending against them. On reflection, Cao Cao blamed his benevolence and negligence in letting the rival go for the fate of his family and army, advising his commanders to never make such an egregious error.

### Considering Your Troops

**Having the largest force does not equate to winning the battle.** If you have a smaller force, hold your ground, gather the troops you have, keep an eye on the enemy, and prepare a defense.

Even if you have the largest force, if you rely on strength alone, fail to strategize, and take your enemy’s forces for granted, you will be defeated.

If your troops are punished without first gaining their trust and loyalty, they will withdraw emotionally and will be hard to mobilize.

Likewise, if your troops become too attached to you and are spared punishment, they will become cocky and difficult to manage.

**In sum, treat your troops humanely but govern them strictly.** They will respect your command and trust you, thereby becoming loyal and fierce warriors.

> **Historical Example: The Benefit of Strict Governance**
> 
> The kingdom of Qi was invaded by Yan and Jin during the Spring and Autumn Era. In response, one of the Qi nobles recommended a man, Rangju, from outside the Qi territory to advise the Qi leadership. Rangju was known for his strength in battle and positive relations with the public where he came from.
> 
> However, when Rangju was made a general for Qi, he requested the service of a familiar nobleman to lead the army, since his authority was challenged by the lack of familiarity and trust by both the Qi fighters and people. A nobleman was appointed, but when called upon, his ego led him to attend a farewell bash instead of heading to the military meet-up position.
> 
> When he finally arrived, Rangju ordered his decapitation, which was the consequence of any military personnel failing to report on time for duty. The nobleman sent a message to the lord of Qi to be pardoned, but he was killed before the emissary returned with pardon. When the emissary returned, he galloped into camp to deliver the message, another crime according to military conduct. Two of the emissary’s men were killed as a consequence.
> 
> On his own now, Rangju led the army on their mission. When they stopped to set up camp, he behaved as one of the soldiers, getting his hands dirty in the preparations, sharing his supplies, and tending to the sick. After a few days, when it was time to enter battle, all of the soldiers were eager to fight for the fair and authoritative Rangju. This news spread to the Yan and Jin, who knew what such loyalty meant. The Yan and Jin withdrew from Qi territory.
