## Chapter 13: Final Thoughts on Leadership

A good leader is a steward of survival not only for the forces they command, but also for the entire nation. Therefore, **if a leader encompasses the qualities of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and sternness, the nation will be strong**. If, however, a leader is lacking in one or more of these qualities, the nation will be weak.

  * Leaders must be both loyal and capable. 
  * They must be able to concoct successful strategies that are unknowable and unpredictable.
  * A good leader does what is best for their troops, as well as their nation. 



There are five ways of determining which leader will be victorious during a conflict.

  1. The leader who knows when and when not to engage in battle.
  2. The leader who understands what sort of manpower is needed and when.
  3. The leader who has created harmony among the ranks.
  4. The leader who has prepared a strategy ahead of time.
  5. The leader who knows when and when not to listen to government commands.



**Prowess in Leadership**

Victory is formless to outsiders. The public is aware of the win but unaware of how the win manifested. Simply understanding a victory is not the same as having wisdom about how to win. Therefore, **a good leader understands the nature of victory in a way laypeople cannot fathom.**

Victories of good leaders should not be categorized as brave or cunning. **A good leader does not win by luck, accident, or exertion.** They use wisdom to win before the battle has even begun.

Keep the formation of victory a secret from the public. Keep the knowledge of the masses focused on the result of victory, not on the tactics of victory. Then your strategies will always be formless.

Similarly, be mysterious even within your own ranks. Keep your troops ignorant of the overall strategy. If they are only aware of your commands, they only have forward-looking vision and can be led like sheep. They know their role is to follow your command and nothing more. The troops are there to carry out the conclusion of the strategy, not help create the strategy.

As well as guarding your strategy from the troops, guard the dangers and disadvantages, as well.

  * Do not make them fearful of the tasks ahead. 
  * Keep them motivated with thoughts of advantage. 
  * When danger comes upon them, they will voluntarily mobilize to survive. 



### Ignorance in Leadership

**A good leader always takes into account the dangers as well as the advantages when determining action.** The mark of defeat is when a leader does not consider advantages and disadvantages. They either rush into battle, react too slowly, are susceptible to emotional disturbances, and fail to conceal strategies. For this leader, defeat is not an occurrence but a consequence.

There are six ways poor leadership leads to defeat.

  * Not examining the size of their troops and those of their opponents. 
  * Not instituting a system of rewards and punishments, or instituting one that is not strictly enforced.
  * Poorly training and preparing their troops.
  * Having a poor disposition or being easily emotionally distrubed.
  * Being unable to command and maintain control of their ranks.
  * Not considering the strengths and weaknesses of their troops.



### Further Considerations

If a leader does not form alliances, establish authority, and refrain from anger and violence, they will be alone, ineffective, and vulnerable. If a leader can create this situation in their enemy, the enemy will be unable to defend against you.

#### Troop Management

A good leader takes stock of their troops and determines which are strong and which are weak.

A good leader knows that both rewards and punishments are required. One without the other leads to either a state of complacency or resentment, which negatively affects the troops ability to fight effectively.

A good leader fortifies their troops, ensuring they are fed and healthy, monopolizes on early energy and reserves energy for when it is needed, remains formless and mysterious in defense, and remains patient until the momentum and advantages are in their favor and the enemy shows vulnerability.

When a leader is organized and consistent in leadership, the strong and the weak come together to fight under the same umbrella. When they consider the terrain and take advantage with this combined force, victory is certain.

  * When they generate this type of synchronicity in their forces, they can lead them as though they were one person. 



When the situation is dire and there is nothing left to lose, a good leader knows they don’t need to mobilize and encourage their forces. Everyone understands the stakes and fights with the same aim voluntarily.

#### Positioning

A good leader lays low and fortifies their defenses when they see no opening to attack the enemy. They wait for an opportunity by maneuvering according to the actions and behaviors of the enemy.

  * If the enemy is strong and resentful, a good leaderthey will appear weak and ashamed, manipulating the enemy into egotistical emotions of superiority. 
  * If the enemy shows a desire to retreat, a good leader willthey allow them to mobilize and head home.
  * Both of these actions trick the enemy into a place of complacency, making them ripe for attack. 



When faced with a large enemy force, a good leader determines where advantageous terrain lies and occupies it, then disrupts the enemy’s supply chain.

  * A leader should take hold of anything considered advantageous and dear to the enemy so the enemy will be forced to abide by their plans. 



A good leader strikes like a snake with four heads, so the front is the back and back the front. Therefore, anywhere the enemy attacks is within striking distance.

#### Momentum

A good leader is swayed by the momentum of battle and acts within those boundaries regardless of orders from civil government.

  * This leader advances without hopes for personal gain, retreats without fear of personal loss, and acts only in a way that is advantageous for their troops and nation.
  * All decisions are aimed at protecting the nation’s people. 



To be able to gain advantage when the enemy is unprepared and unalert, a good leader must be swift in action. Hesitation will be the death of their forces.

Once the strategies for battle are clear and the time to fight is upon them, a good leader ties up loose ends, closes the borders, and refuses entrance or exit to negotiators.

#### Deception

A good leader gets their opponent to open the door and appears innocent so as to be let in. Once in, they wreak havoc like a virus.

A good leader uses tactics to confuse and discombobulatediscomboble the opponent, drives wedges among the enemy’s troops and populace, relies on unorthodox and orthodox tactics, and strikes when it is advantageous and can be done in a way that leaves the enemy without time to prepare.

A good leader is never stagnant. They constantly adapt their strategies, routes, and encampments to keep not only the enemies in the dark and on their toes, but their troops as well.

> **Historical Example: A Properly Trained Force**
> 
> Confucius stated that allowing forces not properly trained to enter battle is the same as abandoning your forces in enemy territory.
> 
> Another leader, Wu Qi, a general for the Wei state, advised that the first task of any military action is to properly train the forces. Teach a few to fight, and they will expand and teach others to fight, and so on until a large fighting force is amassed.
> 
> Soldiers must be trained in all the tactics and strategies possible within a conflict, such as when to strike and when to retreat, when to fortify and when to divide, and when to use resources and when to feed off the enemy. Only after they have learned and mastered these skills and considerations should they be given weapons. Creating experts in battle before providing the tools of battle is the foundation of a good leader.
