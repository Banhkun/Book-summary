## Chapters 7-9: How Crises Lead to Revolutions

If recognizing anomalies is a key part of new discoveries, it shouldn’t be surprising that it’s also part of inventing theories—remember that discovering new facts and developing new theories are closely related processes. That whole process is key to scientific revolutions.

**This isn’t to say that normal science never solves anomalies—in fact, that’s one of its major functions.** This is part of the reason paradigms are so hard to change: Scientists often assure themselves that there _is_ a solution within the paradigm, it just hasn’t been found yet. Of course, this isn’t always the case.

On the very rare occasions that a field answers _every_ question posed, such as the paradigm that has light traveling in the form of rays, that field stops being science and becomes an engineering tool. However, when those anomalies last long enough or reject some key part of the paradigm, it could be said that the fields they pertain to are in crisis.

**In other words, an anomaly must seem like something more than a regular puzzle of normal science.** Scientists in those fields have a growing awareness that something is fundamentally wrong, that nature is in direct conflict with their understanding of it. That growing sense of crisis is what prompts the move into extraordinary science, and eventually revolution.

### From Anomaly to Crisis

The anomaly becomes more generally recognized in the field, and the most prominent members of that field turn their attention to it. In attempting to resolve it, scientists will push the rules of their current paradigm as far as they can go in an effort to see exactly where they break down. Once the breaking point is found, they will start speculating about new theories that can account for the anomaly. Then, if one of those theories holds up under scrutiny, it may form the basis of a revolution and a new paradigm.

A good example of this is Ptolemaic astronomy, which was the paradigm before Copernicus’s time. While it predicted _most_ planetary movements correctly, small details such as when equinoxes would occur never quite lined up with reality.

Scientists kept making small adjustments over the course of centuries, until the system became so patchwork and so convoluted that it couldn’t possibly be right. This is a clear sign of a scientific system in crisis. Finally, Copernicus said that the Ptolemaic system had become a monster, and he rejected it entirely to replace it with his own model.

### From Crisis to Theory

In the Copernican revolution and almost all others, **new theories come about when normal science repeatedly fails to explain anomalies** , often over the course of many years. However, while the failure takes a long time to reach the point that it can’t be ignored, the revolution often occurs relatively soon after that.

In many cases, there are only 10-20 years between the crisis point and the establishment of a new paradigm, replacing the old one. While that sounds like a long time, consider that in the previous example it took _hundreds_ of years for scientists to admit the current system was failing. This short timeframe suggests that new theories come about as a direct result of scientific crises.

This may be because many of the key anomalies in the Ptolemaic system were considered to be solved already, or so close that it hardly mattered, needing only some slight adjustments to the paradigm. **Therefore, when it turned out that those problems _couldn’t_ be solved, scientists felt the failure very keenly and began looking elsewhere for answers. **

One other common element of new theories is that they were frequently developed—at least to some extent—during a time when there was no crisis in that field; but they weren’t seriously considered until much later.

For example, the Greek astronomer Aristarchus first suggested a heliocentric model of the solar system in the 3rd century BC. However, since the then-current geocentric model explained the universe well enough, there was no need for his new idea and it was brushed aside. That would remain the case until many centuries later, when improved technology allowed astronomers to see things that the geocentric model couldn’t explain.

### New Theories Create New Paradigms

**The only time a paradigm is rejected is when another one comes to take its place.** This implies that the process of rejecting a paradigm doesn’t just involve comparing it with nature, but comparing it with another paradigm.

All scientific crises seem to resolve in one of three ways.

  * The first and most obvious solution is that normal science finds a solution to the anomaly after all, and the field returns to its pre-crisis state. 
  * The second, which is quite common, is that the anomaly is not resolved; however, scientists still believe that it is _solvable_ ,__ and they don’t fundamentally reject the current paradigm. In this case, the issue is set aside for future generations with better tools and methods to figure out. 
  * The third is that a new possible paradigm emerges and the two (or more) struggle for dominance in the field. If a new paradigm wins that struggle, it becomes a scientific revolution.



Paradigms must be based on theories. Scientific history, especially from the time before a given field has an established paradigm, shows that **many competing theories can explain the same sets of data.** Even so, normal science makes no effort to develop new theories, because there is no need for them as long as the current paradigm holds. That’s exactly why crises are so important to scientific advancement: They are the stimulus for scientists to break the rules and start looking outside of their paradigm for new ideas.

However, even in the face of crises,**** scientists will never start by rejecting the current paradigm. They don’t treat anomalies as _disproving_ the current paradigm, even if the paradigm has failed to explain them for many years. Instead, scientists will try to explain away the anomalies with arguments and off-the-cuff modifications of the paradigm, like the Ptolemaic scientists did.

Remember that people—and therefore paradigms—resist change. Formal education trains students on the current paradigms, and often fixes them in it. Students are taught how the paradigm is used, and the problems it has solved, and they take that as proof that the paradigm is true. Alternative explanations for those observations are rarely, if ever, part of a scientific education. While science is seen as enlightened and logical, in many ways it is steeped in tradition and habit.

### Why We Need Revolutions

The word “revolution” is usually used in a historical context, not a scientific one. **However, there are many parallels that make the term appropriate here.** First and perhaps most important of all, revolutions start with a growing feeling that the current systems aren’t working. This is often because they’re failing to solve problems they helped to create.

The revolutions may only be significant to a small part of the population. Like the Balkan revolutions in the 20th century, outsiders might see them as normal and expected parts of progress. Similarly, scientists whose paradigms aren’t affected by a scientific revolution may not see it as a revolution at all, but just as a new piece of information.

Revolutions, whether political or scientific, try to overthrow the current establishment and put a new one in its place. The community is inevitably divided into those defending the status quo and those fighting against it.

Once that division happens, there is no political solution. The people can’t even agree on what type of political (or in this case, scientific) framework should be in place to make that solution happen.**It’s impossible to resolve the conflict by the usual methods, because those are set by the current paradigm, and it’s the paradigm itself that’s under attack.** The only thing that’s clear to all sides is that the competing paradigms can’t coexist. Finally, the opposing parties use whatever means they can to get popular opinion on their own side, including force if needed.

Revolutions are key parts of both history and science, **but they only work because they exist outside of the normal, established structure.**

### Science Is Not Cumulative

It seems like, in theory, science should be able to progress without revolutions. Many people believe that—if not for human error—science _would_ add perfectly onto itself, with no need to reject and overthrow old paradigms. This is largely based on the idea that what we call “knowledge” is a human construct put onto observed data, which would imply that any errors in our knowledge must stem from our interpretations of the facts.

**However, even if humans were perfectly logical and never made mistakes, it’s unlikely that normal science alone would be sufficient.** As previously mentioned, many different and incompatible theories can explain the same observations. Until some new information makes one seem more plausible than the others, even a perfect scientist would have no way of knowing which theory is the correct one.

Also, scientists will tend to look for problems that should be solvable with current knowledge and techniques, and novel discoveries only happen when the knowledge proves to be wrong. **Therefore, if humans never made mistakes, major discoveries would never happen.** The _only_ means of gathering knowledge at that point would be slow accumulation by normal science, without the sudden leaps that revolutionary science allows.

#### Refuting Logical Positivism

(Shortform note: Logical Positivism is a philosophy which states that the only problems worth considering are those which can be solved through direct observation or logical reasoning. One side effect of this is the belief that any paradigm that has been used effectively must be correct—the paradigm has been observed to work, therefore it’s correct.

This was the dominant philosophy in Kuhn’s day, though not so much in modern times. In fact, _Structure_ itself played a large role in overthrowing it.)

The theory of scientific revolutions is not a popular one. **Many people believe that new paradigms must be either offshoots of, or additions to, current paradigms.** They would argue that an entire paradigm doesn’t get overthrown, only those parts of it that are provably wrong; and, furthermore, that those parts are based in human error, not a fundamental flaw in the paradigm. The paradigm as a whole must work, because it has been observed to work.

**We should reject this logical positivist view of science.** Following that logic, paradigms should only work for the specific phenomena they’ve been tested for, and only under those same laboratory conditions. **If only things that have been observed can be considered true, then extrapolation—which is crucial to science—would be impossible.**

Consider this: If there were not some critical, unresolvable difference between an old paradigm and a new one, there would never be scientific crises. In that case, any anomalies would be explained by the current paradigm and a new one would never be needed. Therefore, the very fact that such crises exist shows that the logical positivist view is flawed.

New paradigms are fundamentally incompatible with preceding ones, and establishing a new paradigm requires that the old one be rejected, right down to its fundamental beliefs and its scientific rules. When that happens, the entire field may need to be redefined. Old problems are shunted to different fields, or brushed aside as unscientific. New problems, or problems that weren’t considered worth the field’s time before, may become the central focus of that field.

In short, the normal sciences practiced under different paradigms are not just incompatible, they’re completely incomparable. **The new paradigm bears no relation to the old one, yet both have been observed to work, so logical positivism can’t be correct.**
