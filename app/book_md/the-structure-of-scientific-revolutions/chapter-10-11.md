## Chapter 10-11: Changing Paradigms, Changing World

**When paradigms change, it could be said that the entire world changes with them.** Scientists ask different questions, follow different rules, and even use different terms (or use the same terms differently) after a paradigm change. Perhaps even more importantly, they see new information in studies they’ve done before.

This process resembles a _gestalt shift._ In psychology, a gestalt shift is when your perception of something suddenly changes—like a picture that you can see as either a rabbit or a duck (but never both at once).

**However, there are important differences between a simple gestalt shift and a scientific revolution.** Gestalt shifts can go either way—from duck to rabbit or rabbit to duck, and back again. The subject can even learn to make the switch at will. On the other hand, scientific revolutions generally go one way, and they are irreversible. A scientist who now views the world through a Copernican paradigm can never go back to Ptolemy. A period when scientific perceptions can switch back and forth is, by definition, a crisis.

In a gestalt shift, such as with the picture which could be seen as a duck or a rabbit, either interpretation is correct—or at least, one isn’t _more_ correct than the other. However, as we’ve said before, accepting a new paradigm means rejecting the old one, as if seeing a rabbit meant that you could never see the duck again.

Finally, in psychological experiments there are external forces helping the gestalt shift—for example, in the card experiment described earlier, there was someone there to tell the subject that he had been looking at a black five of hearts. This allowed the subject to begin shifting his perspective of what a playing card could be. However, in science, there is no higher source of authority or information. Scientists have only their instruments and observations to rely on.

Scientific crises aren’t resolved by study and interpretation—that would be normal science, which by definition can’t fix a crisis. **They’re resolved by a sudden understanding or change in perception resembling the gestalt shift.** Scientists have sometimes described that shift like a flash of inspiration, or scales falling away from their eyes, rather than a deliberate understanding of the material.

### What Happens After a Scientific Shift?

Many readers will say that what changes with a paradigm is only how scientists interpret their observations, not _what_ they see. In other words, the observations themselves are unchangeably set by nature, and all that changes is the observers’ understanding. **However, like normal science, interpretation needs a paradigm in order to exist.** Furthermore, interpretation of a paradigm can’t fix that paradigm. It can only explain and expand upon it. It’s impossible for a paradigm to disprove itself; all it can do is find anomalies that eventually lead to crisis.

For example, consider a stone swinging on the end of a string. Aristotle, whose paradigm said that objects were naturally drawn to their places of rest, saw a stone attempting to fall and being held back by the string. Galileo, however, saw a pendulum, with all the complex physics that implied. By this theory of different interpretations, Aristotle and Galileo both saw pendulums, they just interpreted them differently.

**This common view isn’t entirely wrong, and it’s part of a long-standing paradigm about the nature of knowledge and understanding.** The current paradigm says that there _is_ an objective reality, which we can learn about through unbiased observations and share by using neutral language to describe it. Furthermore, this paradigm states that objective reality is what scientists are studying, and any discrepancies come from different interpretations of it.

However, despite its past effectiveness, modern research is finding anomalies that suggest the current paradigm is flawed. There isn’t a strong alternative yet, so the current paradigm can’t be rejected right now, but it seems clear that different interpretations of data aren’t enough to explain what happens after a change in paradigm.

For one thing, **the data scientists collect is not the same.** For example, a falling stone is not the same thing as a pendulum. This isn’t just a reinterpretation of the same thing, it’s a fundamental difference with hugely different implications.

An Aristotelian scientist might observe the stone’s weight, the distance it moves from its starting point, and how long it takes to cover that distance. A Galilean scientist, on the other hand, might observe the pendulum’s starting angle and the radius of its swing. The community transitioning from the falling-stone paradigm to the pendulum paradigm is not just reinterpreting data; that would be impossible, since the data itself is different.

**Given that the observations, data, and interpretations are all different, it seems fair to say that, after a paradigm shift, science is now happening in a different and incommensurable world.**

### Why Scientific Revolutions Are Hard to See

The problem we now run into is that most of the previous examples of scientific revolutions aren’t usually seen as such—they’re viewed as additions to knowledge, as would be expected from normal science. Any additional examples would run into the same issue.

**Part of the problem is that both scientists and laypeople get their ideas of science from authorities that methodically and intentionally hide the existence of revolutions.** These authorities are usually textbooks, along with popular works and philosophical treatises based on those same paradigms. All of these are devoted to established paradigms, along with the data, theories, and questions it contains.

These works explore the _results_ of revolutions, rather than the revolutions themselves, which gives the impression that those revolutions never happened. Furthermore, they tend to show revolutions as logical progressions of knowledge, rather than the overthrow of established paradigms.

**This is done for practical reasons, not to deliberately cover up the facts.** There’s no sense in exploring the entire history of science in every textbook, so for teaching purposes they only cover the parts that are relevant to the current paradigm. Furthermore, going in depth about outdated paradigms would give them more weight and credibility in present-day scientific communities. This would only lead to new scientists rehashing the same issues again and again.

**However, as a result, the books end up making all science look like normal science** —linear progress from ignorance to knowledge through the accumulation of facts. They can also give the false impression that scientists have always been working to solve the specific questions posed by our modern paradigms.

For example, textbooks often credit the 17th-century chemist Robert Boyle for inventing the concept of a chemical element in his book _The Sceptical Chymist_. However, the definition of “element” that he gave was little more than a paraphrase of a concept that had existed at least since Aristotle’s time.

**Boyle’s writing was significant because he was at the head of a scientific revolution that changed what the word “element” referred to** —a key distinction from changing the definition itself. Aristotle favored the four so-called “traditional elements:” earth, water, air, and fire, while Boyle and his contemporaries had the word refer to elements as we understand them today.

_The Sceptical Chymist_ was a major part of a revolution that transformed the field of chemistry. However, by glossing over everything that came before him, modern textbooks make it seem as though Boyle was simply adding to an established pile of knowledge rather than overturning the popular ideas of the day.

**Textbook methods of teaching have so shaped our view of science and discovery that we often can’t see the countless revolutions that brought science to its current state.**
