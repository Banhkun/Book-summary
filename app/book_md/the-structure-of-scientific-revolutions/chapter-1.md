## Chapter 1: An Introduction to Structure

Our current view of science is pulled mostly from textbooks and similar sources, the formal education we receive in school. However, these sources are like guidebooks or pamphlets for tourists, rather than accurate pictures of scientific history. **As a result, some of our ideas about science are wrong.**

Many of those books imply that “science” is only the theories and discoveries in the books themselves, rather than a huge assortment of different fields, ideas, and practices. Also, they often focus on experimental science (the so-called Scientific Method), but ignore the importance of connecting the results of those experiments to more general theories.

If our current ideas about science are true, then science is just the complete collection of knowledge we have about the world. In that case, scientific historians should be devoted to figuring out who made which contributions to that collection—and, on the other hand, figuring out how and why so many mistakes and myths were wrongly added to it over the years.

**However, recently, people are finding that scientific history isn’t a straight line from ignorance to knowledge like they thought**. There are a few anomalies that have led to this conclusion. (Shortform note: This book was first published in 1962.)

For one thing, questions that should have simple answers become harder—not easier—to answer the more you look into them. For example, you might ask, “Who discovered oxygen?” This seems like a simple question until you research it and find that at least three different scientists have reasonable claims to the discovery of oxygen.

People also have trouble explaining how today’s beliefs and understandings are more “scientific” than in the past. The methods of previous eras weren’t any less rigorous, and the conclusions scientists reach today aren’t any freer from human error.

**Science has often supported beliefs that are totally incompatible with what we believe today, and yet we haven’t changed our beliefs simply because we got “better” at science.** This seems to go directly against the idea that science is simply gathering facts and building on what’s already known.

**This is all leading to a shift in how older kinds of science are viewed.** Instead of steps along the way to our current ideas, they might have just been products of their time, eventually pushed aside by new ideas. If that’s the case then, rather than precursors to our current scientific beliefs, they simply aren’t relevant to modern science at all.

Therefore, instead of asking how those old views led to today’s science, some historians now ask how they fit into the beliefs of their times. That is to say, they look for internal consistency in the fields rather than some overarching consistency throughout history.

### When Nature Doesn’t Fit Scientific Biases

Problems often arise because accepted scientific theories are biased in some way, which leads to inaccuracies. Scientists will inevitably bring their own biases and experiences to whatever they study.

This is especially notable when studying relatively new fields. **By examining different aspects of that field, and using different experiments and methods, scientists can come to wildly different—but no less valid—conclusions.** For example, consider Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s theory that physical changes an animal experienced in life could be passed down to its offspring; then compare that to Darwin’s well-known ideas about genetics. The two theories are totally irreconcilable and grounded in the scientists’ personal biases, yet neither could simply be dismissed as wrong.

Bias isn’t necessarily a bad thing—no scientist could work without pre-formed beliefs. Avoiding all established knowledge and methods is impossible. If you somehow succeeded then you’d be practicing philosophy, not science.

**Normal science—that is, adding to what we already know—is all about fitting nature into the frameworks that we learn from formal education.** Normal science is based on the assumption that we already know what the world is generally like, and we just need to fill in the details. As a result, normal science tends to cover up new ideas and discoveries that go against the established model. (Shortform note: This covering-up doesn’t have to be malicious. Often it’s just because scientists assume something that doesn’t fit the established model must be a mistake or an outlier.)

**However, sometimes science will find an anomaly that can’t be hidden or fit into the current model, even after years of trying.** This could be a new theory that doesn’t match the paradigm, or simply an observation that doesn’t line up with what was expected (Shortform note: “Theory” in the scientific sense means a well-developed idea that’s supported by data, not the informal meaning which is closer to a guess.)

When that happens, scientists have to break with traditional knowledge and start looking for a new model that fits this new information. That’s the beginning of a scientific revolution—**but to truly deserve that name, the new model has to have big implications.**

For example, when the movements of planets and moons couldn’t be resolved with the old Earth-centric model of the solar system, scientists of the day had to discard and replace it with the current sun-centered model. Therefore, the new heliocentric model didn’t just mean that scientists had made a mistake before, it meant they had to completely reevaluate how planets move and why. It was as if the scientists had to work in a totally new world with different natural laws.

Because a new model throws a lot of old work into question, scientists will often resist these revolutions at first. This is why it’s so hard for historians to pinpoint when major scientific revolutions happened:**They were and are ongoing processes,** but historians try to put specific timeframes on them. (Shortform note: Consider that, even today, there are people who don’t believe in evolution and fight to disprove it. While scientific historians can point to major events in the process, such as when Darwin’s _On the Origin of Species_ was published, it would be very hard to say exactly when the revolution “happened.”)

### The Structure of _Structure_

_The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ expands on this idea of revolutions as ongoing processes, not concrete events. It also goes into more detail about the difference between normal science and revolutionary science.

**The rest of the book focuses on three central questions:**

  * First, why our modern style of textbook learning makes it hard to pin down past scientific revolutions 
  * Second, the struggle between scientists who favor the old model and those who favor the new one, and how those old theories are eventually overthrown 
  * Finally, how this idea of revolution fits (or doesn’t fit) with the idea that science is a progressive collecting of knowledge



Viewing scientific history _purely as history_ isn’t enough to really understand how science progresses and why. Therefore, the book makes a number of generalizations about the psychology and behavior of scientists. It also goes into epistemology—the study of knowledge itself, and how to separate facts from beliefs. Especially in light of those generalizations, and knowledge drawn from fields that are not the author’s specialty, the ideas and theories in _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ should be carefully checked for flaws.

**The theory of scientific revolutions should be subject to examination and experiments just like any other scientific model;** perhaps eventually someone will find an anomaly that completely invalidates it.
