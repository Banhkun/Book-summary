## Chapter 12: Verifying a New Paradigm

**Any new paradigm starts with one or, at most, a few people.** These people usually have two things in common. First, they have focused their work on the anomalies that led to the current crisis. Second, they are young, or at least new to the field, and so are less set in the current methods and rules than their colleagues.

The challenge then becomes convincing the rest of the scientific community to adopt their new paradigm. Therefore, the two (or more) paradigms must now be compared both against nature and against each other.

### Positive Verification

It’s impossible to test a paradigm in every way, under every circumstance. Therefore, many scientists would say that convincing the community to adopt a new paradigm isn’t about proving beyond doubt that it’s correct; instead it’s about showing that, **given the available evidence,** **it is more likely to be correct than the other options.**

This is called _positive verification,_ and it offers a couple of testing methods. One way is to compare the paradigm or paradigms in question against all conceivable ones that explain the same data. Another is to come up with tests that the paradigm might reasonably be expected to pass.

However, while it has its uses, this method is fundamentally flawed. As previously said, meaningful testing and observation can’t occur without a paradigm already in place. Given that a paradigm is required, there’s no way to test the new ones in all possible ways—only those ways that the paradigm itself allows.

Positive verification could be compared to natural selection: **The most fit** **of the available options at the time of testing will survive and thrive,** at least for a while. It’s meaningless to ask whether it’s the best _possible_ option, because there is no practical way to test that.

### Negative Verification

The philosopher Karl Popper suggested an alternative, which could be called _negative verification_ , or falsification _._ Under negative verification, **tests would be conducted with the express purpose of failing, thereby disproving a theory.**

(Shortform note: To give a somewhat outlandish example, if you showed that you could drop a stone and have it fall up instead of down, you would have disproved the theory of gravity. So far, every test conducted has _failed to disprove_ that theory.)

It’s worth noting that negative verification serves much the same purpose as anomalies: Showing fatal flaws in current ideas, thereby paving the way for new ones. However, **anomalies and falsifications are not the same thing.** In fact, true negative verification might not even exist.

Remember that very, very few paradigms can answer every question they’re presented with. That is the reason why normal science exists. Therefore, if a single failed test were enough to reject a paradigm, they would all be rejected almost instantly.

There would have to be some point at which the failure is great enough that the paradigm can be comfortably rejected. In other words, scientists would have to show that it’s **less likely to be correct than other paradigms** , and in trying to establish the exact degree of unlikeliness, they’d run into all the same problems as positive verification.

The underlying problem is that both of these popular, yet opposite, ideas try to combine two separate processes. Positive and negative verification are, essentially, attacking the same problem from opposite sides: One seeks to show that a given idea is more likely to be true than others, the other that a given idea is less likely to be true than others. **However, both processes are needed to establish which theory the scientific community could be most confident in adopting.**

### Conversion to a New Paradigm

**There are significant challenges in converting a scientific community to a new paradigm.**

Remember that scientists working under different paradigms are, in many ways, working in different worlds. Because they aren’t always answering the same questions or using the same methods, competing schools of thought often have trouble communicating with each other. Because they have different standards, they can’t agree on which paradigm meets those standards better. **Finally, because the paradigms can’t be compared to each other, the switch between them can’t be forced by reasoning or evidence.**

Instead, like the gestalt switch, the change happens all at once—if it ever happens. Sometimes current scientists—especially older ones—can’t or won’t be convinced at all, and it takes a full generation for the new paradigm to establish itself.

However, this is not necessarily because of stubbornness or willful ignorance, but because the scientists are confident in the paradigms they’ve been using their whole careers. Oftentimes they believe that the current paradigm, if given the chance, will solve its anomalies and prove that a new paradigm isn’t needed. That same confidence in the paradigm is what makes normal science possible.

#### The Process of Conversion

However, many scientific communities _have_ switched from one paradigm to another.

One of the most effective ways to convert scientists, naturally, is by showing that the new paradigm solves the problems that caused the current crisis. This is actually quite rare; despite it being the basis of a revolution, a new paradigm often won’t solve the crisis much better than the old one. **This is in large part because the new paradigm hasn’t had the time or normal scientific effort to develop.** In its early versions the paradigm is still crude and imprecise, and often doesn’t provide the elegant solutions that scientists were hoping for.

Therefore, the major question becomes **not which paradigm solves those particular problems better, but which one should guide normal science going forward.** In that case, it’s not so much about which paradigm is currently “better,” but which one shows more promise for future achievements.

If resolving the crisis isn’t enough—or if the new paradigm doesn’t solve those problems better than the old one—other areas of the field will often be drawn into the argument. If the new paradigm can predict phenomena that the old one couldn't, even if those are not the problems that caused the crisis, its position will be greatly strengthened.

For example, Copernicus predicted many things about other planets and the universe that improved telescopes showed to be true decades after his death. The fact that his paradigm correctly predicted such things made it much stronger and more popular, especially with non-astronomers.

**On top of the purely scientific arguments, people can sometimes be converted to a new paradigm just by aesthetics** —if the new paradigm is seen as simpler or more elegant than the old one. Other “unscientific” reasons for adopting a new paradigm may include the reputation, past successes, or even nationality of the one proposing it. In these cases, people adopt the new paradigm for purely human reasons rather than scientific ones.

No single one of these things will convert _every_ scientist in a community. Instead, **there is a gradual but ever-increasing shift in belief among the people in it.** As the new paradigm gains support, more scientists will devote themselves to exploring it, thereby making it stronger. This trend continues until there are only a few holdouts left.

**It’s important to acknowledge that these holdouts aren’t necessarily wrong.** They hold to an older paradigm, one that has or had great scientific value. At most one could say that, after an entire profession has moved to a new paradigm, those who still resist are no longer part of that profession. Sooner or later these last opponents die out or retire, and leave the new paradigm largely uncontested.
