## Introductory Essay by Ian Hacking

(Shortform note: This essay is included as a preface to _Structure_ in the 2012 edition, but its author suggests saving it until after you’ve read Kuhn’s book.)

This introductory essay by Ian Hacking discusses how and why _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ was written, its impact on the scientific community, and whether it’s still relevant today (Shortform note: The first edition of _Structure_ was published in 1962).

The sciences have changed a lot since _Structure_ was first published. In 1962, physics was in the spotlight. It was the middle of the Cold War, so everyone had nuclear weapons on their minds. In fact, Kuhn himself was trained as a physicist.

**Today, however, biotechnology is the hot field of science**. On top of that, modern technology like computer simulations and the internet has changed how science is practiced and how ideas are shared.

Another major change since _Structure_ was written has to do with fundamental physics itself. In 1962, physics had two major competing models of the universe: steady state and the Big Bang theory. By 2012, only the Big Bang theory was commonly accepted.

Finally,**** Kuhn believed that the most important scientific work was theoretical, not experimental. In fact, the modern emphasis on experimental science is as recent as the 1980s. **You’ll have to decide for yourself how relevant Kuhn’s ideas about physics are to modern science.**

(Shortform note: Steady state physics said that while the universe was constantly expanding—which had been observed—it was constantly recycling old matter to maintain its density. The Big Bang theory says that this is not happening, and the universe is becoming less dense as it expands. To learn more about the Big Bang Theory, read our summary of Stephen Hawking's _A Brief History of Time._)

To show how Kuhn is both right and wrong about normal science, consider the Higgs particle. The Higgs particle is a theoretical particle that would fill a gap in the current physics paradigm. Normal science is trying to find this particle.

In looking for the Higgs particle, scientists aren’t trying to discover anything new; they’re trying to find evidence to support the current paradigm. This is what Kuhn got right. **However, it’s possible—even expected—that discovering the Higgs particle will open up entirely new branches of physics. This is what Kuhn’s ideas about normal science gloss over.**(Shortform note: The Higgs particle—now called the Higgs Boson—was first observed in 2012, the same year this essay was published.)

### Supplemental Reading

There are a number of supplemental readings you could do to better understand _Structure_ and the author’s life:

  * The online _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ has some great intro-level reading about Kuhn’s life and work. 
  * _The Essential Tension_ is a collection of papers that Kuhn published at around the same time as _Structure_. It contains commentary and expansions on a lot of the same topics.
  * _Black-Body and the Quantum Discontinuity_ is about Max Planck’s work with quantum theory, which Kuhn often said was a perfect example of what _Structure_ talks about.
  * Kuhn himself often praised _Reconstructing Scientific Revolutions_ as the best book another author ever wrote about his work.
