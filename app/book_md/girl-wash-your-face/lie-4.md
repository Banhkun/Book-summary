## Lie #4: I’m Superior to You

Women all too often tear each other down, gossiping and talking behind each others’ backs, even making fun of other women. This behavior is usually traceable back to insecurities that developed in childhood. In pointing out someone else’s flaws, we somehow think we can diminish our own.

### Judging and Competing Ruins Friendships

Women judging other women is a hurtful, spiteful impulse; the fact that everyone does it doesn’t make it OK. It keeps us from building stronger friendships and from connecting in deeper ways.

The author was once on a plane with a horribly behaved little boy who screamed nonstop. She kept wondering why his mother allowed this behavior. When he was quieted by a bag of candy, Hollis was even more judgemental. Sugar? Rewarding his behavior? But at the baggage carousel she was struck by the look in the parents’ eyes-- overwhelmed and near tears. It hit her that she didn’t know this woman’s story. Perhaps the child had special needs or struggles no one was aware of. Instead of offering help or simply giving this mother the benefit of the doubt, Hollis judged her and found her lacking.

Women competing with each other also needs to stop. Instead, we should focus on supporting each other. Hollis experienced this when she joined a group of friends running a race. An avid marathon runner, she focused on being her friends’ support system this time instead of making it about herself. Though it wasn’t easy to sit on the sidelines, she ultimately had an incredible experience cheering on her friends. **She would have missed so much if she’d only been out there for herself**.

With her blog and website, Hollis found that the **number one thing women ask for advice about is friends** \-- making them and keeping them. Ironically, their judgemental and competitive behavior is keeping many women from building friendships.

True friendship comes with keeping an open mind when you meet someone, looking for commonality instead of differences. Ignore outside factors like hair or clothes, and instead focus on inside factors like heart, character and experience.

### Tips on Overcoming the “I’m Better Than You” Lie

Use these ideas and strategies to help curb the inclination to judge and compete with other women:

  * **Admit that no one is immune**. We’ve all judged others. We judge in small ways like rolling our eyes at how someone is dressed. We judge in bigger ways, such as viciously gossiping or writing hateful things on social media.
  * **Know that you don’t necessarily know best.** Just because you believe things should be a certain way, it isn’t necessarily true for everyone. Judging makes us feel safer in our own choices. Even if you want to hold someone accountable for their behavior, you can do so in a loving way. Judgement, on the other hand, comes from a place of fear or hate.
  * **Surround yourself with non judgmental friends**. If you surround yourself with gossipers, you’ll likely take part. Instead, find a community of women who build each other up.
  * **Police your judgemental tendencies** : When you find yourself judging someone, force yourself to stop and think of compliments you could pay this person Look for the positives.
  * **Deal with your own insecurities** : Figure out what’s making you lash out at other women. Acknowledge your own deep well of insecurities. You become a better version of yourself when you understand what makes you tick.
