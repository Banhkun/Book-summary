## Lie #20: I Need to Be Rescued

Women can fall into the trap of waiting for someone else to fix their lives, or they simply exist, assuming that life will magically improve on its own. We look outside ourselves and see something else as the solution -- if only we had the right job, man, house, or car, then life would be what we’ve dreamed of. But women can leave this trap behind and take responsibility for their own success.

The author’s own journey to becoming a runner is an example. Never athletic as a child, she first challenged herself to run a half-marathon, despite hating running, after her husband ran one when she was pregnant. She did this for a few reasons. She was jealous of his energy and health, and wanted that for herself. She wanted to prove to herself she could do it, and prove to her kids that dads _and_ moms are strong. She also wanted to see if she truly _wasn’t_ athletic or if that was a narrative she had always believed about herself. She successfully ran the half-marathon.

Her first full marathon brought her to the epiphany that **she and she alone was in charge of her destiny.** She went through agonizing training, drawing on the strength of her past accomplishments -- enduring a 52-hour labor and building a business from the ground up.

Getting through the race took everything she had; at mile 11 she found a song to inspire her, Bonnie Tyler’s “I Need A Hero.” Singing along with the lyrics, she was struck by the thought that in fact she didn’t need a hero -- **she was her own hero**. She had done the work and was reaping the rewards. She pushed herself to do something she never thought was possible.

From this epiphany came the greatest lesson she wants to impart to other women: **Only you have the power to change your life.** God, your mom, your husband, your friends can’t make you into something without your help, and she wants other women to experience the pride and joy of being their own heroes.

To do this, you need to set a goal for yourself and work hard to get there. **Prove to yourself you can do it** , whether it’s run a race, lose 10 pounds, or pay off a credit card -- the point is proving to yourself that you are capable of anything you set your sights on.

**Lose the mindset of waiting for something or someone else to make your life better.** Stop medicating and abusing your body. Lose the fear and negative self-talk.**Leave the pain of yesterday and start again knowing you have the power.**
