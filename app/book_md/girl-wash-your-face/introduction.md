## Introduction: You Choose Your Own Happiness

This book drives home an important truth for women: _You_ are in control of your own life. You are responsible for your happiness and for the person you become. And you are capable of _more_ than what you’ve become right now..

Unfortunately, many women can’t embrace this truth because a slew of painful lies gets in their way, destroying their sense of self-worth and impeding their ability to reach full potential. These lies, thrown at women by society, the media, and even their families, include:

  * You’re not good enough.
  * You’re not thin enough.
  * You’re a bad mom
  * You’re bad at sex.
  * You’re not lovable.



Women too often absorb these lies as truth, leading to self-destructive behavior. They let others treat them badly and accept less than they deserve. They buy things they can’t afford to impress others and self-medicate with alcohol, food or other distractions. They even buy their kids’ love instead of parenting.

But it doesn’t have to be this way; women can change their trajectory and improve their lives.**The first step toward gaining back power and strength is identifying and acknowledging these lies.**

The journey to a new life is a long process and it won’t be easy. Change doesn’t happen overnight. You’ll try out different tools and techniques; some will work and some won’t. You’ll fall short at times on your journey. **But when you grasp that you are truly in control, you’ll get up and keep trying until being in control feels natural.**

Author Rachel Hollis speaks from experience. She has overcome pain and struggle in her life and has emerged a better and stronger person. She, too, has shames, flaws and insecurities, but has learned to love herself despite it all.**She knows she is in control, so she’ll never give up on trying to improve herself and solve her problems.**

As a lifestyle blogger, her job includes sharing images of perfection -- perfect meals, chic images of family life, fashion, and travel. This kind of lifestyle imagery often sets women up for unrealistic expectations of what life should be like; they feel bad because they can’t measure up. But Hollis takes great pains to counter these images with doses of reality. She may show a beautifully styled cupcake, but she’ll also show a photo of herself with facial paralysis or share bladder control issues so her readers understand that perfection is an illusion.

In fact, she believes her readers aren’t responding to _perfection_ in her images -- they see real _happiness_. Despite her flaws and life’s struggles, she is happy, and that’s what all women deserve.

The author’s Christian faith played a big role in her journey toward finding happiness and wholeness, understanding that God loves us unconditionally, but doesn’t want us to squander our gifts.

Each section of the book addresses a lie that holds women back from happiness and success. Hollis used to believe each of these lies; she explains how each lie hurt her, and how she made changes in her life to disarm the lie. By sharing her insecurities and imperfections, and how she keeps trying every day, her goal is to inspire other women. **Your life doesn’t have to look like hers or anyone else’s, but you are in control of your own happiness.**
