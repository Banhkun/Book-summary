## Lie #14: I’m Not Talented Enough

Sometimes women tend to hold other people’s opinions ahead of their own, especially when it comes to something they are creating. It could be writing a book, building a company, creating art, or even their fashion sense.

You want your work -- what you’ve created -- to be recognized when it’s sent out into the world, but there’s no guarantee it will be liked, appreciated or even understood. It’s hard to find the courage to complete something because fear of criticism can be overwhelming.

**While you can’t make people like or understand what you’ve created, you still have to put it out there** because your ability to create is a God-given gift.

As a writer who receives good and bad reviews, Hollis has to fight the tendency to believe the negative criticism. She holds onto the mantra, “Someone else’s opinion of you is none of your business.”

### Focus on Creating, Not Opinions

Women must send their work out into the world without fearing negativity or criticism because pushing your work our into the world is more important than how it will be received. Creating for the sake of creating is the point, not outside validation.

But worrying about criticism is a hard habit to break. Whenever Hollis writes about something new or controversial, she wonders if people will get it or like it. She’s worried about making people mad and has to fight the tendency to believe that she needs public opinion to validate her work.

To counter this, she asks herself, **would she risk a negative response if her work resonated positively with just one other person?** Her answer is yes -- it would still be worth it.

The advice: Create for yourself in celebration of your God-given abilities.

### Tips on Ignoring Negativity

Try these strategies to create without worrying about the opinions of others:

  * **Stop reading reviews**. Other people’s opinions shouldn’t affect your desire to keep creating. Every profession or endeavor has a form of review; stop “reading” yours.
  * **Create for yourself**. Your creativity is an outlet and your creative choices shouldn’t be based on money. Reach for creative and even silly endeavors that bring joy. Color, play with your kids, explore fun activities. Creativity can come from many places.
