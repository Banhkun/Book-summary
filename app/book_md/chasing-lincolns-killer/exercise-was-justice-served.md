## Exercise: Was Justice Served?

Most of the people who saw and knowingly assisted the Lincoln assassination conspirators were not ultimately punished. (Also, an innocent man _was_ punished.)

* * *

Do you think those who knowingly assisted the conspirators by providing food, shelter, transportation, and so on, should have been punished? Why or why not?

Do you think Dr. Samuel Mudd was punished appropriately? Why or why not?

Did Mary Surratt deserve a death sentence, although she wasnâ€™t directly involved in planning the assassination? Why or why not?

Would you ever hesitate to report something you knew or felt was wrong? What factors would you consider in deciding whether to report it?
