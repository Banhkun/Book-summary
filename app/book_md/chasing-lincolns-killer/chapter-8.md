## Chapter 8: Trial and Execution

Despite the hundreds of people originally arrested, including many who had encountered or assisted the co-conspirators, Stanton decided to try only eight: Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, George Atzerodt, Samuel Arnold, Michael O’Laughlen, Edman Spangler, and Dr. Samuel Mudd.

Arnold and O’Laughlen were involved in Booth’s kidnapping conspiracy, but apparently not in the assassination plot. Nonetheless, they were sentenced to life in prison. Spangler, who had held Booth’s horse behind Ford’s Theatre, was found guilty and sentenced to prison, although he was innocent.

Mary Surratt was believed to have played a central role in organizing the conspiracy, so she was sentenced to death, as were Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt. On July 7, the four were hanged at the same time on an extended scaffold.

**Dr. Mudd was sentenced to prison in Florida, but his sentence was commuted by President Johnson four years later in 1869,** in part for his help in a prison epidemic. He returned to his Maryland farm, where he died in 1883. Before he died, he confessed to the son of Samuel Cox (whose father had hidden Booth and Herold in the woods until they could cross the Potomac) that he’d recognized Booth the moment he showed up the night of April 14, 1865.
