## Chapter 3.2: Orientalism in the Modern Age

In the last chapter, we saw how Orientalist scholarship and writing animated, motivated, and rationalized European imperialism by reinforcing the fundamental power imbalance between East and West. In this chapter, we will see how Orientalism reacted to historical developments in the 20th and 21st centuries, when the peoples and nations of the Orient began resisting European imperialism, forging their own political identity, and competing with the West on more equal terms. Specifically, we’ll look at:

  * How Orientalism remained rooted in its reductive and essentialist discourse, even as other academic disciplines reacted to a changing world
  * How Orientalist scholars opposed political developments like Arab nationalism, seeing them as deviations or perversions from the essential, eternal Oriental state of mind, which was to be passive, compliant, and accept domination by others
  * How the United States emerged as the preeminent Western power after World War Two and made its own contributions to Orientalism
  * How 20th-century political flashpoints like the oil crisis of the early 1970s and the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict that shaped Western popular images of the Orient still built upon centuries-old Orientalist tropes



### Resisting the Tides of Change

After World War One, European scholars working in academic disciplines dealing with studies of Asian history and culture began to approach their subject in a different way.

They studied the East in the hopes of learning _from_ it, thereby rejuvenating the West and easing the cultural crisis and alienation brought on by the experience of war, violent ethno-nationalism, and economic depression. They emerged with a recognition that the West needed the East as much as vice versa. As Europe descended into the horrors of fascism, the Orient seemed to be bursting with new potential and developments that pointed toward the region playing a major role in the global future: Arab nationalism, self-determination, the Zionist movement, and the economic power of oil. The East was flowering; the West seemed to be entering a new dark age.

**With the postwar rise of independence movements across the Middle East, it became clear that the Orient _was_ indeed a dynamic and changing place, whose peoples yearned for self-determination. **The Orient could now be seen as an entity that acted on its own, rather than one that was merely acted upon. Accordingly, a new generation of scholars began to study cross-cultural synthesis, writing about how Europe and the Orient had influenced one another at crucial junctures throughout history, instead of presenting it as a one-sided exchange.

**Despite these readjustments in scholarly focus in other fields, however, Orientalism remained rooted in its fundamental “us and them” outlook.** As we’ve emphasized, a central tenet of Orientalism was that the people of the Orient were unchanging through time. This belief, which the Orientalists accepted as an unquestionable fact, made Orientalism as a whole resistant to change or revision. To accept the dynamism of Arab or Islamic society and its power to act would be to undermine the very edifice of Orientalism.

Indeed, comparative cultural analysis only made the Orientalist world (particularly those scholars dealing with the Islamic Orient) _more_ aware of the fundamental and irreconcilable differences between East and West. This was largely due to these Orientalists' fixed ideas about Islam. They saw Islam as fundamentally incompatible with modernity. Increased study of Islamic texts and sources could only confirm them in this belief.

#### Example: H.A.R. Gibb and the East-West Divide

**The Orientalists strove to maintain the barrier between East and West**. For scholars like H.A.R. Gibb (1895-1971), keeping this wall of separation intact was paramount. As we’ve seen, the West had defined itself since ancient times in opposition to the East. If these lines were to become blurred, the West might find itself without an identity of its own.

This was a major reason why figures like Gibb remained steadfastly opposed to modern political developments like Arab nationalism. **The success of the national independence movements threatened to knock down the barriers between East and West and possibly even put the East on equal footing with the West.**

Thus, despite the changes taking place within other academic disciplines during this era, Semitic or Islamic Orientalism remained insular and backward-looking in its outlook and core assumptions. It continued to root the region’s complex contemporary conflicts and political problems in ancient, Biblical sources—such as explaining the emerging Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the lens of the Old Testament story of Isaac and Ishmael (In the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, Isaac is the true heir of the Abrahamic covenant with God; in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, this figure is Abraham’s other son, Ishmael). Twentieth-century Orientalists saw these conflicts as manifestations of an “eternal” struggle between East and West, a clash of civilizations brought on by the ancient hostility of the East toward the West.

Yet, in spite of its increasingly clear failures to describe reality, Orientalism remained a discipline in good standing well into the modern age, with works on topics such as “the Islamic mind” or the “Arab character” continuing to find publication in elite academic journals throughout the 20th century.

### Postcolonial Orientalism

**After the end of the Second World War, financially and militarily exhausted colonial powers like Great Britain and France began to lose their grip on their Middle Eastern colonial possessions.** In the postwar decades, most of the former colonies threw off the shackles of European imperialism and gained independence.

This turn of events _should_ have forced a reckoning within Orientalist circles, if not an outright rejection of Orientalist modes of thought. After all, the supposedly lethargic, unoriginal, and unchanging Orient was suddenly asserting itself and forging a new political identity. But old-guard Orientalists like Gibb refused to adapt their ideas even in face of a politically armed and dynamic Orient.

In a 1963 lecture, Gibb was _still_ asserting that the politics of the Arab world could not possibly be motivated by modern political ideologies like communism, nationalism, or anti-colonialism. Those were products of the Western tradition; the “Oriental” was forever constrained by his status as an “Oriental.” Any deviation from this preordained role was a betrayal or perversion of his essential character.

Figures like Gibb saw these complex movements toward self-determination as unorganized outbursts of enthusiasm. The Arabs may have been capable of political agitation, but it would typically be short-lived and, ultimately, self-destructive. The Arab temperament was incapable of conceiving, let alone acting upon, a collective political program for the benefit of their nation or society as a whole. Their innate parochialism and loyalty to tribe or clan would inevitably trump the formation of larger political identities or coherent ideologies. These were Western political achievements of which “the Arab” was incapable.

### The United States: New Colonial Power

Financially and militarily exhausted by the war and no longer able to maintain their far-flung Asian and African colonial outposts, the British and French empires entered a period of sharp and permanent decline.**In the postwar world, the United States would emerge as the preeminent Western power.**

As the Cold War (1945-1991) began to take shape, Western strategists and policymakers feared that the Soviet Union would step into the power vacuum left by Britain and France and turn the Middle East into a launchpad for the export of communism. This was the beginning of America’s active role in Middle Eastern politics, which it maintains to this day.

The United States also took a leading role in driving Orientalism. American Orientalism would be inextricably linked to Cold War geopolitics, with think tanks and university cultural relations programs in Islamic or Middle Eastern studies being funded by the United States Department of Defense, the Ford Foundation, the RAND Corporation, as well as major banks, oil companies, and other pillars of the US national security establishment. Orientalism served a valuable role in the Cold War as the Middle East became a theater of war throughout the conflict, with flashpoints like the Suez Crisis (1956), the Six-Day War (1967), and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979-1989) creating fresh demand for the service and expertise of Orientalists.

Although it assumed a new cast and justification (containing and rolling back Soviet influence), American policy in the Middle East remained guided by the same Orientalist stereotypes and assumptions that had shaped the West’s actions in the region since Napoleon’s Egypt expedition in 1798. **The Orient remained an object to be shaped, manipulated, dominated, and _defined_ by Western interests.**

This idea of an unchanging and essential Orient continued to have currency throughout the 20th century, creating a space for old-guard Orientalists to influence American foreign policy—such as when the US Department of State sent specialists in the history of medieval Islamic guilds to advise American embassy officials in the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War.

### Neo-Orientalism

**In the latter decades of the 20th century, Orientalism became recast as “area studies,” but the same assumptions and power dynamics remained.** Rather than being based around the scholarly study of ancient languages and artifacts, studies of the Orient were becoming more geographically based and strategic in their purpose. Building on its legacy as a partner to European imperialism, Orientalism after World War Two refocused itself to become a tool of American policymaking, helping the United States formulate its response to the rapidly changing and strategically vital Middle East.

Well into the 1960s and 1970s, area studies specialists were publishing papers analyzing the failure of the “Semitic” people to produce great cultural achievements on par with those of the West. This was little more than neo-Orientalism, with crude and reductive analyses of Arabs and Muslims still finding a welcome audience in prestigious academic journals.

Figures like the Austrian historian Gustave von Grunebaum (1909-1972) argued that Islam was rooted in its classical past, unaltered by the changing world. There was no such thing as classical, medieval, or modern Islam—there was only Islam as it always had been and always would be.

For figures like von Grunebaum, the entire history and culture of the Middle East could be understood through the lens of Islam. It was the sole, all-encompassing feature of Arab life. Unfortunately, these reductive and simplistic explanations of Islam, Arabs, and their relation to Europe and America continued to have great intellectual and popular currency well into the late 20th century.

#### Example #1: The Cambridge History of Islam

An example of the lingering effects of Orientalism can be found in the _Cambridge History of Islam_ (1970). The two-volume history—written and edited almost entirely by European and American scholars—failed to examine Muslim theology on its own terms, instead focusing only on Islam’s history of conquest (and thus, its threats to the West) and the rise and fall of Islamic dynasties.

Among other glaring oversights, the _Cambridge History of Islam_ also ignored the stunning cultural achievements of the Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258) and dismissed the seriousness of postwar anticolonialist politics.

#### Example #2: Samuel Huntington and the “Clash of Civilizations”

**Modern scholars like the American political scientist Samuel Huntington (1927-2008) have posited that there is a fundamental “clash of civilizations” between the liberal, secular West and the Islamic world.**

Huntington argued in 1993 that these two religious and cultural traditions formed distinct blocs organized around irreconcilable values and worldviews. He traced the evolution of this conflict from the initial Islamic conquests and clashes with Christian Europe in the 7th century to the Crusades of the 11th-13th centuries, to the threat of the Muslim Ottoman Empire from the 15th to the 20th century, to the Israeli-Palestine conflict of our time.

The “clash of civilizations” theory held that cultural conflict between the West and Islam would form the main theatre of geopolitical conflict in the years following the Cold War. This view gained many adherents in the West, as it seemed especially prescient following the attacks of September 11 and the subsequent US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

**But the notion of the “clash of civilizations” is rooted in old, false Orientalist assumptions.** Cultures are, in fact, syncretic and related. They influence and shape one another and do not have neat distinctions like “the Muslim world” or “Western civilization.” These are ideological constructions and invented identities. As we’ve seen, the very ability to create neat distinctions like “West” and “Orient” is itself a function of power.

#### Example #3: Arabs in Pop Culture

**We also see the lingering effects of Orientalism in the way Arabs are portrayed in Western popular culture.**

These portrayals became more prevalent in Western popular culture following the 1973 oil shock, in which several Middle Eastern oil-producing states withheld American access to petroleum products to protest US support for Israel.

For consumers in the West, the resulting gas shortages and price shocks (which often benefitted American oil companies) represented a dangerous and shocking inversion of the “natural” order. Here, for the first time, was the Orient exercising its autonomy and exerting economic power over the West.

The cultural impact of the oil shock in the West was significant, as Arabs became stock villains, seen as greedy dictators or violent, maniacal terrorists. Around this time, in political cartoons in American and European newspapers, Arabs began to be represented using racist caricatures featuring hooked noses, mustaches, and leering expressions. Disturbingly, these portrayals echo the depictions of Jews in the antisemitic propaganda of the Third Reich—perhaps unsurprising, given the Orientalist tradition of lumping Jews and Arabs together as “Semites.”

Beyond their physical portrayal, successful Hollywood films like _Network_ (1976), _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (1981), and _The Mummy_ (1999) depict Arabs as manipulative, cunning, lecherous, deceitful, and greedy.

### Israel, the Arabs, and Modern Orientalism

**The 1948 creation of the State of Israel was a watershed moment in 20th-century relations between the West and the Muslim world.**

The creation of the Jewish state and the subsequent Israeli victory in the 1947-1949 Palestine War resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Arab Muslim Palestinians and the annexation of Palestinian land—a political crisis that continues to this day.

Western journalistic accounts reduced this complex humanitarian, political, sectarian, and economic conflict to familiar colonial and Orientalist tropes. In this narrative, brave and heroic Jewish Israeli settlers were forging a new homeland on the lands where their ancient forebears had once ruled.

Like their British and French colonial forebears who wished to bring civilization and modernity to the benighted Arabs, these modern-day Israeli pioneers were planting the seeds of civilization in the face of barbaric, murderous opposition from the Palestinian Arab hordes. This narrative harkened back to the colonial myths promoted by figures like Kipling and Lawrence, with Israelis fulfilling the postwar version of the “white man’s burden” to civilize and tame the Orient.

#### Example #1: “Do the Arabs Want Peace?”

**Western media commentators and public officials (especially in the United States) refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of Palestinian objections to the Israeli military occupation and subsequent construction of Jewish settlements on lands seized from Palestinians.**

Palestinian resistance to Israel was dismissed as being based in ignorance, religious mania, and violent anti-Semitism. Palestinians were simply “terrorists,” irreducibly barbaric and hellbent on Israel’s destruction. This was a modern replay of the old Orientalist trope of Arabs being driven entirely by passion and emotion—it was not possible for them to be motivated by rational political concerns. They could only be the essentially violent and irrational people they had _always_ been.

This modern spin on Orientalism was expressed by writers like the American political scientist Gil Carl Alroy (1924-1985), who argued that the Arabs were inflexibly opposed to peace and could not be trusted to abide by any political settlement in his 1974 article “Do the Arabs Want Peace?” published in _Commentary_ magazine.

Yet again, here was a Western commentator purporting to speak with authority on the essential character and mind of an entire culture. It was the role of the Orientalist to write; it was the role of the Orient to be written about.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict provided fodder for the Western academic press, with books featuring titles like _Temperament and Character of the Arabs_ continuing to be published.

Such works pathologized and delegitimized anti-colonialism and pan-Arabism as perversions of the natural order and deviations from the essential, unchanging Arab mindset—which was to be politically impotent and submissive.

#### Example #2: Bernard Lewis and Muslim Anti-Semitism

Perhaps the most famous and influential of modern-day Orientalist writers was the British-American historian and public intellectual Bernard Lewis (1916-2018), who was among the editors of the _Cambridge History of Islam_ , the shortcomings of which we discussed earlier in this chapter.

Lewis was a ubiquitous presence in academic journals and a frequent television commentator in the United States in the 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. With his sonorous voice and erudite style, Lewis presented himself as a serious, sober scholar imparting “objective” wisdom about the Arab world.

Yet Lewis was steeped in the same Orientalist tradition that had hampered the perspectives of Western commentators on the East since the 18th century. He believed that Islam was fundamentally unchanging and that this fact could explain most of contemporary Middle Eastern politics. Lewis infantilized the Orient, arguing that political upheavals like the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and the Arab Spring of 2011 were temporary excitements, bursts of passions that would eventually die down when the Arabs reverted to their essential political submissiveness.

An ardent supporter of the Israeli position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, **Lewis argued that Islam was an inherently anti-Semitic faith, motivated by irrational hatred for the Jewish people.** In reducing Arab Muslim grievances to pathological, murderous anti-Semitism, Lewis ignored substantive objections to specific Israeli policies, including:

  * The Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip
  * The construction of Jewish settlements on land held under military occupation, in violation of international law
  * The denial of immigration rights to Palestinian Arabs and the parallel Law of Return, which allows foreigners of Jewish ancestry to settle and obtain Israeli citizenship



For Lewis, these nuances were simply irrelevant to his preferred narrative of civilized (i.e., white European) Israelis against barbarous (i.e., Arab Muslim) “Orientals.”

(Shortform note: Edward Said and Bernard Lewis had an intense academic rivalry for most of the latter decades of the 20th century, ending only when Said passed away in 2003. The two frequently sparred with one another in the academic press, in mainstream print media, and on television, with Lewis even going so far as to question Said’s basic competence as a historian. To learn more about the Said-Lewis debate, read “Orientalism: An Exchange” published in the New York Review of Books in 1982.)
