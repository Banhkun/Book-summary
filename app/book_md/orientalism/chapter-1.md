## Chapter 1: The Structure and Core Ideas of Orientalism

As we mentioned in the Introduction, Orientalism is the intellectual framework by which European (and later, American) scholars, diplomats, imperial administrators, and policymakers created the idea of an alien, oppositional, and unchanging “East.” In this chapter, we’ll define and flesh out Orientalism as a concept by exploring:

  * Orientalism’s function as a creator of knowledge about the Middle East
  * How Orientalist modes of thought helped to justify and power Western imperial ambitions in the region
  * How the Orientalist framework positioned the East as an entity that was incapable of acting upon its own agency or initiative—and therefore required European guidance and intervention
  * How Orientalism promoted the idea of the peoples and societies of the Middle East as being unchanged since ancient times, contributing to the concept of an essential “Oriental Mind”



### Knowledge as Power

**The knowledge produced and disseminated by the Orientalist tradition was a source of tremendous power for the West in its efforts to subjugate and subordinate the East.**

Beginning in the early 18th century, Orientalism began to emerge and diversify as an academic discipline, with its experts and practitioners positioning themselves as the authoritative “interpreters” of the Orient, both for Western audiences and, as the Age of Imperialism dawned, for the people of the region themselves.

Later, in public speeches and written works, figures like Arthur James Balfour (1848-1930), First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Empire and, later, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; and Evelyn Baring (1841-1917), 1st Lord of Cromer and first British Consul-General of Egypt, asserted **the Orientalist position that the Orient was a fantastic, wild, but ultimately static and unchanging place.**

Balfour was a figure thoroughly rooted in Orientalist assumptions about the Middle East. A stately and high-ranking figure in the administration of the British Empire, he had held key posts in countries from Ireland to Afghanistan to South Africa. In a memorable speech before the House of Commons in 1910, he justified the British occupation of Egypt on the grounds of the wealth of knowledge that British scholars had accumulated about the country. Because they knew so much already, the country would be easy to administer and expropriate for British strategic and commercial purposes. And what had this knowledge “taught” them? That Egypt—and the Orient writ large—was unchanging, incapable of self-government, and capable of flourishing only under conditions of despotism.

This last point was crucial to Balfour’s argument. If the benighted Egyptians could not govern themselves and had always submitted to the will of iron-fisted rulers, why shouldn’t those rulers be the enlightened, humane British? Only Europeans, Balfour argued, had the right combination of strength, ingenuity, but also humanity to serve as Egypt’s rightful masters.

The Orient, rather than being a complex and evolving society of people with its own political and economic agency, was, in the view of Orientalists like Balfour and Cromer, an object to be studied, described, represented, and, ultimately, mastered by Western powers.

This was why the production of knowledge about the Orient was so vitally important—the extensive knowledge that British and French Orientalists had about the ancient cultures, languages, and history of the Orient was precisely what made them fit to rule it and bring it out of its decrepit state into the light of the modern world.

#### Reverence for the Ancient World

The Orientalists’ admiration for the ancient world of the Orient was important in this production of knowledge. They viewed with awe the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Syria. For them, the Orient was the cradle of civilization itself, the great well from which Greek, later Roman, and, finally, their own Western European civilization had sprung.

But crucially, **they saw the _modern_ Orient as having remained essentially unchanged in the millennia that had passed since ancient times.** European civilization, in their telling, had thoroughly eclipsed its Eastern forebears. The Orient, it’s true, may have been home to the world’s first civilizations, but they had already passed their peak before Western civilization had truly begun. The West had birthed political ideals like democracy, the rule of law, representative institutions, and free enterprise; the Orient languished in decadent and backward despotism. The West had developed advanced technologies and sophisticated, rational state structures that enabled it to navigate the world and export its ideals; the Orient, meanwhile, was parochial and conservative, caring little about the world beyond.

After their launch of human civilization in the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia and the valley of the Nile, the “Orientals” had fallen into a state of perpetual arrested development, having neglected to maintain their own glorious tradition.

#### The Benevolence of Empire

Therefore, the Orientalists, with their unparalleled knowledge of the achievements of the Orient (which, to them, was eternal and unchanging) were the _true_ guardians and inheritors of that tradition—more so than the people who actually lived in the Middle East.

For the Orientalist, the views of the people of the Orient _themselves_ were irrelevant, as they were clearly incapable of self-government or judging their own self-interest. To supposedly enlightened British imperialists like Balfour and Cromer, empire-making was _not_ mere conquest or subjugation. Instead, they genuinely believed it to be an inherently humanitarian enterprise, one in which colonial officials, scholars, and entrepreneurs were engaged in a great civilizing mission. Their role would be to protect the heritage and allure of the Orient from the depredations of the “Orientals.”

### The Myth of the Oriental Mind

**As previously noted, a hallmark of Orientalist thought was the idea that the Orient was a monolithic mass whose people, culture, and society had remained unchanged since the days of the ancient civilizations.** Moreover, Orientalists believed there to be little if any distinction between cultures _within_ the Orient—it was all one undifferentiated mass, so what was true for Egypt was also true for Iran, Transjordan, Palestine, and Arabia.

This belief in an essential, static, and unchanging Orient enabled Orientalists to make sweeping generalizations about the mental framework of the millions of people living in the Middle East—despite the enormous cultural, social, ethnic, and linguistic diversity of the region.

**The idea that the Orient was static and unmoved by the forces of modernity directly fed the myth of the supposed “Oriental mind.”** In the Orientalist telling, the “Oriental mind” was incapable of the kind of objectivity and rationality that would enable the people of the region to develop enlightened European institutions like science, representative democracy, capitalism, and the rule of law. Instead, the people of the Orient saw everything as subjective and transactional. As a people, they were vengeful, emotional, dishonest, and violently obsessed with shame and honor.

This speaks to another aspect of Orientalist thought: its essentialism regarding the peoples of the region. Orientalists believed that non-Westerners shared a set of essential characteristics that made them who they are. According to this mode of thinking, a person’s identity as an “Oriental” was the most important fact one needed to know about them. Every other aspect of their humanity was secondary to it and could be explained by reference to it.

We see these attitudes in works from the period like _Tancred_ , an 1847 novel by British parliamentary backbencher (and future Prime Minister) Benjamin Disraeli. The novel details the adventures of the titular protagonist, a member of the British landed gentry, who travels to the Holy Land in the footsteps of the Crusaders, in an attempt to connect more deeply with his Christianity. Tancred’s interactions with the people he encounters there come down to the essential and unalterable racial characteristics. Whether they are Jews, Muslims, or Druzes matters little, they are _all_ fundamentally “Orientals.” An “Oriental” worships, lives, eats, fights, and dies as an “Oriental.” No matter what he does or thinks, he can never shake loose this fundamental component of his identity.

#### Orientalism and Scientific Racism

These ideas of essential or innate characteristics shared by groups of people are closely tied to scientific racism, which was broadly accepted within the Western academic community from the 18th century through the first half of the 20th century. These ideas were only finally discredited when they were carried to their logical (and catastrophic) conclusion by the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Scientific racism argued that humanity was divided up into different races (like the “Asiatic,” the “Aryan,” the “Negroid,” the “Semitic,” and so on), each with their own set of immutable characteristics. Thus, a race scientist could speak of the behaviors of “the Asiatic” or “the Oriental” just as a naturalist might describe the behavior of “the gazelle” or “the antelope” in the wild. The individual was largely irrelevant to this system of classification. What mattered most was the racial group to which she belonged.

### The Passive Orient

Because of its perceived failure to keep up with European political, economic, and technological advances, the Orient was seen by the Orientalists as incapable of acting upon its own agency or initiative.

**In Orientalist writings, the Orient is forever in the passive position. It can never _act_ of its own accord; it can only be acted _upon_. **Even when Orientalists _did_ encounter unmistakable evidence of political agency and will among people of the region (as with, for example, the Egyptian nationalist movement, which gained momentum in the late 19th century) they could comfortably write it off as an anomaly.

This was because the people of the Middle East lacked the initiative and innate racial characteristics (as the Orientalists saw it) to break free from their ancient superstitions and irrationality. They would forever be at the mercy of events, never in control of their own destiny—and certainly incapable of gaining the requisite knowledge and enlightenment to bridge their gap with the West on their own.
