## Exercise: Challenge Your Preconceptions

Think about how your ideas about other cultures may be rooted in false assumptions.

* * *

What false or overly simplistic preconceived ideas have you had about cultures, religions, and/or ethnicities other than your own?

How do you think you came to believe these things? Did someone teach them to you, or did you simply absorb them without actively learning them? Briefly explain your answer.

What caused you to rethink these preconceived ideas about other cultures and adopt a more nuanced approach? How can you avoid accepting stereotypes and simplified understandings of other cultures in the future?
