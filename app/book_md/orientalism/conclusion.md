## Conclusion

**Our analysis of Western representations (and, under the influence of Orientalism,_mis_ representations) of the East raises a key question: How do you represent a culture?**

Perhaps more fundamentally, is there even such a thing as a “separate” culture or culture zone, or are divisions of the world into neat categories like “West” and “Orient” simply fictions left over from the age of European imperialism?

It is not the case that the West can only be written about by Westerners or the Muslim world written about only by Muslims. But scholars, policymakers, cultural commentators, and even members of the general public must resist the temptation to fall into either ethnocentrism when analyzing their own culture, or dismissal and chauvinism when analyzing other cultures.

Our discussion of the ideological pitfalls—and real-world consequences—of Orientalism show that **the role of the scholar should be to question and scrutinize politically motivated myths, not to help manufacture them.**

Thankfully, there are alternatives to Orientalism for those who wish to engage in thoughtful area studies about the Middle East. Today’s scholars are increasingly discarding the concept of a monolithic “Orient” in which one can become an expert. Instead, they are narrowing their focus to study specific problems and societies, without reference to a larger “Oriental” superstructure.

Scholars and researchers on Middle Eastern society and culture are employing a more multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from disciplines such as economics, sociology, postcolonial studies, and feminist theory. This helps to ensure that scholarship is submitted to more rigorous and holistic peer review, while serving to break the old Orientalist stranglehold of fields like philology, textualism, and archeology on Middle East area studies.

The emerging field of postcolonialism (which studies the political, economic, and social impacts of colonialism) holds great promise for deconstructing Orientalist myths, as does the diversification of graduate programs in Europe and the United States since the 1960s, which has seen more women and students of color enter these fields that were once the sole provenance of white men.

**The most important takeaway from _Orientalism_ is that that knowledge is _not_ inherently neutral or objective. **If our study of Orientalism teaches us anything, it is that knowledge can always be manipulated to serve the interests of the powerful against the powerless.
