## Exercise: Question Your Objectivity

Explore how what you accept as fact may actually be heavily influenced by your own cultural biases.

* * *

In a few sentences, give an example of a contemporary issue (perhaps the Israel-Palestine conflict or the 2003 US invasion of Iraq) where your ideas of what’s “objective” or “true” might be influenced by your culture and values—and why someone with a different set of cultural values might see things differently.

Given that people might be able to arrive at such radically different ideas about the same issue, do you think that there is truly such a thing as objectivity? Is everything in the modern world a question of subjective experience? Explain your answer.
