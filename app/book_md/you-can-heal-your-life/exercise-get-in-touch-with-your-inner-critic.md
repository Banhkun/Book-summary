## Exercise: Get in Touch With Your Inner Critic

Hay says that we can solve our problems by transforming self-criticism into self-love. To do this, we must first identify the negative beliefs we have about ourselves. One approach that Hay suggests is to listen to the critical voice in your head—your “inner critic”—and meet it with compassion.

* * *

Set aside a minute or two and, while contemplating some of the challenges in your life or your goals for the future, **write down all of the critical thoughts** that come to mind. For example, if your goal is to start your own business, perhaps you might think, “But you never finish what you start,” or, “You’re terrible at math, how are you going to keep a business afloat?”

Next, identify the earliest source of each of your critical thoughts. For example, did your father often blame you for not finishing projects you started? Did your fifth-grade teacher tell you that you were awful at math? Maybe your inner critic isn’t “you” at all. Perhaps it’s the negative belief systems you learned in childhood.

Hay says that the key to transforming self-criticism into self-love is self-compassion: Accepting yourself exactly as you are, flaws and all. Another approach is to challenge your critical thoughts: Are they accurate?nnReview your critical thoughts and, for each, determine whether they are objectively accurate. If they are, see if you can accept that aspect of yourself. For example, maybe you’re actually good at math, but your experience with your fifth-grade teacher scarred you. Or, if you can’t do basic math to save your life, you could acknowledge that it’s okay to be bad at math—you might not need that skill to start your own business, as computers or an accountant can do much of the work for you.
