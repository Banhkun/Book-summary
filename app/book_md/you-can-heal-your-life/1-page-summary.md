## 1-Page Summary

In _You Can Heal Your Life_ , self-help author Louise Hay claims that your thoughts create your reality. She argues that negative experiences in childhood cause us to form negative beliefs about the world, which in turn manifest in negative life experiences. She says that the solution is simple: By transforming your negative thoughts into positive ones, you can create positive experiences in your life. You can change all of your circumstances for the better, solving your problems with relationships, money, and work—even healing disease and illness.

Some have called Hay one of the founders of the modern self-help movement. Hay herself says that she created her own company to publish _You Can Heal Your Life_ in 1984 because, at the time, bookstores didn’t have self-help sections; she didn’t think any traditional publisher would be interested in the book. However, it ultimately became a massive best seller, hitting the _New York Times_ best-seller list _twice_ , 22 years apart.

  * Our guide organizes Hay’s advice into three sections. Part 1 discusses her beliefs about where our problems come from. Part 2 explores how we can solve those problems. And Part 3 offers advice for specific types of problems.



We place Hay’s ideas in context by examining the ways in which recent advancements in the fields of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience shine new light on Hay’s ideas, supporting some and calling others into question. We also contrast Hay’s theories with those in other popular self-help and wellness books, such as _Think and Grow Rich_ , _Loving What Is_ , and _The Body Keeps the Score_.

> **Controversy Surrounding Hay’s Teachings About AIDS**
> 
> As popular as Hay’s teachings on positive thinking are, they are also controversial. This is due in large part to her beliefs about AIDS, which she shared in _You Can Heal Your Life_ and with AIDS support groups that she started in the 1980s. The groups began with six gay men in Hay’s living room and grew to encompass 800 people meeting weekly in an auditorium in Los Angeles.
> 
> During the meetings—as she does in the book—Hay preached the power of positive thinking and self-love to heal AIDS, which she believed was caused by negative thoughts. While some found hope in her message, others noted its tendency to blame those with AIDS for their own illness. These critics reasoned that if your thoughts could both heal and cause disease, then not only were you at fault for getting sick in the first place, but when you failed to cure yourself with the power of thought, that was your fault, too.
> 
> The science has been clear since 1985 that AIDS is caused by a virus—HIV. Hay’s critics point out that **teaching that HIV and AIDS can be cured by positive thoughts is not only victim-blaming and dangerous but also potentially deadly, as it can prevent people from seeking life-saving medical treatment.**
> 
> Modern commentators have noted that Hay’s popularity during the early years of the AIDS epidemic was due to the fact that there were very few people or institutions offering _any_ messages of love to those with AIDS, who were often treated as pariahs. Hay’s defenders argue that she offered a welcoming space where those who had nowhere else to turn could celebrate life, rather than focus on death.
> 
> Her critics argue, however, that she took advantage of desperate people to grow her following and profit handsomely. In fact, she didn’t become famous as a self-help “guru”—and _You Can Heal You Life_ didn’t become a best seller—until she appeared on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ in 1988 to discuss her work with people with HIV and AIDS.

### Part 1: All Problems Are Rooted in Negative Childhood Experiences

Hay claims that all of the problems in our lives are the result of two things: negative experiences in childhood and the belief systems that form as a result.

#### Negative Childhood Experiences Create Negative Beliefs

Hay says that **when we’re children, we mirror the thoughts of the adults around us**. For example, if your parents told you that you were stupid when you were a kid, you’re likely to believe that you’re stupid later in life—and to talk to yourself in the same shaming way that your parents once talked to you. (If, on the other hand, they praised you and constantly reminded you how much they loved you, you’re likely to love yourself when you’re older.) Similarly, if your parents were cruel to each other or to you, you learn to relate to others with cruelty.

#### Negative Beliefs Create Negative Experiences

Hay asserts that **once our belief systems are formed in childhood, we spend our lives “creating” experiences that mirror those beliefs**. Therefore, our negative thoughts result in negative experiences: All external problems (our experiences) are manifestations of inner problems (our beliefs).

How exactly does this happen? Hay claims that the belief systems we learned as children act as a type of filter through which we view the world, causing us to accept as “true” only the experiences or information that confirm our existing, subconscious beliefs. For example, if you were told as a child that you were a failure who would never amount to anything, then you’ll subconsciously believe that you’re a failure. Even if you go on to live a life full of career or personal successes, you’ll focus on your mistakes instead—and continue to see yourself as a failure. In this way, your thoughts “become” your reality.

Not only do your subconscious beliefs affect your perspective on the world, argues Hay, but your subconscious mind also believes everything your _conscious_ thoughts tell it. **When you think negative thoughts** , your subconscious believes them to be true. Hay claims that as a result, **you “attract” negative experiences into your life**. For example, if you spill your coffee on your way to work and think to yourself, “This is the beginning of an awful day,” then your negative mindset will cause bad things to happen to you for the rest of the day.

##### **Examples From Hay’s Life**

Hay’s own life led her to believe that all problems are rooted in negative childhood experiences. She grew up poor during the Great Depression, with a stepfather who abused her. She was raped by a neighbor around the age of five, and was frequently told that it was her fault. She continued to experience sexual and physical abuse throughout her childhood until she ran away from home at age 15.

As Hay grew older, she had many relationships with abusive men. She believes this was because of the abuse she suffered as a child, which damaged her self-esteem so much that she unconsciously thought she deserved to be mistreated. Later, as her sense of self-worth improved and she stopped believing that she deserved abuse, she stopped dating abusive men.

In addition to her relationship issues, Hay was diagnosed with cancer as an adult. She already believed that cancer was caused by longstanding resentment and anger (and she’d written a book, _Heal Your Body_ , arguing that negative thoughts can cause illness). She thought her own cancer was caused by resentment toward her parents for how they’d treated her when she was a child. Her childhood lacked love and her parents’ criticism of her had taught her to criticize herself, so she resolved after her cancer diagnosis to change her critical thoughts and start loving herself. She did this in part by repeating positive affirmations to herself in front of a mirror.

She also went to therapy. The therapist helped her release her anger about the abuse she’d suffered as a child, and also helped her understand that her parents had hurt her because they’d been hurt themselves. Understanding the ways in which her parents were damaged helped Hay have compassion for them and, ultimately, forgive them. Hay says that **after only six months, by learning to love herself and forgiving those who’d hurt her, she cured herself of cancer**. As we’ll see throughout this guide, Hay credits her healing with **positive thinking, forgiveness, and self-love.**

> **Childhood Trauma and Mental and Physical Health**
> 
> The childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse that Hay describes are known in modern psychological literature as trauma. Trauma research tends to support Hay’s theory that childhood trauma alters our **beliefs** on a _subconscious_ level, which can lead to negative experiences in adulthood. However, Hay’s claim that _conscious_ negative thoughts “**attract** ” or “create” negative experiences—and its corollary, the idea that altering your conscious thoughts is sufficient to heal your trauma—is unsupported by scientific evidence.
> 
> Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, in his best-selling book _The Body Keeps the Score_ , explains that **traumatic experiences actually rewire the brain to make people hypervigilant to threats**. The slightest hint of a threat sends trauma survivors into a fight-or-flight response, causing stress hormones to flood their bodies and keep them in a state of hyperarousal long after the threat is gone. Over time, these high levels of chronic stress can cause mental and physical ailments and hamper trauma survivors’ ability to function emotionally and socially.
> 
> Thus, in some respects, Hay’s theory that negative childhood experiences lead to negative life experiences bears a resemblance to more recent theories of trauma. Trauma changes the way the brain works on a _subconscious_ level, causing adults who have experienced childhood trauma, as Hay did, to **struggle to take control of their lives, have functioning relationships, and stay mentally and physically healthy**. However, this same research tells us that trauma rewires survivors’ brains in such a way that many actions are beyond their _conscious_ control, which contradicts Hay’s assertion that positive self-talk can change the way they see the world.

### Part 2: Positive Thoughts Can Solve Our Problems

Hay asserts that just as negative thoughts create negative experiences, positive thoughts attract positive experiences. Thus, by transforming our negative thoughts into positive ones, we can resolve all of the problems in our lives, from relationship woes to serious illnesses and diseases.

She advocates three primary methods for changing our negative thoughts into positive ones: positive affirmations, forgiveness, and self-love. First, we’ll explore positive affirmations, which Hay claims are useful for changing _all_ kinds of negative thoughts into positive ones. Next, we’ll examine forgiveness, which specifically involves changing thoughts of blame into thoughts of compassion. Last, we’ll look at self-love, which requires you to change self-hatred to self-acceptance.

#### Method #1: Harness the Power of Positive Affirmations

Positive affirmations are statements that you make to yourself, either out loud, in your head, or in writing, to counteract your negative thinking. Hay argues that if you dwell on your problems, they will only become worse, but if you substitute positive affirmations in place of negative thoughts, you can attract more positive experiences into your life. Hay reminds us that this is effective because your subconscious mind accepts your conscious thoughts as the truth. For example, if instead of thinking, “I’m so unhappy,” you think, “I am happy,” this positive affirmation will convince your subconscious that you really _are_ happy.

(Shortform note: Most psychologists agree that positive affirmations don’t solve your problems simply by existing. However, some say that the act of repeating positive affirmations can calm anxiety and put you in a more clear frame of mind, which enables you to handle any situation with greater care and better decision making. In this way, you might feel more confident and positive and have better results than had you not repeated any affirmations at all.)

##### Begin With a Willingness to Change

When it comes to the process for using affirmations to create positive change in your life, Hay says that the first step is being _willing_ to change. Because your negative beliefs create a subconscious need to engage in certain negative behaviors and habits, you have to be willing to let go of that need in order to heal.

For example, if you think that you’re odd and unlikeable, you may become dependent on binging TV shows to drown out the pain of your loneliness. To heal, Hay says that you must tell yourself that you’re willing to release the need for your bad habit or behavior—in this case, the need for TV binges. **You must tell yourself that your thoughts created the problem and that you’re willing to give it up.** For example, you could affirm to yourself, “I release the need for TV binges. My thoughts of unworthiness created this need to immerse myself in a fantasy world, and I am willing to give it up.”

(Shortform note: Depending on how you approach it, acknowledging how your thoughts created the problem can decrease or increase feelings of shame, which leads to fear, blame, and disconnection. We can infer that Hay would want us to _decrease_ this negative feeling through our affirmations, so it might be helpful to mentally acknowledge the purpose the behavior served and then declare it no longer needed. For example, in this case, the affirmation might become: “I release the need for TV binges. I used to feel unworthy, and immersing myself in a fantasy world gave me temporary relief. But I am willing to give it up in exchange for long-lasting happiness.”)

Once you’ve affirmed your willingness to change, you can take the next step: turning your desired changes or problems into positive affirmations. For example, you could say to yourself, “I love and accept myself, and I am worthy of love,” or “I have a healthy relationship with streaming shows.” Note that these affirmations are stated in the _present tense_ —Hay says that this is crucial. It tells your subconscious mind that, for example, you love yourself _now_ , rather than telling it that you will love yourself at some point in the future. In this way, you can avoid putting off solving your problems.

##### Use Affirmations Consistently and Holistically

While Hay believes that positive affirmations can solve your problems and change your life, she does issue a few caveats when it comes to relying on them. First, she says that if you want to heal yourself, you have to **practice every day** : If you’ve been relying on negative thinking your whole life, it’s not something you can change overnight. (Shortform note: How often is often enough? Some say to begin with repeating your affirmation ten times when you wake up and ten times when you go to bed, and build from there.)

Second, Hay cautions that she doesn’t have all the answers and that different healing techniques work for different people. She advocates a holistic approach to healing that addresses the body, the mind, and the spirit, and includes practices like eating healthy foods and meditating. (Shortform note: The mind-body-spirit connection is a tenet of many ancient and indigenous belief systems, particularly as it relates to healing.)

> **Benefits and Risks of Positive Affirmations and the “Law of Attraction”**
> 
> Hay’s theory that you can “attract” positive experiences by thinking positive thoughts is part of a long tradition of spiritual and self-help teachings often collectively referred to as the “law of attraction.” While these ideas have been around since the 1800s, they’ve been popularized in the last century by a series of best-selling books, including Napoleon Hill’s _Think and Grow Rich_ (1937), Norman Vincent Peale’s _The Power of Positive Thinking_ (1952) and Rhonda Byrne’s _The Secret_ (2006). All of these books have in common the message that your present thoughts create your future reality, which supports the argument for affirmations to always be stated in present tense.
> 
> Studies show that there are many benefits to positive thinking, including increased coping skills during difficult times, lower rates of depression, greater job satisfaction and workplace productivity, and a longer life span. However, researchers caution that positive thinking doesn’t mean ignoring negative thoughts or transforming reality with your mind; instead, it means being an optimistic person and meeting life’s inevitable challenges with a positive attitude.
> 
> The law of attraction also carries with it some risks. As we’ve already alluded to, **one of the most serious risks is that a person will ignore actual harm as a result of positive thinking**.**** Positive thinking can be dangerous or even deadly if a person fails to seek necessary or life-saving medical treatment due to a belief that they can “cure” themselves of a serious illness using positive affirmations. This risk of harm doesn’t just apply to illness and disease. For example, one study found that focusing only on positive thoughts could cause victims of abuse to underestimate its severity and stay in abusive relationships longer, exposing them to increased danger of bodily harm or death.

#### Method #2: Forgive to Change Blame to Compassion

The second method Hay advocates for transforming negative thoughts into positive ones is forgiveness. Hay argues that by using forgiveness to change thoughts of blame into thoughts of compassion, we can leave the negative experiences of our past behind and move forward with our lives. We can even rely on forgiveness to heal from disease, as Hay did.

##### Forgive to Let the Past Go

Hay explains that we often blame other people for our problems, but blaming others actually makes our problems more entrenched. **By placing the blame on others, we fail to take responsibility for ourselves and the problem goes unsolved.** Because our thoughts create our reality, she says, we are the ones responsible for everything that happens to us. Rather than blaming someone for an error they made, it’s better to practice forgiveness and assume responsibility.

Hay says that one exercise you can do to practice forgiveness is to say out loud to yourself the name of the person you need to forgive, then state that you forgive them and identify the specific action or behavior for which you’re forgiving them. Another approach is to imagine the person you have the hardest time forgiving, then visualize good things happening to them.

Because negative childhood experiences can have such an outsized impact on our lives, Hay believes it’s particularly important to forgive your parents. She advocates forgiving your parents or caregivers for the ways in which they’ve wronged you—**not to give them a “free pass” for their behavior, but to help you move forward with your own life**. She suggests asking your parents what _their_ childhoods were like to better understand why they acted the way they did. This will allow you to have more compassion for them, which in turn will allow you to have more compassion for yourself. They were hurt, and they hurt you—but you don’t have to keep hurting yourself, says Hay.

Hay says that once you’ve bestowed forgiveness on the person who you once blamed for your problems, you’ll be able to take control of the situation and begin to solve it. (Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, _Mark Manson makes a clear distinction between _blame and responsibility_. He says that _blame_ is related to who caused the problem, but _responsibility_ is related to who needs to solve it. This is an empowering mindset—you have no control over what happens to you, but you do have control over how you handle it.)

> **Practicing Forgiveness**
> 
> Hay recommends two ways to practice forgiveness: increasing your empathy by learning more about the person who hurt you, and imagining forgiving the person who hurt you or witnessing their good fortune. Research backs up both of these methods.
> 
> Studies show that when we visualize forgiving someone, our neural circuits responsible for empathy light up, demonstrating that empathy is necessary for forgiveness. In addition, studies on childhood bonding demonstrate that children who don’t receive love and attention from their primary caregivers have wounds that can negatively affect all of their future relationships. This research supports Hay’s assertion that understanding the wounds your parents suffered in childhood might help you forgive them.

##### Forgive to Heal From Disease

Hay claims that just as she cured her cancer by forgiving her parents for her abusive childhood, so too can anyone heal from illness if they forgive the people who’ve hurt them. Similarly, she contends that failing to forgive those who hurt you can make you sick, as she says happened to her. In fact, Hay asserts that failing to forgive is the cause of _all_ disease. Bottling up your resentment and anger can eat away at your body and manifest in all types of illnesses. Only by letting that blame go can you heal from disease.

> **Forgiveness and Letting Go of Anger as a Pathway to Better Health**
> 
> While there’s no scientific evidence to suggest that forgiveness can cure cancer or any other disease, some modern research has borne out Hay’s underlying theory that there is a link between forgiveness and improved health.
> 
> Studies show that letting go of anger and resentment can lead to better mental and physical health. Forgiveness can lower the risk of heart attack and reduce depression and anxiety. Research conducted by the Stanford Forgiveness Project demonstrates that, after being taught a specific method for forgiveness, 27% of subjects experienced fewer physical ailments, such as pain, gastrointestinal problems, and dizziness. In addition, 70% reported a decrease in hurt feelings, and 13% experienced reduced anger.
> 
> Why is forgiveness good for your health? Experts say that **chronic anger causes your brain to go into fight-or-flight mode, which increases your stress levels and weakens your immune system, resulting in greater risk of illness**.**** Forgiveness allows you to lower your stress levels and improve your health.****
> 
> Forgiveness doesn’t have to mean reconciling with the person who hurt you or condoning their actions. Experts agree with Hay’s characterization of forgiveness as something you do for yourself, not for the person who hurt you.

#### Method #3: Love Yourself—Changing Self-Hatred to Self-Acceptance

While forgiveness can help us leave the past behind and heal from disease, self-love, argues Hay, is the answer to every problem. Self-love does not mean narcissism or having a big ego. It means believing you’re valuable just as you are.

Hay says that everyone she’s ever known has felt some amount of self-hatred or guilt. Everyone feels that they’re not good enough. Why? Hay claims it's because of the negative beliefs we pick up from adults when we are children. One way to identify and dismantle these beliefs is to make a list of everything your parents (and all the other adults in your life) said was wrong with you. You could also list all the things people told you that you should or shouldn’t do, like becoming a doctor or lawyer, or being less bossy. Next, consider the extent to which your own beliefs about yourself echo those negative or prescriptive beliefs instilled in you by your parents. Armed with this knowledge, you can recognize when the familiar negative self-beliefs creep in and use your affirmations instead.

In order to transform your self-hatred and self-criticism into self-love, Hay instructs that you must **never criticize yourself for anything**. You need to love and approve of yourself exactly as you are, flaws and all. (Shortform note: Because Hay advocates using affirmations to change problem behaviors, we can infer here that she’s not implying that flaws should go unchanged, just that they should go uncriticized. She would likely advise you to approach them with positive phrasing, as with the affirmations.)

If you don’t believe you deserve good things, you’ll never get them, says Hay. You can use mirror work to learn to feel that you deserve positive experiences. Look in the mirror and tell yourself that you deserve to have or be whatever specific thing you desire. For example, you could say “I deserve this promotion,” or “I deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.”

Another way to begin to love yourself is to constantly tell yourself that you approve of yourself. **Each time you have a negative thought about yourself, turn it into a positive affirmation.** For example, if you think to yourself, “I’m so dumb, why can’t I figure this out?” look in the mirror and state, “I’m smart and curious, and I’m able to teach myself to do hard things.”

(Shortform note: Research confirms that self-compassion—treating yourself as you would treat a close friend—can make you more successful, happier, and less stressed. Self-compassion can make you more productive because it allows you to see obstacles or failures as learning opportunities, rather than as evidence that you’re not good enough or you don’t have what it takes to succeed. And just as criticizing yourself can make it harder to pick yourself up after a failure, it can also activate your fight-or-flight response, releasing more of the stress hormone cortisol. Self-compassion, on the other hand, can calm your sympathetic nervous system and decrease stress.)

### Part 3: Using Positive Thinking to Solve Specific Types of Problems

Once you have learned to transform your negative thoughts into positive ones through positive affirmations, forgiveness, and self-love, you can continue to use positive thinking to solve specific types of problems that you encounter in your life. Hay says that turning negative beliefs into positive affirmations can solve problems involving relationships, money, work, and illness.

#### Relationship Problems

Hay asserts that **the things we don’t like about other people are simply reflections of the things we don’t like about ourselves** : Our relationships are reflections of our beliefs. Therefore, if we learn to love our own flaws and quirks, we will no longer be frustrated or annoyed when we encounter those qualities in others.

For example, if you have a friend who you feel is selfish and unreliable, this could be because you believe that _you_ can be selfish and unreliable, and you are projecting your beliefs about yourself onto your friend. Or it could be because you learned as a child that everyone is selfish and unreliable. To address the problems in your relationship, you could use mirror work and positive affirmations to learn to love the selfish and unreliable aspects of yourself, which will translate to forgiveness toward them. Alternatively, you could use these techniques to affirm to yourself that people are generous and reliable, until you believe it—your positive outlook will attract generous, reliable people into your life as a result.

(Shortform note: While Hay’s method for solving relationship problems appears to encourage some reflection about the cause of the problems, it primarily focuses on positive affirmations. One of the risks of using positive affirmations to address relationship challenges, however, is that it encourages people to ignore their problems, focus on the positive, and not communicate with the other person. But all relationships (except your relationship with yourself) involve at least two people, and failure to acknowledge shared issues, much less discuss them with the other person, can destroy interpersonal communication and lead to further relationship breakdown.)

#### Money Problems

Like relationship problems, money problems are rooted in a lack of self-love, says Hay. **If you want to be wealthy, you first need to feel that you deserve it.** If you have negative beliefs about money or your relationship with it, it will be hard for you to accumulate wealth.

Money is in endless supply, asserts Hay, and the only thing keeping us from having money is ourselves. She suggests various ways to change your negative beliefs about money into positive ones:

  * **Show gratitude:** Be grateful for everything you _do_ have.
  * **Clear the way for abundance:** Get rid of old possessions that you don’t use in order to clear the way for new material goods to enter your life.
  * **Appreciate your bills:** Appreciate the bills you receive rather than resenting or fearing them. See bills as evidence that a creditor believes you have the money to pay them.
  * **Demonstrate generosity:** Be happy for other people’s prosperity and generous with the money you do have.
  * **Accept compliments:** If you learn to accept the gift of a compliment, you will attract other types of prosperity to you as well.



Hay claims that each of these approaches will change your negative mindset about finances into a positive one, opening the door for more money to flow into your life.

(Shortform note: Hay’s belief that changing your negative thoughts about money into positive ones can attract more wealth into your life is similar to Napoleon Hill’s theory in _Think and Grow Rich_. He says that if you fill your mind with thoughts of financial success, you can achieve riches. Both Hay and Hill believe that your thoughts create your reality. However, Hill’s recipe for prosperity includes a few steps that Hay omits: He says that in addition to thoughts and desires, wealth also requires planning, work, and persistence. It’s not enough to believe you can become rich— you also need a plan for how to make money, and you must push through obstacles without quitting until you achieve your goals.)

#### Work Problems

Hay says you can also solve work problems by focusing on the positive. She claims that if you don’t like your job or a particular aspect of your work, the solution is not to think about how much you hate it. Instead, you should bless it with love and express positive affirmations about what you want in your career.

For example, you could say, “I have the best boss,” “I am using my talents to their utmost,” or, “I am in a leadership role.” **These positive affirmations will eventually change your belief system and, accordingly, lead to improvements in your work situation.**

(Shortform note: While having a positive attitude is undoubtedly beneficial in any work environment, research indicates that many of the factors that contribute to a positive work experience are outside of an employee’s immediate control. Workplaces that are able to retain the best employees often share characteristics such as fair pay, work-life balance, meaningful work, and empowering employees to provide input and develop their skills.)

#### Illness and Disease

Hay believes that, like all of our problems,**illness and disease are caused by negative thoughts**. She says that there are specific thought patterns that correspond to every conceivable ailment, and she provides a list of mental and physical health issues and the thoughts that likely caused each one of them. For example, she says that deafness results from refusing to listen to someone and sore throats are caused by feeling angry. Hay believes that our thoughts even cause cancer and AIDS. She claims that AIDS is caused by thinking that you’re not good enough and no one cares about you, as well as by sexual guilt.

To heal any condition, says Hay, you need to first affirm to yourself that you’re letting go of the thoughts that created the condition. Then, you need to repeat the affirmation Hay provides to create new beliefs.

Hay also claims that harmful accidents aren’t really accidental; they are caused by our anger at ourselves. The degree of bodily harm caused by an accident correlates with the extent to which we want to punish ourselves. In fact, Hay believes that at the root of every disease are variations on just two emotions: anger and fear.

(Shortform note: As we’ve discussed, attempting to cure illness using positive thinking alone can be dangerous or even deadly: It can result in psychological and physical harm. While research doesn’t support this course of action, it does validate the broader concept of a mind-body connection—the idea that our thoughts, emotions, and overall outlooks can affect our physical health, just as our physical health can affect our mental states. While some mind-body practices, such as talk therapy, address the “mind” side of the equation, many focus instead on the “body” side, using practices such as Tai chi, yoga, meditation, and relaxation techniques to help alter your mental state and reduce your stress, leading to better health.)
