## Chapter 9: Sentimental Items

Sentimental items, mementos, keepsakes--these are usually reminders of times or people that gave us great joy. But think about the most important moments in your life--would you forget these moments if you didn’t have a physical object to remind you of them? Probably not.

**Too many keepsakes might suggest that you’re living in the past, and not appreciating the present or thinking about the future.**

**When we handle each item from our past and decide what to keep and what to discard, we ultimately end up processing our past and putting it in order.** If you hide these things away, your past can become an unseen weight that prevents you from being fully present.

### Discarding

These are some common kinds of keepsakes, and how to approach them:

  * Letters
    * A letter fulfills its purpose the second it is received. Think about the letters you’ve written in your life: do you remember what was said? Probably not. Keep only the ones that actually spark joy, and that you might read over in the future. Discard the rest.
  * Gifts
    * We covered this briefly in the komono section, but it bears repeating in this context. Gifts are meant to convey that the giver feels affection for us, and they accomplish this the moment we receive them. **You shouldn’t keep a gift as a memento just because someone gave it to you, you should keep it because it sparks joy.** If it doesn’t, thank it for doing its job of letting you know the person cares, and discard or donate it.
    * If you feel guilty, you can think of it this way: if you can donate the gift, you’re turning the affection someone felt for you into something that will spark joy for someone else in the world--you’re spreading joy! 
    * But even if you can’t donate it, the person who gave it to you wanted to bring joy into your life--thank the object for conveying the giver’s affection, and thank the giver in your mind for understanding that **some things bring us more joy when we let them go than when we keep them**.
  * Photos
    * A good rule of thumb regarding photos is to **cherish who you are now.**
    * Leave photos for last when you do this category. Looking at old photos will pull us in all sorts of directions--remembering past versions of ourselves, dredging up old loves and old burns--and it’ll make harder for you to discern what sparks joy for you _right now_ in the present.
    * We keep photos to remind us of specific times or events. But we probably only need a handful of photos per time or event, not entire albums dedicated to one thing.
    * Many of us have photos lying around, tucked into books, or loose in a box. Kondo notes that photographs seem to turn up in envelopes along with letters that accompanied them. Put these loose photos in one place whenever you find them.
    * You might think your photo albums are safe from the KonMari method, but they aren’t. How do you sort photos? The same way we’ve sorted everything else: one by one, taking each one in our hands. Yes, including albums. Take all the photos out and then go through them one by one.
    * You’ll find that a lot of photos you kept through the years end up being unexciting photos of scenery, or images that you couldn’t place outside of the album. Discard these. Discard any photos that don’t spark joy. Thank the discards for the joy they gave you when you took them, and let them go.



### Organizing

Again, Kondo doesn’t go into too much detail about how to store these items, so turn to the general principles of organization once you finish discarding.

A lot of people keep sentimental items hidden away in boxes in their closets--but this of course makes it easier to forget what’s in there, and prevents you from appreciating these objects that bring you joy. **Ideally, you’ll have cleared up enough space throughout your house from discarding that you should have space to display some of these mementos** , or at least access them easier.

For instance, once you’ve gone through all your photos, put them in albums and put them out on a shelf. Don’t let them sit loose in boxes or other storage units. When you’re older, you’ll appreciate being able to easily pull an album down and flip through photos that give you joy--**and if you tidy successfully, you can appreciate them right now.**

#### A Personal Shrine

This section is catered specifically to Kondo’s Japanese audience, as it addresses what to do with shrine charms that you collect, but it can be applicable to other audiences and other items.

The top of a bookcase is a great place to make a personal shrine. Pick your favorite, most joyful mementos and knickknacks, and create a small, personal altar in your home. This is in direct keeping with turning your home into a place of joy, your own sacred space, and filling it with positive energy.

You can also decorate the insides of your closets to make your space more personal, especially if you have things you might be embarrassed to have out where other people can see them. Fill your closet with your secret delights, and feel the rush of joy every time you open your closet.

#### The Ultimate Storage Shortcut

Many people, especially in America, have boxes of sentimental items in storage at their parents’ house. Some people even send stuff _to_ their parents’ house if they don’t have space for it.

**Your parents’ house is not extra storage for you--** if you treat it that way, you undercut your ability to discard. We almost never retrieve the boxes we leave at our parents’ homes--they sit there, unopened, taking up space in that house instead of ours. Don’t do that to your parents.

Sometimes, parents even leave their children’s rooms untouched long after their kids have become adults and live permanently in other places. This, too, should be avoided. **Turning their room into a shrine prevents you from appreciating them for the adults they are now, and from moving into the next chapter of _your_ life without kids in the house.**

  * Of course you can keep mementos from your children’s early years, but put these in the sentimental items category and go through them item by item. You don’t need every single drawing they did in kindergarten, and you must ask yourself _if you even remember these items are here until it’s time to throw them away_. If you don’t, you don’t need them--you’ve got the memories in your head.
