## Chapter 3: Discarding

Now that we’ve covered the high-level process, let’s break down the first phase of discarding into more detail.

For every category, once you have everything in one pile, you’ve got to discard first, all at once, completely.**You can’t start putting things away until you’ve finished discarding.** It might sound intense, but this is going to be the key to tidying effectively.

Pull out all the items from one category from anywhere in your home. Then, at your pile, pick each item up and ask if it sparks joy. Then start a keep pile and a discard pile. Remember to go in the correct order of categories.

**Do not let any item slip by when you gather by category.** When starting with clothing, get ALL your clothes. After you’ve finished discarding your clothes and organized what was left, move on to your books and take out ALL your books.

  * It may seem like forgetting an item here or there won’t be a big deal, but if you let yourself slip, you won’t be able to assess all your things at once, and it’ll become much harder to stay on track and sense whether things spark joy or not.



This raises an important question: what standard should you use to decide what to keep and what to get rid of?

**Belongings are valuable for 3 different reasons:** **1) they’re functional, 2) they contain information, or 3) we have an emotional attachment to them.** These are also the 3 reasons that make it hard for us to get rid of something.

The KonMari method focuses on joy as the primary reason to keep something, but let’s look at a few other philosophies on discarding objects first and their pitfalls.

### Common Methods of Discarding

Functionality is one of the primary categories we use to discard--it’s easy to get rid of something when it breaks down or doesn’t work anymore. However, when functionality is the primary reason we keep something, we end up with a lot of things that are useful or _might_ be useful in the future--_but that we really don’t like_. **We’re more prone to use things when we like them, and we’re less likely to actually use something that’s functional if we don’t like it.**

Sometimes people discard things that have fallen out of fashion. This will help you stay on trend, but fashion is fickle, cyclical, and personal: it changes constantly, things come back _into_ fashion, and everyone’s got their own individual style. If you use this to get rid of things, you can end up discarding things you like and still get use out of, creating regret down the line and losing your sense of identity.

Some tidying experts give very specific criteria for discarding things: “get rid of it if you haven’t used it for a year,” “if you’re unsure put it away and wait 6 months to see if you miss it,” “you should only have X number of sweaters for the perfect seasonal wardrobe.”

However, what works for someone else might not work for you. Similar to fashion, following rules that are too rigid or too specific might also cause you to get rid of things that you like based on someone else’s preferences.

Kondo tells of a time in her life when she was fed up with tidying. She kept getting rid of stuff according to other guidelines, but her room still felt messy and cluttered. A voice in her head spoke up: _look more closely at what is there_. This led Kondo to the realization that **when we focus only on throwing things away, that’s when we become unhappy. Instead, we should be looking more closely at what is there in our homes, and choosing what we want to keep.**

### Does It Spark Joy?

**When you pick up each item in your hands, ask, “Does this spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If it doesn’t, discard it.** This is the simplest way to approach your belongings.

How to know when something sparks joy: it usually happens immediately. We handle something with care, our eyes light up, and we feel a warmth in our hearts and a smile on our face.

  * **Pick up something you know you love, and see how it feels. This is the feeling you want everything around you to spark**. If everything around you sparked joy, you’d be happier--everywhere you looked would bring a smile to your face.



When something doesn’t bring us joy, we usually pause and look at something for longer, turn our heads, frown. Our faces are tight, and we feel more confusion inside than joy.

Using your joy as the deciding factor will help avoid the pitfalls of the previous section.

It’s a subtle difference, but **approaching it this way will turn it into a positive experience (identifying what gives you joy and choosing that) instead of a negative one (getting rid of things).**

You should feel a spark of joy when you touch an item--this is a surefire sign that you should keep it. But remember that there might be totally rational reasons that you need to keep something that doesn’t spark joy--something like necessary medications that keep you alive and healthy.

  * (Shortform note: **You obviously shouldn’t discard things that you absolutely need, like medications, even if they don’t spark joy.** For instance, a lot of critical book reviewers mentioned having work clothes that they needed but didn’t spark joy. If you have a uniform you can’t change, you need to keep that uniform. But if you have a dress code and therefore have some freedom in terms of what you wear, wouldn’t it be better to find work clothes that _do_ spark joy?)



### Encountering Resistance

Sometimes we find ourselves resistant to the idea of throwing something away, even if it doesn’t necessarily spark joy and we don’t absolutely need it. Here are some of the most common mental blocks, and how to deal with them.

If you encounter something that makes you resist discarding it: remember how you came to own this object. When did you get it, and why, and what meaning did it have for you then? Ask yourself if this object has a real purpose in your life now. Chances are the answer is no, and **this object has already fulfilled its purpose in your life**.

**Sometimes objects come into our lives to teach us that we didn’t like this thing, or didn’t need it, or that it gave us joy to purchase it but not to use it.** These are still valuable lessons.

  * Every object has a role to play in your life, even if that role is to reveal that actually you don’t like that style of clothing, even though you really thought you did--why else would you not have worn it?



**Our unwillingness to discard something usually indicates either an attachment to the past or anxiety about the future.** We all want to remember our past and we all want a stable future--but when we let attachment to the past or anxiety about our future dictate our decisions, we focus on everything but the present.

  * If you discover, through tidying, that you have a deep attachment to the past, it’s probably affecting other areas of your life, like your job and your relationships. Same goes for anxiety about the future. 
  * There are only three ways to deal with your belongings: do it now, do it sometime, or avoid it until you die. It’s better to face things now, if we can, so that we don’t have to deal with them later.



**Getting rid of things we don’t need anymore isn’t shameful or a waste.** Just because you give a home to a lot of objects doesn’t mean you’re taking care of them. It really means the opposite: you have too many things to take care of any of them.

  * The more we take care of things, the longer they last, they happier they make us. The less we take care of things, the more things fall apart around us, and the more frustrated we feel with our surroundings.
  * Concentrate your care on fewer things that really mean a lot to you.



**Discarding with joy and gratitude can help ease the guilt of getting rid of things.** As you discard something, thank it for everything it’s done for you.

  * The people who are the most content report regularly practicing gratitude, and here’s an opportunity. You will feel more refreshed and clear-headed when you do this.
  * It’s a celebration for things to be let go of. It means they served their purpose and can move on. Think of discarding as a joyful ceremony that releases these things.



**You might think you need everything you have to survive, but you really don’t.** Many of us live in societies where we’re surrounded by far more than we’d ever need to survive, so we begin to lose sight of how much we need to be comfortable. But as you go through this tidying process, you’ll reach a point where you know exactly how much you personally need.

  * Kondo calls this the “just-right click point.” Once you discover it, you’ll never own more than you need--you’ll always live in this just-right target area.
  * The click-point differs from person to person--don’t use guides that give you a certain number of clothes or books that you’re supposed to have. Go through those things and decide for yourself.



**Reducing what you own rekindles your relationship to what’s left over** , and going through this process helps you identify exactly what you need and love.

### Family Households

There are two major rules for families working together on the tidying process:

  * **Don’t let your family see what you’re discarding.**
  * **Don’t force your discards on your other family members.**



Discarding results in a lot of garbage. Parents or spouses might get worried about how much you’re throwing away, if you’ll have enough to get by on if you get rid of all that stuff. They also might have a personal attachment to the things you’re getting rid of--often because they gave it to you. This will make them feel bad or cause them to keep it instead of you.

  * You can save them from both feeling bad and acquiring more items that don’t spark joy for them by keeping them away from your discard piles.**It’s considerate to them and will be better for you.**



If you’re getting rid of something that another family member wants or can use it or receives joy from, give it to them--this makes sense economically and will give you the satisfaction of giving someone a gift.

But often we force things on other family members. Parents give their discards to their kids, or older siblings give younger siblings their hand-me-downs--whether they want them or not.

  * **It isn’t fair for you to take things that don’t spark joy for you and force them on someone else.** You’ll just be adding to their pile of stuff that doesn’t spark joy, and you’ll complicate the issue by presenting it as a gift, which might make them feel guilty getting rid of it.
