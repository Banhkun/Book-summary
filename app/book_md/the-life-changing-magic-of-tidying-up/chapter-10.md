## Chapter 10: The Psychological Benefits of Tidying

Now you’ve learned why we should undertake this, how to discard and organize, and how to make your way through all the categories--you’ve learned to tidy! Tidying is a simple process through which we restore the complex balance between ourselves, the things we own, and the home we live in.

A major takeaway of this book is to **appreciate the things you surround yourself with daily.** These things support you and provide service, and most of us don’t treat our possessions with a lot of respect.

**Actively appreciating your belongings will not only give you a deeper sense of gratitude** , which is proven to be connected with a healthier and happier mindset, but **it will also increase the longevity and usefulness of your belongings.**

  * Kondo draws from the Japanese religion of Shinto, and believes that objects have spirits and emotions. So, in her view, every time you stuff a balled up pair of socks into a drawer, you might as well be treating a human that way.
  * But you don’t have to believe that belongings have spirits to see this benefit--the more you appreciate your belongings, the more you’ll take care of them, the longer they’ll last.
  * Kondo greets her house every day when she comes home, and she says thank you to everything she uses over the course of a day. You can do this silently in your mind if you feel uncomfortable saying it loud.



Once you tidy, you’ll spend less energy finding things, you’ll be able to relax more knowing everything’s in order, you’ll appreciate your belongings, and you’ll only be surrounded by items that spark joy.

And the process of **discarding things and organizing what’s left can help us improve more than just our space:**

  * Dialoguing with ourselves throughout this process hones our sense of intuition. 
  * Deciding what to keep or discard hones our ability to make decisions confidently, 
  * Keeping only objects that spark joy hones our ability to experience joy, and works to bring more joy to our lives.
  * Completing this process can even bring us back to big-picture life things that are important to us. 
    * A client had been working in IT for years when she went through the KonMari process. Once she’d whittled her home down to items that sparked joy, she realized that all her books were about social welfare, specifically in regards to childcare. And this client used to be a volunteer babysitter long before she entered IT--she’d just forgotten about this passion over the course of daily life. After doing the KonMari method, she quit her job and started a childcare company.



**Letting go is more important than adding.** Yes, this rule applies to tidying, but it’s a good rule for life. Many of us add things to our lives constantly, but still don’t feel happier. If we’d focus instead on letting go of things--both tangible things, like possessions, as well as intangible things, like grudges, trauma, and fears--we’d all feel a deeper sense of happiness.

This is not to say that clients haven’t occasionally regretted getting rid of something--it definitely happens. But you can **take pride in knowing you made the choice yourself** \--you were in control of the situation. This is why it’s crucial to be the one who decides what goes and what stays--if someone else makes you throw something out or makes you feel like you should, you’ll be resentful towards them for forcing your hand. With this method, you have to take responsibility, both for getting rid of something and then for recognizing that you need it again.

  * It’ll take less effort to discover you need something, which will decrease your stress levels. If you discover something’s gone that you need, you don’t have to waste time worrying if it’s somewhere else in the house--you can immediately jump to solving the problem and filling the gap.
  * **When you realize you can survive with fewer belongings, this frees you from feeling like you _need_ things to survive. **



Your body might respond to this tidying process--Kondo noticed most of her clients experienced physical symptoms while going through her course. Getting rid of possessions that don’t spark joy is essentially like detoxing, and you might find that your body detoxes alongside your house.

  * Some of Kondo’s clients get stomach problems, some people break out, and some people get sick--but these things pass quickly, and Kondo notes that the clients are healthier afterwards. 
  * The same way that our bodies respond to stress, they will also respond to new feelings of calm and contentment. When we get rid of excess clothing, we might slim down; when we get rid of excess books and papers, our minds might be clearer; when we clean up our body products, our bathrooms get cleaner, and so does our skin.



Now you know how to tidy, so why not do it now? Put your house in order all at once, and be done with it. Make room in your life to focus less on all the stuff around you, and more on all the things and people that bring you joy.
