Adding to Favorites 

Removing from Favorites 

## Chapter 6: Books

**Books are deceptively hard to discard in.** Unless damaged, books are always functional. Even if we’ve read them, they always contain information. And many of us who own books have emotional attachments to them. If you remember, these are the 3 reasons we keep items, and 3 reasons we find it difficult to get rid of items--so you can see why this category gives people trouble.

This is also the only category without the discard/organize divide. This information is entirely about discarding. Organizing books is relatively straightforward: arrange them vertically on shelves. Some people put their books in horizontal piles--we’ve covered why that’s a worse way to organize anything. Books may be the only category that people don’t need help organizing.

**The problem most people run into is that they have too many books to store, which is why discarding is the primary focus of this chapter.**

As with clothes, take all your books off the shelves, and put them in a pile on the floor.

  * It might seem easier to pick what to discard if the books are neatly arranged on a shelf. But, if you do it this way, you’re skipping one of the fundamental stages we already covered: holding each item _in your hands_ , one by one.
  * Even if you have books in neat piles on the floor already, bring all the books into one place to sort through them. This lets you see your total number of objects in any given category, and this, as we’ve discussed, can be a wake up call about how many things you own.



Break the books down into categories if you have a lot:

  * General, books you read for pleasure
  * Practical, books you use for reference, like cookbooks
  * Visual, books such as photography collections or art books
  * Magazines



**Do not read books as you sort them** \--simply hold the book in your hand and see if you feel a thrill of joy upon holding it. Reading will cloud your judgement and take your brain out of the tidying zone.

**If you haven’t read it yet, you’re probably not going to. Discard it.** This will be the true test of how passionate you are about it.

  * If you don’t think about it after you get rid of the book, then you didn’t really want to read it. 
  * If, after you discard the book, you want it so badly you’d be willing to run out and get a new copy, do so and _actually read it this time._



Most of us are also not going to reread many books again. We might have a small number of favorites that we actually return to time after time, but we keep way more books we’ve already read than we’ll actually return to. **Keep only your hall-of-fame books.**

(Shortform note: Kondo’s gotten a lot of criticism from the book community. We’ll clear some misconceptions up.

  * Remember, she’s only encouraging you to discard _what no longer sparks joy_. She’s not telling you to get rid of _all_ your books. Instead, make sure all the books you keep spark joy for you. 
  * She’s not telling you to throw your books away. Donate them to your local library or second-hand store so someone else can enjoy them. 
  * The decision to discard or keep books--or anything else in your house--is ultimately up to you. Kondo pushes us to analyze our relationship to the objects in our lives, and for even the most dedicated book lover, it will still be beneficial for you to do this--even if you don’t discard a single book.)
