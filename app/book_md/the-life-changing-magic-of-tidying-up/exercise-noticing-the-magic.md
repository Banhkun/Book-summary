## Exercise: Noticing the Magic

Everyone that successfully goes through Marie Kondo’s process has a major revelation about their habits, their spaces, and their lifestyle. Go through the tidying process, then complete this exercise. Then come back to your answers if your space ever starts to feel cluttered again to remind yourself of the impact tidying had.

* * *

What’s one thing you learned or noticed throughout the tidying process that surprised you? It can be a good surprise, or a not-so-good surprise--both have value.

If it was a positive thing, or something you’d like to continue feeling in your life, write about how you can apply it to other areas in your life, like your job or your relationships. If it was a negative thing, or something you’d like to work on improving, write about some non-tidying changes you could make to help you continue to improve.
