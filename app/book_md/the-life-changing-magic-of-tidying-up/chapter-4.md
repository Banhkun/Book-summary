## Chapter 4: Organizing

For a given category, you’ve made it through the discarding phase. Now your task is to **find a place for each remaining thing, and put each thing in its place.**

It may seem like this will take a long time, but it won’t take as long as discarding. You’ve only got to find a spot for each item once. Items without designated spots are much more likely to end up all over the place, causing you to rebound back into clutter.

When you are deciding what to keep or discard, ask your heart. But when it comes time to decide where to put things, ask your house. **Your home has enough space to contain the things you need--the trick is to learn how to store everything properly.**

### Common Mistakes in Organizing

Many people think they organize to “go with the flow of their house”--that the layout of their house determines what goes where. But if you look at their organization and the subsequent flow, it’s actually not determined by the house or anything other than _where they’ve decided to store things_.

**Flow doesn’t determine where we store things. Instead,where we store things dictates the flow of our daily lives.**

For example, a lot of people put a long, thin table near the front door as a place to put mail, keys, and anything they either need when they leave the house or want to put down immediately upon coming home. But then mail tends to pile up on this table, because it’s not actually an effective place to put mail that needs to be opened--it’s just the easiest place to drop it. The house didn’t force them to use the hallway as a space for mail--the storage method the homeowners chose determined where the mail ends up.

People often end up putting things in places where it’s _easiest to access them fastest._ This is a trap, and a surefire way to clutter your house up. When we keep things at arm’s length, that’s usually where they end up staying, and suddenly your house is covered in things always an arm’s length away.

  * The average home isn’t large enough for it to be much of a hassle to organize things more simply. If it only takes you 10-20 seconds to walk from one end of your house to another, is that really too much time to walk somewhere to get something?
  * **Tidying is about putting things away, not taking things out. Storage should decrease the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to take them out.**



### How to Store Things

**The more general you are in your sorting, the easier it will be to find what you need.**

Since you’ve already discarded according to category, now all you have to do is **store those things near each other. Don’t scatter storage throughout your house.** Keeping categories together will be the simplest way of keeping track of what you have, accessing what you need where you need it, and not rebounding.

  * For instance, many people keep their clothes in a bedroom closet, coats in a different closet, towels and sheets in a linen closet, kitchen towels under the sink--minor separate categories in different places. Then, they have to do mental work to remember where every one of those categories are. This is how we forget what we have--we spread it around our house. 
  * Instead, organize everything by general type: cloth-like things together, paper-like things together, electrical-like things together. This takes a lot of the stress and mental work out of organizing. Ideally, you could keep your clothes, your coats, and maybe even your sheets and all your towels in a single closet--most likely your bedroom closet--for the easiest general organization. (Shortform note: Wouldn’t this also make putting laundry away much easier?)



**The best storage should let you see exactly what you have at a glance** , without too much effort. To that end, **vertical storage is better than horizontal storage**.

  * Piles can be endlessly added to--you can always stack more things on top of each other. Infinite storage is bad for organization, and great for clutter. Conversely, vertical storage runs out. You’ll know when you’ve accumulated too much stuff because you won’t have space for it.
  * But piling things also puts a lot of strain on the things at the bottom, and will cause them to deteriorate faster. Also, when things end up on the bottom of piles, that’s usually when we stop using them, either because they’re harder to get to, or _because_ they don’t spark joy and we use them less frequently, so they ended up there.



We’ll talk more about storage for each category later, but here’s what vertical storage looks like for clothes. When you pull out a drawer, items are shown vertically, so you can see all the items at once:

#### Avoid Alternative Storage

Don’t turn to alternative storage solutions--extra sets of drawers, tiered shelving units, containers that open up into many smaller drawers and containers. **If you need additional storage options, you probably haven’t discarded successfully.** Complicated things won’t help you out in the long run, they’ll just make it more difficult to access what you need and assess how much you have.

Most storage fixes are hideaways for belongings we don’t need.

  * A lot of storage just moves the mess around. It might look prettier, but your space is still cluttered, just with storage solutions instead of individual objects.
  * What happens once your storage solutions get full? You just buy more storage options or stuff spills out into other areas.



You don’t need anything fancy, and you usually don’t need to buy anything. Cabinets, closets, drawers, and boxes or similar containers are your friend.

  * Kondo’s fond of shoeboxes. Use the bigger bottom part to divide your underwear from your socks. Use the thinner top in your kitchen drawers to keep your utensils from sliding all over the place. Use them in the bathroom to organize shampoos. Use them in the kitchen to organize spices or grains or snacks.
    * (Shortform note: If you don’t have shoe boxes, try going to a local shoe store and seeing if they have empty ones you can take for free.)
  * Other good boxes for organizing smaller items are business card boxes and Apple boxes for phones and music players.
  * Items that take up a lot of floorspace can be put in your closet instead of out in space. 
  * If you have a big, open closet without much internal organization, you can get storage units that go inside the closet. Even things as simple as bookshelves can be put in your closet to help you maximize what gets stored in there.



Don’t buy storage options before you’ve finished going through the whole process. Use all your available space first and then you’ll know exactly what you still need.

#### Family Households

If there are multiple people in your home, each person should organize their own stuff by category first. Then you can tackle shared stuff in communal spaces.

If you do have multiple members in a household, **make sure everyone has their own personal space to store things**. Ideally, everyone in your household would have a single spot where they keep all their belongings. Once storage spaces get spread out over the house, clutter is more likely to happen.

Giving everyone their own individual storage space will make them happy and give them autonomy. This is especially useful advice for parents. You might think it’s better for you to pick where your child’s stuff goes, and for you to organize it. But **if you want to teach your child how to be tidy on their own, you’ve got to give them their own space, let them organize it, and allow them to maintain it**. They’ll want to keep it clean if it’s their space and their responsibility--if you do it for them, they won’t have any incentive.

**Your space should be your sanctuary.** It should be tailored to you, and give you the peace and comfort of a tidy space. That goes for everybody.

#### Labels

You may feel tempted to label things in your house so you know what’s inside, or you may leave the labels on items you bring into your home without thinking twice.

But having words in sight all the time--even if it’s just words on our deodorant, for example--can **create a buzz in our minds**. Words, after all, are information, and if we’re surrounded by unnecessary information, our brains are still going to be processing it whether we’re conscious of it or not.

**Avoid labeling things.** The less stuff you have, the more you’ll remember what you _do_ have--this is why discarding is so important. Then, your storage should let you see everything in one place at a glance, which removes the need for labeling--this is why organizing is so important.

  * Remove as many labels as you can, from your storage boxes and items, and this will calm your mind down, and give it a break from processing.



**The noise of written information actually increases the more you decrease the objects around you.** The neater your home is, the more this unnecessary information will stick out.
