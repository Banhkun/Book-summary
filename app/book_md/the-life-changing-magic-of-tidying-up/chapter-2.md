## Chapter 2: The Big-Picture Process

**Tidying is really just the sum of two physical acts: 1) deciding whether you want to keep something, and then 2) deciding where to put it.** If you do these two simple things the right way, you can actually achieve perfection in your home.

**Here’s the KonMari method, at the highest level:**

  * Get all your belongings in a single category (eg clothing) across your entire home, and put them in one pile in the same room.
  * Pick up each individual item, and decide whether to keep or discard it.
  * For the items you keep, organize them effectively.
  * Move on to the next category (eg books).



KonMari goes through five categories in specific order: Clothing, Books, Papers, Miscellany, and Sentimental Items. As we’ll explain later, this saves the hardest emotional items to discard for last.

This sounds easy, but in practice you’ll find it hard to discard items and to confront how much stuff you have (which is why you own more stuff than you need right now).

The rest of this summary is about how to execute these steps effectively. You’ll learn how to get over the psychological hurdles that prevent you from tidying to the most effective extent.

Here’s what to expect:

  * In this chapter, we’ll discuss the overall process and mindset.
  * In chapters 3 and 4, we’ll discuss general principles of discarding and organizing that apply to all categories. We'll discuss common psychological barriers you might face.
  * Then we'll have a chapter on each of the five categories, to deal with issues specific to that category.



### Ikki Ni - In One Go

Ikki ni, in Japanese, means _in one go_ , and this is an important facet of the process: **do it all in one go.**

In the KonMari method, tidying “all in one go” means:

  * Taking all your items of a category in your entire house and putting it in one pile, instead of going closet by closet or room by room**.**
  * Sorting through the whole pile, picking up each item and deciding what to keep and what to discard.
  * Organizing what you keep in the storage space available to you.



Ideally, you’d discard and organize a whole category, start to finish, in one sitting, and then do categories back to back as soon as possible.

But most of us have jobs and responsibilities that prevent us from tidying this way, so “in one go” really means powering through the process as much as you can in the time you have available to do it.

  * Kondo advises that “all in one go” can still mean the process takes you up to 6 months total, tidying when you have the long stretches necessary to do so. But it’s only 6 months out of your whole life to get your space in order and make a change that will affect the rest of your life positively.



A lot of organization advice says that you can make tidying easier by doing a little bit at a time. But this doesn’t make it easier, it makes it harder, and it makes you more likely to rebound back into clutter.

  * Doing it little by little makes us feel like we’re organizing, when in reality we’re just doing things halfway and unfinished.
  * **If we tidy just a little bit every day, we’ll be tidying for the rest of our lives, and who wants to do that?**
  * It’s easy to lose momentum this way, and it takes more energy over a longer period of time.
  * This is why it’s better to do it as a marathon: tidy up in one go. This makes sure you finish the job completely, which prevents you from rebounding.



The kind of big-picture tidying Kondo talks about shouldn’t be done every day. She views this kind of tidying as a special event. **Special event tidying should be done in a short amount of time while your spirits are high, while daily tidying should consist of putting the things you use back where they go.** Only once you’ve completed the special event task can you actually do the daily tidying effectively and without much effort.

**Tidying all in one go helps you see the most dramatic results fastest--and this is the easiest way to change your mindset.** You’ll know what it feels like to have a house that’s totally organized to your own standards, and you’ll be surrounded by objects that make you happy. Why would you ever want to go back to a cluttered life after that?

### Go by Category

This is a fatal mistake most people make while tidying: going by room instead of by category**.**

Most of us have similar items in different locations, like coats in a coat closet in the hall and clothes in a dresser in the bedroom. If we tidy by room, we end up doing the same kind of work over and over--this can lead to burnout.

**Tidying by category lets us do one kind of work in totality** , no matter where the objects are in your space. Plus, most of us have no idea how much stuff we own, so tidying by category is the wake up call we need.

  * For example, for clothing, you’ll put every single item of clothing you own on your bed. You’re going to be floored by the volume of clothes you have, and you’d never realize that if you tidied by room.



**The correct sequence of categories: clothes, books, papers, komono/miscellany, mementos.** In each category, gather all the items together at once, discard first, then organize what’s left.

Going in the correct sequence speeds up the process and makes it easier in 3 ways:

  * It allows you to go from easier categories to harder categories, not only psychologically but in terms of storage as well. 
  * It helps you refine your ability to choose what to keep as you go along. 
  * It helps build good habits before you get to communal areas and shared objects or sentimental stuff that can be difficult to discard. 



**Do not start with mementos.** Don’t even think about sentimental items until everything else has been sorted. If you discover one as you go through other categories, put it aside immediately.

  * They cloud our judgement and are the hardest things to make decisions about.
  * Because they’re rare and can’t be replaced, we resist throwing them away. 
  * This is also usually a big category, and will take too much energy out of us before we’ve streamlined our discarding system.



### Look Within

**Tidying is kind of like meditating--it’s an internal dialogue.** You commune with yourself, deciding what things spark joy and what things don’t. Your belongings serve as a medium to get you in touch with yourself.

Because of this, Kondo recommends the ideal environment to tidy in:

  * **Tidy in quiet**. If you do it with distractions like music or TV, you won’t be able to hear your own thoughts as clearly, or you’ll be influenced by the outside noise.
  * **Tidy in the morning.** The fresh air clears your mind and your ability to make decisions is sharper than late at night--it’s easier to dialogue with yourself.



Before you start, Kondo also recommends **visualizing what you want your life to look like.**

  * What’s your goal? Why’d you want to read this book? You have to have some idea of wanting to tidy your space for this book to appeal to you. What do you hope to gain by tidying?
  * You need more specific goals than “I don’t want to be messy” or “I want to be tidy.” These are too broad to help you achieve a space that’s yours.
    * One client wanted a more “feminine” lifestyle. Kondo asked what that meant. The client answered in very vivid terms that she wanted a home as tidy as a hotel, nothing obstructing the line of sight, a pink bedspread with a white antique lamp. She’d come home from work, have a bath, do some aromatherapy, and listen to classical music while doing yoga and drinking tea, and then fall asleep with “a feeling of unhurried spaciousness.” Look at how specific that visualization is!
  * If you’re having difficulty, use interior magazines or look at homes on the internet to help you think about what you want your own space to be like.



Once you’ve thought about some of the aesthetic specifics, **you’ve got to think about the WHY behind all those things.** Keep diving deeper into the whys behind what you want. _Why_ do you want to do aromatherapy and drink tea? Probably because you want to relax. _Why_ do you want to relax? And so on.

Eventually, you’ll find that all your answers lead you to a simple realization: **whatever we want, we want it because we want to be happy.** That’s one of everyone’s primary internal goals.

Once you realize this,**you’ll start to look at your possessions differently, mainly asking if they bring you happiness, or spark joy**.
