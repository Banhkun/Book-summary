## 1-Page Summary

In _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ , multimillionaire entrepreneur and direct-response marketing consultant, Dan Kennedy, shares strategies for crafting powerful sales letters that capture customers’ attention and make them want to buy the products and services you’re selling.

Kennedy, who says he found success as a copywriter despite not having a college degree, argues that anyone can learn to write persuasive copy and turn it into profit—you just have to believe in yourself, trust your intuition, and know your product better than anyone else.

Kennedy is the author of 13 business books, including 10 in the _No B.S._ business book series. Originally published in 1990 and updated in 2011, _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ provides time-tested foundational strategies in the art of persuasive writing that translate and remain relevant across media in the ever-evolving world of sales and marketing.

> **What Is a Sales Letter?**
> 
> Since Kennedy doesn’t explicitly state what a sales letter is, further context may be useful. It’s a direct marketing tool designed to attract, build relationships with, and convince prospective consumers to buy your product. A low-cost alternative to television and other forms of advertising, sales letters are typically rooted in the “A.I.D.A.” formula (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), and they’re often used by companies with smaller budgets or those that do “mail-order only” sales.
> 
> Kennedy focuses primarily on hard copy, long-form letters that were popular at the time of the book’s original publication in 1990—well before the rise of social media. However, more contemporary direct marketing tools, such as email and video sales letters, are rooted in the foundational elements Kennedy outlines.
> 
> _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ is directed toward business owners and copywriters who are starting from scratch, though Kennedy asserts that seasoned professionals can use his tips and strategies as evergreen touchpoints and even learn a new thing or two.

In this guide, we’ve reorganized and condensed Kennedy’s tips and strategies into two parts:

  1. Gathering intelligence needed to write an effective sales letter
  2. Crafting a compelling sales letter



We also compare and contrast Kennedy’s work with updated recommendations from other sales and marketing experts.

### Part 1: Gather Your Sales Letter Intel

In this section, we’ll discuss the background information Kennedy says you’ll need to write a powerful sales letter. First we’ll cover how to identify and understand your target customer, then we’ll talk about getting to know your product inside and out.

#### Step 1: Identify and Understand Your Target Customer

Kennedy says that before you write your sales letter, you have to first identify and understand your target customer so you can address their priorities and pitch your product in a way that resonates with them.

Kennedy recommends that you **narrow your focus to people who _would_ buy your product (**as opposed to taking a mass marketing approach) and try to find out the following things about them:

  * Their greatest worry, fears, frustrations, and dreams 
  * Their age, income, hobbies, political affiliations, and magazines they read
  * Their biases and how they communicate 
  * Trends impacting their business and life
  * Whether anyone else has tried and failed to sell them a product like yours



To home in on your target customer and gather this information, Kennedy suggests immersing yourself in the applicable industry by reading industry publications and websites, subscribing to email groups that prospective customers are part of, attending conventions and trade shows, and talking with people who have insights into your customer base.

> **New Ways to Identify and Understand Your Target Customer**
> 
> Since the 2011 publication of _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ , the world of online sales and marketing has expanded, offering new ways to identify your target customer and understand them in greater depth. For example, you can join Q&A forums like Quora and Moz Community to interact with people who are similar to your customers and see what questions they are asking about products and services related to yours.
> 
> Once you’ve developed a working list of potential buyers, you can create an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which will allow you to home in on your perfect customer base and market your product even more effectively.

#### Step 2: Know Your Product

Kennedy says that in addition to identifying and understanding your target customer, you should become intimately acquainted with your product so you can highlight its benefits and address its weaknesses in your sales letter.

Kennedy recommends that you get to know your product and how it operates by using it extensively. For example, take it apart, test it, try it out on others, talk with people who use it, and examine competitive products. Going through this process will help you identify your product’s best features and benefits, which you’ll prioritize and highlight for customers in your letter based on their distinct needs and interests.

(Shortform note: Kennedy says it’s important to emphasize the benefits of your product to customers so they understand how it will make their life better or easier. You can practice framing your product’s features as benefits by listing each feature, then describing the specific way it will help buyers.)

Kennedy asserts that in addition to highlighting your product’s strengths, you must also directly address its limitations in your sales letter to defuse customer concerns and keep them interested in buying your product. He recommends**two strategies for countering questions** that buyers may have about your product:

  1. **Explain that you’ve conducted extensive research** with consumers who didn’t buy your product, list every reason they gave for not buying, then address those issues.
  2. **Present a list of frequently asked questions** and answers about your product. 



Kennedy suggests you bolster these strategies with testimonials and stories that highlight your product’s strong points, or provide guarantees and free trial offers that encourage customers to try your product.

(Shortform note: Being upfront about problems with your product is perhaps more important now than ever. The risk of disgruntled customers publicly airing complaints about your flawed product—and of millions of people hearing them—has grown since Kennedy published the 4th Edition of _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ in 2011. Some marketing strategists recommend that you openly display problems with your product to get ahead of online trolls by featuring your product’s flaws front and center in your content headline and on your website, or by joking about and making light of its problems in your advertising.)

### Part 2: Craft Your Sales Letter

In the previous section, we covered the background information you need to write your sales letter. In this section, we’ll go over five steps for crafting a letter that captivates, engages, convinces, and compels customers to buy your product. We’ll then discuss how to get this well-crafted letter into your customers’ hands.

#### Step 1: Write Your First Draft

Now that you have all the information you need about your customer and product, Kennedy says the first step of crafting your sales letter is to simply **sit down and start writing**. He notes that this step is intentionally brief since your goal is only to get your ideas on the page, not to worry about editing or getting things perfect.

> **How to Draft a Sales Letter**
> 
> Kennedy doesn’t provide additional or explicit steps on _how_ to write your first draft, but here’s a step-by-step outline you can use to draft a sales letter:
> 
>   * Write a catchy headline that grabs your customer's attention.
> 
>   * Say why your product or service will benefit your customer.
> 
>   * Provide key information about your product using bullet points.
> 
>   * Provide testimonials or statistics to substantiate your product’s value.
> 
>   * Provide a call to action (include a direct link or action button for online sales. For example: “Enter your email and website here, and we’ll send you free information on our product.”)
> 
>   * Say that your product is available for a limited time, or is limited in its availability, to increase the urgency for customers to respond.
> 
>   * Finish with a “PS” (postscript) where you offer a guarantee.
> 
> 


#### Step 2: Grab, Engage, Convince, and Compel

Once you have a rough draft, you need to shape your letter so it grabs, engages, and convinces your customer to buy your product, then compels them to respond immediately. We’ll examine Kennedy’s recommendations for each.

##### Grab

Kennedy argues that your first goal in your letter is to quickly seize customers’ attention by telling them your product will solve an immediate problem. Failure to do this, he says, will result in your letter getting thrown away. Kennedy recommends the following tips to grab customers’ attention:

  * **Insert a headline** at the top of your letter, following your initial greeting, that states a problem your target audience faces and the solution your product or service offers to fix it (for example: “Dear Ms. Hannigan: Give me 10 days and I’ll turn your hyperactive dog into your best-behaved friend!”).
  * In your first paragraph, **paint a vivid picture** of your product using dramatic words, and describe the sights, smells, sounds, feel, and taste that buyers will experience while using it.
  * **Break traditional grammar rules** in favor of unusual punctuation, buzzwords, and exclamations, which build energy.
  * **Keep sentences and paragraphs short**(no more than four sentences per paragraph) to focus customers’ attention on key points.



##### Engage

Once you have your audience’s attention, you need to keep them engaged. Kennedy says you can do this by using a friendly, conversational tone, showing your personality, and repeating your sales pitch in as many different ways as possible. You can also encourage customer interaction by asking questions at the start or end of paragraphs and by writing partial sentences at the end of each page to force buyers to turn it over to find out what happens next.

> **The Video Sales Letter—A Better Tool for Today?**
> 
> Kennedy recommends leading your letter with a headline—a brief span of text that grabs readers’ attention and hints at what you’re going to say next. This is a common approach in written and online sales letters because if your customer isn’t immediately interested in what you’re saying, they’ll stop reading.
> 
> But some sales and marketing experts argue that an even more effective way to capture customers’ attention―and to _keep_ them engaged and convince them they need your product _right now_ —is to show your product in action using a video sales letter. Video sales letters are a visual marketing tool similar to written sales letters, but in video format. Proponents of this tool (over the written version) argue that video sales letters:
> 
>   * Allow you to use facial expressions, tone of voice, and background audio to quickly establish and maintain emotional connections with viewers.
> 
>   * Are better at engaging and convincing customers to buy your product
> 
>     * The time it takes to watch them (typically two to three minutes) is shorter than what it would take to read a lengthy sales letter.
> 
>     * Watching a person make a sales pitch feels more “real,” and is often more compelling and memorable than reading faceless words on a page.
> 
> 

> 
> Psychologist Susan Weinschenck bolsters the idea that video sales letters are more effective than written sales letters, explaining that biology draws us to videos with people for four reasons:
> 
>   * Our brains are wired to look at human faces for information, believability, and emotion.
> 
>   * The tone of the human voice conveys meaning and context.
> 
>   * Emotions are contagious.
> 
>   * Motion grabs attention.
> 
> 

> 
> If you want to write a video sales letter script that captivates, engages, and convinces customers to buy your product and compels them to respond quickly, experts say to create a hook, overcome buyers’ internal and external obstacles, and incentivize quick responses to your call to action.

##### Convince

Once you’ve engaged your customer, you need to convince them that your product or service is valuable and worth the price. Kennedy says you shouldn’t worry about the length of your letter—take as many pages as you need to make a compelling argument.

Kennedy recommends providing evidence that highlights the benefits of your product or service to your customer, such as testimonials and photographs that show the product is easy to use or that your service delivers great results.

He also says you must address the tricky subject of your product’s price, which you have to navigate carefully because consumers won’t buy a product without knowing its cost, but they’ll also forgo purchasing that product if they don’t like its price. He recommends two strategies to de-emphasize your product’s cost and turn customers’ focus to reasons they should buy it.

**Strategy 1** : Shift the conversation from your product’s price to the value or savings your customer will experience when they buy it:

  * Pitch the quantity of your product—the bigger the better because people value bulk.
  * Highlight the components that come with your product to create the appearance of additional value.
  * Talk about the money and effort that went into producing your product to emphasize its quality.
  * Advertise the monthly, not full, cost of your product to make it look lower than it is.
  * Tell customers that investing in your product will either save or make them more money in the long run than what they’ll spend upfront.



**Strategy 2** : Move beyond the topic of price by focusing on persuasion techniques that compel your customer to buy your product:

  * Say that:
    * You’re about to run out of your product.
    * _Smart_ people are buying your product (implication: If the consumer doesn’t buy it they’re not smart).
    * Only special people understand the value of your product or have been selected to try it—and not everyone ticks these boxes.
  * Paint a harrowing picture of a problem your target customer faces, provide an example that will trigger an emotional reaction in them, then say how your product will solve it.
  * Repeatedly offer product guarantees (money back, refunds, free trials) or make them the central focus of your sales pitch.



> **Which Is the Stronger Strategy: Manipulation or Transparency?**
> 
> Kennedy argues that while consumers may react negatively to strategies that trick or bully them into responding to your sales letter, the benefits often outweigh the costs. But some sales experts counter that a low-pressure sales approach is more ethical and effective, allowing you to build relationships and maintain your reputation with customers. Let’s look at two ways price can be addressed:
> 
> Strategies that could be considered manipulative but are often effective:
> 
>   * Contrast your product with more expensive versions to make yours look more affordable.
> 
>   * Reduce the font size of prices and remove dollar signs.
> 
>   * Break the full price of your product into a smaller dollar amount, then turn that amount into a tangible item that customers waste money on (for example: “You can save a baby for less than the price of a cup of coffee”).
> 
> 

> 
> By contrast, if you have an established client base and need to announce a price _increase_ on your product, here is what **a transparent strategy** could look like:
> 
>   * Make sure that everyone in your business knows about the price increase before announcing it to customers.
> 
>   * Inform customers of the price change well before its implementation.
> 
>   * Reassure customers that higher prices mean better quality.
> 
>   * Explain the reasoning for the price increase.
> 
>   * Encourage customers to reach out with questions or concerns.
> 
> 


##### Compel

After convincing your customer that they need your product, your goal is to **get them to respond to your letter as quickly as possible**. Kennedy says this is crucial because when prospective customers put your letter down to “read it later,” they rarely do. He offers the following tips to compel consumers to respond to your letter immediately:

  * **Create a deadline** by which customers have to respond to get your product. 
  * **Offer incentives** , such as premium package deals or discounts, for quick responses, or disincentives, like penalties, for slower responses.
  * **Provide multiple ways for consumers to respond to you** (phone, email, standard mail with prepaid return mail option, even fax). 



> **Craft an Effective Call to Action (CTA)**
> 
> Kennedy provides suggestions for how to get buyers to respond quickly to your written sales letter. But if you’re looking to craft an effective online call to action (a prompt that encourages customers to respond to you by taking a specific action, like clicking a button to submit their email or buy your product), you can start with these five tips:
> 
>   * Place your CTA near the top of your web page.
> 
>   * Tell people _what_ you want them to do and _why_(for example, “Subscribe now and you’ll get exclusive access to our best deals.”
> 
>   * Create a sense of urgency using action-oriented language (for example: “Sale ends tonight!”).
> 
>   * Keep your message simple.
> 
>   * Test different versions of your CTA to see what works best.
> 
> 


#### Step 3: Refine, Finalize, and Send Your Letter

Now you have a letter that will capture your customer’s attention, convince them you have a product or service worth buying, and compel them to respond quickly. Your last task is to put the finishing touches on your letter, and make sure your target customer receives it. Kennedy recommends the following tips to polish your letter and make sure it gets into the right hands:

  * Add a PS at the end of your letter where you make your pitch one last time.
  * Edit your letter for clarity and cut words and phrases that don’t support and move your main point forward.
  * Scan and tweak your letter for visual appeal, with an eye toward improving its readability. Emphasize key takeaways (and contact information) for customers using bold font, highlighting, or capital letters.
  * Put your letter on trial:
    * Read it out loud to see how it sounds. 
    * Read it to others for feedback on what’s effective, and what’s not. 
    * Compare it to similar letters to see how it stands up. 
    * Send yourself a copy to approximate customers’ experience receiving and reading it. 
    * Make final edits accordingly.
  * Individualize its packaging: Use materials and packaging that appeal to different customers for the strongest possible chance of reaching your target customer.
    * For **executives and business owners** : Use high-quality paper and envelopes, put your sales letter in a separate envelope from other materials you package it with, and use language that highlights the exclusivity of the product or services you’re selling. 
    * For **mass mailings** : Choose colorful, interactive materials. 
    * To **prevent your letter from looking like junk** mail that front-line mail sorters are likely to throw out, hand address a plain white envelope, don’t put a name in the return address, and opt for postage stamps instead of metered mail. 
    * Choose **FedEx or first-class mail** to prevent the postal service from filtering out your letter. 
  * Send your letter. 



> **Refine, Finalize, and Send a Video Sales Letter**
> 
> Kennedy’s fundamental processes for refining, finalizing, and getting your written sales letter to your target customer are similar to and apply across contemporary sales mediums, but differences do exist—particularly when you compare written sales letters and video sales letters.
> 
> For example, the process of editing a video sales letter requires different skills from editing a written letter. Also, with a written letter, you have to choose physical materials and send your letter by mail, but with a video sales letter, you have to publish and promote your video online.

### Conclusion

Kennedy offers some final thoughts on how to strategically use your sales letter, and how to expand its purposes in the future.

##### Use Your Sales Letter Strategically

Kennedy says that you can improve your brand recognition and increase customers’ response rate to your first sales letter by sending a second (and possibly third) follow-up letter 45 to 60 days after your first.

(Shortform note: Kennedy doesn’t provide specific information on what content should go in your follow-up letter. To get ideas and learn how to boost response rates to email sales letters, consider these templates for a series of follow-up emails. While wording is important, the key is persistence—not quitting until you get a firm yes or no.)

##### Use Your Sales Letter and Its Fundamental Elements Elsewhere

Kennedy says that in addition to using your sales letter to sell products and services to new and existing customers, you can also use it to:

  * Identify qualified sales leads (people who’ve shown they’re interested in your product by responding to your call to action).
  * Introduce and smooth the path for follow-up telemarketing calls.
  * Bring foot traffic into your business (by announcing events and sales).
  * Reduce product returns (by reinforcing that they made a good purchase).



Finally, Kennedy argues that although social media has changed the communications landscape since the first publication of _The Ultimate Sales Letter_ in 1990, the fundamentals required to write a powerful, long-form sales letter translate across platforms—including in online sales letters, TV infomercials, and other advertising. Because of their proven effectiveness, he asserts it would be foolish to abandon written copy sales letters and argues that a combination of offline and online sales letters is the best approach.

> **The Combined Video Sales Strategy**
> 
> Kennedy asserts that a strategy combining written and online sales letters is the most effective, but he doesn’t explain why. Other proponents of the approach say it works because it allows you to reach a wider audience, build a stronger brand, reach customers at different points in the buying process, and save money on marketing.
> 
> But if a combination of written and online letters is more effective than either technique in isolation, then a combination of video sales strategies may be the best approach. Video commercials, 30- to 60-second ads, can supplement video sales letters by helping you attract customers, create and maintain awareness about your product, and build your brand.
