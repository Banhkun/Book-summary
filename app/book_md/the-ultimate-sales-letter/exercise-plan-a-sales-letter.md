## Exercise: Plan a Sales Letter

Kennedy says that writing a powerful sales letter starts with identifying and understanding your target audience, then getting to know your product inside and out.

* * *

Think about the industry where a product that you want to sell is typically sold. Now think about where, in this industry, you could learn more about customers who might be interested in your product (this might be online resources, events you could attend, or people you could talk with).nn**List three to five places** where you could gather more information about prospective customers.

Think about a specific product you want to sell. List three flaws with that product and the specific way you’d frame each problem with prospective customers.

Think about Kennedy’s recommendations for addressing the price of your product with prospective customers. Describe three ways you’ll shift the conversation from price to value.
