## Chapter 7: Discovering Michael Oher

The bits and pieces of his history that Michael had shared with Leigh Anne and Sean, and the parts the Tuohys were able to piece together on their own, amounted to very little. **It would be years before they learned the true history of this boy they’d taken in and given a home and why he was the way he was.** But Michael’s history helped highlight why he reacted the way he did after the incident with Antonio and the little boy.

### Michael’s Early Life

Michael’s mother Denise, or Dee Dee, didn’t start out as a person who was likely to grow up and lose her children. She had an uneventful childhood, but darkness was quick to come into her life, and it never left. When she was a child, her father was murdered in his bed. After that, her mother became an alcoholic and could no longer care for Dee Dee and her brother, Robert. The two children were removed from the home and placed in an orphanage, where they stayed until Dee Dee was 15.

**When Dee Dee left the orphanage, she fell in with a group of wayward kids. She started doing drugs and drinking** , and five years later, she had her first child with a man named Odell Watkins. Over the next six years, she and Odell had four more children, although he was not a father figure or partner to her. At the age of 27, Dee Dee decided to leave Odell. It wasn’t long before another man walked into her life by way of her brother Robert.

Robert was serving his first prison sentence for murder and made a friend in jail named Michael Jerome Williams. Michael Sr. was getting out of jail, and Robert asked him to visit Dee Dee and give her an update on how he was doing. Dee Dee and Michael came together quickly, and she was pregnant again shortly after. Dee Dee was deep into drugs and had no job or money, but she welcomed her new son, Michael Jerome Williams Jr., into the world happily.****

Michael’s father didn’t stick around long after he was born and ended up back in prison. Dee Dee no longer wanted her child named after that man, so she started referring to him as Michael Oher, her last name. Four years and four more children later, Dee Dee was firmly addicted to crack and using her government checks to support her habit, leaving her 7 boys and 3 girls to fend for themselves. **Michael’s earliest memories are of going for days without food, drinking water to get full, and sleeping outdoors.**

Despite these hardships, Dee Dee’s children loved her. She wasn’t mean and told them she loved them often, and Michael and his siblings started to worry that they’d get taken away from her and separated from each other. In April 1994, when Michael was almost 8, their worst nightmare came true. Police officers showed up to take Dee Dee’s children. The boys were able to escape, but the girls were taken away. Michael never saw his sisters again.

#### Foster Care

**Several weeks after the girls were taken, the police found Michael and his brother Carlos at school.** They were taken to live with Velma Jones, an obese woman who used to sit on them when they were bad. Velma was guardian of several foster children, and they used to pick on Michael and Carlos.

Michael ran away two days after arriving and went back to his mother’s place. Despite his pleas, Dee Dee knew things would get worse if Michael didn’t go back, and she escorted him there. He tried the same move a few weeks later, and Dee Dee took him back again.

Two years later, both Michael and Carlos escaped from Velma’s for good. **The social workers took Michael to a hospital to have him tested for mental illness, and he was checked into a juvenile ward.** Once again, Michael ran away from the hospital. He wandered the dark streets until he found Dixie Homes, the project where Dee Dee lived. But she didn’t live there anymore. In the years that he’d been gone, she’d moved to Hurt Village.

Michael found Dee Dee at Hurt Village, but he went to hide at her abandoned apartment at Dixie Homes to avoid getting taken back to foster care. Carlos showed up soon after, and the two went on the run. When they realized the police were no longer looking for them, they moved in with Dee Dee and a few siblings, some old and some new. The eight of them shared a two-room apartment and stayed there for the next five years.

### A Boy With a Dream

Hurt Village was a harsh environment with close to 1,000 residents. There were no nuclear families, many adults didn’t have jobs, and 75% suffered from mental illness, including drug addiction. Most of the village was under the control of Delvin Lane and his gang, the Gangster Disciples (GD).

Michael stopped attending school for 18 months after arriving at Hurt Village, fearing the police would find him there and take him away again. He didn’t realize the Department of Children’s Services had already given up on placing him in a foster home. He lived a free life with no supervision or obligations, and he remembers it as being fun. Michael had few to no friends and spent a lot of time alone. His favorite pastime was shooting hoops from morning to night, what he considered to be training for his future. Michael had a dream—he wanted to be the next Michael Jordan.

Michael’s dream started in 1993 after he watched the Bulls guard make the Phoenix Suns look like a high school team. He was fast and agile, and he believed he had what it took to make it to the NBA. He made a vow to be as great as Jordan one day. **No one in the world thought this little boy had anything to offer the world, but he knew differently. He knew he was destined to be a rich and famous athlete.**

Michael grew quickly and got stronger, but inside, he was still a quiet and shy boy. There were only two people that Michael hung out with: a boy his age named Craig, who also loved to play basketball, and a man 10 years older named Big Zach. Zach had been a hot high school football prospect and had what would become the quintessential left tackle body. Many people mistook Michael and Big Zach for brothers because they were so similar in shape and features.

Like Michael, Tom Lemming had touted Zach as one of the brightest offensive tackles in the country, and scholarship offers rolled in. But unlike Michael, Zach had a large group of friends and a girlfriend. After he returned from a visit to Florida State, where the coach had his name already stenciled on a locker, they convinced him he wasn’t good enough for the NFL and that college was a waste of time. He listened and dropped out of school. Several years later, Zach regretted his decision. He didn’t realize how close he’d been to making it.

Perhaps it was this future regret looming in his subconscious that caused Big Zach to take Michael under his wing. He took him to the basketball court and saw that Michael was good and handled the ball well for his size. People started calling Michael “Big Mike,” but he hated it because it didn’t match the image he had in his mind. Without pictures or mirrors around, **he didn’t have a true understanding of how big he was getting. He wanted to be light as air and fast with cat-like reflexes, like Jordan, so that’s who he believed he was**.

To keep the illusion alive, Michael wore oversized clothes and shoes a size too small. He worked out, believing he was slimming down, and only played guard on the court to maximize his quickness. This delusion also kept him from realizing how strong he was becoming. He was truly shocked one day when he picked up a kid while horsing around like it was nothing. Still, he refused to be big. He was small and lithe in his mind, and his body followed his mind’s commands.

### A Father Figure for Michael

During this time, Michael still wasn’t attending school most days, but his teachers kept moving him up a grade without concern. He was unencumbered and content, but everything changed before his 15th birthday when Big Tony found him on the basketball court at Hurt Village.

Tony took Michael in and enrolled him into Westwood High School, where Tony’s son, Steven, played basketball. Michael played both basketball and football at the school, but he didn’t care much for football. Still, Big Tony saw how big Michael was getting and knew he could attract attention from colleges with his size alone.

Around this time, Tony’s mother died, and he fulfilled his promise to her to take Steven across the city to get a Christian education. And if he was already driving Steven to Briarcrest, he may as well take Big Mike, too.

Michael remembers those first months at Briarcrest as days of confusion. He’d never been around white people before and couldn’t understand their way of life. They were all overly friendly, seemingly fragile, and careless with their possessions.

Steven had noticed this, too, and one day, the two boys came home with Big Tony and revealed a stash of stolen items from the boys’ locker room. Tony sat Steven and Michael down and explained the ways of their new world to them. It wasn’t like the hood. **They had to stay out of trouble and follow the rules because once a black boy caused trouble in a white world, he’d never be accepted again.**

### Black Boy in a White World

**Everything that had happened to Michael Oher, from his entry into Briarcrest up to his near-certain path to the NFL, was in jeopardy because of his behavior that day in the tutoring center.** The center became a crime scene, with both Ole Miss and Oxford police investigating the incident. The little boy was taken to the hospital, and the father, Bobby Nix, was pressing charges. He and his wife had already lost one child.

In Memphis, Leigh Anne was frantically trying to get hold of Michael. She bounced between calls to Michael’s cellphone and Sean’s. Michael didn’t answer, and Sean was in Seattle with the Memphis Grizzlies and at a movie theater. He’d received the first call about Michael just as he and a friend were entering, and now he was on the lobby floor against a wall with his phone plugged into an outlet.

As usual, Sean was trying to figure out the best strategy for how to manage this situation. **He was worried that Michael might do something drastic to himself out of fear or guilt.** Sean called Hugh Freeze, who informed him that the boy had received stitches but was unharmed beyond that. Hugh also said the police were planning on arresting Michael. Sean reeled. An arrest would generate bad press and a bad reputation for Michael. He called a family friend who was also a big-time defense attorney.

During this time, Michael was driving around Oxford angry and confused. He’d never had attachments like he had with the Tuohys before, and his love for them made him vulnerable. Even he was surprised by how quickly he’d become angry after Antonio said what he did about Collins and Leigh Anne. **If Michael was still the kid he was 3 years before, he’d have kept going and never looked back. But he had a family he loved now, so he called Sean.**

Sean told Michael to turn himself in to the Ole Miss police. Afterward, Sean called the boy’s father and any other person with sway in the case and explained who Micahel was and what had happened. He promised to cover the medical bills and damage incurred and got the campus police to handle the situation without the city police.

At the end of it all, Michael completed 10 hours of community service, made a series of apologies, and returned to his life without a single word being written about the incident. He received the rich-white-kid treatment, and no one was the wiser.

### Michael Oher’s Legacy

Michael’s story is scripted as though it was meant to be, and for Michael, it was. He has a hard time admitting that anything that happened to him contributed to his success. **He knew from early on that he was going to be a big athletic star, and he saw his rise as merely the fulfillment of his destiny.** But the truth isn’t quite so fantastic or simple.

Michael may have been born with an athletic gift that made him ripe to be a star, but his path to the NFL was by no means a sure thing. He had to overcome his learning issues and poor school performance, run-ins with the law, an NCAA inquiry, and his lack of training to be a starting left tackle for Ole Miss and a future first-round prospect for the NFL draft. And if he’d simply stayed a black kid from the inner city, he’d likely not have made it. There were numerous people, from Big Tony to the Briarcrest administrators and teachers, who made his current life possible. And then there were the Tuohys, without whom Michael would not have been treated with the privilege he enjoyed.

**All of these aspects of Michael’s life turned him from a poor black kid that no one knew about into a household name within the football sphere and beyond.** And although Michael’s talents and body type are unique, his potential is not. There are hundreds of talented black athletes in West Memphis and other inner city communities who have what it takes to be star athletes someday. But more than likely, no one will ever know who these kids are. Their lives are not organized in a way that grants them access to the brass ring. But after Michael, many tried.

Briarcrest became inundated with applications from poor black students with bad academic histories but athletic talent. These boys wanted a chance to prove themselves and receive the help they needed to be successful in life. And although many at Briarcrest and in East Memphis saw that there was a benefit in helping these kids make something of themselves, the new president wasn’t comfortable with Briarcrest becoming a training ground for black youth.

Sean and Leigh Anne also recognized the lasting legacy of what they’d done for Michael. They saw that there were many young black kids who could have bright athletic futures under the right circumstances. It wasn’t talent that held them back but a skewed system of opportunities. If Briarcrest had opted to allow more black students in, they would have been willing to help give them the resources needed to succeed. **They also knew that it’s 100% fact that if Michael had never crossed their path, his talents would have remained unknown in Hurt Village.**

This point was driven home for Leigh Anne one day in 2006 when she read a story about a young black boy from West Memphis named Arthur Sallis. Sallis was a football star on the rise at one of the Memphis public high schools. He was being recruited by every coach in the SEC and offered scholarships from Kentucky and Ole Miss. But he didn’t qualify for college sports because he didn’t meet the NCAA’s minimum GPA requirement. His scholarships went unused, and Sallis returned to West Memphis.

Sallis didn’t simply go back to West Memphis and do nothing. He started a carpet-cleaning business with his high school coach’s help and raised his baby daughter on his own. Then, a few years later, Sallis was at home with his four-year-old daughter when three men broke in. They shot him in the head, and at 22, Arthur Sallis died.

Leigh Anne realized that Michael could very easily have been Sallis, and she wasn’t alone. A study conducted at Sallis's high school showed that 5 of 6 students with collegiate athletic potential never make it because of their educational performance. One of the only career paths afforded to poor black kids was obstructed. But Leigh Anne was going to do something about it. **She decided she wanted to start a foundation that would help promising black athletes raise their grades so they could follow their dreams.**

### Those Left Behind

Michael’s inability to see the blessings that afforded him his life made him resentful of people from his past who now wanted help. He didn’t feel like he owed anyone anything, and anyway, he didn’t have anything to give. He was still an amateur athlete in college and hadn’t earned a single cent, but that didn’t keep his family and friends from West Memphis from calling.

Once, Michael had stated he would buy a house big enough for his mom and all his siblings when he reached the NFL. But now he stopped returning his mother’s calls and rarely returned his siblings’. **He thought that because they started in the same place, they should be able to turn their own lives around, like he had.**

Part of Michael’s attitude was his feeling that he hadn’t changed as a person. He was still the same kid from Hurt Village, just in a new environment. But there was still one person Michael felt connected to and wanted to help. His old friend Craig from childhood was still a close friend. As soon as Michael got his driver’s license, he started bringing Craig to the Tuohy house. And he knew he would take Craig with him when he went pro.

What made Craig so special was that Michael trusted him because he felt he was one of the only people who didn’t want something from him. Craig never asked for help, and when Michael offered it, he turned it down. Michael took that as a sign of Craig’s integrity, which made him want to help him more. Michael also felt comfortable with Craig because he was the only person who understood that Michael was still the same person he’d always been.

But it would be another two years before Michael could reach his dream of playing in the NFL and helping his friend. He was a sophomore at Ole Miss and couldn’t be drafted until after his junior year. But there was no doubt that he would make it, not for Michael or anyone else.

**Michael started every game for Ole Miss his sophomore year and made the Dean’s List with a 3.75 GPA.** He was focused in college and told those around him that he would stay and graduate, but inside he knew it wasn’t true. If the NFL came knocking when he became eligible, he was going to answer.

Michael no longer looks backwards toward his past. He rarely goes to West Memphis and spends the majority of his time away from the team with his family, the Tuohys. He has successfully shed one life and replaced it with a newer, shinier life. He beat the odds stacked up against him with the wind of the white world, once a presence to hold him down, now pushing him forward. But there is nothing remarkable about this to Michael. It is what it is.

### Shortform Note: Life After _The Blind Side_

After Oher’s junior year season at Ole Miss in 2008, he declared for the NFL draft. But days later, he rescinded and returned to play his senior year. He eventually graduated as a highly decorated college athlete with a degree in criminal justice.

In 2009, Oher was drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens and signed a five-year contract worth $13.8 million, the same year the hit film _The Blind Side _was released (in which Sandra Bullock won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy). He started every game for the Ravens his first season in the NFL and came in second for Rookie of the Year. In 2013, Oher won a Super Bowl with the Ravens over the San Francisco 49ers.

Oher left the Ravens in 2013 to play for the Tennessee Titans, but his career there only lasted one year. Michael then went to play for the Carolina Panthers, protecting star quarterback Cam Newton’s blind side. He signed an extensive $21.6 million three-year contract, but after a failed physical examination due to continuing issues from a concussion, the Panthers released Michael in 2017.

Oher released his own book _I Beat The Odds ,_ in 2011.__ In it, he objected to parts of the film, contending they falsely portrayed him as “dumb.” Also, in 2015, he said the film hurt his career by portraying him as less skilled at football than he really was. Others have criticized the film as portraying Oher as stereotypically submissive to white authority and the Tuohys as “white saviors.”

In August 2023, Oher published another book, _When Your Back’s Against the Wall_ , and six days later, he filed a court petition to terminate a conservatorship with the Tuohys. He claimed they misled him into naming them as his conservators when he was 18—he thought he was signing adoption papers. But, he said, they never adopted him and made millions from his story. The Tuohys’ lawyers told reporters they were “devastated” by the allegations and called the profit claim “outlandish.”

Meanwhile, _The Blind Side_ book author Michael Lewis, a Tuohy family friend, called the allegations ”breathtaking” in light of all the Tuohys had done for Oher.
