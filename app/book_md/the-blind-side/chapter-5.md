## Chapter 5: College Bound

One of the biggest moments in a young college prospect’s life is when he sits behind a row of microphones in a hotel conference room and declares which program will be lucky enough to have him join their team. With Michael Oher currently serving as the best thing to hit high school football since electronic scoreboards, that moment loomed during the fall and winter of 2004. **Now that Michael was a senior, he could be formally courted by college programs** , but he wasn’t the only person the coaches had to charm. Just like in everything else in Michael’s life, Leigh Anne took a leadership role in Michael’s recruitment, as did Sean Jr., who’d become Michael’s best buddy and sidekick and wanted to make sure he had plenty of access to Michael.

Outside of Tennessee and Mississippi, where both she and Sean were alumni of Ole Miss, most of the coaches had no idea who Leigh Anne Tuohy was. Many of them were surprised to come up against her protective nature over Michael. They thought they were coming to visit a poor black kid and dazzle him with promises of financial rewards, shoes, tickets to elite sporting events, and other extravagances. What they found instead was a now-privileged rich kid who had access to a private jet and shopped at Ralph Lauren.

**To avoid any suspicion of favoritism for Ole Miss, Sean stayed out of the recruitment process.** He routed all communication requests through Hugh Freeze. This move didn’t fool anyone. The Tuohys were already building a house near the Ole Miss campus, assuming Collins would attend and cheer there. Their house was decorated on a normal day with Ole Miss paraphernalia, which grew to intense proportions with their Ole Miss-decorated Christmas tree during the holidays. Each coach walking through the Tuohys’ front door had to pitch their program under the shadow of this tree.

But Hugh Freeze quickly became a liability in Michael’s decision process, as well, when he started interviewing for a job on staff at the University of Tennessee. He wasted no time in trying to impart to Michael all the reasons UT was the right school for him. Leigh Anne also wasn’t shy about her feelings about Michael attending Ole Miss, but she didn’t pressure him. But his tutor, a woman named Sue Mitchell, who’d been working with Michael on his grades five hours a day, six days a week for several months and also an Ole Miss alumna, did. On the day before Michael was leaving to visit the Tennessee campus, Sue told him that she’d heard it on good authority that the FBI conducted decomposition tests on corpses and buried the bodies under the football stadium.

Many people had a vested interest in where Michael decided to attend college, but he took it all in stride. He never committed to one school or another in a serious way and entertained any and all offers to visit campuses in an official or unofficial capacity. The only caveat was that **if he was intending to go to Ole Miss, the Tuohys thought it best to officially adopt him to avoid looking like boosters offering monetary bribes to influence Michael’s decision**.

### A Reversal of Fortune and Lifestyle

By the time Christmas rolled around, Michael had become accustomed to the good life. Most of the time, he accepted invitations to visit schools simply so he could ride on the private jet around the country. In fact, when he learned he had to fly on a commercial airline for an official visit to North Carolina State, he almost didn’t go. The only reason he went was that Sean thought it would look suspicious for him to skip an official visit.

To Leigh Anne, Michael’s flippant attitude regarding other people’s time was just another indication of how much Michael didn’t understand the world, which only reinforced her desire for him to attend school close to home.**** His grades had improved thanks to Sue’s help, but grades were not what counted in Leigh Anne’s eyes. Michael wasn’t stupid, and she already knew that, but he was uninformed in the ways of the world. And this ignorance made him vulnerable. **She had no idea how he would cope away from her guidance, so she did everything she could to school him in life to prepare him.**

She educated him in the things that young people naturally pick up when living as part of an upper-class society. She taught him about shopping for himself and anyone special he might want to spoil with gifts. She explained the rules of golf and exposed him to fine art. She took him to restaurants and ordered everything on the menu just so he could see what the different dishes were and tasted like. He learned the differences between all of the Italian dishes and discovered that chicken alfredo was his favorite.

These lessons weren’t just about regular life but about the life she and her family lived. **Michael was part of her family, so he needed to understand what it meant to live in affluent society.** She taught him how to live in a white world, and Michael absorbed all of it and was becoming spoiled as a result. He drove a black SUV and had no problem walking into one of Sean’s restaurants and requesting special attention as the owner’s son.

As Michael grew more into a Tuohy, Leigh Anne grew more relaxed. She started to feel like her work was accomplished and that Michael would be OK. However, this peace was shattered shortly after it arrived when Michael got into a car accident with Sean Jr. in the car. It was winter, and the roads were icy. He couldn’t stop at an intersection and slid head first into an oncoming van going 25 mph. When Leigh Anne got to the scene, she found Michael overcome with emotion and Sean Jr. lying on the ground with an unrecognizable face.

At the hospital, the doctors were surprised Sean Jr. wasn’t seriously injured. His face was bruised and swollen, but no bones had been broken. For a 10-year-old boy sitting in the front seat, the airbag should have caused more damage. Leigh Anne went home and told Michael the good and perplexing news, and that’s when he showed her his arm. **He’d stopped the airbag with his arm, cushioning the impact on Sean Jr. and burning his arm in the process.** This came as no surprise for the boy who scored below the 10th percentile in middle school on every aptitude test except for one. For “protective instincts,” he’d scored in the 90th percentile.

### A Most-Wanted Man

Michael was getting better at playing the role of doted-on rich kid, but it didn’t change who he was in his heart. **He was still innocent and naive, and because of this, he never spoke to any of the coaches who came to visit.** Instead, he’d sit quietly while the recruiters expounded on the great programs and benefits they could offer him and let Sean Jr. ask the hard questions, namely what sort of perks they would offer him as Michael’s brother. The bond between brothers was stronger than ever, and Sean Jr. made it clear that Michael wouldn’t be going anywhere he wasn’t invited along as his entourage.

After months of entertaining coaches and school visits, Michael finally narrowed his choices down to three: LSU, Ole Miss, and Tennessee. Of course, Leigh Anne wanted Michael to go to Ole Miss as much because it was only an hour away as it was her alma mater. She knew people in high positions there and could control Michael’s experience better, but she felt herself become persuaded when the coach from LSU, Nick Saban, made his home visit. He was suave, sophisticated, and well-mannered. He was the kind of person Leigh Anne believed was decent, and she was starting to come around to the idea of Michael attending LSU. Unfortunately, a few weeks after his visit, Saban accepted the head coaching job for the Miami Dolphins in the NFL.

The next home visit was supposed to be from Ole Miss’s head coach, but he was fired only days before he was meant to arrive in Memphis. The only coach left standing was famed Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer, who’d been after Michael since his junior year. The only hitch—**Tennessee was the main rival of Ole Miss, and Sean was not happy about the prospect of having Michael play for the enemy**. Of course, Sean didn’t share this with Michael. He couldn’t be seen in any way to be influencing Michael toward Ole Miss. Instead, he decided to push LSU, even without a coach.

But things changed when Ole Miss hired a new coach, a Louisiana native who served as defensive line coach for the University of Southern California. Coach Ed Orgeron, or Coach O, announced his intent to assume the Ole Miss head coach position at a news conference, and five hours later, he was sitting in the Tuohy living room. As usual, Michael stayed silent. Then, when Coach O was ready to leave, Michael finally asked his first question. He asked what the coach was planning on doing with the players who’d already committed to Ole Miss.

Sean assumed Michael was asking because his close friend had received a scholarship from Ole Miss as the kicker. But Michael wanted to see what type of character Coach O had. If he was going to release all the players who’d been promised a spot on the team by the old coach, was this the type of person he wanted to play for? But Coach O said he was going to let them stay, and after Sean Jr. was promised full access and the chance to lead the team on the field at the first home game, Michael felt good about this new coach.

In general, **Michael had taken a lot away from the five-month recruitment process regarding people. He saw who cared about him and who wanted to profit off of him.** Hugh Freeze fell into this latter group, as Michael saw that Hugh had used his relationship with him to secure a position on the Tennessee coaching staff. He also saw that Sean respected him enough not to pressure him, and although Leigh Anne and Sue had made their feelings clear, their intentions were more about his support system than school loyalty.

Finally, on February 1, 2005, Michael announced his choice at a press conference. He told the reporters he was attending Ole Miss because he wanted to continue the Ole Miss tradition of his family. Ole Miss felt like home, which was not a surprise considering his home was one large shrine to the Rebels. Later, Michael confessed to Sean Jr. that he’d known he was going to Ole Miss since September. He’d just enjoyed the wooing from so many other places.

### Ulterior Motives

At the same time that Michael Oher was declaring his intention to attend Ole Miss, up at the NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis, a rumor was starting to spread about an unethical practice happening in the South. **The rumor suggested that rich white Southern couples were adopting poor black kids from the inner city so they would play football at their alma maters.** How the rumor got started or who it was that called and directed the NCAA’s attention to Michael Oher and the Tuohys is unknown. But a call, or maybe several, had been made, and at least one suggested that the Tuohys had kidnapped Michael. Because of that call, the Tuohys were now under investigation.

In late March, a month and a half after Michael’s press conference, an NCAA investigator named Joyce Thompson sat in the Tuohy household with Michael and Sean. She turned on her tape recorder and started to question Michael. Leigh Anne refused to attend the meeting, finding the whole affair insulting.

Over the course of the next five hours, Joyce questioned Michael about his past, how he came to live with the Tuohys, why he didn’t live with his mother, who paid for his Briarcrest education, who clothed and fed him, and other questions pertaining to Michael’s relationship with the Tuohys. As always, Michael’s answers were mostly one or two words without elaboration or no response at all. Often, Sean jumped in to respond, but Joyce resented his intrusions and told Sean he’d have his turn to be questioned.

**Michael found the investigation annoying and upsetting. He didn’t like being asked about his life, but he also started to wonder whether there wasn’t some truth in the accusation.** Had the Tuohys realized his future worth and taken him in out of some plot to benefit from his talents? He knew Hugh Freeze had used him to further his career. Michael’s faith in the people around him had been shaken so much that his senior quote in the yearbook was a line from a rap song that asked the question: If he didn’t become a star, would people still care about him?

Leigh Anne noticed a difference in his behavior. He didn’t outright reject the Tuohys or treat them differently, but she could tell he was wondering whether things would have been the same if he was just a poor black kid with no talent. He had also started wondering about Big Tony’s motives. Big Tony still kept in touch and seemed to constantly remind Michael that he was responsible for Michael’s fortunate circumstances.

Joyce didn’t help the matter with her questions. When she asked Michael if his truck was a gift for signing with Ole Miss, Sean blurted out that the idea was ridiculous. **But Michael asked him, unclear whether he was joking or not, whether he’d have gotten the truck if he’d signed with UT.**

The conversation became more contentious when Joyce tried to nail down the details of Michael’s upbringing before he met Big Tony. He mumbled something about foster care, but he couldn’t or wouldn’t be more specific. Joyce grew frustrated. She didn’t understand Michael or his secretive and pleasing nature and felt she was being taken for a ride. The interrogation ended only when Sue showed up for Michael’s tutoring lessons. Joyce said she would need to question Michael again.

### The Question of Intelligence

The NCAA investigation was upsetting, but violations were a moot point at the moment. **Michael still wasn’t academically eligible, and if he didn’t find a way to improve his GPA, he wouldn’t be playing football at Ole Miss.**

With Sue’s help, Michael had worked exhaustively to raise his grades from Ds and Fs to As and Bs his final year, but it wasn’t enough. He was going to graduate with a 2.05 GPA, and the NCAA minimum was 2.65. The problem was that he didn’t have any more credits to earn at school. Time had simply run out, and no one knew what to do. For the first time, Sean took over the care of Michael’s education from Leigh Anne and Sue to find a solution.

Sean went to Coach O to discuss Michael’s circumstances and discovered a loophole in the NCAA regulations. Brigham Young University in Utah offered online courses that could be completed in less than two weeks and count as a grade replacement for a full semester’s grade in high school.

One of the problems with this plan was that the courses had to be taken during the school year to serve as replacements, and the school year was quickly coming to an end. The only caveat was if the student had a learning disability. Those students were allowed to complete courses up until the beginning of August. Michael had never tested positive for a learning disability in the Memphis public school system, but it was clear he struggled with learning. At any rate, it was the only option they had, so Sean set up an assessment.

Sean took Michael to see two female psychological examiners. They gave him several achievement tests.**** They asked him simple mathematical and logic questions and asked him to perform basic tasks, like drawing a picture of a house. **From these tests, the examiners saw that Michael had significant knowledge deficiencies and had never been truly taught how to read.** He’d never been taught phonics, which allows children to sound out words and determine what they mean based on their context in a sentence. Michael was a master memorizer, and the only reason he could read was that he’d memorized a large number of words.

Michael was an enigma to these examiners. At 18, he still learned like a child learned, through association rather than knowledge. There had been an opportunity for Michael to learn to read and take in information properly when he arrived at Briarcrest, but his secretive and pleasing nature had hindered that. He’d hidden his deficiencies as best he could, faking his way through to avoid being considered stupid. But the examiners could tell he wasn’t stupid, and this belief was confirmed when they gave him a new IQ test.

His previous IQ test scores as a child stated that his IQ was 80. With this IQ, he was determined to be unintelligent, so his poor performance was not considered a learning issue. He was learning about as well as could be expected with his lack of innate intelligence. But on this new IQ test, Michael scored between 100 and 110, which meant he was of average intelligence.

This result baffled the examiners. IQ wasn’t supposed to change. They explained that IQ is based on both critical thinking in the moment and thinking based on experience. The problem with Michael as a young boy was that he’d had no experiences. There was no way for him to respond through experience or critically because of that. But since arriving at Briarcrest, he’d been immersed in experiences, so his ability to make conclusions was functioning more normally. These results were good for Michael. **As a person of average intelligence, his learning achievements were now not in line with what he should be capable of. He legitimately had a learning disability.**

### Clearing the Final Hurdles

With his new diagnosis intact, Michael set to work to build up his GPA through the BYU courses. He took a series of courses called Character Education, which seemed to involve reading famous speeches or passages and answering a few questions. **As the weeks went on, Sue helped Michael pass his Character Courses and replace Fs on his transcript with As.** They were making progress toward their goal, but there was still the NCAA to deal with.

Toward the end of April, Joyce returned for her second interview. Again, she pressed Michael about any rich white person who had given him something over the course of his time at Briarcrest, whether money, a place to stay, or material gifts. As before, Joyce grew frustrated with Michael’s unwillingness to answer her questions or expound on his answers.

At this point, the conversation became heated. Joyce**** was suspicious and thought it strange that Michael wasn’t answering for himself. She didn’t understand the BYU situation, how Michael had survived so long without a home, and why he was with the Tuohys. Eventually, it was time for Michael to go study, and Joyce and Sean were left alone. Joyce suddenly changed her demeanor and admitted that she was pressing Michael so hard because **she was truly curious about his living situation and couldn’t understand why the Tuohys had done what they did for him.**

Sean explained his relationship with Michael and told her what he could about Michael’s past. He also said Michael had ruined them to some extent; they couldn’t look at a poor black kid now without wondering whether there was something they could do to help. Should they take in another kid after Michael left for college? Joyce almost fell out of her seat at the suggestion that they would do this again, but that was the last conversation she had with Sean or Michael. **Whether she was satisfied or simply didn’t have enough evidence to support a case is unclear, but the matter was over.**

### Crossing the Finish Line

A month after the end of the NCAA investigation, Michael walked across the stage at Briarcrest’s graduation to receive his diploma. Big Tony and Sue were both in attendance, but Michael’s mother was not.

A couple of months later, Michael finished his final BYU course and successfully upped his GPA to NCAA standards. Sean turned in the paperwork a day before the deadline, and the next day, Michael was given the green light to play collegiate sports. His future was again on track.

When Coach O heard the news, he called Sean and told him how happy he was. His plan was to build an entire offensive around Michael, which was unusual. Most college freshmen don’t start their first year. They are given an extra year of eligibility to practice at the higher level and learn from the upperclassmen. Sean was concerned when he heard this news. Michael wasn’t ready to face off against 22-year-old men who’d been playing college football for years.

Sean went to Coach O’s office to explain exactly who Michael was. He explained that he’d never weight-trained like other players and had only played offense for one season. He also didn’t learn plays like other players. Michael couldn’t learn by staring at a series of drawn-up plays on a whiteboard or in a binder. The Xs and Os wouldn’t make sense to him. He would say they did to please the coach, but come game day, he’d be lost.

**Micahel learned by seeing, and he had the gift of memorization. Once he saw something, he never forgot it.** If Coach O wanted Michael to learn plays, he had to use props and videos to show him what to do. Coach O took three pages of notes and thanked Sean for this valuable information. He would take these issues to heart. Michael would be in good hands.
