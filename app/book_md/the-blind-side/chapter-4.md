## Chapter 4: A New Future for Michael Oher

By the time football season started in 2004, Michael Oher was a household name among NCAA Division I football programs and just about anyone else who was paying attention. **Michael’s realization that he might have a future in football was spawned by thousands of offer letters from various universities, many of which were full-ride offers.** He attended summer training camps and received intensive coaching by both Hugh Freeze and the offensive line coach, Tim Long, a former left tackle in the NFL. But Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy both saw two obstacles in Michael’s path to football stardom.

The first was his lack of aggression. The time since his anger during the Myrtle Beach game was long gone, and their memories of his docile football performance from the previous year made them skeptical that he could perform the left tackle role the way he needed to. They settled in for a pre-season scrimmage (Leigh Anne in the stands and Sean on the sidelines as assistant coach) against a nearby town, Mumford, and waited to see what would happen.

Somehow, the Mumford players and fans hadn’t become aware of Michael’s rising status and only saw a giant blob of a player on the field. Right away, a 220-pound defensive end started heckling Michael. **He made fun of his weight and taunted him about his play. Michael tried to ignore the taunting at first, but his anger grew.**

On the next play, Michael was instructed to block the mouthy kid from the quarterback. Instead, when the whistle blew, Michael picked the player up by his chest plate and ran him down the field. He took a left and headed toward the Mumford bench, knocking players and coaches out of the way. Michael’s path ended when just about every Mumford player tackled him.

The referees blew their whistles and were about to call a penalty on Michael, but they didn’t know what to call. The whistle to end the play hadn’t been blown, so technically, Michael had done nothing wrong. When Sean asked Michael what he’d been thinking during the play, Michael simply said he was tired of hearing the kid’s mouth and was taking him to the team bus. Sean suppressed his laughter and told him that he had to start playing with more discipline now. He was a big deal, and all eyes would be on him. **That was the moment everyone saw that Michael had the competitiveness he would need to succeed.**

### Becoming Human

With his growing popularity, Michael started changing. **Where once Michael was reserved and afraid of his own shadow, now he was gregarious at school and becoming popular.** The more people told him he was special, the more he started to believe it. At home, he was becoming more outspoken, confident, and comfortable asking for things. The first thing he wanted was a driver’s license.

Leigh Anne was willing to get Michael a license, but she didn’t have any documentation for him. He had no birth certificate, social security card, or school ID. On paper, Michael Oher didn’t exist. To start the process of making him official, Leigh Anne collected an ID card and documentation from the school to vouch for his existence. But the man at the social security office said he still couldn’t find anyone named Michael Oher in his system. His hands were tied.

But Leigh Anne wasn’t one to take no for an answer, so she explained the situation to the man. She told him about Michael’s life and them taking him in, and it worked. The man continued looking and discovered something strange. **Michael Jerome Oher didn’t exist, but Michael Jerome Williams did. Leigh Anne was confused until Michael said that was him. Williams was his father’s name.**

Despite the victory at the social security office, Leigh Anne knew it was unlikely the DMV would allow him to take the test without a birth certificate. Michael assured her he didn’t have one. She asked about his mother, and he said he doubted she had one either. This mention of Michael’s mother again brought up Leigh Anne’s frustration with his relationship with her. He said he was visiting his mother, but Leigh Anne had her doubts. She told Michael if he wasn’t going to visit his mother, she would. Her threat did the trick.

When Michael returned from West Memphis, he had a crumpled, soiled piece of paper. They’d found his birth certificate. When Leigh Anne looked at it, she saw that his name was, in fact, Williams and his birthday was two days before he’d said it was. When she asked him about his birthdate, he simply said the hospital had gotten it wrong. Although she knew this was unlikely to be true, she didn’t push the matter and kept his birthday as the day he said it was.

Leigh Anne drove to the outskirts of Memphis with both Collins and Michael to get their driver’s licenses. As she suspected, schmoozing the DMV workers was not easy. He needed proof of residence, which they didn’t have. The only thing that would work would be an official letter with his legal name on it. And the only place to get that was back at his mother’s house.

Leigh Anne and Michael drove all the way to West Memphis, leaving Collins behind to stall for time, to his mother’s house. When they arrived, they found his mother friendly but slurring her words. She tried to hug Michael, but he didn’t return it. Leigh Anne asked about a piece of mail, and the mother directed them to the mailbox. When they opened it, months of bills fell at their feet addressed to Michael. Leigh Anne grabbed the first bill she saw. They raced back to the DMV, neither speaking about what had just happened.

Leigh Anne anxiously waited with Collins while Michael took the test. She’d become used to doing everything either with or for him, and leaving him to his own devices was difficult for her. By now, she felt like his mother. He even called her “mama,” and the family treated him like he’d always been there. **She was constantly defending her choice to her extended family and friends, who were not shy about suggesting that she was putting Collins in danger by having a black boy in the house.** But Leigh Anne’s love for Michael was so deep, she told them all to shove it.

Finally, Michael appeared with a driver’s license. On the way home, he told her he was the first person in his family to have a driver’s license. That’s why it had been so important to him to get one. It had been a day of revelations about this boy she had learned to love. Despite his new confidence and openness, he was still secretive and didn’t talk much about himself. He still said what he thought would please others, and this problem would rear its head again soon when she received his transcripts.

### Making the Grade

With all the talk of college football, Leigh Anne decided to request Michael’s grades to make sure he was on track. To her surprise, he wasn’t. She’d assumed that since no one had said a word about his academic progress, or lack thereof, that he’d been doing better. What she found was a 1.56 GPA, a full point below the minimum requirement for the NCAA. The same thing that had happened in the previous public schools was happening again. **Briarcrest was simply passing him through all his classes without concern for his future.**

Leigh Anne knew there was no way he would fulfill his role as top college prospect if he didn’t graduate from high school, but what angered her more was the carelessness of the school administration. She marched to Briarcrest and reprimanded everyone from Principal Simpson down to his teachers. She told them they were going to have to deal with her now, and as always, it was not an idle threat.

Leigh Anne now required Michael to go to school at 6 in the morning for tutoring help and be in class straight through until the end of school, since he was behind in credits. She went through his backpack every day to make sure he didn’t forget to mention a failing grade on a test. His penchant for secrets often kept the details of his schoolwork a mystery if she didn’t ask outright. Leigh Anne started to wonder what made him so secretive, but she didn’t push the matter. **She was only concerned with his life now, and she was going to make sure he graduated one way or another.**

### Becoming a Champion

Despite the fanfare surrounding Michael Oher at the beginning of the 2004 football season, Hugh Freeze still wasn’t sure what to do with him. He was used to coaching a particular way, one that included trick plays meant to confuse the other team. He’d been successful over the years, leading his team to 5 of 6 state championship titles. But after the first regular season game, in which Briarcrest lost 6-16, it was clear his usual strategy wasn’t going to work. Leigh Anne as much as said so after that first game, but **it wasn’t until Assistant Coach Tim Long said that Hugh wasn’t using his most valuable weapon that he had a change of heart**.

The fourth game of the season was against a powerhouse school called Treadwell, who was more skilled in every way than Briarcrest. Before the game, Hugh brought the players together for their usual pre-game pep talk. He told them they were going to run the Gap play the entire game. The Gap involved the running back moving up the field right behind the left tackle. With Michael at left tackle, it would be like hiding behind a cement truck traveling 100 mph.

By halftime, Briarcrest led by 40 points. The crowd, players, and assistant coaches were overjoyed, but Hugh wasn’t. He was winning, but the game was no longer fun to coach. Still, he couldn’t deny the success of the play, and the Gap became the one and only play the Briarcrest football team used for the rest of the season.

The Briarcrest team lost only one game along the road to the playoffs. By December, they only had three games left to make it to the championships. Finally, the team arrived at the championship game played at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The opposing team was the only team to beat them that season once they started playing the Gap. This time, Briarcrest was ready for them.

**The other team’s coach remembers watching Michael on the field and realizing that there was nothing they could do to stop him.** But Hugh Freeze could. He didn’t enjoy the beat down they were giving the other team at this level of competition. It was too easy, and he no longer felt like himself on the sidelines. After two months of nothing but the Gap, he decided to change things up. He called a trick play, and the team ran it to perfection and would have scored a touchdown if one of the defensive players hadn’t pushed the fullback out at the one-yard line. This defensive player was supposed to have been blocked by Michael.

When Sean called Michael over to chew him out, he asked Michael why he’d just stood there instead of blocking. Michael said he knew what he was supposed to do, but he was enthralled by how good the trick play was, and he wanted to watch. After a full season of charging through teenage boys like a freight train, Michael still didn’t have a killer spirit. This was shown again when he was tasked with taking down a fullback on the opposing team. Instead of bowling him over, Michael saw the face of a Tuohy family friend behind the mask and greeted him warmly. Then, he picked him up and gently moved him out of the way before returning to the play.

Briarcrest won the game easily, and Michael had his first state title. **It was clear to everyone in Tennessee that he was the best player in the state and maybe ever at this level.** He’d made his mark as a high school football player. Now, the main questions were whether he’d be able to make that same mark in college and where.
