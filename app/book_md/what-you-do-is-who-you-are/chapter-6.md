## Chapter 6: Understand the Challenges of Culture

In this final chapter, we’ll explore some of the factors that Horowitz believes make it challenging for leaders to leverage culture to support their organization’s vision and make it an attractive place to work.

### Cultures Have Built-In Challenges

Horowitz describes three characteristics inherent in culture that will challenge you as you design and implement your culture:

#### Challenge #1: Culture Is Both Aspirational and Actionable

The first challenging feature of culture is that **you must balance acknowledgment that it’s an unattainable ideal with taking action to get as close as possible.** Culture reflects what the organization hopes to become. But Horowitz makes clear that you can’t expect complete compliance with the culture. To get as close as possible to that ideal culture you’ve designed, you must consistently take actions that are in line with the culture. At the same time, the needs of the business will sometimes take precedence over culture, and you might find yourself temporarily breaking a cultural rule because it’s not helpful to the organization’s short-term objectives.

(Shortform note: In _Start With Why _Simon Sinek clarifies that you can prevent the split between aspirational and actionable by keeping the focus on the “why” or purpose of your organization. Some strategies he offers to keep your focus are:

  * Making sure that the “why” trickles from the top down to every single employee
  * Measuring the metrics that truly align with your “why”
  * Ensuring your company is prepared to transition leadership to people who support the “why” as strongly as current leadership so there’s continuity)



#### Challenge #2: Culture Is Always Evolving

The second challenging feature of culture is that it**** needs to**continuously evolve to allow the organization to move forward**. As we’ve seen in Senghor’s lessons, hanging on to culture as dogma can keep an organization stuck in modes of behavior that served the original strategy but no longer move it in a direction of growth. In addition, Horowitz warns that cultural strengths can become weaknesses. If the organization leans too heavily on a particular characteristic, it can go to a detrimental extreme. For instance, overemphasizing horizontal organization caused a crisis at Zappos in which people chose to leave the company rather than try to get their jobs done in a confusing flat structure.

(Shortform note: This challenge also points to a balancing act that culture leaders must enact: maintaining the organization’s core cultural identity without letting it calcify into dogma. In _Built to Last, _Collins and Porras provide actionable steps for leaders to sustain that balance, including maintaining a core ideology by fostering a cult-like workplace centered on its values and promoting from within, and stimulating progress by committing to challenging goals, experimenting, and never settling for “good enough.”)

#### Challenge #3: Culture Is Universal

The final challenging feature of culture is that it **must permeate every aspect and area of your organization,** so there are no inconsistencies that lead to confusion or frustration.**** Horowitz notes that everyone has to be on board with the culture, from rank-and-file employees to investors, so that they all pull in the same direction.

(Shortform note: Culture experts highlight that not fostering a cohesive identity throughout an organization can lead to compartmentalization and the creation of silos, which endangers the integration necessary in moments of major change, such as a digital transformation. They point out two challenges that must be tackled in order to bring cohesion to an organization:

  * Not being able to let go of projects, even successful ones, to embark on unknown but potentially more beneficial ones outside of the organization’s comfort zone
  * Making frequent exceptions that seem small on their own but together amount to huge diversions from the organization’s core)



The exception to the universality of culture is the organic development of **subcultures** that reflect the characteristics of specific teams, such as marketing or accounting. Horowitz explains that an organization’s core characteristics are relevant to the entire culture, but some of its characteristics apply only to specific subcultures. For example, Facebook’s early motto, which encouraged employees to “move fast and break things,” was important guidance for engineers and designers, but probably less useful to the legal or accounting departments.

(Shortform note: Beyond pragmatic reasons, subcultures can help companies be more flexible and inclusive without losing their dominant cultural traits. By allowing subcultures to emerge, companies can keep their internal coherence and still be able to deploy specific teams to respond to fast-paced developments in their environment, such as disruptive technologies or unforeseen competition. On the other hand, subcultures that form around demographics rather than teams can help employees from diverse backgrounds find a group in which to feel at home without losing their ties to the organization’s broader culture.)

### Example: Andreessen Horowitz’s Focus on Entrepreneurs

Horowitz offers an example from his own experience that illustrates the three challenging characteristics of culture. When he co-founded the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, their culture served their strategy: being an entrepreneur-focused venture capital firm. They were in business to support visionary entrepreneurs, and their mission was to give them the necessary support to bring their visions to life.

**Their culture was _actionable:_** They supported entrepreneurs by having only experienced former founders or CEOs sit on their boards. They also provided founders with an extensive network of press, talent, and resources through the firm’s junior employees.

**Their culture was _aspirational:_** Although the ethos of the firm was to make the entrepreneur the focus, the experienced founders and CEOs that sat on the boards of the firms they funded enjoyed being in charge and didn’t always go along with Andreessen Horowitz’s belief of showing the utmost respect to the entrepreneur.

**Their culture was _universal:_** Their culture affected every aspect of the firm’s operations and not always for the best. Because of the rule that only experienced founders or CEOs sat on the boards of the companies they funded, Andreessen Horowitz never promoted their junior employees to general partnership. Thus, junior employees left the company quickly and often—taking with them the culture, skills, and network insight entrepreneurs needed.

**Their culture was continuously _evolving:_** Horowitz realized that to continue being an entrepreneur-focused firm, Andreessen Horowitz had to break their rule and start promoting their best junior employees to general partnership. This allowed them to keep their best cultural advocates, support their entrepreneurs, and continue growing beyond their initial strategy.

(Shortform note: This example also showcases other challenges that experts on organizational culture have highlighted:

  * Employees bring their own cultures to the organization, like Andreessen Horowitz’s CEO partners who brought their own cultures to the firm and didn’t always align with the firm’s values.
  * If culture is only expressed through values and symbols, employees cannot acquire it since they learn experientially. Andreessen Horowitz understood this, and they set rules and policies based on their culture.)



### The Culture of Decision-Making

A final challenge pertaining to culture is decision-making. How you make important decisions is _shaped by_ _your culture_ because it is an expression of your leadership style. At the same time, it _shapes_ _your culture_ because it determines your priorities and how employees and leaders interact with each other. According to Horowitz, leaders make three choices that set the tone for the organization’s culture of decision-making: autocracy versus democracy, speed versus accuracy, and top-down versus bottom-up.

#### Autocracy, Consensus-Building, or Democracy

**The first choice Horowitz believes a leader has to make is how much power she will ultimately have** —a choice among autocracy, consensus-building, and democracy.

##### Autocracy

In this first decision-making style, you make the decision on your own. Horowitz argues that this style fosters a culture of efficiency because it doesn’t waste any time, but it doesn’t take advantage of the insight other people have so it disempowers everyone other than you. Taken to an extreme, it can become inefficient as everyone needs to wait for you to make a decision.

##### Consensus-Building

This second decision-making style has you trying to get everyone on the team to agree on a decision. According to Horowitz, it fosters empowerment at the expense of efficiency because it requires a major time commitment, but ensures that everyone participates in the decision. Taken to an extreme, this style can become disempowering because no one can move forward until everyone has had a say and reached a consensus.

##### Democracy

In this final decision-making style, you hear from everyone on the team who has something to say about the decision, but ultimately make the final call yourself. Horowitz argues that this style fosters a culture that balances efficiency with empowerment because it takes advantage of the insights others have, but ultimately the buck stops with you.

> **Deciding How to Decide**
> 
> Each style has its set of advantages and disadvantages, so it might be best to choose an approach according to the specific decision you have in front of you. In _Crucial Conversations_ , Kerry Patterson et al. provide guidelines to choose the right decision-making method for every situation. They suggest considering these four questions before deciding how to decide:
> 
>   * Who wants to participate and who will be affected by the decision?
> 
>   * Who has information or expertise you might need to make the decision?
> 
>   * Who needs to be on board with the final outcome and should therefore be included from the beginning?
> 
>   * How many people need to be involved (the fewer, the better)?
> 
> 


#### Speed Versus Accuracy

The second choice Horowitz says a leader has to make in regard to decision-making is **whether to prioritize speed—making the decision quickly—or accuracy—making sure you arrive at the right final outcome**.

##### Speed

According to Horowitz, companies that favor speed over accuracy in decision-making often make a large volume of decisions. Large companies favor speed because their employees make hundreds of similar decisions each day, and the outcome of one decision impacts the workflow of hundreds of people. In these cases, the potential time lost in protracted decision-making is a greater liability than the potential mistake. If you make a mistake, it’s better to make it quickly, realize it’s a mistake, and then fix it armed with the valuable information the mistake has given you. The alternative would be to spend a lot of time figuring out the right course of action—while hundreds of people wait for you to decide—and even then there’s no guarantee that you’ll make the right decision.

##### Accuracy

Horowitz argues that companies that favor accuracy over speed in decision-making often face a small number of significant decisions. Small companies where the relative impact of each decision is greater favor accuracy. A company with few resources or opportunities to make its business work must ensure every decision brings it closer to its vision. It’s better to spend significant time making sure you make the right decision than to rush because—unlike a large company—you don’t have many chances.

Horowitz clarifies that both large and small companies favor accuracy in situations that involve financial or reputational risk. Whenever the outcome of the decision will determine the success of a venture, the wrong decision would put the company in danger. Similarly, if the decision affects important elements of the brand’s promise—the value the brand has committed itself to delivering—the wrong decision could negatively affect clients’ perception of the brand and company, potentially leading to financial loss.

(Shortform note: The choice between speed and accuracy might remind leaders of the choice between waterfall and agile project management methodologies. While waterfall’s rigid approach to projects can stifle speed, its focus on documentation and clear requirements helps keep a tighter rein on outcomes. On the other hand, agile’s focus on flexibility helps projects deliver value more quickly but doesn’t always ensure the final outcome is what was intended at the beginning. Similarly, feeling that your company’s culture of decision-making has to choose between either accuracy or speed is a false choice. In practice, organizations decide which to favor depending on the decision at hand, much like choosing between waterfall and agile depends on the nature of the specific project to be executed.)

#### Top-Down Versus Bottom-Up

The final choice Horowitz says a leader has to make in regard to her organization’s culture of decision-making is **how much decision-making power to give her employees—a choice between making decisions top-down or bottom-up.**

##### Top-Down

When decision-making is top-down, leaders make decisions with a bird’s-eye view of the organization. They are able to see how the decision’s effect ripples across the company, and they can ensure that all teams receive information about the decision and that it is in line with the company’s strategy. However, Horowitz cautions that they might disregard important information that lower-level employees have. Also, they can create bottlenecks because employees whose work depends on the decision need to wait for them to decide.

##### Bottom-Up

When decision-making is bottom-up, Horowitz says lower-ranking employees make decisions considering the insight they have on aspects of the business that they work closely with. This empowers employees, which in turn motivates them to be more involved and take ownership of the company’s success. However, this type of decision-making might mean that different teams make decisions independently and don’t communicate them to each other because they don’t have the view from the top to see how their decisions affect other teams.

> **Dispersed Decision-Making**
> 
> In _No Rules Rules, _Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer describe the decision-making process at Netflix: a dispersed decision-making system that alleviates some of the shortcomings of bottom-up decision-making without reverting to top-down. To achieve that balance, the system outlines four steps for employees to follow:
> 
>   * Step 1: **Get feedback**. Employees share their idea with managers and colleagues, gathering input and making adjustments based on that input. If employees get feedback from managers and colleagues outside of their area or department, they can avoid working in silos.
> 
>   * Step 2: **Test it out**. Employees bring their idea down to a smaller scale in order to test it out before committing large amounts of resources and time into a full-blown version.
> 
>   * Step 3: **Take the lead**. Employees who come up with an idea become its project managers.
> 
>   * Step 4: **Share successes and failures**. After the process has been executed, project leads share the success or failure with the rest of the organization. If the project fails, they write an open memo detailing what happened and what they learned from the experience. This step also aids communication by ensuring the entire company gets to learn from each others’ mistakes.

#### After Making the Decision

Regardless of how you arrive at a decision, Horowitz says **the moment that makes or breaks your organization’s culture is right after having made the decision**. How leaders communicate the decision to employees and how leaders manage their reactions can strengthen or debilitate the culture. If a leader below the CEO level, such as a manager, lets employees know that they personally disagree with the decision, they create an opening for employees to question or challenge decisions.

According to Horowitz, everyone below the CEO must be unwavering in their adherence to the decision from the moment it’s made—even if they disagree with it. This prevents giving employees the opportunity to doubt the leaders’ decision-making and disrupt cultural cohesion. To do so, middle managers should accept the decisions leadership has made, vocally support them, and be able to explain the reasoning to anyone who questions them.

(Shortform note: The behavior Horowitz is advocating here contradicts his advice to foster the freedom to speak up about problems. Other experts also hold a different opinion, such as Ronald Heifetz (_The Practice of Adaptive Leadership) _who argues that leaders should let employees come to their own conclusions rather than always do whatever the leader will like best. This will allow the organization to harness the intelligence of all of its members, rather than rely on a select group of people to make decisions for everyone else.)
