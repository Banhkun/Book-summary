## Exercise: Observe Your Company’s Vital Signs

Horowitz believes that simply asking employees how they feel about the culture won’t give you useful insights. Instead, he argues you should keep an eye on certain vital signs.

* * *

Reflect on the last three employees or colleagues who quit the team. Were they good cultural fits? Why wasn’t the organization able to keep them?

Look up your industry’s attrition rate and compare it to your organization’s. Are your employees or colleagues quitting at the same rate as the industry or lower? If your organization’s rate is higher, what can the organization do to reverse that trend?

Find the employee or colleague who has joined your organization most recently. Ask them what they have learned about the culture so far. Make a note of any comment that surprises or worries you, and make a plan to address it in the near future.
