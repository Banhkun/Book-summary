## Chapter 1: Understand Culture—The Basics

_What You Do Is Who You Are_ offers lessons for leaders who want to design or improve their organization’s culture. Ben Horowitz wrote this book after learning as a CEO and venture capitalist how critical culture is to a business and how much leaders struggle to define and create it.

This guide organizes Horowitz’s lessons and examples, starting from understanding what culture is and why it matters, laying the foundations of your culture, making it inclusive, modeling and reinforcing it, and continuously improving it. Finally, we’ll explore Horowitz’s insights into why culture can be challenging.

To understand how to create an intentional culture, Horowitz studied four unique cultures in history and drew lessons from them:

  * **Samurai Warriors:** Build your culture on strong tenets and have a method of translating them to action.
  * **Genghis Khan:** Embrace inclusivity to strengthen your culture.
  * **Toussaint Louverture:** Define, model, and reinforce your culture.
  * **Shaka Senghor:** Evolve your culture to keep up with your strategy.



The four models span widely different contexts, but each exemplifies a culture that served the vision and strategy of its leader and endured, in some cases even surviving the leader who designed and implemented it. (Shortform note: The use of historical examples of culture can create some cognitive dissonance when applied to a business context. This might explain why Horowitz sparked controversy for allegedly oversimplifying the social and historical topics included in the book to make them fit within the narrower framework of organizational culture.)

In this chapter, we’ll begin by discussing what culture is and why Horowitz believes intentionally designing and nurturing your culture is important. Then, we’ll look at two core elements of intentional cultures.

### What Is Culture?

Horowitz doesn't give a conclusive definition of culture, but he makes clear what culture is _not_. Culture is not the perks some companies offer to employees, the corporate values that most companies claim to follow, the mission statement, or even the CEO’s leadership style. These can all reflect an organization’s culture, but on their own, they’re not the culture. (Shortform note: Experts agree with Horowitz that perks and other features are surface-level. Most experts say it’s culture’s deeper structure of beliefs and assumptions that define it. However, Horowitz believes values by themselves are surface-level, too—they must be linked to action.)

From the array of definitions Horowitz gives, we can understand _culture_ as **the way employees make decisions and act based on their perception of underlying premises and shared beliefs**. The title of the book, _What You Do Is Who You Are,_ stresses that it’s actions that truly define a culture. Further, because your actions, decisions, premises, and beliefs are unique to your organization, there is no perfect or ideal culture replicable by everyone.

(Shortform note: In _Leading Change, _John Kotter argues that culture is made up of behaviors, norms, priorities, and values that persist in a group over generations. Although Horowitz doesn’t explicitly say so, we might infer from his emphasis on the culture being sustainable that he agrees that the elements that make up culture are the ones that endure over time.)

Horowitz says culture derives from what leaders state _explicitly_ and also what they enforce _implicitly_ by example and through the organization’s incentive structure. Leaders’ actions and messaging inform employees’ behavior. Therefore, he argues that as a leader, you should be _intentional_ about the culture you’re designing. If you’re not intentional in shaping your culture, your employees will shape it in ways you might not like. _What You Do Is Who You Are_ is about how to translate your beliefs into action—that is, how to create the culture you want and sustain it over time.

(Shortform note: Leaders struggle with designing their culture intentionally, and they often delegate culture to the Human Resources department since HR works closely with all employees, training them and receiving their direct feedback. However, when leaders leave culture in the hands of HR, they’re forgetting that it’s _their_ example that sets the culture most clearly. If a strong cultural identity flows down from the top, it’s easier to get the entire company aligned. If not, siloed departments each start creating their own competing cultures, and there is no coherent identity binding the organization together.)

### Why Culture Matters

As we’ve seen, Horowitz sees culture as encompassing the actions and decisions of the employees of an organization. All those actions and decisions add up to the organization’s success or failure, which is why culture matters. Horowitz cites three ways culture boosts a business. First, **an intentional culture serves the company’s vision by ensuring that employees know what to do to move the company forward, and they consistently do it**.

(Shortform note: While Horowitz argues that a strong culture ensures employees know what to do to move the company forward, culture can also help leaders do the same by aligning everything the company does. Guided by their culture, leaders can create alignment within a company, ensuring that every element reinforces every other element within a company, instead of creating competing forces that slow down progress toward the organization’s vision. In _Built to Last, _Jim Collins and Jerry Porras argue that to create alignment, you must be able to look at both the big picture and the details to ensure cohesion among all the company’s features.)

Second, Horowitz argues that **the right culture can boost individual and company performance by giving employees a common purpose**. Successful cultures help employees see that their work matters to the overall mission and that they all direct their daily actions and decisions toward the same goal.

(Shortform note: In _Measure What Matters_ , John Doerr takes this argument further and says that culture is, most of all, a shared sense of purpose. He cites research showing that companies with positive cultures outperform those without them. According to Doerr, this is because a cohesive company culture where everyone understands their purpose helps employees make decisions quickly and reliably.)

Third, Horowitz believes a great**** culture plus a great product or service is powerful—**it can make an impact beyond a single organization and disrupt an industry and an entire system, changing the business landscape forever**. He explains that industries develop default modes of behavior that replicate in every new company that comes up in the industry, and they become that industry’s culture. If an organization develops effective new behaviors to deal with the industry’s or system’s challenges, and the product or service the company provides is successful, other companies begin copying the culture in the hopes of being equally successful.

> **How** **Hip-Hop Disrupted the Music and Business Worlds**
> 
> While Horowitz credits hip-hop culture as disrupting the music world, its influence extended even further. Besides spreading the hustler's mentality in the music industry, it also disrupted the business world by forcing brands and companies from other industries to grapple with hip-hop and with the cultural shifts it brought to the fore.
> 
> Steve Stoute, the author of _The Tanning of America_ , describes how some companies were able to grow their businesses by embracing the emerging culture while others were less successful. For instance, Adidas was a struggling company in the eighties until hip-hop group RUN DMC put out their song “My Adidas _._ ” __ Adidas executives took advantage of the opportunity and signed deals with RUN DMC, starting a decades-long relationship between the brand and the hip-hop community.
> 
> Other brands were less successful. Stoute mentions Cristal, a champagne brand that rappers and hip-hop artists showcased in their music videos to signal their affluent lifestyle. Cristal executives didn’t appreciate the connection to hip-hop, though, and the company said their product wasn’t for that community. The hip-hop community responded by no longer referencing the brand in their music, and Cristal’s market share dropped dramatically, becoming irrelevant to the generations that came after.

#### Example: How Intel’s Culture Disrupted Business

Horowitz cites Intel as an example of a culture that disrupted an industry. Bob Noyce, one of Intel’s co-founders, set the tone for Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation. At the time, companies emphasized hierarchy, which stifled innovation because employees only had decision-making power if they climbed the ladder high enough.

Instead, Noyce created a horizontal culture that empowered employees and gave them the freedom to explore new ideas. He got rid of vice presidents and empowered middle managers whom founders would oversee directly. He also made ownership of the company horizontal by giving engineers stock options. This allowed engineers to feel invested enough to nurture and iterate products so they remained innovative. Noyce also emphasized Intel’s horizontal culture through a relaxed dress code and an open office organization. To support the messages _implicit_ in those cultural features, Intel had mandatory meetings on company culture to make their beliefs _explicit_ and ensure that everyone understood them.

Intel’s culture is now a standard in Silicon Valley and beyond. After seeing Intel’s success, companies in other industries and regions adopted its cultural features, from open offices to stock options.

(Shortform note: While Intel defined the culture for Silicon Valley, features of Silicon Valley's innovation culture then spread beyond the tech industry to businesses in general. Some of those features, such as employee ownership and horizontal structures have generally been positive shifts in the business world. Other features, such as open-floor offices and perks, blurred the line between work life and personal life and have become double-edged swords for companies and employees.)

### Core Elements of Intentional Cultures

Horowitz emphasizes there is no perfect, one-size-fits-all culture because the behaviors and beliefs that work for one company may not work for another. However, he says **all intentional cultures share two core elements** : They reflect the leader’s strengths, and they support the organization’s strategy.

(Shortform note: Silicon Valley culture, for all its innovation and value-creating power, is an example of a culture that doesn’t fit everywhere, even though many businesses and even countries have tried to emulate it. Some of the downsides of emulating Silicon Valley are the high percentage of failed ventures that are inevitable when favoring fast-paced innovation and the litany of scandals and unethical behavior that can result from its rule-book-ripping culture.)

#### Core Element #1: Successful Cultures Reflect Leaders’ Strengths…

First, Horowitz argues the culture you design should reflect who you are as a leader, your strengths, and beliefs, rather than emulate what other leaders do. If you start from your strengths, the culture you design will be sustainable because you’ll be implementing a style that comes naturally to you.

##### … But Avoid Leaders’ Weaknesses

The flip side is that your culture shouldn’t reflect your weaknesses, or characteristics that won’t serve the organization’s vision. Because your example as the leader sets the tone for the organization, your weaknesses can permeate the culture as employees emulate your behavior. To keep your weaknesses from infecting your culture, the author says you first need to become aware of them, then immunize your culture against them by establishing checks and balances. For example, if your weakness is conflict avoidance, hire assertive people, and set up policies that encourage dealing with conflict head-on.

> **The Founder is 80% of the Culture**
> 
> Molly Graham, former head of Culture and Employment Branding at Facebook, has said that the founder is 80% of a company’s culture. The founder’s qualities and strengths become competitive advantages for the company, but only if the founder consciously builds them into the culture. She also says being aware of your weaknesses is essential, especially in those first rounds of hiring. She needs to hire people who can complement her weaknesses with the strengths that she’s lacking. To deepen their self-awareness, Graham recommends founders ask themselves these questions: What sets me apart from the people around me? How do I make my best decisions? What am I bad at?

#### Core Element #2: Successful Cultures Support the Organization’s Strategy

The second core element of a successful culture is that it supports the organization’s strategy. Horowitz says your cultural features, such as policies, must encourage employees to act in ways that bring the company closer to its vision.

For example, flexibility and the opportunity to be creative are important features of Google’s culture. They support the company’s strategy of constant innovation and staying open to new lines of work by encouraging employees to explore new ideas, even if they’re outside of the scope of their current projects.

(Shortform note: If you’re looking to change your organization’s existing culture, making sure the new culture supports your strategy is key. Experts who studied the cultures of top-performing companies identified matching culture to strategy as the number one principle to follow.)
