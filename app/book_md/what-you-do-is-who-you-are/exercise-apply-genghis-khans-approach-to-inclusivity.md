## Exercise: Apply Genghis Khan’s Approach to Inclusivity

Horowitz believes that most companies begin to mirror the characteristics of their leaders, which leads to a lack of diversity and inclusion.

Observe your organization with a critical eye. What words would you use to describe the backgrounds and demographics of leaders and managers? What words would you use to describe the backgrounds and demographics of the employees who work for them? Is there significant overlap between both descriptions?

Consider your descriptions of your organization’s leaders and employees. What backgrounds and demographics seem to be missing? List them below.

Consider your peers in other organizations and the professional networks you’re a part of. Who can you reach out to to gather input on how to hire more people from the backgrounds and demographics you’ve noticed are missing? List as many people as you can and make a plan to reach out.
