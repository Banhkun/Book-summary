## Chapter 4: Lessons From Toussaint Louverture—Model and Reinforce the Culture You Want

After laying down strong foundational virtues for your culture and incorporating inclusive practices, you must model and reinforce them so they become ingrained in your organization’s culture. This chapter will explore Horowitz’s insights from the third of the four historical models he examines—Toussaint Louverture, who led the military and diplomatic campaign that liberated enslaved people in Haiti and set the stage for its independence from France.

According to Horowitz, **Louverture’s military and cultural leadership elevated the Haitian revolution from slave revolt to strategic military and diplomatic action**. Under his leadership, they defeated Spain and England and improved their relationship with France. A decade after the insurrection began, he became governor of the island. He proclaimed a new constitution that abolished slavery and ensured people of all races could have access to any job.

(Shortform note: Although Haiti didn’t declare its independence from France until 1804, almost a year after Louverture’s death, his actions made independence possible. The revolution began in 1791, but it took 13 years of Louverture’s political and trade negotiations with France and the United States, as well as warfare with France, England, and Spain for Haiti to finally be able to declare its independence.)

Louverture elevated the global standing of his army by constantly teaching and reinforcing the behaviors soldiers needed to practice. His leadership showed slave-trading colonial nations that the behavior they criticized in enslaved people was a result of the dehumanizing conditions in which they were forced to subsist, not their nature. Slavery had created an environment where enslaved people had to focus on day-to-day survival, but Louverture created a visionary culture using the virtues he valued most in African and European cultures.

> **The Dehumanizing Effects of Slavery**
> 
> Although some critics have taken issue with Horowitz’s depiction of enslaved people as a group without culture, this might not be a fair assessment. Horowitz argues that Louverture took what he considered to be the best characteristics of their native cultures as well as European cultures to build a new identity for Haiti. While his emphasis on the difficulty of establishing this new cultural identity and attending behaviors might seem callous, it’s founded on the excruciating reality of enslaved people.
> 
> In her book _Creating Black Americans: African American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present_ , Nell Irvin Painter offers a detailed account of the dehumanizing environment enslaved people subsisted in. Besides the physical and psychological trauma of constant abuse, neglect, and overwork, they had no access to education and no right to wages or property. All of this, she argues, led to them developing “habits of deceit and anger” that further damaged them and the bonds among them. Thus, although enslaved people were never without a culture, elements of it were likely not conducive to the kind of society Louverture wanted to establish.

Horowitz believes that cultural leaders in the business world should follow Louverture’s example of building existing strengths into the culture and constantly reinforcing the behavior they want. Doing so will allow members of their organizations to internalize the culture and outsiders to acknowledge its strengths. In this chapter, we’ll explore four key lessons Horowitz gleaned from Louverture, as well as discuss examples from the business world.

(Shortform note: One of the key criticisms Horowitz received over his handling of Louverture’s history was that he used it to promote corporate lessons that are alien to Louverture’s reality. Horowitz is not alone in this appropriation of Louverture’s story, though. Although he has been the subject of several books, Louverture remains a sort of mystery, even for his biographers. The lack of documents to certify details of his life story prior to the revolution, as well as conflicting documents from his time as military leader, has led to Louverture’s story being appropriated in all sorts of ways—even as business advice.)

### Lesson #1: Leverage Your Employees’ Strengths

Louverture leveraged his soldiers’ guerrilla warfare experience and encouraged his army to use voodoo songs to communicate over long distances without the Europeans understanding.

(Shortform note: Louverture’s leveraging of the cultural characteristics of his people was short-lived. As Horowitz himself notes in the book, after having taken advantage of it to win several battles, Louverture outlawed voodoo in the constitution, making Catholicism the official religion of the island. In their book _Toussaint Louverture: A Black Jacobin in the Age of Revolutions, _Charles Forsdick and Christian Hogsbjerg argue that this decision, along with mandatory work requirements, served to alienate the Black people of Haiti from his leadership.)

In the same way, Horowitz says you should **take advantage of the existing strengths of the culture you’re working with**. Allowing employees to practice strengths they already have will help lower the cognitive load that comes with incorporating new behaviors. Identify virtues your employees have that support your vision for the organization and its culture and build them into the new culture you’re creating.

(Shortform note: This advice highlights the flexibility of Horowitz’s approach to culture. He sees culture as a top-down and bottom-up process where both leaders and employees have a role. Experts warn that by only taking a top-down approach in which leaders design the culture and filter it down to their employees they are disregarding the fact that culture is taking shape every day as employees interact with each other. To supplement top-down interventions such as choosing virtues and implementing mechanisms to bring those virtues to life, leaders should study their cultures as they develop bottom-up, identifying their strengths and noticing how they evolve over time.)

### Lesson #2: Don’t Leave Ethical Gray Areas

Louverture continuously reinforced his cultural expectations for his soldiers. He spoke to his army regularly about ethics and kept them under strict discipline that didn’t allow for any of the usual acts of war, such as stealing and destroying property.

(Shortform note: There might have been a darker side to Louverture’s strict discipline. For example, in _Toussaint Louverture: A Black Jacobin in the Age of Revolutions, _Forsdick and Hogsbjerg explain that he didn’t allow peasants to buy plots of land. This meant that they were forced to continue working for plantation owners instead of working their own lands. Louverture believed peasants wanted to own their lands so they could be idle, and he worried their ideas would challenge his economic plan for the island.)

In the same way, Horowitz says **leaders must spell out what ethical behavior looks like in the organization and why it’s important to behave in that way.** Ethical gray areas where the correct course of action is unclear leave room for each individual to decide. This can spell disaster for an organization if an individual makes a wrong choice.

> **Factors That Encourage Unethical Behavior**
> 
> In _The Infinite Game, _Simon Sinek also warns that if ethics are not properly established in an organization it can fall into a process he calls ethical fading: People engage in increasingly unethical behavior while convincing themselves that they are acting fairly and properly. Besides stating your ethical expectations, Sinek suggests looking out for three factors that encourage unethical behavior:
> 
> **1) Poorly designed incentives** : If employees who cut corners are then rewarded with bonuses and promotions, other employees get the message that the organization prioritizes _winning_ over ethics.
> 
> **2) Use of rationalizations** : Euphemisms that disguise the true nature of people’s actions, system-blaming, or even blaming the customer for enabling their behavior justify unethical behavior.
> 
> **3) Symptom fixes that overlook the bigger picture** : If leaders try to fix behavioral problems by implementing new rules and regulations instead of addressing the underlying reason for the issues, they create more hoops that employees will avoid having to jump through.

#### Example: An Uber-Competitive Culture

Although Uber founder Travis Kalanick thoughtfully designed the company’s culture, he left ethical gray areas that employees filled in with the company’s other values: a hustler’s mentality and an emphasis on competition. The culture didn’t clarify ethical boundaries, and it encouraged finding a way to “win” in every situation, which made ethical breaches commonplace. According to Horowitz, this led to Uber employees committing acts that exposed the company to liability while harming employees and customers.

(Shortform note: Some experts see Uber’s problem as running deeper than culture, and they point to the business model itself. They argue that the economic model on which Uber is built doesn’t allow for the company to properly care for its customers and drivers—one major source of its ethical scandals. The company cannot afford to make necessary improvements without a substantial increase in its fees, which it cannot enforce without losing market share. Uber is then, as critics see it, trapped in a cycle of companywide unethical behavior.)

### Lesson #3: Make Rules That Stick

To emphasize the need to be trustworthy, Louverture forbade officers from cheating on their wives or having concubines, although it had been common practice in times of war. The rule prompted questions, and Louverture explained that officers who cheated on their wives couldn’t be trusted in other matters either. **Horowitz emphasizes making rules that surprise people and force them to think about the principle behind the behavior** , like Louverture’s rule for officers.

(Shortform note: Horowitz’s assessment of the rule’s purpose might be incorrect. As CLR James explained in _The Black Jacobins, _this rule was part of Louverture’s plan for building a respectable Catholic society. Forbidding concubines was a way for Haitians to simultaneously recall customs from their native cultures, such as the faithful keeping of wives, and emulate virtues of French society.)

Horowitz says that to make a rule stick, make sure that:

  * **People will remember the rule.** It has to be explicit and specific enough that people have no difficulty remembering the rule—and the cultural virtue behind it.
  * **People will apply the rule every day.** It has to be relevant to an action employees take every day, so they have the chance to engage with it regularly and internalize it.
  * **The rule will make people ask “why?”** and the answer they get will point them to the cultural tenet behind it. The rule has to be surprising and thought-provoking so employees ask why it exists—and the answer has to encourage them to reflect on the virtue underlying the expected behavior.



> **A Rule That Helps Embody the Virtue**
> 
> In his book _Turn the Ship Around!, _L. David Marquet shares an example of a rule that sticks. To improve morale among the crew of the submarine he led, he established a “three-name rule.” The rule required that when any crew member saw a visitor, he would greet the person using three names: the visitor’s name, his name, and the ship’s name. For example: “Good morning Commodore Kenny, my name is Petty Officer Smith. Welcome aboard _Santa Fe_.”
> 
> The rule was catchy and hence easy to remember, and it was one they would apply several times a day. But instead of making crew members ask why the rule was instituted, it made them actively embody the virtue Marquet wanted them to demonstrate: being proactive.

#### Example: Amazon’s Rule of Frugality

Horowitz highlights Amazon’s emphasis on frugality as a memorable rule in modern-day business culture. At its founding, Amazon made a rule that everyone should “accomplish more with less.” Employees remembered the rule and applied it every day because their desks were frugally made out of cheap doors nailed to legs. If someone asked why they couldn’t have regular desks, managers reiterated the rule to accomplish more with less.

(Shortform note: Through their culture of frugality, Amazon has been able to reduce costs and offer low prices in a way that forces competitors to play according to their rules—an example of a culture disrupting entire industries. Some argue, however, that Amazon’s frugality can turn into not giving their employees the time and resources necessary to do their jobs safely and ignoring their needs by not giving them enough time for bathroom breaks.)

### Lesson #4: Align Your Decisions and Example With Strategic Priorities

Louverture enforced a forward-looking culture that focused on the long-term sustainability of their freedom. Rather than exacting revenge on plantation owners (and former slave masters), he allowed them to live and continue farming their lands to sustain the economy. However, he made them share the profits with the workers and pay wages.

(Shortform note: _Toussaint Louverture: A Black Jacobin in the Age of Revolutions _(Forsdick and Hogsbjerg) argues that this move turned the former chattel slaves into wage slaves. By making work mandatory and not allowing peasants to buy their own pieces of land, Louverture gave the Black peasants of Haiti no choice but to continue working for the same plantation owners. They now received wages, but were still treated unfairly and couldn’t choose where to work.)

Louverture’s decision not to kill the former slave owners shocked his army, but it made clear that their culture was in service of the bigger mission of keeping Haiti free—which required being economically sustainable. Horowitz says decisions such as Louverture’s send clear messages because **the leader’s actions to enforce culture communicate the priorities of the organization to the rest of the team.**

To set the right example for his soldiers, who were eager to take revenge on their former masters, Louverture refrained from exacting revenge on his rival, André Rigaud, a mulatto who believed Blacks should remain at the bottom of the system, with mulattoes above them. Louverture defeated Rigaud but didn’t kill him or his supporters, publicly forgiving them at the end of their civil war. (Haiti and Louverture experienced civil war as well as wars against colonizers.) **As the leader, you must be the first to follow the rules and embody the virtues.** Horowitz stresses that if you don't follow the cultural rules you’re setting for everyone else, employees will follow your example rather than the rule.

#### Example: Netflix Pivots From DVDs to Streaming

One of the toughest decisions Netflix CEO Reed Hastings made during his company’s pivot from DVDs to streaming was no longer letting top executives from the DVD division attend leadership meetings. It was especially hard to do so because the DVD business had sustained the company until then, but Hastings needed to steer Netflix toward the future. This decision signaled to everyone in the company that Netflix was on a new path.

> **Focus on the Future Instead of the Past**
> 
> Aligning choices with priorities and Netflix’s pivot to streaming echo Peter Drucker’s advice in _The Effective Executive _to focus on only a few key things and do them one at a time. For Drucker, it comes down to the simple fact that focusing allows you to do better work, faster. The way to decide what to focus on is by having clear priorities which he says requires courage more than analysis. In his view, courage requires that you:
> 
>   * Focus on the future instead of the past.
> 
>   * Focus on opportunities, instead of on problems.
> 
> 

> 
> By focusing on the future and on opportunities, companies can avoid a common pitfall: preserving legacy products (such as DVDs) while failing to develop products that will sustain the business in the future. To assess whether legacy products are worth keeping, Drucker recommends regularly asking, “If we weren’t already doing this, would it make any sense to start doing it?” If the answer is “no,” drop it.
