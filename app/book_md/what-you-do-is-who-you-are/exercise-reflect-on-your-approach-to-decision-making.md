## Exercise: Reflect on Your Approach to Decision-Making

Horowitz argues that leaders make several choices regarding how to make decisions: autocracy versus democracy, speed versus accuracy, and top-down versus bottom-up.

* * *

Think of the last major decision that your organization made. Which approach did you take: autocracy, democracy, or consensus-building? How did the approach affect the outcome of the decision? For example, maybe not enough people were involved so some key information was unavailable.

In that same decision, was there an emphasis on speed or accuracy? Why was either speed or accuracy favored? Did it have the desired effect on the outcome of the decision?

Finally, was the decision made top-down or bottom-up? Why was that approach favored? Did it have the desired effect on the outcome of the decision?
