## Exercise: Apply Toussaint Louverture’s Approach to Cultural Leadership

Horowitz argues that Louverture’s cultural leadership elevated the Haitian revolution from revolt to strategic action, and that business leaders can assert their own cultural leadership to elevate their organizations.

* * *

List at least three of your employees’ or colleagues’ strengths. Next to each, write down whether those strengths are already recognized as part of the organization’s culture. If they’re not, consider how they might be incorporated.

Think of a behavior you’d like your employees or colleagues to internalize. Then, create a rule that sticks, making sure that it will be memorable (perhaps using a catchy name), it will be applicable every day, and it will point employees to the cultural tenet behind it.

Think of a cultural virtue or rule your employees or colleagues are struggling with. List at least three ways in which you can lead by example in the implementation of the virtue or rule.
