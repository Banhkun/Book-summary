## Part 3: Improve Interpersonal Skills | Habit 4: Seek Mutual Benefits

Now that you’ve developed your independence in Habits 1-3, Habits 4-6 build on that foundation by focusing on interdependent (or collaborative) success through strong relationships and effective interactions.

**Habit Description:**

  * When tackling a problem or negotiation with someone, always strive to find a mutually beneficial solution.



### Why It Matters

**Interpersonal success starts with approaching every interaction as an opportunity to find a mutually beneficial outcome.** Covey calls this a Win/Win mindset. This is admittedly difficult:

  * It often calls for long, tedious negotiations.
  * It requires you to genuinely try to understand others’ perspectives. (More on that communication strategy in Habit 5.)



But he argues that the effort is worth it:

  * It often leads to more innovative solutions than either side would have reached independently. (More on that in Habit 6.)
  * The spirit and process of working together to reach those solutions strengthen the relationship, which improves the quality of future collaborations. 



To better understand the mutually beneficial mindset, see how it compares to other approaches to negotiation.

**Mindset** | **Description** | **More Detail** | **Leadership Style** | **Takeaway**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Win/Win: Mutually Beneficial** | There is plenty (of money, success, happiness, and good fortune) to go around.  | People with this mindset value cooperation over competition.  | (Shortform note: Covey doesn’t specify a leadership style, but this mindset is characteristic of collaborative leadership, in which colleagues with different expertises work together to achieve shared goals.)  | In interdependent relationships, Win/Win is usually the only viable option because it preserves the relationship’s health.   
**Win/Win or No Deal:** **Everyone Wins, or No One Does** | Sometimes a Win/Win resolution is impossible, and it’s better for the relationship to drop the negotiation altogether.  | This is not always possible (for example, you can’t abandon your kids if you don’t see eye-to-eye with them). If that’s the case, take a compromise, which is a low form of the mutually beneficial approach.  | (Shortform note: This may not characterize a particular leadership type, but there are leaders who know when to leave a deal on the table—and those who don’t.)  | Sacrificing the negotiation for the sake of the relationship raises the odds of successfully collaborating in the future.   
**Win/Lose:** **Either I Beat You or You Beat Me** | Everything is a competition; your success must come at the expense of someone else’s.  | This win is short-lived: The other person develops negative feelings about their loss, which impedes future collaborations.  | Authoritarian (use authority, power, status, or personality to win)  (Shortform note: This leadership style generally hampers team members’ performance, commitment, and creativity—but it can be effective in certain contexts.)  | This approach is effective for competition (like sports), not cooperation.   
**Lose/Win:** **Have Your Way and I’ll Deal With It** | Follow the path of least resistance rather than causing conflict—even when that means sacrificing what you want.  | People with this mindset have personal weakness and insecurity, which drives them to seek others’ acceptance and also makes them intimidated by others’ strength.  | Permissive, laissez-faire  (Shortform note: Laissez-faire leadership typically hurts productivity, increases employee conflict, and lessens leadership satisfaction.)  | This approach is unsustainable because it causes people to suppress their feelings and become angry, resentful, cynical, and even physically ill.   
**Lose/Lose: If I Can’t Win, Neither Can You** | People with this mentality want the other person to _lose_ more than they want themselves to _win_.  | Fierce competition between two Win/Lose people can devolve into both sides adopting Lose/Lose mindsets, each desperate to see the other lose.  | Covey calls this a “philosophy of war,” suggesting that it is the mindset of a leader whose primary objective is to beat competitors. (Shortform note: Business consultant Terri Bozkaya argues that this ultra-competitive behavior is typical of aggressive leaders, who compensate for their personal weaknesses by aggressively demonstrating their strength.  | Covey doesn’t spell this out, but it seems clear that a paradigm that causes both sides to lose is not effective.   
**Win:** **Everyone for Themselves** | Look out for yourself, and expect others to do the same.  | This is only effective if achieving your goal matters more than how it impacts others. For instance, if you urgently needed to order supplies and your usual vendor couldn’t fill the order in time, you would risk burning bridges and hire the first supplier that could fill the order.  | Selfish leaders, whose top priority is their own success, rather than the team’s (Shortform note: Selfish leaders tend to crave power and often gain power through dominance. Although some employees prefer dominant leaders over prestige-oriented ones, dominance eventually hurts group dynamics.)  | The lack of consideration for others doesn’t foster the necessary trust and cooperation for an effective interdependent relationship.   
  
> **Critiques of Win/Win**
> 
> Although the idea of finding a mutually beneficial solution seems hard to oppose—if everyone wins, who’s left to disagree?—there are a number of arguments against this approach.
> 
>   * Negotiation coach Jim Camp asserts that win/win often means that the more powerful party pushes the other into a less-than-ideal compromise. In _Start With No_ , he posits that a win/win mindset pressures both parties to rush to _any_ agreement rather than doing the haggling necessary to reach the _best_ deal.
> 
>   * Similarly, others say that win/win is a fallacy (particularly prevalent in many tech companies’ mission statements) that allows the powerful to justify their wins, while glossing over the shortcomings of the less-powerful people’s supposed win; instead, there are times when the powerful simply need to sacrifice for the greater good. For instance, a company that sells affordable food could call it a win/win when the company profits and reduces food insecurity—but the bigger picture may be that the company should use its resources to provide free food to those most in need.
> 
>   * Social scientist Jeremy Sherman also points out that, in economics, a win/win between vendor and customer can be a losing prospect for society, and that the government has a role to step in to prevent that loss. For instance, a purely win/win approach would allow people of any age to buy alcohol and cigarettes—the vendors gain more profit and the customers get what they want—but the government has deemed it better for society to put an age requirement on those purchases.

### How To

Covey says you need five key components to set the stage before you even sit down at the negotiating table:

**1) Know your values and principles.** If you don’t, then you can’t determine what constitutes a “win” for you.

(Shortform note: While Covey argues that you must know your values in order to identify what’s best for you in a negotiation, he doesn’t point out that you also must know the values _underlying_ your objectives. This allows you to be flexible and open to alternative outcomes—as long as they still meet your values—and being flexible can help you reach a better deal than settling for a lesser offer just because it checks certain boxes.)

**2) Consistently live by those values and principles.** This shows that you have integrity and gives the other person confidence that you’ll genuinely commit to helping them win, too.

(Shortform note: Research shows that your perceived integrity is one of three key factors that makes others trust you, and that being viewed as trustworthy makes you more effective in negotiations.)

**3) Have high levels of courage and consideration** : courage to express your goals and expectations, and consideration to factor in the other person’s perspective.

(Shortform note: In _Dare to Lead_ , Brene Brown writes that there are four skills that build your courage—facing vulnerability (accepting that you can’t control the responses to your words and actions), choosing and practicing clear values (echoing Covey’s two points above), building trust and connection (Covey’s fifth component, below), and developing failure resistance (the ability to recover and move on quickly after something goes wrong).)

**4) Adopt an Abundance Mentality** , or the conviction that one person’s success doesn’t come at the expense of another’s. This requires a solid sense of self-worth and a personal sense of direction, which gives you the security to celebrate another person’s value and direction.

(Shortform note: Covey was the first to coin the term “abundance mentality,” as well as “scarcity mentality,” which is the belief that there are limited resources and one person’s success must come at the cost of another’s (the Win/Lose mindset). Subsequent research has found that a scarcity mindset impedes your focus and decision-making skills, which causes people in poverty—who are constantly reminded of their scarce money and resources—to make choices that often _keep_ them in a cycle of poverty.)

**5) Maintain a high level of trust with the other person.** You must trust that the other person respects and cares about you enough to want you to win, too (and vice versa). That caring also pushes you both through the sometimes-difficult work of negotiating a mutually beneficial solution.

> **Make the Other Person Feel Secure and In Control**
> 
> Former FBI hostage negotiator, CEO, and author Chris Voss presents a different approach to negotiation in _Never Split the Difference_: He argues that the win/win approach assumes that people act rationally in negotiations, when they’re actually driven by emotions. As such, successful negotiations depend on fulfilling people’s two basic emotional needs:
> 
>   * To feel secure
> 
>   * To feel in control
> 
> 

> 
> To do this, Voss suggests strategies that Covey would probably categorize as external approaches:
> 
>   * **Using “calculated empathy,” **or understanding the other person’s feelings for the purpose of getting what you want. Understanding how they feel allows you to show empathy, which makes the other person feel safe enough to open up about what they really want—and that information is crucial in negotiations.
> 
>   * **Giving them the illusion of control** so that you can lead them to the result _you_ want while making them think it’s _their_ idea. You can do this by:
> 
>     * Asking open-ended questions (like responding to their suggestion with “How could I make that work?”) that help them see things from your perspective
> 
>     * Getting them to say “no” to something early in the negotiation, which makes them feel that they’ve asserted some control
> 
> 


With this foundation, how do you actually arrive at a mutually beneficial solution? Covey suggests four steps:

**1) Try to understand the other person’s perspective.** We’ll explain how to do this in Habit 5.

(Shortform note: Rather than _understanding_ the other person’s perspective, Voss suggests _changing_ it. If you’ve made them feel secure and in-control enough to divulge their hidden desires, and you know how to exploit cognitive biases and other irrational blind spots (which Voss details in the book), you can make them believe that helping you achieve your preferred outcome will actually satisfy their own desires.)

**2) Pinpoint each person’s biggest concerns.** Describe these as objectively and straightforwardly as possible.

(Shortform note: Voss promotes a related tactic called labeling, in which you identify and articulate the other person’s feelings (for instance, “You seem frustrated”). This is a calculated empathy technique that creates a sense of intimacy and rapport by demonstrating your insight and empathy.)

**3) Identify what results constitute a “win”** for each person.

(Shortform note: Voss suggests that you might gain a better understanding of what the other person wants than they have themselves: He emphasizes the importance of getting the other party to open up enough to reveal the desires and worries driving their negotiation objectives, and he argues that people are often so overcome these emotions that they scarcely know what they really want.)

**4) Determine a new solution** that achieves those results.

> **Use Principled Negotiation to Reach a Mutually Beneficial Solution**
> 
> In _Getting to Yes_ , Harvard law professors Roger Fisher and William Ury suggest using objective criteria (such as market values or expert data) to measure how a solution benefits both sides. Using objective standards improves fairness, efficiency, and the working relationship between the deal-makers.
> 
> Criteria is one of four elements of Fisher and Ury’s principled negotiation, a win/win framework for deal-making. The other three elements are:
> 
>   * **People** —Separate personalities and emotions from the substance of the negotiation. People’s emotions and the dynamics of the relationship often get intertwined with the issue being negotiated, so Fisher and Ury emphasize that sensitivity and respect are essential for successful negotiations.
> 
>   * **Interests** —Focus on each side’s _interest_ —which involves their needs, desires, fears, and concerns—not their _position_. While two people argue over opposing positions, there can be a third solution that meets everyone’s interests.
> 
>   * **Options** —Brainstorm multiple options that meet mutual interests. Instead of there being a winner and loser, this makes a win/win outcome possible.
> 
> 


### Going Deeper

Unlike the other habits, Covey clarifies that you should not adopt this approach universally or unconditionally.

  * **A mutually beneficial mindset is key to effective _interdependent_ communication—but no single approach is best for every situation. **For example, if you’re competing against the other side, rather than collaborating with them, then you should adopt the I-beat-you-or-you-beat-me mindset. (Shortform note: Research finds that fostering healthy competition among employees increases creativity and effort—as long as the competition _excites_ workers by focusing on positive possibilities. By contrast, if the competition _stresses_ workers by emphasizing threats and negative consequences, it can push them to resort to unethical practices.)
  * Alternatively, **sometimes you have to sacrifice a mutually beneficial approach for the good of the relationship.** If it would be better for the relationship to affirm the other person by letting them get the win, or if it simply isn’t worth the time and effort to negotiate, a Lose/Win can be the best choice. In other words: Pick your battles.  
(Shortform note: In Jim Camp’s rejection of the win/win mindset in _Start With No_ , he writes that, in order to have a successful negotiation, each side must feel empowered to walk away if they can’t come to a mutually beneficial resolution.)
