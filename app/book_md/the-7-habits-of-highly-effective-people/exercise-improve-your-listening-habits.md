## Exercise: Improve Your Listening Habits

We all have misunderstandings from time to timeâ€”and sometimes the consequences are more severe than others. Use this exercise to see how you can practice careful, empathic listening to avoid misunderstandings in the future.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you misinterpreted or misunderstood someone.

In which of the four stages were you listening (mimicking, rephrasing, reflecting feelings, or listening empathically) and how do you think this contributed to the misunderstanding?

How might your own perspectives and assumptions have contributed to the misunderstanding?

Were there obstacles preventing you from listening empathically (e.g. distractions, your assumptions, time constraints)? How could you eliminate those in the future?
