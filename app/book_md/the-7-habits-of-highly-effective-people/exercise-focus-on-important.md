## Exercise: Focus on Important

Reflect on the time you spend in each of the time management categories; this is an important first step to shifting how you spend your time.

* * *

Name one Category-1 (urgent and important) task you did today and explain why it belongs in that category.

Name one Category-2 (not urgent and important) task you did today and how much time you spent doing it. If you have not done any Category-2 activities, name one you could do within the next 24 hours.

Name one Category-3 (urgent and not important) task you did today. What is one strategy you could use to spend less time on unimportant activities like this?

Name one Category-4 (neither urgent nor important) task you did today. What do you gain from this activity (for instance, entertainment or relaxation)?

Review your previous answers and write one observation you have about how you spend your time.
