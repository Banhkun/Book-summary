## Exercise: Reach a Mutually Beneficial Solution

Reaching a mutually beneficial solution can be difficult, depending on your emotional involvement in the issue, your relationship with the other person, and their willingness to strive for a win/win outcome. Follow this exercise to improve your current approach.

* * *

Describe a current or recent disagreement you’ve had with someone.

Try to see things from the other person’s perspective. How do you think she views the problem and what would constitute a “win” for her?

What would constitute a “win” for you?

What are a couple of possible solutions that could have been mutually beneficial?

Next time you face a conflict with this person, what can you say or do to stop the momentum of the argument and ask the other person to work with you to find a mutually beneficial solution?
