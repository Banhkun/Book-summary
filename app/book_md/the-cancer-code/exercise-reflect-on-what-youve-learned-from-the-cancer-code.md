## Exercise: Reflect on What You’ve Learned From The Cancer Code

 _The Cancer Code_ divides cancer research into three different Models—though each new Model doesn’t truly replace the old one so much as build upon it. Reflect on what you’ve learned about cancer from these Models and consider how you might apply that knowledge in your everyday life.
