## Part Three: After the War

The research and innovation coming from Langley played a major role in the ultimate Allied victory in World War Two, which finally came when Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. **Although few Americans knew it, a small contingent of black female computers had made vital contributions to the superior aircraft production** that had enabled the Allies to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.

But while the end of the war ushered in a nationwide wave of euphoria, it was a source of anxiety for Langley computers like Dorothy Vaughan. Their contracts had only guaranteed employment for the duration of the war. Now that the war was over, what lay ahead for the black computers of Langley? Would the extraordinary opportunity they’d been given be taken away?

### Peacetime Transition

The much-feared rollback of federal jobs began quickly. Just three weeks after V-J Day, newspapers announced a planned layoff of 1,500 Newport News shipyard workers as well as downsizings in other parts of the government’s civilian workforce. This would hit women particularly hard, as the returning GIs were expected to have first claim to these jobs. Women who’d earned an unprecedented level of economic and social independence were expected to return to their traditional domestic role. **Indeed, two million American women were let go from their jobs before the end of August 1945.**

Conservative figures like Virginia’s Democratic Senator Harry Byrd sought to use the transition to a peacetime economy to roll back the progress that had been made toward racial and gender equity in employment during the war years. To figures like Byrd, Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802 was an inversion of the natural order of things and an unwelcome federal intrusion into the southern way of life.

During the Cold War and the “Red Scare” of the late 1940s and early 1950s, anti-communist radicals like Byrd and Senator Joseph McCarthy targeted government employees who had alleged “leftist” or “un-American” views. **The anti-communist crusade often blended seamlessly with a defense of Jim Crow and white supremacy** and an attack on groups and individuals who supported integration, civil rights, and equality for women. Groups like the NAACP were frequently harassed, and a black computer at Langley named Matilda West was even forced out of her job for her supposed disloyalty.

But pioneers like Dorothy weren’t about to let their gains be taken away without a fight. They had established new lives and careers during the war, and they intended to consolidate and expand on the progress they had made. They could not and would not be sent packing to their former lives.

#### Hampton Roads and the Cold War

**While much of the nation did, in fact, witness a downscaling of the defense industry, this was not the case in Hampton Roads**. As the Cold War with the Soviet Union began to take shape following World War Two, Southern Virginia was set to become a critical hub of the nation’s defense industry. The Norfolk Naval Base became the command center of the Atlantic Fleet, while the US Army designated Langley Field as the headquarters of its Tactical Air Command (later to become an independent branch of the military: The United States Air Force).

Thus, although some women who had been hired during the war did end up leaving Langley, this was usually due to personal choice rather than being forced out of their positions. Most of the West Computers ended up receiving permanent offers of employment, as Dorothy did in 1946, when she was made a permanent Civil Service employee.

**The new strategic importance of the region meant that the boom economy would continue**. With new bases, there would be new needs for military contractors to supply them. Defense industry money poured into Hampton Roads, bringing new jobs, new migrants, and new transformations. During the Korean War (1950-1953) alone, NACA presented a proposal to Congress to double its staff from 7,000 to 14,000.

#### Jim Crow in the Cold War

While, as we’ve seen, the Cold War and the Red Scare gave new force to racist policies, they also contributed to the eventual breakdown of Jim Crow. As the United States sought international allies in its fight against worldwide Soviet Communism, **American policymakers began to realize that segregation at home had become a significant liability, one that made America’s self-proclaimed leadership of “the free world” look hypocritical.** In fact, foreign leaders of color who visited the US were frequently banned from hotels and restaurants—stories that received much attention in the foreign press and that handed a significant propaganda coup to the Soviet Union.

The question became clear to many international observers: Why should an African or Asian country side with the US in the Cold War when the US supported segregation at home? The necessities of Cold War politics and the weight of international opinion started to make a real difference in US domestic policy. They were a major part of the impetus behind President Harry Truman’s 1947 executive order desegregating the military and a subsequent order making federal department heads “personally responsible” for rooting out discrimination in their departments.

### A Man’s World

**For all of the progress that had been made, Langley was still very much a white world, in particular a white _man’s_ world**. The women of West Computing may have mastered the intricacies of aerodynamics, but now they faced an even more daunting task: advancing as women in a career that was built and run by men.

The forms of discrimination could be subtle. There was a whole universe of networking, consisting of lunches, cocktail hours, and men-only smoking sessions from which the women of Langley were shut out. Being talented wasn’t enough when they lacked the social capital and access to get their superiors to see it.

**The decentralized nature of their work was also a disadvantage to the female computers.** Because they were only given small portions of larger assignments to work on, it was difficult for Dorothy and her peers to develop a holistic understanding of the kind of work the male engineers were doing. Without this context, their work was just a series of isolated math equations and without specialized knowledge, they would become expendable when electronic computers began entering the laboratory.

**The way to get noticed and start getting real credit for one’s work as a computer was to get out of the general computing pool and become assigned to a specific group** working on a particular project. This would allow for the development of specialized knowledge, which would make the computer far more valuable to the team than someone with just general knowledge. As NACA moved into space research in the 1950s and 1960s, this kind of specialization would be a key point of difference between the women who made the cut and those that didn’t.

This was illustrated dramatically by the experience of two (white) female computers from East Computing. In 1947, these two women were sent west to the Mojave Desert, along with a small team of fellow Langley employees, to conduct research into the vexing problem of getting aircraft to travel faster than the speed of sound (“breaking the sound barrier”).

Working in this small, detached team and focusing on a singular, mission-oriented project was a game-changer for these two women. When they verified the fact that pilot Chuck Yeager had indeed broken the sound barrier, it brought them a new level of credit and recognition. _They_ had broken a barrier of their own. Other signs of progress were there, as more and more Langley women began to get their names on research reports, a key first step in the career of any engineer.

**Of course, the women of West Computing faced a double barrier to their upward mobility, being both female _and_ black**. Segregation had isolated them from their colleagues and from many opportunities. The all-white East Computing unit was shuttered after the war—many of the white women had won new positions in specialized units, plus the changing nature of the work at Langley reduced the need for a general computing pool. All remaining general computing work was transferred to West Computing, many Langley employees hadn’t even _known_ that there was an all-black computing unit.

But the integration of the computing functions at Langley was a watershed moment at the laboratory and opened new doors to the black women who worked there. In 1946, a unit conducting stability analysis research integrated a former West Computer, Dorothy Hoover, into its group full-time. In 1951, Dorothy Hoover would co-publish a report on a new wing-design for airplanes, contributing to one of Langely’s major breakthroughs from this era. She eventually went on to a prestigious academic career in mathematics at Arkansas AM&N. Her achievement was followed by others, as more West Computers moved to specialized divisions.

**Dorothy Vaughan rapidly ascended the ranks at Langley.** As more and more women were hired at the now-integrated West Computing to replace those who had been reassigned to specialized divisions, she transitioned into a managerial role. In 1949, the laboratory director appointed her head of West Computing, a position she would hold for the next decade.

### Mary Jackson

**In 1951, a new 26-year-old hire named Mary Jackson made her way to West Computing.** Whereas so many of her predecessors had been “come-heres,” transplants from other parts of the country, Mary was a “been-here:” she’d grown up in Hampton Roads and had deep roots in that part of Virginia. She graduated from high school in 1938, after which she had enrolled at Hampton Institute, an all-black college founded on the idea of self-help and practical and industrial training.

With these founding principles, most women at Hampton studied home economics, but Mary was different. She completed a double major in mathematics and physical science. After graduating, she married and started a family. Mary also became deeply involved in her local Girl Scout troop, where she committed herself to helping young African-American women make the most of themselves—with a special focus on helping them prepare for college careers.

Although the troop was segregated from the local all-white Girl Scout troop, **Mary always took pains to show her girls that they deserved far better than what a racist society was prepared to give them**. On one occasion, she stopped the troop from singing the slave spiritual “Pick a Bale of Cotton,” believing that performing it would only contribute to negative stereotypes of black people.**She couldn’t remove the limits that Jim Crow placed on these girls, but she could remove the limits the girls placed on _themselves_.**

Mary was working as a clerk typist at Fort Monroe in 1951. Her mathematical abilities quickly became obvious to her superiors, and with the Korean War heating up, there was an urgent need for more skilled computers at NACA. After just three months at Fort Monroe, the federal government transferred Mary to Langley, where she began working for Dorothy Vaughan.

#### Supersonic Pressure Tunnel

Mary was a full-fledged Civil Service employee. But the sting of discrimination that she’d known so well growing up in Virginia still followed her to Langley. Once, when she was sent by Dorothy Vaughan on an assignment to the predominantly white East Side, she asked the white computers where she could find the bathroom. **The white girls simply laughed at her—Mary was black, so how could they possibly know where _her_ bathroom was?** The ugly specter of Jim Crow hurt all the more because it was at _Langley_ , where Mary was supposed to be an equal, working with her colleagues to help her country. But still, absurdly, she was unable to perform her bodily functions in the same bathroom as her white colleagues.

As she was reeling from that encounter, Mary ran into Kazimierz “Kaz” Czarnecki, a white engineer who was an assistant section head working on Langley’s Supersonic Pressure Tunnel (SPT). Although he was a total stranger to her, Mary shared her frustration about the bathroom incident with Kaz. He listened to her story, sympathized, and asked Mary to come work for _him_ instead of returning to West Computing. She didn’t know it, but this chance encounter would change her entire career.

**Mary quickly distinguished herself while working on the SPT unit**. One day, she was asked to perform some calculations on supersonic and hypersonic research for John Becker, a powerful and important division chief at Langley. Mary deftly delivered her calculations to Becker, fully confident that she had performed them correctly. Becker refused to accept them, however, insisting that something was wrong with Mary’s numbers.

But she stood by her work. There _was_ an error in the numbers—but it was _Becker’s_ , not Mary’s. He had given her the wrong numbers to input, but Mary had performed her calculations flawlessly. Becker apologized, and Mary earned a reputation as a trusted and capable mathematician. She was marked as someone who deserved to move ahead.

### Katherine Comes to Langley

While Dorothy and her colleagues were breaking new ground as the first black female professionals at Langley during the war, the brilliant Katherine Coleman (who was now known as Katherine Goble after marrying her first husband, Jimmy) was a devoted housewife and mother. She had given up her own trailblazing academic career as one of the first three black students at West Virginia University to raise her family. Dr. Claytor at Howard had prepared her for a career as a research mathematician, but this dream now seemed a faraway abstraction to Katherine. But that would soon change.

**In 1952, Katherine’s in-laws told her and her husband about the job opportunities in Hampton Roads.** Her husband’s brother-in-law, Eric Epps, encouraged Katherine to apply for a position at Langley, where she could finally fulfill her dream of working as a mathematician (and earn three times what her salary had been as a teacher). Eric also said that Jimmy could find work at the Newport News Shipyard—thus, there was a promise of good federal jobs for the couple, representing a major new opportunity for them and their three daughters.

As director of the Newsome Park Community Center, Eric was a strong advocate for the neighborhood and was extremely well-connected with the black community and its civic and cultural institutions all throughout the Virginia peninsula. If _anyone_ would be able to smooth the Gobles’ transition to the region, it would be Eric.

His offer was too good to resist and tugged at Katherine’s insatiable intellectual curiosity: the family made the momentous decision to leave the mountains of West Virginia and head for Hampton Roads. **Well-paid federal jobs like the ones awaiting Katherine and Jimmy helped build the emerging black middle class**. Like those who had come to Hampton Roads during World War Two, Katherine found a ready-made community waiting to accept her and her family, helping her fill the void of the world she’d left behind in her native and beloved West Virginia. As an added bonus, Katherine would be reporting to her old neighbor from West Sulphur Springs—Dorothy Vaughan.

#### Mounting a Charm Offensive

Although Katherine had real credentials with her honors degree in mathematics and her teaching experience, she started at Langley with the rank of SP-3: a level 3 sub-professional, the low rank to which nearly all women at Langley were assigned during this era.

**After just two weeks on the job, Katherine was moved to the Flight Research Division, one of the most important and powerful groups at Langley.** This was a major step forward in her career and a major move toward integration. The laboratory was always a curious outpost in the heartland of Jim Crow. At Langley, the racial barrier was a bit murkier, the walls of separation more scalable. There were still separate bathrooms, but African-Americans also had an opportunity to demonstrate their value as professionals.

**Katherine was determined to make the most of her opportunity, recognizing that she would never change the minds (or win the hearts) of the most die-hard racists**. She avoided the symbols of segregation where she found them (making a point of eating her lunch at her desk rather than sitting in the “colored” section of the cafeteria). But, most of all, she wanted to combat ignorance and prejudice by demonstrating her intelligence and capability to her colleagues, presenting herself as a well-spoken, patriotic model of the very best that the black community had to offer. While there were certainly hardcore racists at Langley, there were also white people whose opinions of black people were open to change—and these were the people upon whom she mounted her charm offensive.
