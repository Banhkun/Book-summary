## Part One: New Opportunities

World War Two was the most devastating conflict in human history. Although the United States was spared from the ravages of combat on its own soil, the war nevertheless profoundly reshaped the country’s economic, social, and political system. Perhaps the most lasting and significant domestic effect of World War Two was its role in**accelerating the dismantling of the Jim Crow system of racial segregation** that had prevailed throughout much of the American South for over a century following the end of the US Civil War.

**The demands of the war economy brought African-Americans and women into jobs and industries from which they had previously been excluded.** This was an important factor in breaking down racial apartheid all across the country, as African-Americans refused to accept second-class citizenship in a nation for which they had served, fought, and even died. It was in this context that a pioneering generation of black women first began to break down the color bar at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Hampton, Virginia.

### Wartime Demands

At the height of the war in 1943, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which operated the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, was the US government’s main agency for civilian aeronautics research. NACA was crucial to the war effort, as its research informed airplane design decisions being made by the US Army Air Corps. Thus, the researchers, scientists, and engineers at NACA knew that their work had major real-world implications.

By disseminating their knowledge with the military, the men and women of NACA were helping the US create the fleet of bombers and fighter planes that would defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. **Almost every new aircraft model during the war years was tested at Langley** —and with President Franklin Roosevelt’s challenge to have the nation produce over 50,000 aircraft per year, this was indeed a tall order for NACA. “Victory through airpower!” was the guiding mission and mantra of the NACA-ites.

With so many men serving overseas and the unceasing labor demands of the wartime economy, **government facilities like Langley began to hire women in large numbers to work as mathematicians and computers**. Aeronautics was an intensely quantitative field: designing and testing combat planes produced a deluge of numerical data that needed to be processed and analyzed. And that meant hiring an army of number-crunchers.

(Shortform note: In this era before electronic computers, the word “computer” typically referred to an individual who performed mathematical calculations. Throughout the summary, when we say “computer,” we are referring to a human being, not a machine.)

Women had been working as computers at Langley during the 1930s, but they would take on a far greater role at the laboratory during and after the war. By 1941, personnel officers at the lab were eagerly searching for more and more women (or “girls” as they were called at the time) to fill the new positions at Langley. Hiring agents scoured the East Coast for coeds who had any sort of mathematical background and placed job advertisements in newspapers in their endless quest for new talent.

At the same time, African-American leaders like A. Philip Randolph, head of the largest black labor union in the country, were **pressuring the Roosevelt Administration to open up coveted jobs in the defense industry to black applicants**. With two executive orders in 1941, FDR banned discriminatory hiring practices in the defense industry and opened the door for African-Americans to contribute to this growing and dynamic sector of the economy for the first time. This was what enabled black women to submit their applications to work at Langley—it was just a crack, but the door to opportunity was slowly starting to open.

Melvin Butler, the lab’s chief personnel officer, was a native Virginian who had grown up in the world of Jim Crow, but was also inherently practical and recognized the urgent need for new mathematical talent. While he recognized**there would need to be a segregated space for the new black women, he also ensured that nothing was done to inhibit their arrival**. The women would work in the warehouse building on the west side of the laboratory campus: the place would become known to history as West Area Computing.

### Dorothy Vaughan

**One of the first to seize this new opportunity was Dorothy Vaughan**. As a college graduate and high school teacher, she had reached the pinnacle of what was thought possible for black women at that time. Still, the inequality was inescapable—Virginia’s black teachers earned less than 50 percent of what their white counterparts did and worked in segregated, poorly funded, and dilapidated school buildings. But she was a passionate believer in education, believing that it was the best chance black children had to succeed in a country that forced them to work twice as hard to get half as far as white people. She poured herself into her work and was a passionate advocate for her students, even under the trying circumstances of Virginia’s segregated public schools. She even once sent a letter to a math textbook publisher when she discovered an error in one of their books, demanding that they correct it.

She had received her degree in education from Howard University, one of the nation’s premier black colleges. Because the white schools (including the Ivy League) refused to tenure black professors regardless of their brilliance, black schools like Howard had an over-abundance of extraordinary scholars. Dorothy had the opportunity to study under some of the nation’s greatest minds. Although she studied education in order to become a teacher (considered at the time to be the most stable possible career for a black woman) she had always had a passion for mathematics.

**In 1943, Dorothy saw a job bulletin for a federal agency that was hiring women to fill mathematics-related jobs: NACA**. Although the intended audience for this advertisement was likely the white students from the State Teachers College, it captivated Dorothy. This was also happening at a time when the black press was spreading the word that the federal government had cracked open the door of opportunity to African-Americans to work in the bustling war economy.

In 1943, typical black jobs might have been in domestic work (for women) or low-skill, low-wage agricultural industrial work (for men). A good black job would have been as a small business entrepreneur or as a unionized porter on a railcar. A very good black job would have been working as a teacher, minister, doctor, or lawyer. But **the opportunity for a black person to work in an aeronautical laboratory (and not as a janitor or cafeteria worker) was something altogether new and extraordinary**.

That spring, Dorothy filled out her application. In the fall, she received her answer: she was hired to work as a Grade P-1 Mathematician at Langley for the duration of the war. Her pay would be more than twice what she was earning as a high school teacher. Although the job would take her away from her husband, her children, and the community that she loved (they would only be able to see her during school breaks and scheduled visits), she knew she could not let this opportunity pass her by.

### Katherine Johnson

As chance would have it, Dorothy had had some contact with another future NACA pioneer: a black West Virginian named Katherine Coleman (she would become more famous under the name Katherine Johnson after she married her second husband). Dorothy’s husband, Howard, was a bellhop who worked seasonally at the famed Greenbrier hotel in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. In the summer of 1942, a year before she took the NACA job, Dorothy and her family temporarily relocated to West Virginia, so Howard could be closer to his summer job. While there, **the Vaughan family formed a close bond with the Coleman family, especially their brilliant 24-year-old daughter, Katherine.**

Katherine shared Dorothy’s passion for mathematics and displayed signs of being a numerical prodigy as early as grade school. She poured herself into her studies at West Virginia State Institute, a black college near the state capital (which she entered after graduating high school at the age of 14), where she enjoyed a full scholarship. During her junior year, she was mentored by a young math professor, the brilliant William Waldron Schiefflin Claytor, who, **recognizing Katherine’s talents, created special courses exclusively for her and prepared her for a career as a research mathematician**. She matriculated to Howard University, where she graduated _summa cum laude_ with a double major in mathematics and French.

In 1936, the NAACP scored some major legal victories before the Supreme Court, which ruled that explicitly barring black students from graduate programs was unconstitutional. States either needed to create “separate, but equal” programs for black students or allow them to integrate into the white schools. While some states (like Virginia, which actually _subsidized_ black graduate students to study _outside_ the state rather than allowing them to integrate) openly defied the court order, West Virginia opted to comply.

**Katherine was one of the first three black students to enroll in the graduate program at West Virginia University in the summer of 1940** , though she left early when she got married and had her first daughter. But that was hardly the only barrier she would break through. Later, we’ll see how Katherine would follow Dorothy’s path to Langley and make extraordinary contributions to the space program.
