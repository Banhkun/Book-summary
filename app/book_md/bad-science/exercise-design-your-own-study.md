## Exercise: Design Your Own Study

Get familiar with the scientific method by designing an experiment.

* * *

Think of something you’d like to study. Ideally you should choose something you could realistically test and measure with your own expertise and without any expensive laboratory equipment. Briefly describe how you’d conduct your test and what results you’d expect. (For example, suppose you’d like to test the effect of different brands of fertilizer on plant growth. You could buy several seedlings of the same species and measure their growth against each other.)

What other factors could affect your results? How would you attempt to control these variables? List anything you can think of that might skew the results of your experiment, and describe how you’d attempt to control these variables. If there are variables you can’t control, write those down too, and describe how they’d impact your results.

If you wanted to manipulate your results to mislead someone, how would you do it? Write down one or two specific ways you could tamper with your study using the techniques from the guide.
