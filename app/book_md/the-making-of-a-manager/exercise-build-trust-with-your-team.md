## Exercise: Build Trust With Your Team

Zhuo says building trust is crucial for your team to work together, resolve problems, and achieve stellar results.

* * *

Rank the level of trust between you and your team as a whole, and each member individually (1 = Excellent, but room for minor improvement, 2 = Pretty good, but a lot of room for improvement, 3 = Bad, desperately needs improvement). Why did you choose each ranking?

Compare the people at work you trust the most with those you trust the least. What insights do you have to explain those differences (for example, your lack of knowledge about team members’ goals, unresolved conflicts you have with team members, or team members’ poor performance)?

What actions can you take to increase trust between you and your team (for example, schedule one-on-one meetings, acknowledge your mistakes, or deliver constructive feedback)? Write down at least two ideas that you could execute _this week_ , and plan when you’ll execute each.

What barriers do you see that could interfere with the actions you identified (for example, lack of time, feeling awkward, or a toxic company culture)?

What steps can you take to overcome those barriers (for example, designate time on your calendar, role play conversations with a colleague, or announce your commitment to building trust at your next team meeting)? Really stretch yourself to overcome any barriers. Remember, Zhuo says _without_ trust, team members become frustrated, performance suffers, and you stay blind to problems.
