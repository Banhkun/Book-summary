## Exercise: How Strong Are Your Heuristics?

Tversky and Kahneman developed the theory that our minds use a variety of shortcuts to make guesses when we don’t have all the information. How good of a guesser are you? The answers to these questions will be listed below. (Don’t peek.)

Texas, the largest state in the contiguous US, is divided into 254 counties. Brazil is the largest country in South America. Without looking it up, estimate the number of separate states that make up the country of Brazil.

The United States suffers the second-highest number of natural disasters in the world (after China). Guess what percentage of insured homes make claims for damage in the US per year.

Brazil is divided into 26 states. If you guessed significantly higher, you may have fallen prey to the _anchoring heuristic_. In what specific examples from your life did one “anchored” value, such as the price of a purchase, influence your perception of something else’s value?

Only 6% of insured homeowners make claims in the US per year, and not all of those are due to natural causes. If your guess was significantly higher, you may have been affected by the _availability heuristic_. In this case, you were cued to think about natural disasters, which may have made damage to homes seem more probable. What instances have occurred in your life when something weighing on your mind made it feel more likely?
