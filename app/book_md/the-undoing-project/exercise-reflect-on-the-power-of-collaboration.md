## Exercise: Reflect on the Power of Collaboration

Michael Lewis contends that Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky accomplished more together than they would have alone. Think back on projects in your own life that involved collaboration.

In group projects, do you feel like an equal contributor, or do you take on a leadership role? Which of the two do you feel is more empowering, and why?

Have you ever participated in a group project that you could have done better on your own? If so, why did the group process break down?

Are you particularly proud of something you accomplished while working as a member of a team? If so, how much credit do you give to the group as opposed to your own contribution?
