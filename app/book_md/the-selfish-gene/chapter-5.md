## Chapter 5: Aggression and Selfishness

In this chapter, we’ll explore different behavioral styles in animals. It seems logical that strong, aggressive animals will have an advantage in nature, and therefore all animals should selfishly try to take as many resources as they can for themselves. However, that isn’t always true.

A population of animals actually needs a particular balance of aggression and pacifism in order to be stable—too many aggressive (selfish) individuals will constantly fight each other, and too many peaceful individuals will be easily overpowered and exploited by a few aggressive ones. A stable population is the best situation for selfish genes trying to survive through as many generations as possible, without being overwhelmed by other types of animals.

**Animals will naturally compete with one another** —there are only so many resources to go around, so only a limited number of genes’ hosts can reproduce.**** Members of different species may compete for various things—for instance, blackbirds and moles might compete for earthworms—but members of the same species will be in much more direct competition. This is because they tend to live in the same environment and need the same things, including food sources and mates.

Given that fact, it seems logical that the best way to preserve one’s own genes is to kill—and possibly eat—your rivals. However, while murder and cannibalism do happen in nature, it’s not as common as an uninitiated observer might think.

**The problem is that fighting has great costs associated with its potential benefits.** First of all, fighting takes a great deal of energy that might be better spent looking for food or breeding. It also naturally carries the risk that you’ll wind up dead or maimed instead of your rival. A less direct, but still very real risk, is that by eliminating one rival you accidentally help another who was also competing with the individual you killed.

Therefore, before animals fight in earnest, they have to somehow weigh the risk against the benefits. Fighting another member of one’s own species is extremely risky, since they’re likely to have similar physical abilities. In fact, animals of the same species usually “fight” in a way that’s comparable to boxing or fencing: There are rules, it’s clear when the bout is over and who won it, and (barring an accident) neither party gets seriously hurt.

### Game Theory and Evolutionarily Stable Strategies

(Shortform note: Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making through mathematical models.)

**Populations of animals will naturally tend toward an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy, or ESS.** The ESS of a population is the most stable possible configuration of members; by definition, any member of the population who doesn’t conform to the ESS will not be as successful as others.

For example, imagine that a hypothetical species has two possible strategies when confronted with a rival: Fight or bluff. Furthermore, imagine that each member of that species engages in only one of those behaviors—the same one every time without fail.

If two fighters meet, they will fight until one is severely injured or killed. If a fighter meets a bluffer, the bluffer will run and the fighter will win without suffering injuries. If two bluffers meet, they will engage in a drawn-out contest until one backs down.

**We can apply Game Theory to find the ESS for this species by assigning arbitrary point values to the outcomes.** Let’s say that being injured is -100 points, wasting time on a lengthy contest is -10 points, and winning a contest (whether fighting or bluffing) is worth +50 points. In a more realistic model the numbers would be based on a huge number of factors, but this arbitrary setup will do as an example.

#### Running the Numbers

At a glance, it would seem that the ESS is for every member of the species to be a bluffer. Each contest between two bluffers, or peaceful individuals, would then result in each member losing 10 points due to wasting time; however, the winner would also gain 50 points, for a total gain of 40. Neither one would suffer the penalty for being injured, because such a contest wouldn’t turn to violence.

Assuming that each creature has a 50/50 chance of winning any given contest, all members of the species would gain an average of 15 points per contest—50 points for winning one, minus 20 for the cost of engaging in two contests, divided by two. This is the best possible outcome for the entire population.

(Shortform note: For a real-world example of a bluffing contest, think about two dogs meeting: They may stare each other down, bare their teeth, and growl, but it would be very unusual for them to immediately start fighting. Each is trying to get the other to back down.)

However, this all-bluffing strategy could only work if evolution existed for the good of the species, rather than the individual. This is because a single selfish individual could easily take advantage of the situation.

In a population of bluffers, a single fighter would win the full 50 points for every contest it participates in, making it vastly more successful than its bluffing counterparts. Plus, it would only be a matter of time before a mutant or deviant member of the population became a fighter and began spreading that strategy through its offspring. **Therefore, while having everyone be a bluffer is the _best_ strategy, it is not the _stable_ strategy. **

Having every member be a fighter would also be highly unstable, because every member of the population would lose an average of 25 points per contest. Assume again that each creature has a 50/50 chance of winning a fight. Then, in two fights you could expect it to win one (+50 points) and lose one (-100 points for being injured). -50 points across two fights averages out to -25 per fight.

Right now it might seem like there isn’t a stable strategy; that the population is bound to oscillate between bluffers and fighters as the situation keeps changing. However, this hypothetical species can reach an equilibrium.

After doing a lot of math, it turns out that the ideal composition for this arbitrary population is a 5:7 ratio of bluffers to fighters. The average gain from a contest in that population is 6.25 for fighters and bluffers alike. While that’s clearly much lower than the 15 average in a population of all bluffers, the population will be stable.

If, by chance, the number of fighters starts to increase, they will encounter and injure each other more often, so the bluffers will gain an advantage until equilibrium is restored. Similarly, if the number of bluffers happens to increase, fighters will gain an advantage until the population is back to that 5:7 ratio.

The model works equally well if we assume that—instead of being a pure fighter or pure bluffer—every member of the population can act as either. As long as they perform those behaviors in the same 5:7 ratio, the population will be just as stable.

#### Conditional Strategies

The previous model assumes that there are only two possible strategies, but in reality there are several others besides pure fighting and pure bluffing. For instance, a bully will act like a fighter unless the target fights back, in which case it runs like a bluffer. A retaliator is just the opposite—it acts like a bluffer unless it’s attacked, in which case it will fight back. A prober-retaliator usually acts like a retaliator, but will occasionally try to escalate the fight to see if its target runs. These are called _conditional strategies_ : Strategies that depend on what the other creature does.

Interestingly, retaliation is the only strategy that, by itself, leads to a stable population. If two retaliators engage in a contest, it won’t escalate to a real fight. However, if a fighter emerges in a population of retaliators, it won’t be successful because every target will fight back. Prober-retaliator is almost, but not quite, as stable as true retaliation, simply because it leads to fights and injuries slightly more often.

**The retaliator strategy explains why so many animals engage in contests that aren’t true fights** —they bluff unless their opponent tries to escalate to a real fight, in which case they fight back.

### Territorial Aggression

There are other factors besides simple strategy that can determine whether a creature will attack or retreat. A few important ones are the animal’s size, age, and strength compared to its opponent.

However, one of the most notable factors in nature is territory. A strategy where creatures aggressively protect their own territory, and run away if they invade another’s territory, is quite common in nature. **This by itself could be an ESS (Evolutionarily Stable Strategy)—if all members of the population stick to it, contests will rarely (if ever) result in injury or wasted time.**

The opposite strategy—resident retreats, intruder attacks—would also be stable if the whole population followed it, but this is much rarer in nature. There are obvious flaws with that strategy. For example, it has residents constantly running and shifting territories, which is an enormous waste of time and energy.

Biologists often wonder what advantage there is to territorial behavior, since it runs the risk of injuring both the resident and the intruder. However, in light of ESS, this may be the wrong question to ask; perhaps animals simply defend their territory because that’s the ESS that has arisen.

The ESS is one more example of how**genes that work well within their environment tend to be favored by natural selection.** This is just as important, if not more so, than whether those genes are individually “better” than their rival alleles.
