## Chapter 7: Animal Reproduction: Bearing vs. Caring

How, when, and why do animals choose to reproduce? All of those decisions are designed to maximize their offsprings’ chance of survival. There are two competing theories for how animal populations control their reproduction: an altruistic theory put forth by group-selection theorists, and a selfish theory that Dawkins believes is true.

**Animals often have to choose between reproducing and taking care of children that have already been born (bearing vs. caring).** There are advantages and disadvantages to each choice, from the perspective of a selfish gene. Bearing more children creates more opportunities for genes to be passed on and survive, but often involves a great deal of risk and resource spending. Caring for already-living family members is less resource-intensive than bearing new ones, but doesn’t create more vessels for genes to inhabit.

Reaching an ESS usually (though not always) involves some balance of both—in fact, the only strategy that can never be an ESS is a pure caring strategy. This is because a population of pure carers, who rarely or never have offspring of their own, would quickly be invaded by another species turning the carers’ altruism to their own advantage.

### When and Why to Reproduce

**How animals decide when to reproduce is a complicated question.** Some scientists, most notably zoologist Vero Copner Wynne-Edwards, believe that animals control their reproduction rates to avoid overpopulating an area. However, this would be a group-selection based theory, which doesn’t seem to mesh with the idea of the selfish gene. It’s worth noting that Wynne-Edwards was a prominent champion of the group-selection theory of evolution, and his ideas are influential enough to be worth considering—even if only to refute them.

Whatever the reason, it’s clear that animal populations don’t grow at the incredible rates they’d be theoretically capable of. Many populations remain fairly stable, with birth and death rates roughly matching each other. Others, like lemmings, grow rapidly and then decline sharply, sometimes to the point of total extinction in a particular area.

Starvation is one major factor in keeping animal populations under control. If animals reproduce too quickly for an area to support, naturally many of them will starve. **However, starvation cannot fully explain how animal populations stay under control.** If starvation were the only control set on population size, scientists would expect all creatures to work like lemmings do: Their numbers would increase exponentially until the region couldn’t support them, then suddenly crash as most of them starved.

Therefore, it’s clear that there are methods limiting birth rates as well as death rates—animals don’t have infinite numbers of offspring. **The question is not _whether_ birth rates are controlled, but _why_ they are controlled.**

The group-selection theory would say the reason is altruistic: Animals regulate their birth rates for the good of the entire population. The selfish gene theory would say that it’s selfish: Animals regulate their birth rates because it gives them and their offspring the best chance of survival.

### The Altruistic Theory of Birth Control

Wynne-Edwards’s theory says that animals have natural rules and guidelines that keep their populations in check. **He takes observed territorial and hierarchical behaviors as evidence that animals follow certain rules for the good of the whole species.**

He notes that males of many species will not even try to reproduce if they don’t have territories of their own. Since there is a limited amount of territory, that naturally limits the number of new births there can be. Similarly, among many species, males with low social status will not be able to reproduce—either females will not mate with them, or higher-ranking males will prevent lower-ranking ones from accessing the females. As with territoriality, in many species the low-ranking males will not even try to breed. **These contests over territory and social status take the place of direct contests over females, which could result in wasted energy or injuries.**

The most remarkable part of this theory may be _epideictic behavior,_ which is a term that Wynne-Edwards himself created. Many animals tend to gather in large groups, and there are clear evolutionary advantages to doing so, such as protection from predators. However, epideictic behavior suggests another explanation: Animals gather in this way to conduct a sort of informal census of the population.

By seeing how large and dense the herd or flock is, animals can then determine whether they need to restrain their reproduction. Overcrowding is a clear sign that famine may be imminent, and the animals will need to adjust accordingly. This decision isn’t made consciously, but seeing a dense enough population will trigger natural responses in the animals that lead to lower birth rates, according to this theory.

### The Selfish Theory of Birth Control

There are costs as well as benefits to reproducing: remember bearing vs. caring. **Therefore, even from a purely selfish standpoint, having as many children as possible isn’t usually the best strategy.** For example, swifts have a standard clutch size of three eggs. That suggests that three is the ideal number of offspring for a swift to raise at one time. Having more than three at a time may mean the offspring wouldn’t get enough of their parents’ time and resources, and could die. Fewer than three, naturally, would mean that there are fewer offspring to pass those genes on to the next generation.

**A selfish gene would want the animal to produce as many successful offspring as possible, given the resources available.** Therefore, it’s selfishness, not altruism, that leads animals to limit their reproduction; having too many children would make it less likely for each to survive. Similarly selfish explanations can be made for the other aspects of Wynne-Edwards’s theory as well.

**Animals who stop competing for territory or social dominance may have determined that their best bet is to hope that one of the others dies, rather than waste energy and risk injury with repeated contests that it has little chance of winning.** The fact that these gambles often don’t pay off doesn’t necessarily mean that they were bad gambles. The chances of it working are slim, but perhaps the chances of winning such a contest and successfully defending a new position are even slimmer.

Even so-called epideictic behavior can be explained in selfish terms. Animals may lower their breeding rates during times of overcrowding because it gives them, personally, the greatest chance of raising the most surviving offspring. If resources become more limited, such as during a famine, a selfish gene should encourage the animal to have fewer children to split those resources among.

In practice, the altruistic vs. selfish reproduction theories are nearly identical.**** The only difference is whether animals practice population control for the good of the species as a whole, or purely for selfish reasons. Right now there’s no definitive way to tell which is correct, but—as previously shown—pure altruism is not a stable strategy since it’s bound to be taken over by selfish individuals. **Therefore, it currently appears that the selfish reproduction theory is the stronger of the two.**
