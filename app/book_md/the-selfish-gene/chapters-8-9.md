## Chapters 8-9: Limited Resources and Conflicts of Interest

Because Earth is a finite world with finite resources, there’s**** a natural struggle between the creatures who inhabit it to get those resources. In this chapter we discuss various ways that family members compete with each other—their own selfish interests conflict with their shared desires to have their offspring and siblings survive. We’ll also explore the natural conflict between mates, each of whom would benefit from the other contributing more resources to their offspring.

Finally, we examine the role of sexual attractiveness, especially among species where the male _doesn’t_ engage in this conflict between mates, but simply leaves to find another female to impregnate. Sexual attraction is especially important for such species, because there’s no chance that the mate will stick around to contribute to raising the offspring. In that case, all that matters is finding the best, most fit mates through which animals can pass on their genes.

### The Universal Struggle for Resources

**Every animal has a limited amount of resources to invest in furthering its genes.** This limit represents the total amount of food that animal can gather or make, as well as the total energy it can expend in caring for and protecting others. That natural limit raises the question of whether parents (and other relatives) can have favorites—not in the human sense of “liking” one child more than another, but just in the sense of distributing those resources unevenly among its children.

While it might seem like there’s no genetic reason to do so—all of an animal’s offspring have 50% of its genes—**wise investments can maximize the number of surviving offspring.** For instance, if forced to choose between the lives of an older child and a younger one, the animal should pick the elder. It will need less care (and therefore fewer resources) to reach maturity and pass on its genes. However, if forced to choose to feed one or the other—not in an immediate life-or-death situation—oftentimes animals will choose to feed their younger children because the older ones are more likely to fend for themselves.

Also, many animals will not care for the “runt” of a litter, because it is less likely to survive and reproduce than others. In extreme cases parents may even feed the runt to its siblings, or eat it themselves. Though it seems contradictory, a selfish gene may even cause runts to give up and die in favor of their stronger siblings, so as not to drain resources from individuals with better chances of survival.

**There comes a time when it makes sense, from a selfish gene’s perspective, for the parent to stop having children and focus on raising more distant relatives.** If a child would have less than a 50% chance of survival—such as if the animal is too old to effectively raise more offspring—then mathematically the animal should devote its efforts to raising a grandchild instead. The grandchild is more distantly related, but has a much better chance of surviving to reproduce. Of course the animals don’t consciously calculate these odds, these behaviors are programmed by genes that have survived and outcompeted their alleles. As a side note, this may be a genetic explanation for menopause in humans.

**This logic also applies to siblings who have to compete with one another for food and care.** If a sibling would receive more than double the benefit that the individual itself would—for instance, if the sibling is too young to find its own food and needs the parents’ care to survive—selfish gene theory dictates that the individual should _want_ those resources to go to the sibling instead. The “double” cutoff is because the sibling has half the relation that the individual does to itself—50% instead of 100%.

### Parents vs. Children

**There’s a natural struggle between parents and their children for exactly what proportion of the resources each child should get.** The parent will want to distribute resources for the best possible genetic payoff. The child, as previously stated, will be selfish up until its siblings get more than double the benefit it would receive from taking those resources itself. Therefore, the child will often try to trick its parents into believing it needs more resources than it’s getting.

A child may use various tactics to try to get more than its fair share of the resources. A common tactic, especially among birds, is to cry more loudly than the others in the nest. Since the volume of a cry corresponds to how hungry the bird is, a louder hatchling can trick its parents into believing that it’s hungrier than its siblings.

One species of bird, the honeyguide, has a more extreme strategy: It lays eggs in other birds’ nests like cuckoos do. Upon hatching, the newborn honeyguide will kill all the other hatchlings in the nest, thereby eliminating them as competition. Since it has no genetic relationship to its “foster siblings,” this strategy has no downside for the honeyguide’s selfish genes.

Honeyguides aside, this struggle between parent and child causes an apparent paradox: A child that takes more than its fair share will pass those genes on to its own offspring, lowering the number of children it can successfully raise because each child will demand more resources. In other words, being more successful as a child will make it less successful as an adult.

However, the animal has different purposes during the different phases of its life. Therefore, there’s no paradox between the child attempting to trick its parent into giving it more resources, and the parent attempting to see through those deceptions. **All it means is that we must take the cost to future offspring as well as current siblings into account when considering the selfish behavior.** If the total cost (to siblings and offspring combined) is less than double the benefit to the individual, then the genes causing that behavior will naturally be selected for.

### Males vs. Females

If there can be conflicts of interest between parents and children,**** then **there should be a severe conflict of interests between mates, who have no relation to each other at all.** Genetically speaking, each is only valuable to the other in terms of their shared offspring. Therefore, though each wants to end up with as many surviving children as possible, they’ll naturally disagree on who should have to invest the resources to raise those children.

**There are benefits to each of two conflicting situations: staying with one’s partner for as long as possible, and abandoning them with the child before being abandoned oneself.** A mated pair that stays together can split the resource cost of raising their offspring. However, a parent that abandons their mate and offspring gains a significant advantage— _if_ they can be reasonably sure that the remaining mate will successfully raise the child.

In either situation, it’s to an individual’s advantage to keep his or her partner around. This simple fact goes a long way toward explaining the courtship behavior seen in many species of animals. Long, elaborate courtship rituals force both partners to invest a lot of resources into the future child before mating has even occurred. Knowing that future relationships will require similar periods of investment makes the partners less likely to abandon their current mates. The male also gets the benefit of knowing that the female is not already pregnant by someone else, if the courtship lasts long enough.

**Females naturally have a larger investment in their offspring than males do, at least among mammals.** Females, by definition, have larger _gametes_ that are more costly to produce. Gametes are also known as sex cells—sperm and eggs, in animals. They also have to carry the child, and produce milk for it after birth. Therefore, it seems reasonable that a male could abandon his mate and go on to impregnate other females in order to produce the maximum number of offspring possible.

In some species this does indeed happen, but in many it doesn’t. In fact, a few species like beavers and wolves form lifelong monogamous pairs. In those species, there must have been some sort of pressure working against the mate-abandoning strategy—for example, females were unable to raise the children on their own, became adept at spotting males likely to abandon them, or would abandon the children if left alone in spite of the genetic cost.

An interesting side note: In some species of fish this pattern is reversed. Female fish deposit their eggs and leave immediately. Male fish come along later to fertilize the eggs, and are then left to raise the children themselves.

**We can apply game theory to this male vs. female situation, as we did to the fighting and bluffing birds earlier.** We may assume that there are two male strategies: faithfulness and unfaithfulness. A faithful male will stay with his mate, while an unfaithful one will leave as soon as possible. There are also two female strategies: coyness and forwardness. A coy female will insist on a lengthy courtship, a forward female will mate with any male immediately.

By assigning a point value to a successfully raised child, and penalties to the resources invested in courtship and raising the child, we could come up with a stable ratio of each of these strategies to find the ESS. As before, any numbers we assign would be purely arbitrary, and the exact ESS would depend on which numbers we pick. Therefore, the actual result of this exercise is less important than the fact that it can be done—more scientific, less arbitrary applications of game theory can reveal a lot about the behaviors and strategies of individuals.

#### The Role of Attractiveness

Contrary to the previous section, wherein females tried to ensure that their partners would stick around and contribute to raising the offspring, in some species they’ll completely set aside the idea of a long-term partner. **In such species, females will simply look for males with the most desirable traits and breed with them.** An interesting side effect of this is that sexual attractiveness becomes an extremely important characteristic, regardless of its survival value. An attractive male could breed with many different females and spread his genes very quickly.

This leads to what could be considered “fashion.” Even if the attractive quality is objectively harmful, such as excessively long tail feathers in certain bird species (which take more resources to grow and could make the bird easier for predators to spot and catch), females who don’t bear children with that quality have less of a chance of their genes continuing to survive, because their offspring will not reproduce as successfully as other members of the species.

An alternative theory to sexual attractiveness states that these handicaps evolved _because_ they are handicaps—males who survive with such handicaps are demonstrating that their other genes must be very strong. However, scientists haven’t been able to work this handicap theory into a logical model of evolution.

In some species such as elephant seals, this leads to situations where a single male can have an enormous harem of females, while many other males do not breed at all. In the case of elephant seals, the harem holder becomes such simply by fighting off all other males. **By breeding with attractive or strong males, the females are more likely to produce offspring who will themselves be successful breeders, thereby keeping the selfish genes alive.**

Given that one male can impregnate many females, it would seem like the ideal sex distribution would be skewed heavily toward females. **However, the ESS in mammals is roughly 50% male to 50% female, and the selfish gene theory can explain why.**

First of all, sex is determined by a single chromosome: The presence of a Y chromosome makes an animal male, and a father has a 50% chance of passing on his Y chromosome to his offspring. A female has two X chromosomes, and will always pass one on to her offspring.

(Shortform note: There are genetic conditions where a mammal may have something other than the typical XX or XY setup, but these rare cases don’t change the main point of this section.)

It’s theoretically possible that genes could evolve that favor X chromosomes, skewing the sex ratio in favor of females. **However, if that happened, parents of males would be at a huge genetic advantage.** Due to a shortage of males their offspring would probably mate with many different females, giving them a huge number of grandchildren compared to parents of females. The number of Y chromosomes in the population would then increase until the sex distribution was back to the roughly 50/50 balance we see in nature.

As a result of this 50/50 distribution, in many species females are highly sought after, meanwhile there are many more males than necessary. This often leads to males being colorful, flashy, and loud, because they have to compete for mates while females can afford to be picky.
