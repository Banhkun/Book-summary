## 1-Page Summary

**_The Selfish Gene_ shows that all forms of life on Earth begin with genes, and that the purpose of life is to make sure those genes survive. **While many biologists would say that the purpose of life is to survive and reproduce at the _organismal_ level, Dawkins argues that there are things that the organismal approach can’t explain, such as the prevalence of sexual reproduction when it leads to offspring that are substantially different from the parents. Therefore, it makes more sense to look at life from the perspective of a selfish gene doing anything it can to reproduce itself because, outside of random mutations, genes pass from one generation to the next unchanged.

**Any form of life anywhere in the universe must begin with some type of replicating molecule.** That molecule first arises by chance, as atoms randomly bump into each other in some primordial soup. Once formed, however, that _replicator_ quickly copies itself and spreads throughout its environment. Copying itself is that molecule’s only purpose.

Sooner or later, the environment runs out of freely available resources, and then the molecules will have to compete. Those that can’t effectively replicate themselves will be squeezed out of the population, while those that _can_ undergo various mutations during the copying process. **Some of those mutations, by pure chance, are helpful, and the molecules carrying them replicate more effectively than others.** New mutations build on top of old ones to create ever-more effective and elaborate vehicles to carry those replicators. On Earth, those replicators became DNA and evolution led to the complex organisms we have today.

Genes are like a blueprint for the bodies they create and inhabit. Genes can’t control their bodies directly, so they create structures like the brain and muscles to coordinate and execute all of the many processes required for life.

However, for all of the complex structures and systems they give rise to, genes are still replicator molecules doing whatever they can to keep replicating and survive through the generations. **This is the meaning of “selfish gene,” and the reason all biology should be considered from the perspective of genes, not individuals.**

### Altruistic and Selfish Behaviors

While the driving force behind biology may be genes attempting to replicate, in modern times many must do so through the behaviors of their hosts. _Behavior_ is how scientists describe specific actions that creatures take. A behavior is something quick and definite, so only animals can really be said to have them—some plants do move, but not in a fast or purposeful way.

Selfish behaviors in nature are easy to explain: Animals would naturally be expected to behave in ways that benefit themselves at the expense of others, given that the purpose of life is to survive and reproduce. However, altruistic behavior—helping others at cost to oneself—seems counterintuitive.

#### Group Selection

One possible explanation for altruistic behavior is _group selection_ : the idea that natural selection acts on groups of creatures, rather than on the individual level. While the commonly accepted theory today is that individuals compete for the ability to reproduce, group selection says that animals will instinctively act for the good of their local population, or even their entire species. If true, it would make altruistic behavior very easy to explain; risking oneself to help others of one’s species would then be the default, not the exception.

However, group selection is a fatally flawed theory. There are many ways to rebut it, but the simplest is to recognize that a population of altruistic individuals can be easily exploited by a selfish one. The selfish individual will accept all the help that other members of the population offer, while taking on no risks or costs to itself. Therefore, a selfish individual in an altruistic population will inevitably be more successful than the average creature in that population.

That selfish creature would quickly spread its genes—and therefore its selfishness—until a large portion of the population turns selfish. In other words, **the individual will succeed at the expense of the group, and therefore group selection can’t be true.**

#### Gene Selection

The other explanation for altruistic behavior is _gene selection_. **The key to understanding gene selection is recognizing that close relatives, by definition, share many of the same genes.** For example, in a typical mammal that reproduces sexually, an individual’s offspring and siblings will both have 50% of its genes. However, there’s no way for a gene to actively recognize itself in another organism, so it has to play the odds. If another organism carries 50% of the same genes, then there’s a 50% chance that it carries a copy of the gene in question.

Therefore, from the perspective of a selfish gene, siblings and offspring should be considered 50% as valuable as the organism that gene happens to be in. So, to give an extreme example, if an organism could save more than two of its siblings or children by sacrificing its own life, selfish gene theory dictates that it should do so. **Genes don’t need one particular organism to survive, as long as organisms likely to be carrying them are able to keep reproducing.**

### Nature Seeks Stability

Since genes themselves aren’t living organisms, it may be confusing to talk about their “survival”; substituting the word “stability” might help to clarify the matter. By definition, something that’s unstable—whether it’s a single molecule or a population of animals—will keep changing until it finds a stable form. For primordial molecules, this happens by chance; atoms randomly bump into each other until they happen to land in a form that sticks.

In animal populations, it’s a lot more complex. As we’ve discussed, a population of altruistic animals could be easily overtaken by selfish individuals, and therefore can’t be considered stable. Similarly, a population of all selfish animals will be unstable because it’ll fight against itself, inevitably growing weaker until it’s overwhelmed by other types of individuals.

**However, there is a ratio of selfish to altruistic animals where the population will be stable. This is called the _Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)._ **In reality, there are countless details that go into forming an ESS, not just altruism and selfishness, but this simplified version will do.

Any deviation from the ESS will be punished: If too many selfish animals emerge, they will compete against and weaken each other until the balance is restored. If too many altruistic animals enter the population, they will be exploited by the selfish ones until that ideal ratio is reached again. **The best situation for a selfish gene is a balanced population that will allow it to keep reproducing itself indefinitely—which is to say, the ESS.**

Scientists have simulated this process using computers and game theory. By assigning arbitrary point and penalty values to different outcomes such as winning a confrontation, being injured, or wasting time on a lengthy contest, and programming in various strategies for the virtual “animals” to use, the simulation can run until the population stops shifting in any significant way. These simulations help scientists to find and understand the ESS.

### Limited Resources May Cause Conflicts of Interest

Because Earth is a finite world with finite resources, there’s**** a natural struggle between the creatures who inhabit it to get those resources. This competition extends to family members, including the struggle between **parents and their children for exactly what proportion of the resources each child should get.** The parent will want to distribute resources for the best possible genetic payoff—in other words, the maximum number of surviving offspring. However, each child will be interested in getting more for itself. Therefore, the child will often try to trick its parents into believing it needs more resources than it’s getting.

Also, if there can be conflicts of interest between parents and children—who share 50% of the same genes—then **there should be severe conflicts of interest between mates, who have no relation to each other at all.** Genetically speaking, each is only valuable to the other in terms of their shared offspring. Each wants as many surviving children as possible, but they will naturally disagree on who should have to invest the resources to raise those children.

**There are benefits to each of two conflicting situations: staying with your partner for as long as possible, and abandoning them with the child before being abandoned yourself.** A mated pair that stays together can split the resource cost of raising their offspring. However, a parent who abandons their mate and offspring gains a significant advantage— _if_ they can be reasonably sure that the remaining mate will successfully raise the child or children.

Worth noting in this situation is that the female will naturally be more invested in the offspring. This is because she contributes the larger and more resource-intensive egg cell and, in many species, because she takes on the cost and risk of pregnancy and birth. It will be much more difficult for the female to produce another offspring than the male, who could easily find another mate and impregnate her.

These two situations, parent vs. offspring and male vs. female mates, have led to a huge array of evolutionary tools and strategies. A child may use various tactics to try to get more than its fair share of the resources. For example, a common tactic among young birds is to cry more loudly than the others in the nest. Since the volume of a cry normally corresponds to how hungry the bird is, a louder hatchling can trick its parents into thinking it’s hungrier than the others, causing them to give it more food at its siblings’ expense.

For mates, many species of animals have long, intricate courtships to get both the male and female heavily involved before they actually reproduce. We mentioned before that, in theory, a male could simply leave and impregnate another female right away. However, if he knows he’ll have to go through the entire courtship again, it’ll be more worth his time to stay with the mate he already has.

### Group Altruism and the Evolution of Culture

Many types of animals move, or even live, together in groups. Some advantages of this are obvious. For example, prey animals gain some protection from predators by living in groups. Meanwhile, predators like hyenas can bring down much larger prey by working together, so it benefits them all even though they have to share the food.

Another example is birds, many of which fly in formation and switch leaders frequently to reduce turbulence and make travel less tiring. However, birds have also been observed giving alarm calls to warn of predators, at some risk to themselves. **This apparent act of altruism may ultimately be an act of selfishness—in fact, considering the selfish gene theory, it _must_ be. **

By the simple truth of natural selection, we can infer that giving that alarm call is more beneficial to the individual’s genes than not giving it would be. There are any number of possible reasons for this.

For instance, if a bird simply flew away upon spotting a predator, it would lose the advantages of living in a flock. If it froze and hid, but the rest of the flock kept moving around and making noise, that would draw the predator closer to the individual anyway. Therefore, it would be best to call a quick warning so the entire flock can hide. Also, there’s the simple likelihood that by taking a small risk to itself, the individual giving the call can protect many of its relatives. Finally, we can infer that if one of these birds calls to warn the others, that kindness will be repaid later by the others.

This is one form of _reciprocal altruism_ : Two or more animals showing each other mutual altruism. Another common example is communal grooming. This example is especially interesting because there is a delay between one act of altruism and the act being repaid—pulling a harmful parasite off another individual doesn’t help you until you have a parasite to be pulled yourself.

The cost of grooming another member of the population is minuscule, but it’s still greater than zero. Therefore, among species that participate in communal grooming, there must be greater benefit than cost for doing so. One possible explanation is that members of the population evolved the ability to hold a “grudge”; that is, they refuse to groom selfish individuals who don’t groom others. This would naturally drive down the number of selfish individuals as they fall victim to parasites.

#### Ideas Spread Like Genes

Interestingly, ideas and behaviors can be observed to spread through populations and evolve much like genes do. Certain songbirds, for example, are known to learn their songs by imitating birds around them, rather than having them coded in by genes. However, sometimes birds will make a mistake and give rise to a new song. That song, in turn, is picked up by others and spreads throughout the population. **If the replicator unit of biology is the gene, then the replicator unit of ideas could be called the _meme_** —from the Greek mimema, meaning “that which is imitated.”

Among humans, the spread of ideas is more pronounced and much easier to recognize.**A catchy song is a type of meme, as is a popular slogan or a political stance.** God is one of the most successful memes in all of history—while it’s not clear how the idea of God originated in the “meme pool,” so to speak, it has been spread by stories, songs, art, and rituals to nearly every part of the world for thousands of years.

Culture and memes don’t seem to have any inherent survival value. It’s more likely that they’re side effects of group-focused evolutionary traits such as those discussed at the beginning of this section.

### Extending the Phenotype

We began with the premise that biologists think too large (organisms instead of genes), but it’s also possible that they think too small—that genes have much greater impacts on the world than simply creating bodies to inhabit.

To look at biology in a new way requires that we consider what might be called the _extended phenotype_. _Phenotype_ typically means the physical effects that genes have on the body they inhabit—for example, blue eyes or long legs. However, **it’s not much of a stretch to extend the definition of phenotype beyond the individual, to include the impact on the world.** This could be called an _extended phenotype_.

While phenotype typically refers to a creature’s physical body, genes don’t directly affect such things; rather, they change the internal workings of cells, which eventually leads to different traits in the body.**** Therefore, saying that the organism’s body—but not its impact on the wider world—is a result of those genes is fairly arbitrary.

Some examples of this _extended phenotype_ could be bird nests and beaver dams. Though it sounds strange to say, there are genes “for” certain building materials and construction styles—phrased another way, there are genes that cause the animals to build structures in those specific ways. Even a lake that was formed by beavers damming a river could be considered part of those beavers’ phenotypes.

It’s easy to see the obvious ways that organisms interact with each other: competing for resources, predation, mating, symbiosis, and so forth. **However, with an extended phenotype, it becomes clear that there are countless different ways that organisms—or, more accurately, genes—impact each other and the world around them.** The problems and opportunities that arise from this gene-centric view of the world are explored in much greater detail in Dawkins’s book _The Extended Phenotype_.

#### Biologists Often Ask the Wrong Questions

Many biologists make the mistake of focusing their questions and their studies on the organismal level: They ask why an _organism_ does something, or behaves a certain way. In fact, it’s quite common for biologists to say that DNA and RNA are tools organisms use to replicate themselves—which, in light of what we’ve discussed so far, is the exact opposite of the truth.

Organisms don’t replicate themselves at all (except in the relatively rare case of asexual reproduction). Given that the “purpose” of life is replication, it seems clear that **organisms are tools that genes use to replicate themselves.**

Starting from the genetic level, then, one might ask why organisms as we know them should exist at all. The simple truth is that organisms _don’t_ have to exist. They exist on Earth because that’s what evolution happened to favor in this particular environment.

It’s helpful to remember that, at the most basic level, we’re dealing with replicators that aren’t so different from those found in the primordial soup eons ago. The only thing that _must_ exist in order for there to be life is some form of replicator molecule.**Replication is both the beginning and the purpose of life.**
