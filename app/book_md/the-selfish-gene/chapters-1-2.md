## Chapters 1-2: The Purpose of Life

_The Selfish Gene_ is a long essay arguing that biology should be considered from the perspective of individual genes, not entire organisms. Dawkins points out flaws in the organism-centric biology of his day and proposes that many of the apparent paradoxes in nature could be explained by genes, rather than creatures, trying to replicate themselves.

One major paradox is the prevalence of sexual reproduction in nature. If, as Dawkins argues, the main purpose of life is to replicate itself, then sexual reproduction doesn’t make much sense. The offspring produced by sexual reproduction will be inherently different from their parents, so it’s not really a form of replication at all. This apparent contradiction is explored in Chapter 3.

Most of the essay, but especially Chapters 5, 8, and 9, explore competition in nature and how it leads to evolution. Genes that survive at the expense of others will naturally reproduce more effectively and come to outnumber the less successful ones. In Chapters 5 and 12, we’ll also dip into game theory, the mathematical study of decision-making, to help explain some of the more complex behaviors that animals exhibit.

_The Selfish Gene_ ends with the rather surprising proposal that we should stretch our concept of the impact that genes have beyond individual creatures, and consider the world at large. For example, a beaver dam could be considered an effect of those beavers’ genes. So, overall, the essay aims to start from a microscopic level (genes) and expand readers’ concepts of biology beyond the usual macro level (organisms).

### Why Does Life Exist?

The purpose of life is one of the greatest philosophical questions in the world, but the answer is quite simple: The purpose of life is to replicate itself. **In biological terms, selfish and altruistic acts only refer to whether they will help a creature achieve that purpose, or help others to achieve it at some cost to the creature performing the act.** There’s no relation to the more common definitions of the words, which are based on psychology rather than biology.

Selfishness and altruism both have roots in biology and evolution. Several famous and influential books, such as Robert Ardrey’s _The Social Contract_ and Konrad Lorenz’s _On Aggression_ , have already explored selfishness and altruism in nature. However, those books are fatally flawed because the authors misunderstood the point of evolution. Ardrey, Lorenz, and others thought that evolution existed for the good of the entire species. However, the common belief among biologists today is that **evolution is about the survival of the individual.**

(Shortform note: The terminology is a bit confusing here, since evolution works on the population level and not the individual level. However, as a population evolves, each individual in it has a better chance to survive and pass on its genes.)

“The good of the species” is a common misconception. It comes about because most of an animal’s life is devoted to reproduction, and most of the selfless acts an animal performs are for its offspring. Therefore, it seems like creatures act as they do in order to continue the species.

Furthermore, by slightly twisting Darwin’s theory of evolution, a logical—but wrong—conclusion can be drawn: If only the fittest animals survive and reproduce, that strengthens the species as a whole. Thus everything creatures do, including competing with each other, has the ultimate goal of continuing the species. This is the theory of _group selection_.

However, group selection can’t be right because of a simple truth of nature: Even in altruistic groups, selfish individuals will have an advantage. They’ll outcompete the altruistic ones, and reproduce until the population is overrun with selfish individuals. If left unchecked, this would eventually cause the whole population to collapse.

Actually, the spread of selfish individuals probably wouldn’t get that far; as we’ll explain later with the concept of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies, the population would eventually reach an equilibrium where further shifts toward selfishness or altruism would be disadvantageous, so they’d naturally balance themselves out.

However, the point is that creatures’ ultimate goal _can’t_ be the survival of the species as a whole, or such selfish behaviors wouldn’t exist in nature. The truth is that nature is fiercely competitive, with members of the same population having to fight each other for limited resources—and, therefore, for survival. This is called _natural selection:_ Organisms who are fit enough to survive and reproduce in their environments will be the ones to pass on their genes to the next generation.

**In summary, while continuing the species may be a _consequence_ of competition and reproduction, it’s not _why_ animals do those things. **

### The Logic of Selfishness

All behaviors in nature lead back to genes trying to copy themselves. Selfishness and altruism can both be explained by animals acting to protect either themselves or their relatives (who will, by definition, share many of their genes).

Note that, due to countless variables, it’s impossible to say exactly what effect a behavior will have on a creature’s long-term chance of survival. Therefore, all of the examples throughout this essay are presented with what we _assume_ the effects of those actions will be.

Emperor penguins demonstrate selfish behavior when they push each other into the water to check for predators before diving in themselves. Meanwhile, bees demonstrate altruistic behavior when they sting to defend their hives—while they may drive off creatures that would have eaten the hive’s food source, the honey, the bees themselves often die in the process.

However, selfishness and altruism aren’t always immediate life-or-death acts. For example, a bird that gives an alarm call upon seeing a predator is being altruistic, because the bird might draw that predator’s attention to itself. It’s a relatively small risk compared to that of a bee stinging an intruder, but it still counts as altruism.

For all the earlier talk of creatures reproducing, it must be understood that the _gene_ is the unit of inheritance—not the creature, species, or population. **Therefore, creatures’ selfishness and altruism are both rooted in gene selfishness.**

Animals, including humans, are essentially organic machines built by genes, and genes are designed to survive and reproduce. Genes are selfish—not consciously, of course, but those that still exist have out-competed countless other genes. This is ultimately selfish behavior—that is, behavior that benefits the individual at the expense of others.

Genes also show their selfishness because of the fact that altruism toward outside groups is rare, and toward different species is almost unheard of. For example, a human killing another human is one of the worst crimes possible, but we kill animals every day for food, in self-defense, or simply for sport.

Humans are something of a special case when it comes to selfishness and altruism. Unlike other animals, we can be taught altruism and be convinced to go against our basic selfish nature—although to exactly what extent is part of the ongoing nature vs. nurture debate.

### Nature Seeks Stability

**Everything that we observe in the universe, from genes to organisms to populations, is _stable_ : either long-lived enough or common enough that we think it deserves a name. **For example, atoms will naturally arrange themselves in stable configurations because, by definition, anything unstable will keep changing until it’s stable. This is why salt crystals tend to be cubical: Cubes are a stable way to stick a lot of chloride and sodium together.

**Everything from the simplest molecules to the first organisms was created by that same simple process: Unstable things just kept shifting around until they became stable.** In fact, that could be seen as the first type of natural selection: Nature continually rejecting unstable forms until stable ones emerged.

#### From Replicator Molecule to Man

At some point in the very, _very_ distant past, a molecule that had the ability to replicate itself happened to form. It’s extremely unlikely for such a “replicator” molecule to appear but, when dealing with timeframes of hundreds of millions of years, what humans would consider unlikely is almost bound to happen at some point.

With its only competition being molecules created from atoms that happened to bump together in the right ways, this replicator molecule would have spread extremely quickly (relatively speaking) through the primordial soup of the time. Eventually, though, all the materials that make that molecule would have been used up, which would seem to leave us stuck in a sea of identical molecules with nowhere to go from there.

The reason that didn’t happen is that **replication isn’t perfect.** Small mistakes can happen. Then, when imperfect copies are made from other imperfect copies, the mistakes add up until you have something completely different from the original. With the massive amounts of time involved in Earth’s early history, it was almost inevitable that such mistakes would happen and build on top of each other.

**Some of these molecules were more “successful” than others—that is, they lasted longer, or replicated more quickly or more accurately.** The more successful molecules would naturally start to outnumber the less successful ones.

Since there was not an infinite amount of material to create new molecules, eventually they would have started competing for it. Molecules that were better able to replicate themselves, or prevent competitors from replicating themselves, would become more numerous while those that were out-competed would decline. This would have been the first instance of competition and evolution.

The mechanisms that these molecules created (still purely by chance) became more and more complex as new changes built on top of previous successes. In fact, this was likely how the first cells formed: Some molecules created protective shells of protein around themselves, which continued to grow bigger and more elaborate as time went on. By this point, the molecules that could continue to exist and replicate were the ones that created complex mechanisms—relatively speaking—to protect themselves.

Now, billions of years later, those first replicators have evolved into every form of life we know today. Consider this: **A human is nothing but a highly complex and stable survival mechanism for those ancient replicator molecules.**
