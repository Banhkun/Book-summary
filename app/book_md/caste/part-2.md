## Part 2: Caste Tenets | Chapter 3: Justifying the Creation of a Caste System

Each of the three examples of caste systems we explored in Part 1 represents a belief system, and every belief system is governed by a set of tenets. **For caste systems, Wilkerson believes there are eight tenets that uphold the structure and allow for unquestionable participation by the related societies.** The tenets are:

  * Laws of divinity
  * Ingrained superiority
  * Dehumanization at the group level
  * Heritage
  * Laws of love
  * The purity of the dominant caste
  * Division of labor
  * Terror and violence



As each tenet is repeated and supported by attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, it becomes rooted in civilization. Wilkerson argues that once all of these eight beliefs are ingrained, they become the standard mode of life in the form of social hierarchies.

(Shortform note: Not all definitions of caste agree that all eight of these tenets are needed for a caste system to form. For instance, the Encyclopedia Britannica defines caste systems as “ranked, hereditary, endogamous social groups, often linked with occupation.” This definition encompasses only the second, third, fifth, and eighth of Wilkerson’s eight tenets. It’s possible that this definition is more limited because it focuses more specifically on the Indian caste system whereas Wilkerson seeks to define caste systems more generally.)

In Part 2, we’ll explore these eight tenets in more detail. In this chapter, we’ll explore the two tenets that were used to justify the creation of a caste system: laws of divinity and ingrained superiority.

### Laws of Divinity

According to the author, the first tenet involves divine intervention. When a belief system is said to be the will of God, it becomes nearly impossible to argue against the legitimacy of its claims. (Shortform note: Avatthi Ramaiah, an Indian sociologist, agrees with Wilkerson’s argument that divine justification upholds the caste system. He argues, “As long as Hinduism is strong, caste will be strong, and as long as there is caste, there will be lower caste.”)

The will of an all-knowing spiritual power is at the heart of both the Indian and American castes. Let’s explore each system in detail.

#### Divine Justification for the Indian Caste System

In India, this divine justification for the caste system comes from Hinduism. As Wilkerson describes, ancient Hindu scriptures contain an account of the creation of the universe. The story involves a god who took the form of a man named Brahma and set out to create the world. From his mouth, he created the Brahmin; from his arms, the Kshatriya; from his thighs, the Vaishya; and from his feet, the Shudra.

According to Wilkerson, **the part of the body from which they were created determined their status and role in society.** The Shudra, who were made from Brahma’s feet (the lowest body part) would be the lowest form of civilized man and work as servants; the Brahmin, on the other extreme, came from Brahma’s head and were therefore the highest caste. A fifth caste was too shameful to be made from Brahma’s body—they were the reincarnation of all the bad karma of the past. This group was not to be looked at or touched, hence, they became the Untouchables.

(Shortform note: This description of the caste system comes from a sacred Hindu text called the Rig Veda. Some scholars believe this verse wasn’t originally part of the Rig Veda and was inserted later on in order to justify the existing caste system. If that’s true, the story serves as a religious justification of the caste system but did not originally inspire it, undermining Wilkerson’s argument. Furthermore, even if the Rig Veda _did_ originally include caste justifications, scholars have pointed out that other Hindu holy texts contain contradictory accounts of the creation of the different castes. In general, contrary to Wilkerson’s assertion that divine texts created India’s current caste system, many scholars believe the passages in those texts carried little weight until British invaders hijacked them as a way to separate and control the Indian population.)

#### Divine Justification for the American Caste System

Just like Hindu scriptures, Wilkerson asserts, the Old Testament of the Bible contains a story that has historically been used to justify a caste system. One day, Noah (of ark-building fame) became inebriated on wine from his vineyard and passed out nude in his tent. One of his sons, Ham, entered the tent and saw his father exposed. When Noah heard that Ham had seen his naked body, he cursed Ham’s son, Canaan, and all of his descendants to a life of servitude. (Shortform note: While Wilkerson’s telling reflects the canonical version of the story, some scholars argue that Ham’s sin wasn’t just seeing his father naked—he sexually assaulted Noah as he slept. This would explain why the punishment was so severe for a seemingly minor crime.)

According to Wilkerson, as this story was passed down over generations, it grew to include a description of Ham as dark-skinned. Therefore, she argues, those with light skin viewed all dark-skinned people as descendants of Ham and, thus, rightfully destined for a life of indentured servitude. The Europeans used this story to justify their colonization and enslavement of the African people.

(Shortform note: In _Stamped From the Beginning_ , Ibram X. Kendi argues that early enslavers _didn’t_ buy into the “curse theory” because they also enslaved non-Black people. However, by the 1500s, more enslavers turned to the Curse of Ham as a way to explain differences in skin color and justify enslaving more native Africans. Kendi calls these later enslavers “the first known segregationists” because they believed African people were fundamentally inferior to white people.)

> **The Nazi Party Had No Need for Divine Justification**
> 
> In her introduction to the Eight Tenets of Caste, Wilkerson argues that these eight tenets underlie _all three_ caste systems she studied—however, she makes no mention of Nazi Germany in this section.
> 
> Why does she omit this system? It could be because the Nazis’ approach to religion was complex and doesn’t fit neatly into Wilkerson’s model of divine justification for caste. Officially, the Nazi Party endorsed “Positive Christianity,” a blend of Nazi antisemitic values and traditional Christianity (today, Positive Christianity is not recognized as a legitimate sect by any major Christian churches). Some Nazi leaders also argued that Jesus was not Jewish and that his original mission was to promote Aryan values.
> 
> However, official party documents clarified that loyalty to the party itself should supersede any religious ties. Thus, while Nazi leaders may have used religious language to win over the mostly Christian population of Germany at the time, they didn’t actively promote a divine justification of the new caste system. In other words, religion didn’t inspire the Nazis’ racism because racism _was_ their religion.

### Ingrained Superiority

Another way societies have historically justified caste systems is through a belief in ingrained superiority. According to the author, **no caste system could survive without the collective belief in the unequivocal superiority of one caste over another.** This belief was and is still at the heart of every interaction between the dominant caste and subordinate caste in America.

Wilkerson argues that all of the other tenets of caste culminate in this superior mindset. She believes each person must clearly understand the innate inferiority of the subordinate caste spiritually, physically, and mentally to legitimize the unhindered, blatant subjugation of them. **One caste must be seen as deserving of the good life, and the other must be seen as subhuman and deserving of the ills they’re forced to live with.**

(Shortform note: How do people in the upper caste uphold this sense of ingrained superiority? Robin DiAngelo argues it’s through what she calls “the ideology of individualism.” In _White Fragility_ , she claims that white people reassure themselves of their own superiority by telling themselves that all their successes were earned through hard work, and that people who are less successful just haven’t worked as hard. White people who embrace this ideology conclude that they must simply be naturally superior to people of color, ignoring the fact that people of color face barriers to success that white people don’t (such as racial prejudice and economic inequalities).)

#### Enforcing a Superior Ideology

Wilkerson describes how the dominant castes in India, Nazi Germany, and America created laws and protocols that highlighted the roles of the subordinate caste. One very visible signifier of lower-caste inferiority was through clothing. The South Carolina Negro Code of 1735 decreed that slaves could only wear the cheapest and most uncomfortable fabrics available in the colonies. (Shortform note: Other scholars have clarified that “field slaves” were forced to wear the roughest clothing, while “house slaves” who served the enslaver’s family directly were afforded better clothing.) In one part of India, lower-caste people weren’t allowed to wear upper-body clothing at all—instead, both men and women were expected to bare their chests as a sign of respect to the upper caste. In Nazi Germany, Jewish prisoners who arrived at the concentration camps wearing fine clothing were subjected to uniquely horrific punishments.

(Shortform note: Why has clothing been used so successfully as a status symbol and status enforcer in many cultures throughout history? One American study found that people are less likely to physically intrude on the personal space of someone wearing high-status clothing. Therefore, forcing people in the lowest caste to wear poor-quality clothing is a very effective way to bolster a sense of upper-caste superiority.)
