## Chapter 8: The Health Effects of Caste

In addition to causing social disruption, Wilkerson argues that the American caste system negatively impacts the health of lower _and_ upper-caste Americans. In this section, we’ll learn more about these negative health outcomes and how the psychology of caste contributes to them.

### Physical Manifestations of Caste Mentalities

According to the author, the caste system damages the health of the lowest caste because**the psychological strain of constantly navigating prejudice and discrimination damages the body.** The body produces higher levels of cortisol, the stress hormone released in response to a crisis, when danger is perceived, and consistent high levels of cortisol damage muscle tissue and the circulatory and digestive systems. Fear also restricts blood flow to the heart. The result is poor heart and immune system functioning, leading to a number of deadly diseases.

However, according to Wilkerson, prejudice doesn’t just damage the bodies of the receivers. Studies show it has similar damaging effects on the perpetrator. Harboring negative emotions or hate also increases blood pressure and releases cortisol. One study found that even simple negative interactions created massive responses in the body. A group of prejudiced white Americans had the same physiological threat responses when forced to interact with a minority as those recorded during combat or car accidents.

> **White People Can Escape the Negative Health Effects of Caste, but Black People Can’t**
> 
> While the caste system negatively impacts the health of all Americans, white people face a lesser burden than Black people. The same study that found that highly-prejudiced white people experienced higher levels of cortisol in interracial interactions also found a caveat: After a few weeks of practice with building interracial friendships, the white participants’ cortisol levels reduced significantly.
> 
> For Black Americans, on the other hand, the negative health effects of caste are often inescapable because discrimination is inescapable. A 2019 review of scientific studies of discrimination found that only 9% of Black participants reported that they’d “never” been the target of racial prejudice or discrimination. The same study reported that 60% of Black participants had experienced unfair treatment from the police and 57% did not receive equal pay or promotions at work compared to their white colleagues.
> 
> As Wilkerson describes, this widespread discrimination subjects Black people to floods of stress hormones like cortisol. Research shows that experiencing discrimination frequently is associated with elevated levels of cortisol all the time, even in calm moments when discrimination isn’t happening. Over time, elevated cortisol can have negative impacts beyond what Wilkerson describes. According to the Mayo Clinic, overexposure to cortisol can also lead to anxiety, depression, weight gain, sleep problems, digestive problems, and impaired memory.

### The Dangers of Collective Narcissism

In Wilkerson’s view, these negative health outcomes are partly due to the different group mindsets that the caste system demands of the upper and lower caste. For the dominant caste, that mindset is collective narcissism. Narcissism describes the way in which one inflates their sense of self and entitlement to suppress deep-seated insecurities. **In a caste system, the dominant caste embodies collective narcissism by establishing themselves as the standard of beauty and their way of life the standard of normalcy.**

(Shortform note: Wilkerson doesn’t fully define collective narcissism. Narcissism can happen at the individual level (“I’m the best”) or the collective level (“My group is the best”). Research shows that, while individual narcissism can sometimes __ lead to collective narcissism, that doesn’t always happen. In fact, the opposite can also happen: People can develop collective narcissism as a strategy to compensate for low individual self-esteem.)

According to the author, few people can get over this narcissism enough to view the world from another’s perspective. Awareness requires effort, and when your group defines the standard of life, that effort feels unnecessary. (Shortform note: As Wilkerson argues, this inability to see the world from another’s perspective has dangerous consequences. Studies show that there is an “empathy gap” between people of different races. To overcome this gap, white people need to do two things: critically examine the implicit biases they hold about Black people as a whole, and actively try to empathize with individual Black people in their lives.)

Furthermore, when individuals can frame their lives as a representation of the “proper” functioning of a nation, their identities become the national identity, and they lose the distinction between their survival and the nation’s survival. Wilkerson argues that **equating individual survival with national survival creates a fascist political system, which leads to extreme racialism.** (Shortform note: Science backs up Wilkerson’s conclusion. A 2020 article found that collective narcissism predicts support for national populist regimes, which can sometimes develop into outright fascism.)

### The Appeasement of White Guilt

The author argues that, in order to survive the collective narcissism of the dominant caste, members of the subordinate caste must learn and internalize the dominant caste’s expectations, standards, and codes and adjust their behavior accordingly. **Adjusting behaviors is second nature for people living on the margins of society.** Their extreme powers of perception must function at all times so they can navigate life without repercussions.

(Shortform note: Adjusting behavior like this is called “code-switching.” For Black Americans, code-switching frequently involves changing how they speak, express emotions, or greet other people in order to avoid negative stereotypes. Unfortunately, code-switching requires constant vigilance, which can negatively impact work performance and contribute to burnout.)

According to Wilkerson, the biggest adjustment expected from the subordinate caste is to provide forgiveness to dominant members for their infractions against them. The subordinate caste is expected to rise above their trauma and anger and absolve the dominant caste for their actions, thereby absolving them of the sins of the past (including slavery, police killings, and racial terrorism).**** Through this blanket absolution, the white community can skew reality to disguise the violent and oppressive nature of their actions.

(Shortform note: Journalist Stacey Patton argues that Black Americans are the only ones who bear this burden of expected forgiveness. Patton points out that “After 9/11, there was no talk about forgiving al-Qaeda, Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden.” In other words, when white Americans experience trauma (or when Americans of all races face terrorism that isn’t related to anti-Black bias), they don’t face the same expectation to immediately forgive the persecutor.)
