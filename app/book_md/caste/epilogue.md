## Epilogue: A Shift Away From Caste

According to Wilkerson, the only way to dismantle caste in society is for each of us to open our minds and hearts enough to see how we’ve been manipulated into division. That’s because **our actions and thoughts feed the machine of hate and prejudice based on superficial physical traits.**

Wilkerson argues that no one chooses to be born into one caste or another, but we do choose whether to abide by the confines those castes dictate. A person born into the dominant caste can choose to uplift others in the subordinate caste. A person born into the subordinate caste can choose to break the barriers around them.

> **Dismantling Caste: Mindsets, Policies, or Both?**
> 
> Other scholars disagree with Wilkerson’s conclusion that individual actions and mindsets are the driving force behind the caste system. For instance, in _How to Be an Antiracist, _Ibram X. Kendi argues that it’s impossible to dismantle American racism by ignoring policy and focusing on individual mindsets. Kendi believes we should focus on changing racist policies _first_ rather than trying to educate people out of racist mindsets and hoping for downstream change.
> 
> There is a middle ground between these perspectives. In _So You Want to Talk About Race_ , Ijeoma Oluo strikes a balance between Wilkerson’s focus on mindset and Kendi’s focus on policy. She lays out strategies for individuals to make policy changes (such as voting for antiracist candidates and supporting affirmative action policies) _and develop an antiracist mindset_ by engaging with art and music from Black artists.

### Toward Radical Empathy

Wilkerson reminds us that the subordinate caste is not responsible for constructing the caste system; therefore, they are not responsible for dismantling it. Instead, people in the dominant caste must take responsibility for the system and use their privilege to dismantle it. (Shortform note: In _White Fragility_ , Robin DiAngelo also argues that the first step to dismantling the caste system is for white people to acknowledge the way they benefit from the current system. She goes further by saying that while acknowledging privilege can be uncomfortable, white people should lean into that discomfort and remember that it pales in comparison to the pain that experiencing racism causes.)

In Wilkerson’s view, dismantling caste once and for all requires _radical_ empathy, which is more than just imagining what it’s like to walk in another’s shoes. **Radical empathy is the active choice to educate ourselves about others’ experiences by listening to the personal accounts of those we don’t understand.** We must acknowledge that our understanding of another’s life is shallow and only those living the experience have the right to qualify its effect on their lives. We can imagine what it would be like to have one arm, but we cannot tell someone with one arm how they should feel about their challenges.

> **Six Steps to Develop Radical Empathy**
> 
> Wilkerson calls for radical empathy, but what does that look like in practice? Terri E. Givens, author of _Radical Empathy_ , lays out six steps on the path to radical empathy:
> 
>   * Be willing to be vulnerable.
> 
>   * Become grounded in your own identity.
> 
>   * Open yourself to the experiences of others.
> 
>   * Practice empathy.
> 
>   * Take action.
> 
>   * Create change and build trust.
> 
> 

> 
> Givens emphasizes that these steps don’t often happen on their own—they take deliberate, consistent practice. If you belong to the dominant caste, you can practice these steps yourself the next time you interact with someone from a lower caste: Start by being vulnerable, challenge yourself to truly listen to and believe their experiences, and take concrete actions to help improve the situation.
> 
> This may not be easy—as Robin DiAngelo describes in _White Fragility_ , white people often respond to people of color’s descriptions of racism with hostility or denial because they perceive them as a personal attack rather than an opportunity to learn and grow. If you find yourself getting uncomfortable, remember that the caste system has cost millions of people their lives—dismantling it is crucial and worth a little discomfort to achieve.
