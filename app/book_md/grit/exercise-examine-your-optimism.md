## Exercise: Examine Your Optimism

Duckworth explains that optimists tend to attribute their suffering to temporary and specific causes, while pessimists blame permanent and broad causes. These differing interpretations of the same challenges or setbacks can have significant effects on a personâ€™s motivation.

* * *

Think back to a recent setback you endured, either professionally or personally.

With what thoughts did you respond to that setback? Did you get discouraged and feel like the setback was a permanent loss? Or did you think through the specific reasons for the setback so that you could understand what brought it about?

Whether you responded optimistically or pessimistically, was there a more effective way you could have approached the situation? Could you have sought to understand it better, or could you have responded more rationally?

How might you respond to a similar situation in the future?
