## Part 1.3: Grit Is Malleable

Duckworth then turns her attention to the plasticity of grit. One of her central arguments is that grit is not static, but rather, a person can develop it.

She acknowledges that genetics influence traits like talent, intelligence, and grit, but she contends that they can also be shaped by the environment. She concludes, then, that they can change as environmental influences change. She further argues that grit can be consciously, purposefully changed, and also that it can be taught.

> **How Malleable Is Grit?**
> 
> Ever since Duckworth’s book, psychologists have debated if grit actually is changeable.
> 
> Some argue that long-recognized personality traits, like extroversion, openness, and conscientiousness, are fixed—they’re determined by biological factors and resistant to environmental influences. Psychologists on this side of the debate argue that grit can also be considered a personality trait, and that therefore, it’s determined largely by biological factors and isn’t malleable. Many base these conclusions on research that found that adoptive parents seem to have a smaller influence on their child’s personality than do genetics, indicating the strength of nature over nurture.
> 
> However, there is some evidence that grit can, indeed, be taught. In one study, researchers split seventh graders into two groups and asked them each to write an essay at four points during the school year. One group was asked to write about values. The other was asked to write about _how those values affected their lives_. The group that had to reflect on how the values affected them—essentially, to observe how their thoughts could influence their actions—went on to earn higher grade-point averages than the other group. Notably, the effect persisted for years.
> 
> The debate matters, because those who believe that _grit is changeable_ have encouraged schools around the world to design curricula to teach it and even tests to evaluate it. This indicates support of Duckworth’s contention that grit can be purposefully developed, and suggests that the mechanism to do so might be by framing people’s outlook on life and on effort.

### Genetic Traits Can Change

Duckworth points out that even traits that are typically thought of as being entirely influenced by genetics, such as height or intelligence, have been shown to be somewhat influenced by environmental factors.

  * The average male height increased from 5 feet 5 inches in 1850 to 5 feet 10 inches today.
  * The average IQ has increased greatly: Measured against modern norms, people who lived 100 years ago had an average IQ of 70, while measured against their norms, the average IQ today is around 130.



Human genetics don’t change rapidly, so when a trait like intelligence or height changes rapidly in a population over time, the most likely causes are environmental—for example, better nutrition, better overall health, and better education. The fact that even these somewhat “sticky” traits have changed in response to environmental influences suggests that traits that are more skill-based, like talent and grit, are even more responsive to environmental factors.

> **How Accurately Do IQ Scores Measure Change in Intelligence?**
> 
> There is some debate about how accurate the increases in IQ scores are, and whether they show actual increases in intelligence over time.
> 
> The theory that Duckworth references in her book, the Flynn Effect, has measured a steady rise in IQ levels in many countries. However, some psychologists argue that rising IQ scores can’t be an accurate reflection of an equal increase in intelligence. They point out that scores are estimated to have been near 70 a century ago, which would put the average person at an almost disabled level of intelligence—an unlikely scenario. It’s probable instead that there is more to intelligence than IQ scores alone.
> 
> Some argue that IQ scores merely reveal an increased ability to take tests, and that they’ve improved as education has increased in length and quality, leading people to become acclimated to test-taking. Others argue that rising IQ scores correlate to rising literacy rates, not absolute intelligence.
> 
> Regardless, experts generally agree that whether or not IQ is a _strict_ reflection of intelligence, the dramatic increase in scores indicates at least some improvement in intelligence. The greatest increases have been at the lower end of the scale, so that groups that once tested with low scores are now testing higher, while groups that used to test high are still testing at that same level. This suggests that many of the gains are due to things like better nutrition and better education (environmental factors) that were not accessible to lower-scoring groups in the past but now increasingly are.

### Talent Can Change

Duckworth notes the long-observed fact that many talent-based traits have changed over time, some significantly. For example, athletes continue to set and break records for increased speed or achievement.

She argues that this is due to the _social multiplier effect_ , which holds that people improve their skills as they learn from other people, leading to a higher level of average skill in the overall population. She suggests that the advent of television has helped to increase this effect, as athletes can easily see what other athletes are doing and learn from them.

(Shortform note: The dramatic increase in swimming speeds among professional athletes illustrates this effect. Because swimming strokes are complex, there’s a lot to learn, and swimmers who learn more can improve more. Over the years, the collective knowledge of the mechanics of the sport has increased and built upon itself so that today, swimmers have a deeper understanding of what propels them faster through the water. Thus, since they’ve crafted and honed new techniques over the years, they’ve collectively improved. Technology has helped, too—specialized swimsuits and goggles, for example—but even accounting for technological changes, swim times have steadily improved.)

### Grit Changes Over Time

Duckworth writes that behavioral traits can change not only in general populations throughout history, but also in individual lives, over the course of years. She notes that studies show higher levels of grit in older populations than in younger populations, as shown by this graph:

![grit_change.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/grit_change.png)

She notes there might be several possible explanations for this:

  * Older people might have endured more hardship throughout their lives (e.g. by surviving through World War II and the Cold War) and have developed more grit in response.
  * Maturation could be genetically programmed—evolutionarily, grit may not be as beneficial in early years when seeking mates, and it may be more helpful later when caring for a family.
  * Maturation might happen naturally over time as people learn that grit is a successful strategy for accomplishing goals, and that the opposite—quitting plans, shifting goals, starting over—leads to failure and is unsatisfying. 
  * Life experiences—like getting a job, having children, or caring for parents—require us to mature and adopt more grit.



Because we don’t have longitudinal studies of grit, we can’t distinguish between these explanations, but the third is Duckworth’s favorite. Anecdotally, people change when new expectations are thrust upon them—imagine the teen who sleeps in daily, but then enlists in the military and is punished for waking up past 6 a.m. In this way, Duckworth firmly believes that **grit can be grown.**

> **Social Expectations Can Affect Personality**
> 
> Duckworth’s argument that people develop grit as they age because they grow into roles that require it aligns with the _social investment_ _theory_ of personality. This theory holds that personalities can change when people are thrust into new social roles that lead to new expectations and responsibilities.
> 
> A famous example demonstrating this theory was the Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971 that placed 24 male college students in the role of either prison guard or prisoner and then observed their behavior. Although the participants came from similar backgrounds and had similar personality profiles (based on maturity and lack of antisocial tendencies), by the end of the six-day experiment, they were behaving very differently depending on which role they’d been assigned. Those in the role of prison guard acted cruelly and those in the role of prisoner acted subserviently.
> 
> While many observers have critiqued the study for its ethical breaches and questionable applicability to real-world situations, the study does strongly suggest that personality is determined by more than mere genetics, aligning with Duckworth’s argument that grit can be influenced by a person’s role and stage in life.
> 
> In a less extreme example of how grit responds to social roles, Meg Jay discusses the importance of having purpose, vision, and consistency in your twenties in her book _The Defining Decade_. Like Duckworth, Jay notes that in your twenties, flitting between careers is common, and she proposes that this is because it’s culturally accepted and even encouraged, as young adults are bombarded by messages from the media, friends, and even family that they should enjoy their twenties as a “second childhood.”
> 
> Jay advises you to ignore these messages, and instead to place yourself in the role of a more mature, forward-thinking person, because if you don’t build the foundation for a career in your twenties, you’ll be playing catch-up in your thirties against people who started working toward their long-term goals earlier.
> 
> Jay never mentions grit or Duckworth’s theories, but her book is an exploration of the real-world application of grit and how consistency (or, in Duckworth’s words, _passion_) can affect the trajectory of your life depending on how early you adopt it. Her advice aligns with Duckworth’s that grit is changeable and is something you can consciously choose to adopt.
