## Exercise: Make Practice a Habit

To get the most benefit from deliberate practice, Duckworth advises that you make deliberate practice a regular habit. To make developing the habit easier, find an environment in which you most enjoy deliberate practice.

* * *

Think of a skill that you are either currently mastering or have considered taking up. This might be something in your professional life (a software program, for example) or it might be something in your personal life (like learning the piano).

In what environment do you enjoy (or would you enjoy) practicing that skill? What environment—place or time—do you associate with that skill?

How can you use that environment as a trigger to help you make a habit of practicing that skill?
