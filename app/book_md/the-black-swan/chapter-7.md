## Chapter 7: What to Do When You Can’t Predict

If we are surrounded by randomness and unpredictability, if our well-being is radically uncertain, what—besides despair—are our options?

#### 1) Don’t Sweat the Small Predictions

It bears repeating that humans’ ability to predict in the short-term is unique among animal species and quite possibly the reason we’ve survived and thrived as long as we have. **To predict is human**.

So, when it comes to low-stakes, everyday predictions—about the weather, say, or the outcome of a baseball game—there’s no harm in indulging our natural penchant for prediction: If we’re wrong, the repercussions are minimal. It’s when we make large-scale predictions and incur real risk on their basis that we get into trouble.

#### 2) Maximize Possibilities for Positive Black Swans

Although the most memorable Black Swans are typically the negatively disruptive ones, **Black Swans can also be serendipitous**. (Shortform note: Love at first sight is undoubtedly a Black Swan.)

Taleb advocates (1) sociability and (2) proactiveness when presented with an opportunity as strategies for opening ourselves up to positive Black Swans. Sociability puts us in the company of others who may be in a position to help us—we never know where a casual conversation might lead. And proactiveness—taking up a successful acquaintance on an invitation to have coffee, for example—ensures we’ll never miss our lucky break.

#### 3) Adopt the “Barbell Strategy”

When Taleb was a trader, he pursued an idiosyncratic investment strategy to inoculate himself against a financial Black Swan. He devoted 85%–90% of his portfolio to extremely safe instruments (Treasury bills, for example) and made extremely risky bets—in venture-capital portfolios, for example—with the remaining 10%–15%. (Another variation on the strategy is to have a highly speculative portfolio but to insure yourself against losses greater than 15%.) The high-risk portion of Taleb’s portfolio was highly diversified: **He wanted to place as many small bets as possible to increase the odds of a Black Swan paying off in his favor**.

The “barbell strategy” is designed to minimize the pain of a negative Black Swan while, potentially, reaping a positive Black Swan’s benefits. If the market collapses, a person pursuing this strategy isn’t hurt beneath the “floor” of the safe investments (say, 85%), but if the market explodes, he has a chance to capitalize by virtue of the speculative bets.

(Shortform note: There is, of course, the possibility that a Black Swan will affect even the safest investment—in fact, if we take Taleb at his word, _there is no such thing_ as a safe investment.)

#### 4) Distinguish Between Positive Contingencies and Negative Ones

Different areas of society have different exposure to Black Swans, both positive and negative.

For example, scientific research and moviemaking are “positive Black Swan areas”—catastrophes are rare, and there is always the possibility of smashing success. The stock market or catastrophe insurance, meanwhile, are “negative Black Swan areas”—upsides are relatively modest compared to the possibility of financial ruin.

It’s important to note that the history of a negative–Black Swan area will underrepresent the possibility of catastrophe. An obvious example is financial markets, which always appear stable until they crash. Positive–Black Swan areas, oppositely, will underrepresent the possibility of serendipity: Despite years of research, a cure for cancer hasn’t been found; but one _could_ be found any day.

Suffice it to say, **we should take more risks in a positive Black Swan area than in a negative Black Swan one**.

#### 5) Prepare, Don’t Predict

Because Black Swans are, by definition, unpredictable, **we’re better off _preparing_ for the widest range of contingencies than _predicting_ specific events**.

That’s because, though Black Swans themselves can never be predicted, their _effects_ can be. For example, no one can predict when an earthquake will strike, but one can know what its effects will be and prepare adequately to handle them.

The same goes for an economic recession. No one can predict precisely when one will occur, but, using the “barbell strategy” or some other means of mitigating risk, we can at least be prepared for one.

### The Side-Effects of a Black Swan Obsession

Taleb’s preoccupation with Black Swans—and his fellow humans’ persistence in discounting them—has caused him to develop a contrary personality: where others see safety and stability, he sees risk and the potential for catastrophe; where others see volatility, he sees opportunity.

Taleb’s guiding principle is simple: **He maximizes his exposure to positive Black Swans in all aspects of his life—socially, financially, aesthetically—and minimizes exposure to negative ones.**

In terms of investing, this means remaining highly skeptical of “safe” bets—blue-chip stocks, a perpetually rising stock market—and optimistic about speculative bets like venture capital. Because the speculative bets are transparently risky, Taleb knows to limit his exposure. The risks with “safe” investments, however, are hidden and therefore more worrisome.
