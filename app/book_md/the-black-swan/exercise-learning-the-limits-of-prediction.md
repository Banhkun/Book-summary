## Exercise: Learning the Limits of Prediction

Think like Taleb about prediction and the limits of your ability to predict things.

* * *

Write down a prediction you recently made, whether it was about a baseball game, the economy, an election, or other event.

Now explore _why_ you made that particular prediction. What was your reasoning? What variables did you factor in?

Revisit your answer just above in light of Taleb’s assertions. Did you rely on inductive reasoning? On the advice of an expert? On something you read or heard? Explain how you _developed_ your reasoning.

In the space below, explore the possible gaps in your reasoning. What might you have left out? Was there another side of the story (“silent evidence”) you didn’t consider?
