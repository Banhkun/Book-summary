## Exercise: Responding to Randomness

Explore what it means to be an “empirical skeptic.”

* * *

Write down something that happened to you recently, good or bad, that was out of the ordinary.

How did you respond to this event? Write down what you thought about it at the time.

Now, analyze your response to the event using Taleb’s categories. Did you try to wrap a narrative around something that was truly random (“The Narrative Fallacy”)? Did you treat what happened as a particular instance of a more general rule (Confirmation Bias, or “The Distortion of Silent Evidence”)? Did you focus more on what happened than what _could have happened_(a consequence of “tunneling”)? Explain why or why not.
