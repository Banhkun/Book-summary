## Exercise: Maximizing Positive Black Swans

Think about how you can use randomness to your advantage.

* * *

Write down an area of your life where you think you could use improvement and why.

Brainstorm some positive Black Swans that could accelerate this improvement (remember that positive Black Swans are serendipitous moments that have a positive impact on your life). For example, if the area you chose was “romance,” a positive Black Swan could be “finding a life partner.”

Now brainstorm some ways you might increase the probability of these Black Swans occurring. For example, if your positive Black Swan was “finding a life partner,” you might list “go to more parties” or “sign up for a class.”
