## Exercise: The Barbell Strategy

A barbell strategy devotes the majority of resources to safe options, and a minority to highly risky options that can pay off big. How can you integrate this into your life?

* * *

Write down a goal you’ve recently set for yourself, whether in your personal or professional life.

How do you plan to achieve that goal? Explore your current strategies for making that goal a reality.

Now, in the box below, explore how you might use Taleb’s barbell strategy to achieve your goal. For example, if your goal is to secure a raise, you might devote 90% of your efforts to a safe bet (like improving your performance in your current role) and 10% to a riskier strategy (like taking on additional responsibilities).
