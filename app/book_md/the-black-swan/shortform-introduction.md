## Shortform Introduction

In his April 2007 review of _The Black Swan_ in the _New York Times_ , Gregg Easterbrook, riffing on the author’s skepticism about forecasts of any kind, noted, “At the beginning of 2006, the _Wall Street Journal_ forecast a bad year for stocks; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16% that year. (Disturbingly, the _Journal_ has forecast a good year for 2007.)” Mere months later, the world economy would be in a tailspin—and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who in _The Black Swan_ warned that the global financial system was vulnerable to collapse, would be treated as a seer.

_The Black Swan_ covers a broad range of topics and is organized in a somewhat unbalanced way. The first two parts of the book contain its core ideas, moving from (1) the ways we domesticate randomness to (2) the reasons why prediction is impossible to (3) humans’ best options when it comes to uncertainty. (Chapters 1–7 of the summary correspond to these topics.) The third part of the book, meanwhile, is framed as an add-on to the first two parts for the more technically minded reader—it grounds many of the claims Taleb makes in the second part with examples from history and the social sciences. (This material can be found in our summary’s “Appendix.”) The fourth and final part, entitled “The End,” is very brief and functions more or less as a farewell to the reader.

Taleb’s knowledge is encyclopedic. Over the course of the text’s four parts, he discusses mathematics, economics, philosophy, statistics, psychology, political science, history, physics, and literature, among other topics, all with an eye to exposing our assumptions about the nature of randomness and our abilities to account for it.

This summary covers all of Taleb’s major claims as well as many of his real-world examples, but it doesn’t attempt to recreate his energetic prose or his sense of humor. For those readers who want to experience Taleb’s unique writing voice and personality, we urge you to turn to the book itself.
