## Chapters 2-3: How the Enemy Traps You: Self-Lies and Toxic Thoughts

Chapter 1 introduced the mind war that envelopes us all. Chapters 2 and 3 identify the enemy’s basic, interlinked attack strategies, exposing their nature and impact.

### Self-Lies and Their Deep Source

**Satan attacks your mind by convincing you to believe lies about yourself, which are rooted in a lie about God.**

Your self-lies resolve into **three general categories:**

  * “I’m helpless.”
  * “I’m worthless.”
  * “I’m unlovable.”



The fundamental lie about God that lurks behind your self-lies is **the unconscious belief that God’s love isn’t for you.__** The source of these lies is both spiritual and practical. As stated in Chapter 1, the ultimate source of all such lies is demonic. On the practical level, painful life experiences generate self-lies, which then become part of you when engraved in your brain through toxic thoughts.

### Toxic Thoughts and Their Toxic Effects

Toxic thoughts, arising from self-lies, have devastating effects on your life.

For one thing, **toxic thoughts shape your mind, emotions, and responses, creating their own alternate reality, a false mental state in which and from which distorted reasoning seems true.** They blind you to the real truth by trapping you in negative cycles that you build whole chunks of your life around.

For example:

  * A Christian may read of God’s love in the Bible and believe it’s true theoretically but not really _for them_ , so misery and dysfunction shape their identity in isolation from God’s love.
  * Someone with a spouse distracted by work may feel worthless and invisible, so they end up generating constant arguments, making their spouse an enemy, and losing joy and peace.



Allen has also experienced toxic thoughts that have had long-lasting effects on her life. For instance, she describes the diminishment, shame, and insecurity that she felt when a fellow student in her high school biology class called her dumb. She also describes the residual, lurking thought that her husband didn’t love her after their first fight as newlyweds.

#### A Demonic Attack and a Downward Spiral

The author’s most striking personal example is her account of a demonic attack that launched her into an 18-month dark night of the soul. It began when she told a women’s gathering that there’s a real spiritual enemy opposing them, served by demons, who wants to steal their faith and make them useless to God. During a break, a woman approached her with a dark expression and said, “We’re coming for you. Stop talking about us.” Allen told one of the security guards.

Partway through the author’s final talk, shrieking erupted in the hallway outside. She later learned it was both the strange woman and her daughter. Then the church’s power went out. It was the most undeniable manifestation of spiritual attack the author had ever seen.

Initially, she wasn’t terrified but on fire with faith. The day’s events overwhelmed her with their confirmation of the reality of God, Satan, and spiritual warfare. That night she told everybody she ran into about Jesus.

But immediately afterward, a downward spiral caught her off-guard. Starting that night, she woke up regularly every day at 3 a.m. in a panic, wondering about the laundry, her kids’ safety, and other things. **This anxiety rapidly progressed to bigger fears about whether she was wasting her life serving a God who might not exist.**

She remained outwardly faithful and productive, but inside she felt caught up in a war for her mind. When she tried to lean into her lifelong relationship with God, she found her very passion for God eroding under the weight of her toxic thought-spiral. She felt as if her life were crumbling to ash and blowing away like the characters in _Avengers: Infinity Wars_. She feared she and her life’s work would all vanish and be meaningless because if there’s no God, then nothing matters, and when you die, it’s the end.

She later realized that the whole crisis was an attack by the enemy, but in the midst of it, she couldn’t see that.
