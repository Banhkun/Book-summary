## Chapter 14: The Battle Against Complacency

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to battle an enemy that tries to seduce you into a useless and ultimately soul-killing life of self-indulgence and mediocrity.

### Your Enemy and Your Weapon

**Your enemy in this chapter is complacency** ,**** a state of listless passivity in which you find comfort in mediocrity and the status quo while you indulge your own whims and feel your passion for God fade away.

Some typical thoughts associated with complacency include the following. Look for these in your own mind:

  * I have nothing to offer.
  * I deserve some “me time.”
  * Let someone else do it.



**Your weapon against complacency is _intentional service_** , a choice to work for the good of other people instead of fixating on your own comfort and contentment. Clearly, this relates to Chapter 12’s battle with self-importance, but the focus here is different. In the battle against complacency, the enemy isn’t self-inflation (although it’s related to it) but self-indulgence.

### The Lie: You’re Here to Do What You Want

**The enemy’s basic lie in this battle is that you’re free to live for yourself, to do whatever you want to do.** This lie comes out in thought patterns that say things such as:

  * What do I want and need?
  * What do I feel like doing? 
  * What will make me happier, more comfortable, more content?
  * What will make me look good and sound smart?



**Complacency becomes a dangerous addiction.** This relates back to a danger noted in Chapter 8’s battle against distraction: Spiritually, you’re never in “neutral gear.” You’re always moving one direction or the other. So if you’re not becoming holier, which takes effort (enabled by grace), then you’re automatically drifting toward wordliness, which becomes a self-reinforcing spiral. Allen’s own experience illustrates the point. During her spiritual crisis, she traded her passion to serve others for epic binges on Netflix, social media, sugar, and dark emotions. These distractions blunted her spiritual zeal even as she craved more of them.

### The Truth: You Weren’t Built to Live for Yourself

**The truth that overturns the lie of complacency is that God has saved you and set you free not to indulge yourself but to serve others, to elevate them over yourself and seek their good.**

  * A key scripture supporting this truth is Paul’s exhortation in Galatians 5: “You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.” 
  * Another is Paul’s exhortation in Philippians 2 to “do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to your own interests, but also to the interest of others. Have this mind among yourself, which is yours in Christ Jesus.”



#### Saved _From_ and Saved _For_

We all know that Jesus saves us from sin, but the truth we’re examining here tells us what we’re saved _for_. And it’s all about giving and serving: **He saved us, set us free, so that our lives can point others to the joy found in him.**

The Bible talks about this in various ways. In his parable of the wedding feast in Luke 12, Jesus calls us to be perpetually prepared for service. He also indicates the reward for this: Those who faithfully serve will end up _being_ _served_ by their master himself, who will meet their needs.

As the Genesis creation story clearly indicates, **God loves work**. The practical upshot is that **we are stewards of the work he gives us**. This work all involves serving others for his glory.

Our inbuilt purpose for service is also evident in the way our brains work. According to neuroscience, our brains thrive when we serve others and seek their good over our own. Service to others reduces stress-related and threat-related brain activity while also engaging the brain’s reward system, providing us with pleasure.

### The Strategy: Choose to Seek the Good of Others

**The way to defeat your enemy of complacency and its lie of self-indulgence is to choose others over yourself, to seek their good over your own comfort.** See Jesus’s words: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me” (Luke 9:23).

There are two primary ways to implement this strategy, one spiritual, the other practical.

#### Set Your Mind on Things Above

**The primary spiritual way you implement this strategy is to follow Paul’s exhortation in Colossians 3:2 to “set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.”** Go “all in” with God. Then you’ll be able to see life on earth correctly as your focus on eternal realities conforms your heart-mind to the truth that you’ve been “crucified with Christ” (Galatians 2:20) and now live this bodily life entirely through faith in Jesus, for the purpose of serving other people.

#### Surrender and Obey

**The primary practical way to implement this strategy is to _surrender_ and _obey_ at all times. **(Not incidentally, this is also God’s ultimate will for your life.) Surrender your whole life to God. Obey him where you are, in whatever circumstances he places you. Go where he says, do what he says, serve whom he brings. Concretely, surrender plus obedience might look like any number of activities. It could look like:

  * Waiting tables
  * Building spreadsheets
  * Standing against injustice
  * Comforting your distraught child
  * Cleaning up your messes or someone else’s
  * Writing thank-you notes
  * Encouraging a coworker
  * Absolutely any large or small daily action performed in surrender as an act of obedience and service



It is only by surrendering and obeying in the details of daily life that your gaze will shift and enable you to catch a vision of God’s greater plan.

#### The Ultimate Positive Spiral

**Choosing others over yourself sets in motion the ultimate positive, upward spiral:**

  * You choose to serve.
  * So you take risks for Jesus.
  * So you begin to see past yourself, to other people’s needs.
  * So you do things for God’s glory.
  * So you lean progressively more on his divine strength.
  * So you feel a deeper longing to worship him.
  * So your enhanced worship makes you want even more of God.
  * So you take more risks.
  * And so on.



Here’s a visual showing the negative spiral of complacency and how to reverse it by choosing others over yourself.
