## Part 3 | Chapters 15-16: Winning the War

In Part 1, you learned about the war for your mind and what it entails and involves. You learned about toxic thoughts spirals, mental strongholds, and the basic technique for escaping from these strongholds by replacing toxic thoughts with Godly ones. In Part 2, you learned how to engage in specific battles against specific mental enemies using specific weapons. Now let’s zoom out again to consider the entire war and learn the most important lesson of all: what we’re actually fighting for.

Winning the war for your mind requires following certain overarching principles that preside over the individual battles.

#### Victory in Jesus

**The first and most important of these principles is that Jesus himself illustrates the victory in each battle. The same Holy Spirit that empowered him empowers you.**

  * Because Jesus sought solitude away from the crowds with his Father, you, too, can choose stillness with God over distraction.
  * Because Jesus chose to live in community with others, you can do this, too.
  * Because Jesus trusted his Father, even to the point of death, you, too, can let go of fear and trust God.
  * Because Jesus knew all about the world’s brokenness and sin but never became a cynic, you, too, can reject cynicism and delight in God’s goodness.
  * Because Jesus emptied himself and became a servant, you, too, can choose humility.
  * Because Jesus conquered sin and death and made us “more than conquerors,” you can choose gratitude over victimhood.
  * Because Jesus didn’t abandon us but gave us the Holy Spirit, you can reject complacency and embrace intentional service.



#### Who You Are and Who God Is

**The second principle is to remember at all times who God really is, who you really are if you love and follow Jesus, and the stupendous implications of both**. Learn to draw on these truths, especially when you’re upset or destabilized. Pick from the plethora of biblical thoughts about who God is and who you are in him. Use the techniques and tools in this book to reprogram your mind with these thoughts. For example:

  * Revelation 22:13: I am the beginning and the end. I am the first, and I am the last.
  * 1 John 1:5: I am light; in me there is no darkness at all.
  * Jeremiah 1:5: Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.
  * 1 Corinthians 3:16: Do you not know that you are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?
  * **Bear in mind at all times the “secret weapon” of Christ’s pre-existing victory that you learned about in Part 2.** Fight each battle, and wage the whole war, from the confident knowledge of this.



#### Trust Your Training

**The third principle is to train yourself rigorously. Then, in the heat of battle, trust your training.** Practice the disciplines described in this book. They really work. Remember the author’s 3 a.m. panic attacks? After learning to mind her mind, she actually wrote most of this book between 3 and 5 a.m. At the very hour of the early morning when she formerly woke up in a panic during her spiritual dark night, she now experiences peace.

Use the strategies in this book. Fight the battles. Identify your areas of weakness and vulnerability, and reprogram your thoughts. Do the work of reshaping your heart-mind. Remember and take encouragement from the fact of your brain’s plasticity. Consider learning more about this so that you can better appreciate its encouraging implications, and also the dangers of allowing unchecked negative thought spirals.

For example: Inside your neurons are tiny structures called microtubules. They’re the neurological scaffolding for your thoughts, which lead them in a constant activity of building, deconstructing, and reshaping. It takes only _ten minutes_ for them to build new scaffolding in response to a thought. In other words, you can literally change your brain in minutes. With each positive or negative choice of thought, you both bring about and contribute momentum to positive or negative brain change.

Think of it this way: Your goal and calling is to be like an astronaut whose entire life is built around perpetual training for their next mission. Every day, week, month, and year revolves around a training schedule. The missions themselves are grueling and demanding. Blasting into space and staying there for extended periods is hard on the mind and body, and also on human relationships. Only those who believe deeply in the value of such work and are totally committed to it can last. And only the rigor of their training enables them to carry it out.

### Becoming Dangerous for Christ

This book has a double bottom line: Receive the mind of Christ. Then pass it on.

**First, you must learn to have a singular focus. Have your mind consumed entirely by the mind of Christ.** This is God’s desire for you. It’s also your escape route from self-imprisonment in perpetual misery. Think of Peter’s singular focus in Matthew 14 when Jesus invited him out of the boat during the storm on the lake. Peter successfully walked on water as long as he looked at Jesus, but when he lost focus and noticed the surrounding tumult, he sank.

**Second, this wonderful freedom of a sanctified mind isn’t meant for your private enjoyment. God sets us free in our minds so that we can transmit the same freedom to others. It’s a _contagious_ freedom.**

There’s actually scientific evidence that our minds are contagious. In a real sense, your thoughts shift reality for the whole human species. With your thoughts, you add either to the world’s sum total of kindness and compassion or to its sum total of negativity.

The capacity of a Christ-formed mind to broadcast God’s goodness and power to others, and to replicate its own divine freedom in their minds, is almost indescribably powerful. The father of one of the author’s friends is a good Christian man, but he has also suffers from a substance abuse problem. After a stint in rehab, he started leading Bible studies for other men in the program. This developed into a strongly supportive group of diverse men who share not just Bible studies but meals together. The mind of Christ was moving contagiously among them.

**You become _dangerous for Christ_ when you receive and share his mind.** By maintaining the Christ-centered focus described above in the middle of the enemy’s clamoring lies, you maintain your status as an effective soldier and servant of God. **You make yourself a conduit for his liberating grace, mercy, and peace—including peace of mind—to spread to other people.**
