## Part 2 | Chapter 7: Heading Into Battle

Part 1 introduced you to the war for your mind. It identified your enemy (Satan) and exposed his strategies (self-lies and toxic thoughts). It also taught you the basic strategy for escaping his mental strongholds. Part 2 builds on this by teaching you how to fight specific battles in this war.

Remember, the battleground is your mind, not individual problematic actions or habits. You are what you think (see Proverbs 23:7). Satan knows this and wants you to believe lies about God and yourself. What you need to do is to shift your mental focus from the flesh to the Spirit.

### The Awesome Power of Thought

**Every great and awful act in history and in our lives starts with a thought.** A single thought that honors God can change the course of history and eternity. A single uninterrupted lie in your mind can produce inconceivable havoc in the world.

Negative biblical examples of this truth in action include Eve’s sin in the garden (which began with Satan’s implanted thought that the fruit was good and beneficial) and David’s sin with Bathsheba (which began with lustful thoughts).

Positive biblical examples include Mary’s submission to God’s plan for using her to bring his Son into the world (her submission began with thoughts of obedience and faith) and Jesus’s choice to go to the cross (which was centered in his thought, “Not my will, Father, but yours”).

Because thoughts are so powerful, it’s important to learn how to become aware of your most commonly recurring toxic thought, to recognize that thought as the enemy’s attempt to imprison you and shut you off from God and other people, and to replace and reprogram that thought with God’s thoughts.

#### An Otherworldly Way of Life

**As a Christian, you belong to an entirely separate reality. You must learn to think like it.** This entails a shift away from the rampant consumerism, narcissism, and noise of contemporary culture toward transcendent peace, love, and truth.

This work isn’t about improving your outer circumstances. You’ll still encounter difficulties. **It’s about choosing to believe God loves us and is with us and for us even amid hellish circumstances**. It’s about experiencing peace and joy that transcend circumstances and come from the higher realm that you inhabit as a child of God.

### Your Mission

Part 2 of this book identifies seven enemies of our minds (all lies), names the truths that oppose them, and equips you with specific weapons and interrupting strategies (all derived from the master interrupting thought, “I have a choice”). It’s a course in retraining your mind.

Your mission is to learn to spot the enemy’s lies, recognize when and how they’ve trapped you, and fight effectively against them to achieve freedom in Christ.

#### Three Barriers to Victory

  * **The devil.** He tempts with evil and inflicts suffering—but deviously, disguising them with promises of success and pleasure.
  * **Your wounds.** The world is fallen and broken. The ubiquity of pain, misery, and dysfunction can keep you from noticing this fallenness in your own life and seeking healing.
  * **Your sin.** This is the most common barrier. Your own faulty daily choices accomplish the devil’s goals, rendering you passive and ultimately destroying you.



Surmounting these barriers and winning your battles requires a targeted strategy. That’s what the following chapters, combined with the general instructions in Part 1, all provide.

#### Your Secret Weapon

**Always remember and depend on this, because it’s your guarantee of victory: Because of Jesus’s sacrificial death, all your battles are already won.** You simply have to claim the victory and learn to fight from the knowledge and security of it at the start.
