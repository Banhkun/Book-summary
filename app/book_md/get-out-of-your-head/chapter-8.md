## Chapter 8: The Battle Against Distraction

The first battle we’ll study is foundational to fighting all the others. The weapon you’ll learn to use in this battle is the basis for all other interrupting strategies and the foundation for all other spiritual weapons and tools.

### Your Enemy and Your Weapon

**Your enemy in this first battle is _distraction_** , which keeps you from seeking God’s help to quiet the chaos in your mind.

Some typical thoughts associated with distraction include the following. Look for these in your own mind:

  * My schedule’s too full. I don’t have time for prayer and meditation.
  * I’m the active type. I’m not one for silence and solitude.
  * God has better things to do than help me with my little problems.



**Your weapon against distraction is _stillness_** , a state of silent rest in God’s presence from which you can recognize and combat your negative spirals.

### The Lie: Distraction Makes You Feel Better

**The enemy’s basic lie in this battle is that you’ll feel better if you remain distracted.**

The distraction in question is a perpetual inability—or rather a decision not—to spend time in silence and solitude with God. There are many ways to keep yourself distracted, including (but certainly not limited to):

  * Social media
  * Busyness, packing your schedule
  * Playing music constantly
  * Juggling jobs, committees, and too many friends
  * “Doing things” for God but not taking time to actually meet with him



**The enemy’s lie is fueled by our fear of facing ourselves and being “found out” by him.** There’s an irony here, because God actually _wants_ to be with you in your fear and shame, but these are the very things that make you run from him.

This fear of facing ourselves and God breaks down into three different sub-fears:

  * Fear of working: Quiet time with God brings up responsibilities that you need to fulfill, such as interpersonal reconciliations and job commitments.
  * Fear of having to change: Quiet time brings up an awareness of sin, bad habits, and your need for repentance.
  * Fear of being all alone: Quiet time potentially brings up the fear that you’ll find God isn’t really there.



**The lie behind all these fears is the idea that you can’t face God as you really are.** Satan’s hand in establishing such an idea, and also his motivation for doing it, is clear. The enemy hates your time with God because it heals you and makes you dangerous to him.

The author gives many real-life examples of distraction from God, and of its seductive gravitational pull:

  * A friend sought the author’s counsel over frantic and exhausting troubles with her marriage, children, friends, and a hectic life. The author recommended that she spend half an hour in solitude with God. A day later, the friend gave multiple excuses for not doing it.
  * The author describes her own tendency during her 18-month crisis to shy away from quiet time with God. She didn’t even know why she acted that way.
  * The author gives an account of a day when she compulsively socialized at her church and spent too much time on social media when she really wanted to spend some deep time alone with God.



**The fundamental danger of distraction is that you’re never actually “in neutral.” You’re always moving toward or away from something—if not toward God, then away from him.**

### The Truth: Only Stillness With God Will Satisfy

**The truth that explodes the lie of distraction is that God specifically built us for silent communion with him.** As in the example of Paul regaining his sight after the light of Christ had blinded him and then spending an extended time fasting in silence and solitude, stillness with God enables you to see reality as it truly is.

#### Scriptural Support for Stillness

You can find scriptural support for both the importance of stillness and your ability to practice it in various passages, including James 4:8 (“Draw near to God…”), Galatians 5 (flesh vs. spirit), Psalm 46:10 (“Be still and know that I am God”), Psalm 8:10 (“Better one day in your courts…”), and Matthew 11:30 (“Come to me...and I will give you rest”).

The only way you can consistently bear Paul’s “fruit of the spirit” (joy, kindness, peace, patience, self-control, and so on) instead of manifesting it only intermittently because of toxic thought spirals is to consistently “walk in the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). And the only way you can do this is by embracing and practicing stillness with God.

#### Scientific Support for Stillness

There’s also scientific support. Neurological and psychological studies have discovered many benefits that come from quiet meditation and focused attention. These include:

  * Increased relaxation brainwaves and decreased anxiety and depression
  * A younger, better-preserved brain
  * Better focus, with fewer wandering thoughts



The neurological and psychological benefits for a Christian manifest as a shift in perspective toward God’s point of view. You can see these in the paired items below. Notice that they’re all mutually exclusive. You can’t focus on both sides at once, so shifting to one automatically rules out the other.

  * Faith over fear
  * Truth over doubt
  * Trust over the need to control
  * Gratitude over comparison with others
  * Natural focus on God instead of multiple worldly anxieties



### The Strategy: Choose to Be Still

**The way you defeat your enemy of distraction is by learning to practice stillness deliberately.** Such communion with God really is available to you. Remember the master interrupting thought: “I have a choice.” You can _choose_ to be still with God.

#### Reframe Your Negative Thoughts

A primary way to choose to be still with God is to reframe negative thoughts. The skill has a reciprocal relationship with stillness, in that stillness enables you to do it, while doing it is a strategy for reaching stillness.

**The core strategy for reframing negative thoughts is as follows:**

**First** , learn the basic negative thought pattern, which keeps you trapped in negativity: [negative emotion] because [reason]. Consider these examples:

  * I’m overwhelmed because I have so many responsibilities.
  * I’m anxious because I work long hours but can’t make ends meet.
  * I’m furious because that person was rude.



**Next,** contrast the negative thought pattern with the alternative empowering rewritten pattern: [negative emotion] and [reason], so I will [choice]. Consider these examples:

  * I’m overwhelmed _and_ have many responsibilities, _so I will pause and thank God_ for giving me the strength to accomplish what I need to do.
  * I’m anxious _and_ worried about my finances, _so I will choose_ to pray and trust God instead of giving into fear.
  * I’m furious _and_ that person was rude, _so I will reflect on_ God’s patience and kindness toward me.



**Then use this knowledge to 1) identify and understand a negative thought, and 2) replace it with a rewritten, empowering thought.** The exercise following this chapter will give you an opportunity for practicing.

#### Reverse the Spiral of Distraction

Here’s a visual that shows how you can reverse the negative spiral of distraction by choosing stillness:
