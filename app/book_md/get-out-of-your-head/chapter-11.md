## Chapter 11: The Battle Against Cynicism

In this chapter, you’ll learn to defeat an enemy whose goal is to rob you of joy and bury you under a mountain of pessimistic gloom.

### Your Enemy and Your Weapon

**Your enemy in this battle is _cynicism_** , which makes you pessimistic about people and life in general.

Some typical thoughts associated with cynicism include the following. Look for these in your own mind:

  * Everyone disappoints you. Don’t trust people.
  * Don’t get your hopes up.
  * Belief is for gullible fools.
  * I don’t need anyone’s help. I’m fine on my own.



Here are some other signs of cynicism. Use them in tandem with the thoughts listed above to assess whether you’re infected:

  * You find optimism annoying.
  * You think nice people have ulterior motives.
  * You always feel misunderstood.
  * You always expect the bottom to drop out when things are going well.
  * You’re quick to notice other people’s faults.
  * You worry about being taken advantage of.
  * You’re guarded when meeting new people.
  * You’re habitually sarcastic.



**Your weapon against cynicism is _delight_**. More specifically, it’s awe-filled delight in God, his goodness, and the beauty of his creation.

### The Lie: You Can’t Trust People, Life, or God

**The enemy’s basic lie in this battle is twofold: that you can’t trust people and that life won’t work out. Below this lies a deeper lie: that you can’t trust God.** The enemy attacks with this lie by flooding your mind with thoughts about everything that’s wrong with our broken, fallen world.

**This lie is generated and fueled by emotional pain.** It’s a self-protection reflex based on wounds—and accompanying anger—from your past experiences, plus fear of the future. You project your woundedness and fear onto the world and refuse to let yourself hope for good things. You come to see hope and optimism as naivete and vulnerability. You emotionally interpret God and the world through the distorted lens of your personal wounds and disappointments. (Shortform note: Observe how cynicism is related to the fear that you learned how to fight in the previous chapter. Both battles involve fear of the future and the suspicion that God is not in control.)

#### The Effects of Cynicism

The negative effects of cynicism are devastating—primarily to those who buy into it!

**Most hurtfully, cynicism perverts your view of God. It wears down your ability to see him correctly.** The root of cynicism is a refusal to believe in God’s goodness and his control of things. Cynicism takes away your ability to delight in the world and engage fully with other people. It robs you of joy. And it usually does this on the subconscious level, without your being aware of it.

**Note that cynicism is active, not merely passive or receptive.** **It doesn’t simply receive or perceive gloom, it actively _reads it into your life_. **Imagine going to a party and sitting next to people who complain all night about the food, the music, and the hosts. Now imagine the opposite: the same party, but now the people next to you rave about how wonderful everything is. In either case, your party companions would probably affect your subjective memory of the event’s quality—for the worse in the first case, for the better in the second case. To some irreducible extent, the “goodness” or “badness” of the party resides in your choice (perhaps unconscious) of how to regard it. Cynicism sees only the bad. And it does this not just with parties but with everything and everyone.

Allen illustrates cynicism’s negative impact with a personal story. Not long after the end of her 18-month crisis, she attended a weekend leadership retreat. The leader, a psychiatrist friend, noted the author’s self-protective and unfriendly vibe: Allen held back emotionally, brushed off questions about how she was doing (“I’m good!”), and was generally distant. Over the weekend, her friend gently pressed her about this, but Allen didn’t see it and wouldn’t own it. She had become unknowingly infected with cynicism. The root of her cynicism, as she only recognized at the end of the retreat, was a lingering sense of estrangement from and mistrust of God because he had allowed her to hurt so badly for so long.

### The Truth: God Is Trustworthy

**The truth that exposes and overturns the lie of cynicism is simply this: that you can trust God without reservation. He will work all things together for good in the end.** A key scripture supporting this truth is Romans 8:28: “We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”

### The Strategy: Choose to Delight

**The way you defeat your enemy of cynicism with the truth of God’s trustworthiness is by learning to delight in God and his goodness. You implement this strategy by cultivating awe and appreciation of beauty.**

More specifically, you meditate on the truth that all beauty speaks of God’s own beauty, power, and goodness. It speaks of a world yet to come, a world beyond this one, a world more spectacular than you can imagine, but that you’ll one day see and know and enjoy fully.

There are various ways of practicing this. One is to seek out beauty and grandeur in nature, art, and human relationships.

Examples in nature might include snowy mountain peaks, sunsets, scenic vistas, seashells, thunderstorms, beautiful animals, the intricate structure of the human body, or whatever moves you personally. As Psalm 19:1 famously proclaims, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.” The author used this approach once in college when she led a Bible study for fellow college sophomores and noticed that they were all discouraged and exhausted. She scrapped her prepared lesson, went outside, and brought back a leaf from a tree. Then she instructed her friends to pass it around and examine it closely to note God’s careful design.

Examples in art could include a beautiful song, painting, film, or play, or the sight of beautiful architecture, such as a lovely old church with stained-glass windows. The author describes her first time attending a professional stage musical with her husband in her early twenties. It was _Les Misérables_ , and it overwhelmed her to the point of tears with its beauty. The experience amplified her ability to appreciate God.

Examples in human relationships might be the simple delight of watching your children play or the sense of being deeply moved by acts of human kindness.

In all these cases, your overarching goal is to cultivate the discipline that Paul described (and that the previous chapter employed in the battle against fear) of filling your mind with everything that’s true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, excellent, and praiseworthy. Cynicism can’t coexist with such thoughts.

#### The Effects of Delight

**The result of choosing to delight is that it tears down your wall of cynicism and lets in hope, trust, and worship.**

As with so many spiritual experiences, this one has a verified brain-based component. MRIs of the brain show that the experience of awe shuts down brain activity associated with selfishness while increasing a sense of connection with others. Awe-filled delight thus breaches one of the major self-protective barriers that cynicism erects around you.

The Bible also powerfully describes and confirms the effects of delight. See, for example, Paul’s description in 2 Corinthians 3 of how we become like Moses beholding God on the mountain whenever we come “face-to-face” with God in delight and worship. Our own lives become brighter and more beautiful, just like Moses’s glowing face. We become more like God.

The ultimate scriptural illustration of this principle is God’s very Son, Jesus, who explodes any real basis for cynicism because his story and reality literally embody our deepest yearning. They provide the divine truth, beauty, redemption, and connection that we long for. As stated in Chapter 1, Jesus is the whole reason why we have the choice to interrupt our downward spirals in the first place, including the one into cynicism.

Here’s a visual that shows the negative spiral of cynicism and how you can reverse it by choosing to delight in God:
