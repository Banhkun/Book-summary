## Chapters 4-6: How to Break Free From Mental Strongholds

**The distorted thought life described in Chapters 2-3 is the deepest, darkest stronghold inside you. The devil wants to keep you locked up in there, all alone, forever.** In biblical idiom, the term “stronghold” frequently refers to a nexus of sin and dysfunction inside your heart-mind that’s sealed up and walled off from God’s healing grace.

Satan’s evil intention for our minds reflects a psychological fact: Research has found that up to 70 percent of spontaneously occurring thoughts are negative. Negativity appears to be our default setting.

The author found this confirmed at another women’s church meeting when she asked attendees to identify the thoughts playing in their minds as they arrived. Negative thoughts (worries about finances, feelings of low self-worth, and so on) dominated.

**Negative thinking produces a destructive chain reaction:**

  * Negative self-assumptions (for example, “I’m unlovable because I’ve failed too much”) lead to
  * negative emotions (anger, hopelessness, and so on), which lead to
  * negative beliefs (for example, “I’ll never be good enough”), which lead to
  * negative actions (such as numbing your pain or faking your happiness), which ossify into
  * negative habits, which build up to
  * general lifestyles dominated by negativity.



### The Key to Freedom

**The key to freedom from negative thoughts is another thought, the “interrupting thought.” It is simply this: “I have a choice.”**

Making skillful use of the interrupting thought short-circuits any negative spiral and its accompanying mental chaos and imprisonment because it reminds you that you aren’t really at the mercy of your thoughts at all. You can actually choose the mind of Christ over toxic thoughts. This interrupts the negative spiral at its origin point, reverses the polarity, and starts an upward spiral toward health.

**We can take a lesson about this from the way we deal with our children.** We teach our children to interrupt their downward spirals all the time, as in a parent disciplining a toddler throwing a fit in public. We remind our children that we love them and that they can choose other thoughts and behavior, that they’re not victims of their negativity. Why not apply this to ourselves?

**Crucially, this “art of interruption” doesn’t just give you better thoughts, it gives you more of God.**

Also crucially, **this ability to use the interrupting thought is ultimately for _Christians_.** As a Christian you have God’s power to choose your thoughts, focus, and purpose. You’re not a slave to sin. Consider:

  * God gives you, as a Christian, everything you need for a victorious life (see 1 Peter 1:3).
  * In Philippians, Paul observed that because God has recreated us in Christ, we have the Holy Spirit’s power and the ability (and responsibility) to choose whether to live for the Spirit or for “the flesh” (our old, fallen self-nature with its sinful desire). The ability to change our heart-minds is built into us as Christians.
  * When he wrote his letter to the Philippians, Paul was practicing what he preached. He was imprisoned under house arrest, yet he chose to have the awesome love and reality of the risen Christ, instead of negativity, dominate his mind.



Below is a visual showing the interrupted and reversed thought spiral. Now starting from the bottom of the chain, you disrupt and change the toxic emotion-thought relationship by choosing the mind of Christ.

### Using the Key

Remember, the origin and power of negative spirals goes back to self-lies and toxic thoughts. **To break free, use the key of the interrupting thought (“I have a choice”) to identify, reject, and replace the specific toxic lie (about yourself and God) that’s keeping you imprisoned.** This may come to you through other people’s help.

#### How the Author Used the Key

The resolution of Allen’s dark spiritual crisis illustrates this principle. With the help of a friend, she finally recognized the lie that had ensnared her: that she had lost her faith. _In fact, such a thing had never happened_.

This resolution occurred in connection with a trip the author took to Uganda with two friends to observe a hunger relief organization. At a devotional meeting, one of the Ugandan leaders of the relief organization read aloud the passage from Psalm 139 about God’s inescapable Spirit that Allen had been repeating to herself as a lifeline for months during her crisis. This astonished Allen and reconfirmed her faith that God has to be real. But it also shattered her and brought on an emotional meltdown.

She later told her two friends (who witnessed her meltdown) about her months-long spiritual struggle. Her friend Ann responded with an observation that created a breakthrough: “This isn’t who you are.” Ann told Allen she hadn’t lost her faith at all, that the whole thing was actually an attack by the enemy. The statement pierced through Allen’s emotional chaos and set her free because it made her realize that _she had a choice_ to disbelieve the lie and believe something different.

When the three women got back from Uganda, Allen’s two friends staged a 24-hour vigil to fast and pray for confidence and faith in Allen’s life. Her 3 a.m. wake-ups into panic stopped immediately afterward, when she became vigilant about minding her mind. **She realized that she had never actually lost her faith. She had just stopped feeling it.**

#### How the Apostle Paul Used the Key

The apostle Paul’s conversion experience also illustrates the use of the interrupting thought, to break free. Fasting and trapped in blindness after his traumatic Damascus Road encounter with the risen Christ, Paul recognized, with the help of Ananias, **the lie that had ensnared him: that Jesus was not the messiah, and even more, that it was his (Paul’s) God-given duty to persecute Jesus’s followers and stamp out this new faith.**

Formerly a persecutor of Jesus’s followers, **Paul now recognized Jesus as the messiah and experienced a total spiritual transformation that changed the course of his life.** His post-conversion life centered on a new reality. He felt himself to be a totally different person (Philippians 1:21, Ephesians 4:24, Colossians 3:10, and more). He was no longer a slave to thoughts, emotions, or circumstances. He chose to live in awareness of Christ’s power working in him through the Holy Spirit. He made the Christian believer’s power to destroy strongholds, arguments, and opinions that oppose God, and to “take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:3-6), one of the keynotes of his preaching and teaching.

#### How You Can Use the Key

Use the interrupting thought to choose the mind of Christ and escape the devil’s strongholds. Some specific techniques for doing this include the following, all of which you’ll study in more detail in Part 2:

  * Choose stillness instead of noise and distraction.
  * Choose community instead of isolated autonomy.
  * Choose to surrender and trust in God’s goodness instead of fearful anxiety.
  * Choose worship instead of cynicism.
  * Choose humility instead of self-importance.
  * Choose gratitude instead of victimhood.
  * Choose to serve God and others instead of resting in complacency.



It can be helpful to remember again that this “discipline of interruption” uses what we know about how the brain works, as you learned about in Chapter 1.

You can reimprint your neural pathways. New thoughts physically alter the brain by blazing new neural trails. Your brain becomes what you think about.

**The specifically Christian implications of these things are staggering.** You can choose to create healthier neural connections that are more conducive to joyful, Christ-empowered living instead of anxiety, depression, and defeat. God can heal even a lifetime’s worth of toxic thought grooves. This positive Christian brain change simply requires a combination of your disciplined effort and God’s grace.

### Create a Mental Story Map

To do the work described in these chapters, one useful and practical tool is a “mental story map.” Evil never wants you to notice it. It prefers to sneak in and hijack your mind. A mental story map provides a specific technique for shining light on these unwanted intruders.

Here’s how you make one:

  * Step 1: Draw your map.
    * Write down your current primary emotion. Draw a circle around it.
    * Around the circle, write contributing factors. Unfinished work? A relationship? Money? Circle each and draw a line to the central emotion.
    * Near each smaller circle, list how it contributes to your current emotion.
  * Step 2: Talk to God.
    * Pray through each item.
    * Search the scriptures for relevant truths.
    * Ask God to reveal wrong thoughts about himself and yourself.
  * Step 3: Look for common patterns and themes in your map items (anxiety about things you can’t control? anger at insults? self-criticism?).
  * Step 4: Notice the storyline your thoughts build about God. Is it true or false?



(Shortform note: To learn a similar approach to “minding your mind,” read our summary of Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond.)

### The Far Goal: Beyond the Daily Battle

The discipline involved in interrupting your negative spirals, changing your brain, and renewing your mind will likely require a daily battle at first.**** See Paul’s description of the battle between the Spirit and the flesh, the Christian’s “new self” and old sin nature, in Romans 7:22-23.

But **the ultimate goal goes beyond having to fight every day. What we’re after is a new baseline, a new default setting for “normal” in our minds** that’s positive, healthy, and God-directed instead of negative and infested by the enemy’s thoughts. The goal is to keep “minding your mind” and practicing Godly thought patterns until this becomes automatic. In other words, the goal is to do what Paul referred to in Romans 8 as “setting the mind on the spirit.”

#### More Than Self-Help

Importantly, this is not about “self-help” but about a whole new self. **Self-help offers a better version of yourself, whereas Christ wants _a whole new you_ , a new creation.**

Self-help can be useful to Christians on a limited scale because it recognizes and encourages the necessity of “working on yourself.” But on its own, self-help always comes up short. Toxic spirals don’t just need to be stopped, which self-help may partially accomplish through affirmations and such things; they need to be _divinely redeemed_ , which requires Christian faith and your disciplined cooperation with the Holy Spirit.

**Your purpose as a Christian isn’t to think more good thoughts about yourself but to think less about yourself and more about God and others** (Matthew 6:33, Matthew 22:37-39).
