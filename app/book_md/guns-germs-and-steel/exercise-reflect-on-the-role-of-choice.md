## Exercise: Reflect on the Role of Choice

Diamond emphasizes the importance of environmental and geographical influences on the development of societies, and he’s been criticized for minimizing the role of individual choice. In this exercise, you’ll reflect on the way individual choice interacts with other influences to affect how events unfold.

Think of a historical event we’ve discussed in this summary. In the box below, describe how environmental, geographic, or other external factors affected the way this event unfolded.

Now, consider how individual choices affected the course of this event. To what extent were individuals responsible for the way history unfolded in this case?

Finally, reflect on how external and internal factors interact in the progression of current events—whether in your lived experience or in society at large. In the box below, describe how individual choices might affect the course of events for the better: What might be done to make the future brighter?
