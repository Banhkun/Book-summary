## Exercise: Find Your Calling

Greene asserts that the first step to mastery is to look within. Take a moment to reflect and search for your inner sense of direction.

* * *

What were you naturally drawn to as a child? Describe this with specific detail (for example, maybe you always found yourself playing sports with the neighborhood kids).

What unusual or characteristic personality traits do you have? Think of that thing people always notice about you—for instance, maybe you always love to make people feel welcome. Consider a few, and describe which feels the most salient to you.

What do you feel drawn to as an adult? Consider the activities you can’t get enough of—maybe cooking or hiking. How might this relate to your childhood interests?

Considering the above answers, ask: Have you lost touch with what interests you most? If so, how might you bring it back into your life? For example, think about making time to practice a skill you’ve always been drawn to, like playing the piano, or developing a habit you’ve long felt you should.
