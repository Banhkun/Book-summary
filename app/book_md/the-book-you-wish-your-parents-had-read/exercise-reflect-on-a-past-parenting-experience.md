## Exercise: Reflect on a Past Parenting Experience

Reflect on how you could have applied Perry’s advice to a parenting experience from your past so you’ll feel ready to apply her insights to similar situations in the future.

* * *

Describe a parenting challenge that you wish you’d handled differently, or describe a childhood experience of being parented that you wish your parents had handled differently. (For example, maybe your child cried because you wouldn’t buy a toy, and you snapped at them for being ungrateful. Or, maybe your parents never disagreed in front of you, so now you have no idea how to solve conflicts with your partner.)

Which of Perry’s tips could you or your parent(s) have applied to handle this situation better? (For example, instead of snapping at your child for their tantrum, you might have soothed them by empathizing and acknowledging that they were feeling sad because they couldn’t have what they wanted. Instead of hiding their conflicts from you, your parents could have demonstrated healthy conflict resolution strategies like avoiding accusatory statements.)

What’s another piece of advice from Perry you hope to implement in the future? Why? (For example, you plan to acknowledge your mistakes because you don’t want your child to feel like they have to be perfect or can’t trust you.)
