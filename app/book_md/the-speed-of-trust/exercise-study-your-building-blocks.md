## Exercise: Study Your Building Blocks

As Covey explains, low trust often yields low results despite proper strategy and execution. Since trust requires all four building blocks (principles, motives, skills, and track record), a breakdown in any of these areas can impede your success as an individual or organization.

* * *

Pick a sphere (you can think about yourself as an individual or as a member of a team, organization, or larger community). Think about the last interaction when your strategy and execution yielded negative results. (For example, maybe the last time you conducted a performance evaluation with an employee at work, the meeting became confrontational rather than constructive.)nnConsidering that trust sets the tone of every interaction, what role do you think trust might have played in this instance?

Which building block(s) (principles, motives, skills, and track record) might have played a role in those negative results? How so? (Remember, your principles shape how you interpret and respond to your circumstances, your motives drive your actions, your skills are your capabilities in a given area, and your track record refers to your history of getting things done.)

Now think about a current goal or relationship (you can keep the same sphere as in the previous questions or use a new sphere). Considering that trust sets the tone of every interaction, how can you incorporate trust into your planning and execution? (For example, maybe your company is rolling out a new product, and youâ€™re hoping to use your strong track record to attract the loyalty of a new customer base.)

Which building block(s) (principles, motives, skills, and track record) can you focus on to achieve positive results? How will those building blocks contribute to your success?
