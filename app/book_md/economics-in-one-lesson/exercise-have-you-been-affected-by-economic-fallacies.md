## Exercise: Have You Been Affected by Economic Fallacies?

Reflect on your experience with economic policies based on fallacies.

* * *

Describe an instance when you’ve been positively or negatively affected by a policy that was intended to help a specific group. (For example, the Affordable Care Act intended to improve healthcare for low-income Americans, but it also caused many middle-class Americans to lose coverage and pay higher premiums.)

What role do you think lobbying and marketing played in that policy’s enactment?

Overall, did the policy make things better or worse for the economy as a whole? Why or why not?

How could the policy have been different to create a better solution for everyone?
