## Part 1: Have Only Top Employees | Chapter 1: Pay Top Dollar for Top Talent

When Netflix launched in 1997, the company was essentially a mail-order version of Blockbuster, the video rental store that dominated the home entertainment industry at the time. Instead of going to a store to pick out rentals of movies and television series, Netflix users received their DVDs by mail and sent them back when they were finished. Today, Netflix not only streams movies and TV shows but also produces its own award-winning content. The company now has more than 200 million subscribers across 190 countries, its stock price rose from $1 in 2002 to $350 in 2019, and it’s consistently listed among the best places to work.

(Shortform note: Netflix had 167 million subscribers at the time of the book’s publication, but that number has since grown to over 200 million. The company gained more than 36 million of those subscribers at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when people around the world were largely stuck at home due to lockdowns. Netflix’s stock price has also seen an impressive increase: Starting at just $15 per share when the company went public in 2002, it hit a high of $700.99 in November 2021, fueled by massively successful original content. While subscriber growth slowed in early 2021, Netflix is still the undisputed leader among streaming platforms, with nearly 100 million more subscribers than its closest competitor (as of October 2021).)

**To achieve this level of success, Netflix had to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing industry.** The company made four major evolutions in the span of just 15 years:

  1. From mailing DVDs to streaming content online 
  2. From streaming existing movies and shows to debuting original content (such as _House of Cards_ and _Orange Is the New Black_) produced by third-party studios
  3. From contracting with outside studios to building a studio to produce original content in-house (such as _Stranger Things_ and _The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_)
  4. From a domestic business to a global company



> **What Netflix Did Right—and What Blockbuster Did Wrong**
> 
> By staying nimble and going through these four major changes in just 15 years, Netflix was able to stay a step ahead of the competition. In contrast, chief competitor Blockbuster went from 9,000 brick-and-mortar stores to just one and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. Some blame Blockbuster’s failure on the rise of Netflix, but others argue that it’s a combination of factors. While Netflix relied on innovation to propel the company forward, Blockbuster’s success was hindered by:
> 
>   * **Indecisiveness** —the company flip-flopped between changing the business model to eliminate late fees and pivot to digital—which would initially eat into the company’s profitability—and doing what they’d always done. In the end, leaders decided to stick to their original business model.
> 
>   * **Misalignment** —Blockbuster’s leaders and investors didn’t see eye to eye when it came to the company’s future, resulting in CEO John Antioco being fired during a critical period. The company heads also heavily favored retail and largely ignored the separate online division.
> 
>   * **Complacency** —Hastings actually tried to sell Netflix to Blockbuster, but former Netflix CEO Marc Randolph says that Antioco didn’t seem to take Hastings’s $50 million asking price seriously. Blockbuster didn’t see Netflix as a threat and didn’t consider its potential, dismissing the business as unsustainable and unprofitable.
> 
> 


The keys to Netflix’s success have been unconventional business practices. Specifically, the company focuses on:

  1. Hiring and keeping only the best workers—at any cost
  2. Promoting candor through constant feedback at all levels as well as organizational transparency
  3. Removing controls, such as allotted vacation time and approval processes



**These practices, which we’ll explore in more detail in this guide, have created a culture of autonomy and accountability**(what Netflix calls “freedom and responsibility”), **focusing on empowering employees to innovate and take accountability,** rather than conditioning them to simply follow protocol.

In this book, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer, a business professor and author, tell the story of Netflix’s evolution, and they illustrate how these unusual business practices shaped the company’s success. Our guide explores each of these practices in detail and how Netflix applies the corporate culture to other cultures in offices around the world.

### Hire and Keep Only the Best Employees

The first critical business practice that Hastings established at Netflix was to **have only top employees.** This practice grew out of two lessons Hastings learned: one from his first company and another from the early days of Netflix.

#### Lesson #1: An Agile Company Needs Innovators

In the first few years after Hastings founded Pure Software in 1991, the company culture was flexible and fun. Employees enjoyed a great deal of freedom, whether that meant working from home or buying office equipment without purchase orders or approvals.

However, as Pure Software grew, it became more difficult to manage without implementing some controls. Soon, the formerly flexible startup culture had morphed into a rigid corporate environment. Hastings realized that the **employees who thrived in rules-heavy workplaces were people who excelled at following protocol, rather than the innovators he needed to keep the company agile and successful.** Ultimately, this led to Hastings’s downfall at Pure Software: When market needs changed, the company couldn’t adapt and Hastings was forced to sell the company to his competitor.

(Shortform note: ​​Ordinarily, growth is a good thing for a company, but it's not without its drawbacks. In the case of Pure Software, it meant the company culture changed over time, which ultimately led to a buyout. Small businesses can manage growth—without sacrificing the elements that made them successful—in five ways: First, hire a team that reflects your company vision. Second, regularly revisit your budget plan. Third, maintain working capital. Fourth, leverage your strengths. Fifth, be aware of changes as the company grows and adjust processes accordingly.)

> **Why Failed Entrepreneurs Will Likely Fail Again**
> 
> Hastings was able to leverage his failure at Pure Software, using the lessons he learned to increase his chances of success at his next company. However, he’s more of an exception rather than the rule—most entrepreneurs who fail once will most likely fail again. That’s because they tend to blame outside factors and don’t properly evaluate the root cause of their failure before trying their luck with another venture. If you fail and plan to go into business again, take the time to evaluate what you did wrong in your first attempt and determine the changes you should make to avoid another failed venture.

#### Lesson #2: High Performers Thrive Among Other High Performers

The second lesson came with the 2001 dot-com crash: Venture capital funds dried up and Hastings was forced to lay off a third of his 120 employees, including many who produced adequate work.

Although Hastings feared that the layoffs would decimate morale, he discovered that his remaining staff was buzzing with energy and producing high-quality work. Hastings realized that **by eliminating less-than-stellar workers, he was left with a higher concentration of talent per employee.** This created an environment in which top performers thrived: High-performing employees were eager to work with other talented workers they could learn from and who pushed them to produce quality work, which in turn increased individual satisfaction and morale. Seeing how a lean, high-performing workforce worked in the company’s favor, Hastings vowed to hire only the best employees.

> **A Better Way to Handle Layoffs**
> 
> Hastings’s narrative of events tends to romanticize the idea of layoffs—while Netflix experienced an uptick in performance after cutting down its workforce, research suggests that layoffs are merely a short-term fix and typically lead to a 41 percent decline in job satisfaction and a 20 percent decline in job performance. A reduced staff also means a heavier workload for remaining employees, which then leads to higher rates of burnout and turnover.
> 
> For a more pragmatic approach to layoffs that better prepares your organization for changing manpower needs, experts suggest developing a workforce change strategy for three different economic conditions:
> 
>   * **When things are going well:** Be disciplined about hiring and keep a lean, high-performing staff to begin with.
> 
>   * **During downturns:** Find creative ways to cut costs without laying off employees during short-term crises. For example, Honeywell employees went on unpaid or partially paid leave for weeks, which saved the company from cutting thousands of jobs.
> 
>   * **During periods of transformation:** If your company is set to undergo restructuring or some other major change that would render staff redundant, consider re-training current employees to take on new roles.
> 
> 

> 
> If layoffs are unavoidable, make them as painless as possible by giving affected employees other opportunities, whether it’s by helping them find jobs in other companies, giving them the chance to pitch business proposals and win grants, or providing them with training to gain new skills that they can use elsewhere.

### Prevent Poaching

Once Hastings cultivated a high-performing workforce, his new challenge was how to retain it— **having a pool of stellar performers meant that other companies always threatened to poach Netflix’s employees.** Hastings thus implemented three measures to prevent poaching.

#### 1) Pay Top-of-Market Salaries

The first safeguard from poaching that Hastings implemented was to **pay more than any other company offered—even if it was more than the employee asked for.** By contrast, most companies count on job candidates to undervalue themselves, which allows companies to pay people below their value. However, as employees’ skills grow and they become more valuable, it’s often inevitable that they’ll get job offers with higher salaries. Even if workers love their jobs, research shows that most people will change jobs for more money. As a result, this model ultimately decreases an organization’s concentration of talent by creating an environment that encourages employees to leave for better-paying jobs.

> **Other Perspectives on Determining Salaries**
> 
> While Hastings believes in paying top-of-market rates to retain staff, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates thinks you should just pay “north of fair.” In _Principles_ , Dalio recommends paying employees just enough so that they don’t have to worry about money and can focus on their work, but not _so_ much that they’ll become complacent—they should still be motivated to work hard and earn more.
> 
> “Just enough” may be relative, but Gravity Payments CEO Dan Price seems to have found the magic number for his employees: He cut his own salary so that he could afford to raise the minimum wage at his company to $70,000 a year, which was enough to allow employees to quit working multiple jobs and better take care of their families. Since raising Gravity Payments raised their minimum wage, the company’s revenue grew and more employees were able to pay off debts, buy homes, and start families.

##### Paying Top-of-Market Is Difficult, but It’s Worth the Investment

To pay top-of-market salaries, Hastings says that managers at Netflix must know their employees’ market values. Additionally, **Netflix relies on employees to know their value.** Hastings and the rest of the executive staff even encourage their workers to take headhunters’ calls and interview for jobs to find out what their skills are worth. Employees are then instructed to share the information with their managers.

> **What to Do When You’re Blindsided by a Resignation**
> 
> Few companies encourage the same level of transparency as Netflix does when it comes to employees’ other job prospects, so an employee’s resignation may come as a surprise. To deal with unexpected resignations, experts give the following tips:
> 
> **Don’t take it personally.** Do your best to manage your emotions, then have a conversation with the employee about their reasons for leaving. While you often won’t be able to change their minds, the discussion might reveal information and options that weren’t available before—for example, you may discover that they’re resigning for personal reasons and that a flexible schedule or an extended leave will enable them to stay.
> 
> **Invite them back after a year.** Experts say that immediately presenting a counter-offer is counter-productive because it’s difficult to trust someone who has already decided to leave. Instead of convincing them to stay, maintain a relationship with them and consider recruiting them again in a year.
> 
> **Communicate with other employees.** Use it as an opportunity to find out if anyone else is interested in learning and taking over the resigning employee’s responsibilities, and to discuss career paths. If other team members will have an increased workload, assure them that it’s only temporary and that you’ll find a replacement as soon as possible.
> 
> **Wish the resigning employee well.** Have a party to acknowledge the person’s contributions and to send a message to your team that they’re valued.

##### Encouraging Employees to Window-Shop Promotes Transparency

It may sound risky to encourage employees to window-shop for other jobs, but fostering transparency gives Netflix an opportunity to keep its workers. (We’ll go into more detail about Netflix’s organizational transparency in Chapter 5.) Meyers writes that if managers discourage employees from talking with recruiters, employees might simply feel that they have to sneak around. Then, if an employee receives an enticing offer, she’s more likely to accept it before telling her manager that she’s leaving. By contrast, **at Netflix, the employee can feel comfortable coming to her manager with another job offer,** which gives the manager an opportunity to raise the employee’s salary and fight to keep her.****

> **How to Make Employees Stay When You Can’t Afford Top-of-Market Salaries**
> 
> Netflix pays top dollar so that employees won’t be lured by other companies and accept enticing offers and to ensure that it can offer raises to poached employees—but what if you can’t afford to give your star performers a big raise? Experts say that you can retain high-performing employees by:
> 
>   * Communicating how their work makes a difference in the company to make them feel like they’re making an impact
> 
>   * Providing career development support through training and mentoring
> 
>   * Showing your appreciation for your employees and celebrating their accomplishments
> 
>   * Offering other benefits aside from cash, such as better health and dental insurance
> 
>   * Respecting that they have a life outside of work—for example, allowing more flexibility for new parents
> 
> 


#### 2) Eliminate Performance-Based Bonuses

Hastings writes that the second safeguard from poaching that Netflix implemented was to reject bonuses and instead put that money into larger base salaries. The move paid off, as Hastings discovered that **job candidates prefer guaranteed money over the possibility of earning bonuses.**

Many big companies pay employees a salary and incentivize workers to achieve more by offering annual bonuses for reaching predetermined goals. However, Hastings argues that the bonus system assumes that managers can accurately predict which achievements will be most valuable to the company in the year ahead—but those metrics may change.

  * For example, in one quarter, your company might be focused on launching a new product, but in another quarter, your company might find that increasing the revenue stream from an old, tried-and-tested product is more crucial.



**Creating a bonus system doesn’t allow for the flexibility to chase evolving goals** —rather, it incentivizes employees to pursue potentially irrelevant goals to earn their bonuses. (Shortform note: While Netflix doesn’t offer incentives to employees, it now offers bonuses to directors and actors as a means to attract the biggest names in the entertainment industry.)

Additionally, high-performing employees like the ones that fill Netflix’s offices are internally motivated to work hard, and dangling a bonus in front of them doesn’t change that. In reality, the allure of the bonus makes employees constantly aware of whether they’re on track to reach their goals, and that concern actually crowds workers’ minds and inhibits their creativity—a key component of most of the jobs at Netflix.

(Shortform note: Hastings says that high performers are more driven by _intrinsic_ motivation rather than extrinsic rewards like bonuses. If you’re looking to improve intrinsic motivation in your organization, Daniel Pink suggests that you increase employees’ feelings of autonomy and purpose. You can do this by breaking their routines and occasionally letting them choose new projects to work on, involving them in the goal-setting process, and designing policies that show you trust them. Read more in our full guide to Drive.)

> **Why Bonuses Don’t Work**
> 
> Hastings mentions one drawback of bonuses—that job candidates prefer _guaranteed_ money over the _possibility_ of a bonus—but this doesn’t give a complete picture of the flaws of the bonus system. In reality, there are many other issues with bonuses, as Paul Marciano points out. In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Marciano writes that bonuses and other reward systems fail because:
> 
>   * They’re focused on short-term gains rather than long-term impact.
> 
>   * They limit performance. When an employee reaches a goal and gets the accompanying bonus, he might start to slack off.
> 
>   * They promote unethical behavior. Employees may prioritize the ends rather than the means, doing whatever it takes to earn a bonus.
> 
>   * They cover up ineffective managers. Employees may work hard simply because they’re motivated by a reward, not by a good manager.
> 
>   * They can feel manipulative.
> 
>   * They don’t improve company culture.
> 
> 

> 
> Marciano recommends replacing incentives with _engagement_ to motivate employees—give them respect, empowerment, supportive feedback, consideration, and trust; clarify expectations; and treat them as partners.

#### 3) Give Raises That Reflect Employees’ Market Value

Hastings says that the third safeguard from poaching that Netflix implemented was to reject conventional methods of giving raises like raise pools (allotting a certain amount of money to divide among employees) and salary bands (putting a cap on the total salary an employee can reach through raises). As Meyer explains, these traditional raise schemes mean that you may only get a two- to five-percent raise per year, so you would be more inclined to move to another company with higher pay that’s equivalent to getting a 10-percent raise.

(Shortform note: Abandoning traditional raise schemes is more important than ever as millennials and Gen Z populate the workforce. In the past, many people stayed in their jobs for the long term because of their employer’s pension plan—the promise of a payout and comfortable retirement. However, the number of employers offering such plans has decreased dramatically in the past 30 years. As there’s no longer a financial reward for loyalty, millennial and Gen Z workers are prone to frequent job-jumping to increase their wages and develop a meaningful career.)

In contrast, **Hastings says that Netflix decided to give raises based on market changes.** A Netflix employee who’s performing well and whose skills are highly valuable may get a 20-percent raise one year to reflect the market—but the following year, if the market hasn’t changed, that same employee may still be doing excellent work and receive no raise. If an employee’s skill set continually increases, or if the market for those skills continues to rise, that employee may see steady raises year after year.

On the other hand, if the market for another employee’s position remains stable, that employee may not get a raise for multiple years, even if she’s performing well. (The exception to Netflix’s follow-the-market policy is that if the market for a particular position drops, Netflix generally does not decrease that employee’s salary.) Nevertheless, this raise scheme guarantees that a Netflix employee won’t find a more enticing pay increase elsewhere.

> **Can Your Company Afford to Give Big Raises?**
> 
> Netflix has an unorthodox approach to giving raises, which means that employees can experience a windfall year after year. Some argue that this is unsustainable and that it’s impossible for other companies to follow Netflix’s lead because of economics. However, some experts suggest that raising wages is not an economic issue but a management issue. **Many companies choose to invest their huge earnings in share prices rather than their employees.**
> 
> Companies tend to choose this route because raising wages is seen as risky—management doesn’t want to be stuck paying high salaries during the inevitable recession. But research upends this thinking: Underpaying employees actually makes it more difficult to cut pay when times are hard, while giving generous salaries can help see a company through hard times. That’s because higher pay makes people more committed to the company and more willing to do what it takes to show their support—even if it means taking a temporary pay cut for the company to stay afloat. (As an added benefit, research also suggests that paying employees higher wages results in higher profits for the company.)
> 
> In short, evaluate whether your company is justifying low wages and meager raises by saying it’s a safeguard against losses during difficult times. Instead, start viewing employees as an investment that can help your company thrive in any economic condition.
