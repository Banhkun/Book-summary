## Chapter 8: Abolish Vacation and Expense Policies

With a highly motivated staff and a culture of candor and accountability, Hastings was able to give Netflix employees more freedom and empower lower-level employees to make decisions that most companies delegate to managers and executives. This also enabled Hastings to implement another unconventional measure at Netflix: He abolished the vacation policy and the travel and expense approval process.

Giving employees so much freedom is unorthodox and can be risky. To safeguard against abuse, Hastings says you should remove controls strategically to ensure that employees understand the weight of responsibility and the context to make good decisions. If done well, this creates a culture in which autonomy and accountability spiral up: As employees enjoy more freedom, they act more responsibly, and**as they act more responsibly, management can feel confident offering more freedom.**

> **How to Hold Employees Accountable**
> 
> Hastings uses the unconventional practices at Netflix to drive the message that great freedom comes with great responsibility, but he doesn’t explain how companies that don’t have Netflix’s unusual culture can create enough accountability to make the risky move of _abolishing_ limits on vacations or expenses. To foster more accountability in your workplace, experts say you should be clear about the following:
> 
>   * **Expectations** —discuss the results you expect from your employees, strategies for getting those results, and how you’re going to measure outcomes. Then, ask them to summarize what you’ve talked about to ensure you’re on the same page.
> 
>   * **Skills and resources** —give them the tools to set them up for success. If you can’t provide them with skills training and the right resources, it might be best to farm the tasks out to someone else.
> 
>   * **Milestones** —don’t wait until it’s too late to find out if your employees can meet your expectations. Set up milestones and regularly check in with them to see if they’re on track.
> 
>   * **Feedback** —let them know how they’re doing based on your agreed milestones. Then, ask if there’s any way you can help.
> 
>   * **Consequences** —react appropriately. If they succeed, reward them. If they fail despite all the support you’ve given them, you should let them know that they missed the mark and decide on a response that corresponds with the offense. For example, you could issue a verbal or written reprimand, give them a low score on their performance appraisal, or—in extreme cases—fire them.
> 
> 


First, let’s look at how Hastings strengthened this culture of autonomy and accountability when he removed the vacation policy.

### Abolish the Vacation Policy

Even before launching Netflix, Hastings believed that the _quality_ of employees’ work mattered more than the _quantity_ of time they spent producing it, especially in creative industries. So, since 2003, Netflix has neither allotted vacation time nor tracked days off.

(Shortform note: If you’re not able to implement an _unlimited_ vacation policy in your organization, there are a few alternative policies you can try to encourage employees to take enough time off: First, you can implement a _minimum_ vacation policy, which relieves employees of the pressure of determining what’s considered an acceptable amount of vacation time. Second, you can impose mandatory time off—employees have to take one week off every four months (or any other specified time period). Third, you can reward employees who go on vacation with spending money.)

#### Addressing Vacation Time Issues

Despite the benefits of abolishing the vacation policy, Hastings had to implement the change strategically to avoid two potential problems:

**Problem #1: Workers take _too much_ vacation time. **If too many people take off at once, or they leave while their team is pushing to meet a deadline, this could cripple workflow, especially with a small staff (as Netflix had when the policy went into effect).

**Solution #1:** As discussed in Chapter 7, managers must give employees enough _relevant information_ to make sound decisions about when to take vacations and for how long. This may include telling employees that they can’t take time off within two weeks of a deadline, or that no more than one team member can be out at a time.

> **How to Manage Employees’ Vacation Time Fairly**
> 
> While employees may understand that they can’t all take time off at once, it may put you in an uncomfortable position if two employees happen to block off the same dates. To avoid conflict within the team, experts give the following tips for managing vacation requests:
> 
>   * **Discuss vacations as a team.** That way, they can work out schedules among themselves prior to finalizing vacation plans. Emphasize that vacations are important and that you want everybody to have the opportunity to rest.
> 
>   * **Have a rota system.** Have a rotating list so that people get a chance to pick their vacation dates ahead of everyone else each year, making sure that each employee gets their chance to be first.
> 
>   * **Close shop.** It can be especially difficult to decide who gets to take a vacation around the holidays, so in the spirit of fairness, consider letting the whole company take a break at the same time.
> 
> 


**Problem #2: Workers take _too little_ vacation time. **Some workers don’t want colleagues to think they’re not carrying their weight. Under normal vacation policies, the threat of losing unused vacation days often motivates employees to take time off if they wouldn’t otherwise.

**Solution #2:** Hastings and Meyer assert that leaders must set an example by taking big vacations, talking openly about them, and encouraging employees to do the same. Regardless of what managers _say_ , workers will follow what they _do_ —if they say that everyone should feel free to take plenty of vacation, but they only take a week off all year, employees won’t feel comfortable taking long vacations. Similarly, if the CEO takes five weeks’ vacation but a department head barely takes two, that manager’s team will follow her lead. In other words, **all leaders** —from the executive suite to the middle managers—**must set a good example of work-life balance for their subordinates.**

> **How to Encourage Employees to Take Time Off**
> 
> Aside from using your vacation time yourself, which may not always be practical—for instance, if you’re in the middle of closing an important deal, or if your company is experiencing a major transition—there are other ways to encourage employees to take time off:
> 
>   * **Systematize processes.** Some employees are hesitant to go on leave because they’re worried that things will go wrong without them. Encourage them to build systems that can run even without them around.
> 
>   * **Remind them.** Send out announcements to encourage them to use their leave credits, especially around the holidays.
> 
>   * **Be supportive.** When they ask for time off, ask them questions about their plans and be excited for them.
> 
>   * **Get rid of disincentives for use. **Some vacation policies reward employees for _not_ taking time off. For example, your company might applaud when a new parent returns to work earlier than expected. Evaluate whether such unintended messages are keeping your employees from using their allotted vacation time.
> 
> 


#### The Result: Increased Employee Productivity

Surprisingly, at Netflix, employees don’t take significantly more time off with no vacation policy than they would under a restricted vacation policy. Additionally, Hastings notes, the policy (or non-policy) brings significant benefits:

1) It gives employees more control over their lives to create a work-life balance, which improves their job satisfaction and performance. (Shortform note: If you can’t give employees an unlimited vacation policy, you can still help them achieve work-life balance and increase their job satisfaction, performance, and productivity by giving them a flexible work schedule.)

2) It makes it easier to attract and retain the industry’s top talent, especially millennials and Gen Z workers who favor less restrictive work settings. (Shortform note: Some argue that these perks may _attract_ talented workers, but they may not be enough to make them stay. While unlimited vacation can be a useful factor in luring in employees, what will make them commit to your company is a collaborative working environment where their ideas are respected. So, focus on building cohesive, innovative teams instead of fringe benefits.)

3) It sends a message to employees that management trusts them, which inspires them to live up to that trust. (Shortform note: Abolishing the vacation policy is one way to show employees that you trust them, but make sure you don’t undermine your efforts with two cues that show you _don’t_ trust them: first, having a risk-averse workplace that stifles innovation; and second, prioritizing profits over relationships and employee autonomy.)

### Eliminate Travel and Expense Policies

After seeing the success that came from eliminating the vacation policy, Hastings was reluctant to put any additional policies in place, including travel and expense approval processes. In Netflix’s early years, the staff was small enough that travel and expenses could be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but as the company grew, it reached a point where some kind of policy had to be put in place. **Hastings wanted to give employees the freedom to use their judgment, but he needed to safeguard against abuse and overspending.**

First, Hastings implemented a policy that simply asked employees to spend company money as if it were their own. However, it soon became apparent that everyone’s spending habits varied greatly—taking business class for a short flight might seem reasonable to some and frivolous to others. Wording the policy this way punished frugal, conscientious employees while giving others a free pass to spend lavishly.

Hastings learned from the misstep and came up with a well-worded policy that he reinforced with context, safeguards, and transparency.

> **Clearly Communicate Expense Policies (or Non-Policies)**
> 
> Whether you have a non-policy like Netflix initially did or a formal policy like most companies, it’s important to communicate your approach to expenses with employees to avoid issues like those Hastings describes. Experts say that a lack of clarity leads to a host of other issues such as slow processing and an increased risk of fraud, so let your employees know what’s acceptable and unacceptable spending by:
> 
>   * **Making the guidelines easily accessible:** Employees should know where they can find your policies for easy reference. If you’re making changes or updates to the policies, send a message through various channels—email, newsletters, the company intranet, messaging apps, and in meetings—so that employees are more likely to read them.
> 
>   * **Having a summary:** Not everyone will read through a multi-page handbook, so put the highlights in a summary sheet.
> 
>   * **Finding champions:** Tap leaders and employees who are in-house influencers to inform employees about policies.
> 
>   * **Letting them have a say:** Welcome ideas from employees, especially those with roles that require them to regularly use company money, to improve systems and processes.
> 
> 


#### Policy: Employees Must Act in the Company’s Best Interest

Hastings writes that Netflix’s new policy for travel and expenses was to simply act in the company’s best interest. Typically, blanket policies are too inflexible to fit the nuances of real life—for example, a policy that limits how much employees can spend on lodging seems straightforward until someone has a meeting in an unusually expensive location where the only decent hotels are very pricey. In that case, it would be in the company’s best interest for the employee to pay up for a good hotel so that she can get some decent rest and be alert for her meetings.

**Asking employees to act in the company’s best interest builds in enough flexibility for any scenario,** and it gives employees the freedom to use their best judgment.****

> **Be Aware: “Best Interest” Is Subjective**
> 
> While Hastings’s “acting in the company’s best interest” policy makes room for flexibility, keep in mind that _your_ definition of “best interest” may differ from your employees’, and it’s thus arguably unfair to penalize them for doing what they think is best—even if their “best” option isn’t what _you_ would do.
> 
> As an example of how vague “best interest” policies can go wrong if people are unfairly penalized, the state of Montana previously didn’t have an explicitly stated numerical speed limit. Instead, the law simply stated that motorists should drive at a speed that was “reasonable and prudent.” However, police could ticket motorists, at their own discretion, for speeding—in effect, penalizing motorists for driving at the speed they felt was best.
> 
> The Montana Supreme Court eventually struck down the law, saying it was unconstitutionally vague, and that it was unfair to cite motorists for speeding when there weren’t specified limits to begin with. The immediate impact of this was Montana having _no_ laws policing speeding: arguably an untenable and dangerous situation.

#### Context: Employees Understand What’s Appropriate and Inappropriate

Without strict guidelines, employees need to understand the context of what their bosses consider appropriate and inappropriate so that they can make wise decisions.

  * For example, a manager may explain to an employee that expensing a pricey dinner and a bottle of wine with a client is in the company’s best interest, but ringing up a high bill for a department dinner meeting is over the line. 



At the most basic level, Hastings says, **employees should feel that they could confidently justify their purchase to their boss—because they may have to.**

(Shortform note: Some employees may disagree with the company’s idea of what’s appropriate and inappropriate—for example, they may think they “deserve” a pricey meal if they’re asked to work out of town on a weekend. To resolve any disagreement with your company’s policies, try using some negotiating tactics. For example, in _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss suggests the strategy of showing the other person how helping you achieve your desired solution will satisfy their own wants. In the case of the pricey meal, you can explain how the extra expense eats into the budget for the venue of the company’s summer outing.)

#### Safeguards: Managers Periodically Check Employees’ Expenses

While employees exercise their freedom to make travel plans and expense costs without pre-approval, they must know that there’s always a chance that their bosses could be watching. This means that managers must regularly check at least a sampling of employees’ expenses. On the back end, managers can safeguard against overspending in one of two ways:

**1) Managers can review their department’s receipts monthly** and, if they find any problematic expenses, they can discuss them with the employee directly. After one or two of these discussions, employees typically tighten up their spending.

(Shortform note: Regularly reviewing receipts can take up a lot of time and resources, especially if you’re taking the time to discuss expenses with your employees. Manually sifting through receipts increases operational costs by as much as 43 percent. Give yourself the most time possible to explain problematic spending to your employee and come up with solutions by automating the system. Use tools like cloud-based software that’s a virtual one-stop-shop for all things expense-related—aside from allowing employees to upload receipts and enabling managers to set spending limits, you can include a copy of the expense policy for easy reference.)

**2) Managers can defer to the company’s internal auditing department’s annual audit** of 10 percent of all expenses. If the auditing department finds that an employee is overspending, the employee is fired on the first offense. This option radically increases both autonomy and accountability.

(Shortform note: One U.K. study found that only 18 percent of employees who’ve padded their expense reports have ever been caught. To minimize expense fraud, be aware of the tactics employees typically use to inflate their business travel expenses, such as overstating gas expenses (by as much as 40 percent) or out-of-pocket expenses like restaurant tips and reimbursing expenses twice with two separate supervisors.)

#### Transparency: Everyone Knows When Someone Is Fired for Overspending

Despite managers’ efforts to explain context and outline the consequences of overspending, some people will still try to abuse the system. Meyer cites research that most people will cheat for their own gain if they think they won’t get caught, so employees must know that there is a very real possibility of getting caught—and that, if they do, there are very real consequences.

(Shortform note: It’s easy to think that no one in your company is the type of person to abuse the system, but people who cheat for their own gain aren’t necessarily bad people. They may have just found themselves in situations where people in general are more likely to cheat. Research shows that these situations include: being less connected to the cheating—for example, employees may be more willing to put a pricey dinner on a company’s tab because they aren’t actually stealing money; underestimating how much incentives can affect your judgment; and being too tired to resist temptation.)

**To reinforce the threat of getting caught, managers must tell their employees when someone is fired for overspending.** Although they don’t need to share the fired worker’s name, this kind of transparency is a critical ingredient for the freedom of abolishing travel and expense approvals.

(Shortform note: Even though Hastings and Meyer say that you should publicize these firings, there are certain things you should do as a manager to protect the dignity of the person being fired. Research suggests that making the effort to do so has a positive effect on the employee’s reaction—if they’re made to feel shame, they might view the firing as unfair and lash out by badmouthing the company. Allow them to leave with their dignity intact by not sharing the fired employee’s name to save them from embarrassment, and by not making a spectacle of the firing. Give them a chance to quietly pack up their belongings when other employees aren’t around.)

### Eliminating Controls Improves Workflow

When managers entrust employees with making their own travel and expense decisions—even when this freedom is reined in by relevant information, safeguards, and transparency—the company’s costs are typically a little higher than they would be if the company had an approvals process. However, Hastings contends that those costs are outweighed by the benefits of creating a low-rule environment. These benefits include:

#### 1) Flexibility

**Without a restrictive approval process, Hastings says that employees have the flexibility to react, problem-solve, and make decisions under any circumstances.** For example, when 4K resolution technology was new, Netflix partnered with Samsung to promote it. A tech product reviewer for _The_ _Washington Post_ agreed to test the new Samsung TV by watching _House of Cards_ —which could give both companies a big publicity boost—but the night before, a junior Netflix employee discovered the TV was missing from the Netflix offices. As it was after hours, he couldn’t reach his boss for approval to purchase a $2,500 TV.

Empowered with the mandate to act in the best interest of the company, the employee bought the TV and averted a crisis—and the positive review in the _Post_ was worth far more for Netflix than the cost of the last-minute purchase.

> **Stop Asking Employees to Front Money for the Company**
> 
> Hastings says that the absence of an approval process gives employees more flexibility. But this idea can feel unrelatable to many: While Netflix employees are paid handsomely enough to be able to spend $2,500 on a TV, this isn’t the reality for the average employee at other companies. Fronting cash for company expenses puts an unfair burden on employees who don’t have access to corporate cards or who may not have ready cash for urgent expenses. Employees might also be frustrated and stressed by the paperwork and time-consuming process to get their money back, while finance personnel may be uncomfortable if they’re forced to deny some expense claims.
> 
> To take the burden away from employees, replace your reimbursement system with a proactive expense policy: Implement a pre-approval process so that employees can spend company money without stress.

#### 2) Speed

Hastings says that the previous example illustrates the need to act quickly in order for employees to perform their jobs well. Approvals processes slow down the workflow, and sometimes the window of opportunity for an important purchase closes by the time the company has signed off on it.

(Shortform note: Employees must have good judgment to make sound decisions—like making big, urgent purchases—on the fly, so it’s important to improve your employees’ decision-making skills through training. One way to do this is to hold regular meetings to discuss complicated situations and ask the group to describe how they would handle each case.)

#### 3) Frugality

**The authors write that, paradoxically, employees often spend _less_ when they’re told to use their judgment than when they’re given concrete spending limits. **For example, if a company has a specific limit for how much employees can spend when they take clients out to dinner, the employees will be more likely to spend up to the limit because they know they’re in the clear as long as they don’t go over the limit. By contrast, if employees are told to use their judgment, they’re likely to spend more conservatively, because they know they have to answer for their spending choices.

(Shortform note: Additionally, being _too_ detailed when it comes to allowable amounts in various scenarios can backfire because employees might be overwhelmed by all the information and may need to constantly ask for guidance. Experts say that expense policies are most effective when they’re simple and easy to remember.)

> **How to Get Employees to Spend Less**
> 
> Netflix doesn’t make use of a bonus system, but other companies have attached bonuses and rewards to employees’ low spending. This serves to encourage employees to be frugal. For example, one financial services company gives employees 50 cents for every dollar they save when they choose cheaper options for business travel. Employees are thus rewarded for choosing coach over business class for their flights or an Airbnb instead of a pricey hotel for accommodations.
