## Exercise: Identify Your “Never Enough” Thoughts

Reflect on the obstacles keeping you from believing in your own inherent worth and the effect these obstacles have on your life.

* * *

Write down some of your “Never Enough” thoughts. Where in your life do you feel like you aren’t enough? Examples might be “I never feel successful enough” or “I never feel smart enough.”

Why do you feel this way? Do you compare yourself to others or compare your life to the “ideal” lives portrayed in the media?

How do your “never enough” thoughts affect your behavior? (For example, do you find yourself trying to hide the parts of you that feel inadequate? Or curating an ideal image of yourself for the world? Perhaps creating an overblown expression of yourself on social media, or putting a persona on in the workplace?)

How do these behaviors affect how you feel about yourself?

What kinds of experiences or activities help you feel most meaningfully connected? What is one new experience you can engage in today that will support your belief that you’re already “enough,” just as you are?
