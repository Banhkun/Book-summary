## Exercise: Shift From Aspiration to Practice

Think about our culture and the norms we’ve come to expect (perhaps consider one area--education, politics, workplace, family, and so on).

* * *

What do we praise? What do we reject?

Think about how these norms relate to you. Are there certain behaviors you’ve learned to avoid, or behaviors you know will garner you positive attention?

Consider this same area, or another area that resonates personally for you. What are some of your aspirational values? Are there any aspirational values that you have difficulty practicing consistently?

What is one thing you can do today to traverse that value gap?
