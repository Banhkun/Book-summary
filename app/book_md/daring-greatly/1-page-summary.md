## 1-Page Summary

We innately seek connection and belonging. Brené Brown describes this as the desire to live “Wholeheartedly.” Wholehearted living is characterized by behavior or beliefs that facilitate meaningful engagement and growth.

However, Wholehearted living is impeded by shame, which prevents you from accessing or expressing the vulnerability necessary for true connection. In _Daring Greatly_ , you’ll learn:

  * How shame shows up in your personal life, as well as the general collective
  * Why vulnerability is the solution to shame
  * How you protect yourself from your vulnerability
  * Ultimately, how to embrace vulnerability, so you can live a Wholehearted life. 



### The Three Irreducible Human Needs

Human beings need three things in order to feel happy and healthy: love, connection, and belonging. Unfortunately, we all face a number of obstacles on the path to meeting these needs, including our culture of scarcity, shame, and fear of vulnerability.

We’ll cover each of the obstacles, then look at Brown’s solutions for overcoming them in your own life and becoming Wholehearted.

#### Obstacle #1: Culture of Scarcity

The most prominent obstacle is the mentality of scarcity embedded in our culture. _Cultures of scarcity_ are infused with a constant sense or expectation of lack. There is “never enough” of anything, a constant focus on filling what feels like an empty cup. This has occurred in response to chronic, collective trauma on the broader scale, and has resulted in cultural post-traumatic stress. It manifests in three ways.

##### Manifestation #1: Shame

Shame is characterized by fear of not being worthy of love, connection, or belonging. In other words, it’s the internalized manifestation of “never enough” culture.

For example, sometimes one generation will shame another generation for their mistakes or perceived inadequacies. Consider the way the “Boomer” generation sees the “Millennial” generation as not being responsible or hard working enough (or vice versa, with Millennials viewing Boomers as not being flexible or adaptable enough).

##### Manifestation #2: Disengagement

Disengagement is lack of connection, whether it be a lack of willingness to connect, or an inability to connect. It is a type of burnout that arises from unsuccessfully seeking meaningful presence within a culture that is profoundly focused on what is not present.

For example, students and teachers alike struggle to meaningfully connect with one another, whether it be due to large class sizes that don’t allow for personal engagement or material taught for the purpose of passing a standardized test.

##### Manifestation #3: Comparison

To compare is to rank someone or something against another, and allow that ranking to determine value. Scarcity culture breeds comparison, because everyone is always comparing what they have (or lack) to what others have (or lack), whether that be material or emotional.

For example, you are bombarded on a daily basis with messages and images that encourage you to compare who you are, and what you have with that of others. Consider the woman who is constantly seeking the “perfect” body because she is comparing her body to pictures of women in magazines.

#### Obstacle #2: Shame

Shame is the most pervasive effect of scarcity culture. It causes you to fear that you will never be enough, and as a result, to fear that you are unworthy of belonging. Shame is woven into every aspect of our lives.

##### Individual Shame

You are confronted daily by cultural messaging that tells you that you are not good enough, not smart enough, not good-looking enough, and so on. You are told that all the ways in which you are not enough will end in rejection. As a result, you internalize the expectations of others, build a false self based on those expectations, and develop a deepening sense of inadequacy.

##### Relationship Shame

Healthy love is cultivated with vulnerability and trust. Intimacy is not possible without those things. Shame prevents vulnerability, and erodes trust. It is especially damaging in an intimate relationship, because when employed, it twists the sacredness of vulnerability into a weapon. Once this occurs, trust is damaged. If it becomes chronic, you have a recipe for destroying the entire foundation of intimacy.

##### Shame in the Workplace

Many work environments are shame-prone, as shame is often used as a management tool. This type of environment is unsustainable, and detrimental to employee self-esteem. If shame permeates a work culture for long enough, people eventually begin to throw up protective mechanisms. The most common result of this is disengagement, which causes risk aversion and impedes workplace innovation.

##### Shame at School

Shame-prone school environments are similar to shame-prone work environments, and they’re subject to the same pitfalls and destructive results. If students experience too much chronic shame they will eventually disengage from the learning process. This results in less connection to material and less of a willingness to be vulnerable enough to take risks. Learning requires both risk and meaningful engagement.

##### Shame at Home

Home is where the shame cycle ultimately begins. Children are deeply vulnerable, and dependent on their caretakers. Raising a child is rooted in doubt and uncertainty. These two components are a perfect foundation for shame development. When a child experiences shame, they feel unworthy of love. This makes them feel emotionally and physically unsafe. Children who are shamed will grow into adults who both internalize, and perpetuate shame culture.

#### Obstacle #3: Vulnerability Armor

Shame makes you fearful of vulnerability, and therefore, each of us utilizes a common arsenal of protective armors to prevent ourselves from engaging with it.

##### Armor #1: Foreboding Joy

This armor is characterized by happiness, followed by a sense of impending doom. Research shows that when you are not able to be present with vulnerability, you often feel exposed when experiencing positive emotions like joy, **because you are waiting for the other shoe to drop.** In this sense, joy causes you to feel immediately unsafe, so you never fully experience it.

For example, you might experience fear and sadness during the process of falling in love, because you are anticipating loss.

##### Armor #2: Perfectionism

Perfectionism is the false belief that shame is avoidable as long as you do everything correctly. It’s used for protection, but what it really protects is your authentic self, so you don’t have to let anyone see what you perceive to be your inadequacies. **The problem is, perfectionism seeks approval from external sources.** With your worth dependent on something outside of yourself, you lack the self-trust to take risks, or the ability to make mistakes without sinking into shame.

For example, you might be doing everything “right” to be the perfect partner in the hopes that you will never be broken up with, and be broken up with anyway. You may blame yourself, feeling shame because you weren’t “perfect enough.”

##### Armor #3: Numbing

To numb is to seek something that will ease or allow you to escape your pain. Numbing can take many forms, including substance abuse, unhealthy eating habits, workaholism, and so on. Anything that you use to escape is considered numbing. **It’s impossible to pick and choose what you numb, so the danger is that you will numb the entire spectrum of emotion, including the positive.**

For example, you might binge a show on netflix after a hard day, or spend extra hours at work to avoid an unhappy home life. These actions don’t address the root of the problem, and they may even keep you from experiencing the positive emotions that come from living life with awareness.

### What Are the Consequences of Leaving These Obstacles Unresolved?

When you are stuck in fear, shame, and lack, you cut off your ability to engage with life in a truly meaningful way. These obstacles ultimately prevent you from experiencing worthiness, connection, and belonging.

#### Solution #1: Develop Wholeheartedness

The best solution to the culture or practice of scarcity (the belief that there is never enough) is to develop a culture and practice of _Wholeheartedness_ (the belief that there has always been enough). Wholeheartedness allows you to live a fully connected life, and is the antithesis to scarcity. What are the results of Wholeheartedness?

  * **Wholehearted Individuals:** When you believe yourself to be enough, your sense of self depends on your own approval, and not the approval of others. This allows you to show up for yourself with courage and authenticity.
  * **Wholehearted Relationships:** When you know your worth, you are able to truly connect with others, build meaningful relationships, and experience real belonging.
  * **Wholehearted Workplaces:** When you develop Wholeheartedness as an employee or leader, you are able to engage in innovative risk taking, because you know you are enough. You don’t need to compare yourself to others, or protect yourself from criticism. 
  * **Wholehearted Schools:** Similarly to the above, Wholeheartedness facilitates meaningful engagement rooted in worthiness, which allows students to access courage, creative learning, and free themselves from comparing their learning process to the learning processes of their peers.
  * **Wholehearted Families:** When your home environment is rooted in Wholehearted values, you are able to demonstrate worthiness, self-compassion, and resilience to your children. Your children then grow into worthy, compassionate, and resilient adults.



#### Solution #2: Practice Shame Resilience

##### Step #1: Notice Shame and Identify Your Triggers

Observe your physical and psychological experience of shame, and identify common patterns. This serves the purpose of familiarizing you with your shame process so that you can begin to develop resilience.

##### Step #2: Develop Critical Awareness

Once you’ve observed and identified your shame patterns, inquire more deeply into them. Determine their value based on whether or not the thoughts, beliefs, or expectations they reveal align with reasonable reality, or stem from a desire to meet expectations outside of yourself. This is a way to practice introspective authenticity, and determine what is actually attainable.

##### Step #3: Reach Out and Connect

After you’ve explored critical awareness, it’s important to reach out to someone you trust, and share your experience. This demonstrates worthiness and facilitates belonging.

##### Step #4: Practice Speaking About Shame

The more comfortable you can become speaking about experiences of shame, the more you develop self-advocacy, which is a crucial part of practicing worthiness.

#### Solution #3: Embrace Vulnerability

##### Tool #1: Gratitude to Transform Foreboding Joy

Foreboding joy is rooted in fear and scarcity mentality. We fear the loss of it, and we worry there is a limit, or that we aren’t worthy of it. Practicing gratitude is a direct reminder that there absolutely is enough, and you yourself are also enough.

For example, notice when you experience fear during a joyful moment, and immediately speak gratitude about the moment of joy (aloud, if possible).

##### Tool #2: Self-Compassion to Transform Perfectionism

Perfectionism is about self-criticism. You can disarm it by practicing being kind to yourself instead of tearing yourself down.

For example, the next time you make a mistake, instead of beating yourself up, stop and say to yourself, “I did my best, and that’s okay,”

##### Tool #3: Mindfulness to Transform Numbing

Mindfulness is the perfect antidote to numbing, because it is about sitting with your experience as it unfolds. When you learn to be present with yourself, you can notice your numbing behaviors, and feel more empowered to make healthier choices.

For example, notice when you have the urge to distract yourself with something, whether it be media, work, or substances, and simply acknowledge to yourself that you’re experiencing discomfort.

Each of these tools can be applied to any of the common vulnerability armors.

### What Are the Benefits to Developing These Solutions?

The greatest benefit is that you get to cultivate the ability to show up authentically in every area of life with courage and vulnerability. This allows you to experience love, connection, belonging, and ultimately to build a truly meaningful life.
