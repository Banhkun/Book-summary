## Chapter 4, Part 2: Disarming the Armor

**You will not be able to remove your armor or shields until you are able to believe you are enough without them.** You need to give yourself permission to let the walls down, and trust in your worthiness. How do you give yourself permission to remove the protection? The good news is that each of these armor mechanisms can be overridden by taking actions that demonstrate worthiness. You can use the following tools to disarm your protective thoughts and behaviors.

### Disarming Tool #1: Foreboding Joy

**Instead of catastrophizing when joy arises, shift your perception, and allow the accompanying feeling of vulnerability to remind you what you have to be grateful for.**

Brown notes that gratitude is a common practice for the research participants who are able to embrace the vulnerability attached to joy. On an even deeper level, these same participants seem to see conscious gratitude and embracing joy as practices that allow you to trust in a greater thread of connection between yourself and your human experience, as well as yourself and a higher power.

#### Why Is Gratitude So Effective?

The motivating forces for foreboding joy are, unsurprisingly, fear and scarcity. You fear loss of joy, or fear your ability to recover from pain. You worry that joy has a limit, that there isn’t enough, or you aren’t good enough to receive it. Being joy averse has a great deal to do with feelings of unworthiness, so in this vein, practicing gratitude is a reminder that not only is there enough, but _you_ are enough.

#### How Can We Practice Embracing Joy?

There are three effective ways to practice embracing joy.

##### Practice #1—Recognize That Joy Is in the Ordinary Moments

Joy is not this extraordinary, constant state you can live in. Joy arises in the most mundane moments of your life, and scarcity mentality has you missing them, because you’re too focused on having a heightened experience, instead of being present with the experience that already exists in front of you.

##### Practice #2—Practice Gratitude

Those who have experienced tragic loss understand the importance of appreciating what you have when you have it. You can pay your respect to the reality of loss by honoring the joy that arises in your everyday experiences.

##### Practice #3—Embrace the Discomfort of Softening Into Joy

It’s impossible to prepare for or avoid pain. No amount of catastrophizing in advance will protect you from loss. Every time you do this, you lose the opportunity to develop resilience. Resilience is a cornerstone of hope, and you can build resilience by really allowing yourself to sink into moments of joy, even when you are fearful it will go away.

### Disarming Tool #2: Perfectionism

**Embrace imperfection, strive for excellence.**

No one is perfect. The healthy alternative to perfectionism is striving to be the best version of yourself, and allowing your own perception to determine this, rather than the perception of others. Perfectionism has a spectrum, but the way out is to shift from being other-focused to being self-focused. In other words, you stop thinking, “Do others think I am enough?” and start _trusting_ that you are enough. You can shift the above by cultivating self-compassion, developing shame resilience, and speaking your truth. Put another way, you can give yourself and your imperfections a damn rest, and maybe even see the beauty in them.

Dr. Kristen Neff defines three core components of self-compassion you can engage with to recover from perfectionism:

##### Component #1—Being Kind to Yourself

Resist the urge to engage in self-criticism. Practice being kind and supportive to yourself when experiencing moments of suffering or fears of not being enough.

##### Component #2—Remembering You’re Not Alone

Know that we are all in this together. There is nothing you can experience that has not been experienced by others, and you are never alone, even when it feels like it.

##### Component #3—Staying Present

Choose to react to negative emotions with a balanced presence. Understand that you don’t have to identify with them. When you over-identify, there is a tendency to be extreme, which causes you to either suppress, or blow up your emotions. Mindfulness allows you to stay centered, instead of being taken for a ride by your negative thoughts and feelings.

### Disarming Tool #3: Numbing

**You can disarm numbing by practicing mindfulness, healthy boundaries, and leaning into discomfort.**

#### Practice #1—Mindfulness

Mindfulness is quite simple. It’s about being present with your feelings and allowing yourself to really feel them. You can use mindfulness to notice, without judgment, that you are engaging in, or are about to engage in numbing behaviors. An example of this might be noticing that you’re experiencing anxiety, and then observing the impulse to binge-watch something on Netflix. When you are able to notice these things in the moment, you then have the ability to make a new choice.

#### Practice #2—Boundaries

Boundaries are about understanding and honoring your limitations, both internally and with others. With yourself, this might look like knowing a certain habit or behavior leads to numbing, and lovingly redirecting yourself to a healthier habit or behavior (for example, you want to smoke weed to avoid emotions, but instead, you write in a journal, or exercise). With others, this might look like knowing being around a certain person or in a certain environment is going to make you feel bad, so you choose not to be around that person or environment (for example, you don’t like bars, but your friend invites you to go. You let your friend know you’re grateful for the invite, but you’re going to pass on this one. Maybe you even offer an alternative activity you would both enjoy).

#### Practice #3—Leaning In

Leaning in means practicing being present with, or even moving towards emotions that cause discomfort, rather than avoiding them. This is not to say you should push yourself to remain in toxic environments, but leaning in is a great tool for working with challenging, but potentially transformative emotions like anxiety or frustration.

  * An example of leaning in: let’s say you’ve been dating someone for a while, and you have strong feelings for them. One day, they tell you they love you, and despite your feelings being mutual, you feel anxious. Leaning in means being present with that anxiety, but not avoiding it. You might instead take a deep breath and say, “It’s a little scary to admit, but I love you too.”



Practicing these tools allows you to fully experience your life, in all its shades, and develop a more engaged, wholehearted relationship with yourself and others.

### Disarming Tool #4: Victim vs. Viking

You can disarm this false dichotomy by utilizing the practices of restructuring your ideas of success, embracing vulnerability, and pursuing support.

#### Practice #1—Restructuring Success

What this looks like is examining your concept of success. What does success mean to you? If you have a victim/viking mentality, you will often find that your idea of success has arisen as a result of being in survival mode, rather than reflecting a personal value system. You can dismantle this by identifying your own personal idea of success.

  * An example: Maybe you thought you wanted to be the CEO of a company, because you grew up feeling powerless, and you think this title will make you feel powerful, even though it might not make you happy. You can examine this, and notice where the desire for the goal has originated: from a place of fear. Once you identify this, you can ask yourself “what kind of job would actually make me happy?” and proceed from there.



#### Practice #2—Embracing Vulnerability

You need to feel connection and belonging to survive, and you can’t experience that without being open to vulnerability. Vulnerability is something that can be practiced.

  * An example of practicing vulnerability in the context of a viking mentality might be simply admitting when something you’ve experienced is hurtful (maybe your partner makes fun of you, and instead of becoming angry or aggressive, you simply say “that hurt.”)
  * An example of practicing vulnerability in a victim mentality context might be setting a boundary (perhaps your partner yells at you, and instead of putting up with it or cowering, you say “this is not okay, you are not allowed to treat me like that”). 



#### Practice #3—Pursuing Connection

According to Brown, those who successfully made the shift from viking vs victim to wholeheartedness all credit the development of safe, healthy connections.

  * For example, there are programs that get veterans connected with volunteers who are willing to build long-term friendships with them--accompanying them to outings, doctor’s appointments, meals, and so on. This type of support allows the building of community, the sharing of vulnerability, and the cultivation of new life experiences (all components of wholehearted living).



Another way to develop trust and meaningful connection, especially if you have significant trauma at the root of your shielding, is to locate a good therapist or counseling program. This serves the purpose of providing professional psychological support or treatment, as well as provides a safe environment to begin building healthy, trusting connections.

### Disarming Tool #5: Oversharing

Oversharing, which has two types of expression, require slightly different disarming approaches.

#### Disarming Tool #5a: Floodlighting

You disarm this version of oversharing by developing awareness around your needs, and establishing appropriate boundaries for your sharing. You can do this by keeping three rules in mind:

##### Rule #1—Only share what you have already processed through, and feel grounded about.

  * Example: it’s appropriate to share a personal trauma if you have been, say, working through that trauma with a therapist and feel emotionally prepared to begin speaking about it with others you trust. 



##### Rule #2—Only share if the sharing will progress a relationship, or situation in a healthy way.

  * Example: Your close friend tells you that they want to talk about a sexual assault they experienced, but they are afraid no one will understand. You tell them they are not alone, and share that you’ve experienced that type of trauma too. You don’t offer details, but you let them know that you understand, and are there for them to talk to about it.



##### Rule #3—Only share if the motivation is _not_ to get an unfulfilled need met.

  * Example: Your child gets in trouble with the police for underrage drinking, and is feeling ashamed. You tell them a funny story from when you were their age and got caught for the same thing. You told them this, not to make yourself feel better, but to connect with them and let them know they don’t need to be ashamed.



If you’re not sure whether or not to share, consider these questions before you do:

  * Why do I want to share?
  * What reaction am I looking for?
  * What feelings am I feeling?
  * What reaction am I afraid of?
  * Do I have any needs around this I haven’t met?
  * Am I sharing to genuinely connect, or to get a need met?



#### Disarming Tool #5b: Vulnerability Blast

Disarming the vulnerability blast can be done in the same way as above--checking your intentions, expectations, and fears prior to sharing--as well as asking yourself these additional questions:

  * What need is at the root of my desire to share?
  * Am I seeking connection, attention, or a reaction?
  * Is this the healthiest way I can share?



### Disarming Tool #6: Zigzagging

The best way to disarm this shield is by:

Maintaining presence and forward motion. You can resist the temptation to avoid, stay with whatever is arising that makes you uncomfortable, and confront it head on.

  * Example: You have a fight with your partner, and all you want to do is pour yourself a drink and forget about it, but instead, you sign up for a meditation class that evening, which allows you to sit with and be present with your emotions. Afterwards, you call your partner and the two of you calmly resolve your conflict.



Injecting a healthy sense of humor. Laughter serves as both a reminder to breathe, as well as a tension release. Humor is a great way to disarm resistance and engage with vulnerability.

  * Example: You get a DUI, and instead of wallowing in shame or avoiding thinking about it, you google stand-up comedy bits about DUIs. Not only do you get to release tension, but it serves the double purpose of reminding you that you’re not alone.



### Disarming Tool #7: Too Cool for School

This is a tricky one to disarm, because at the root, the “too cool” shield is about caring too much about what others think. There are two sides to the coin here. You don’t want to overly identify with what others think, because vulnerability is impeded, but dismissing what others think prevents connection. You can address this by practicing the steps of shame resilience, as detailed in Chapter 3, notably, critical awareness, and reaching out.

  * Example: Your boss yells at you about not completing your work when you said you would, and calls you “useless.” Walking the line in this context would mean acknowledging that you broke your word, but reminding yourself (and perhaps your boss) that you are a valuable employee, and worthy of respect. You also call a close friend or trusted coworker and share the experience with them. They provide you with empathy, perhaps sharing a similar story of their own, and remind you of your worthiness.



Moving away from shielding and towards vulnerability is possible only when you believe you are enough. To sum it up simply, the solution looks like:

#### Step 1. Moving from shame to worthiness

You can do this by deciding you are enough as you are.

  * Example: You’re dating someone who comments often about your weight, and wants you to meet their weight standards, even though you’re at a healthy weight. Instead of giving in to shame, you decide your body is beautiful the way it is, and celebrate all that you love about it.



#### Step #2. Moving from comparison to healthy internal boundaries

You need to set healthy internal boundaries that allow you to be separate and whole. You can do this by determining you’ve had enough.

  * In the same example from above, determining you’ve had enough means resisting the urge to compare your body to bodies that meet your partner’s expectations, and if they don’t like it as it is, telling them they can go date someone else.



#### Step #3: Moving from disengagement to engagement

You can do this by allowing it to be enough for you to show up, embrace discomfort, and show people who you really are, even when it’s scary and feels vulnerable.

  * Example: You have a date, but you’re really nervous and have the urge to cancel because you’re afraid your date won’t like you as you are. Instead of canceling, you lean in to the fear, show up for the date, and allow yourself to be authentic, even though you’re nervous.



You can’t live wholeheartedly without experiencing and expressing vulnerability, and you can’t do either of those things if you’re armoring yourself with habits, beliefs, or behaviors that erect a barrier between you and the rest of the world, or internal barriers that prevent you from being fully present with yourself. If you want to be fully connected, you must remove those barriers, and engage with difficult experiences and emotions from a place of resilience.
