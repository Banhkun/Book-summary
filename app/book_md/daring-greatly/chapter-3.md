## Chapter 3: Make Shame Make Sense

In chapter 1, you learned that vulnerability is a requirement for living a wholehearted life, and identified shame as a core obstacle to vulnerability. In chapter 3, you’ll take a deep dive into shame. You’ll explore:

  * What shame is
  * How it shows up in your life
  * Why it's an obstacle to living wholeheartedly
  * The best way to work through it



### What Is Shame, and Why Is It so Powerful?

_Shame_ is **the fear of not being worthy of connection and belonging**. It is _the fear that you are not enough_ and will be rejected for your weaknesses. It overtakes the prefrontal cortex, and initiates your fight or flight response. Instead of being able to think critically or analyze the legitimacy of a threat, you are thrust into survival mode.

#### Why Is Shame So Bad?

  1. Once the shame cycle begins, you really only have three options: fight, freeze, or run. In terms of human behavior, this might look like aggression, numbing, or people pleasing. 
  2. Being in this type of survival mode prevents you from connecting meaningfully with yourself and others, which impedes your ability to live wholeheartedly. 
  3. It’s common to confuse guilt, shame, embarrassment, and humiliation. It’s important that you understand the difference, because each sends a different message, and you want to focus on internalizing messages that help you move away from shame, rather than towards it. What is the difference? 


  * Shame: I did a terrible thing and I am a terrible person.
  * Guilt: I did a terrible thing, and I feel responsible, but I’m not a terrible person. 
  * Humiliation: I am being treated terribly for doing something, but I do not deserve it _._
  * Embarrassment: I did something that made me feel**** terrible, but is not actually terrible, and I know I’m not alone. 



Of the four terms, guilt and shame are the most relevant to wholeheartedness. **Shame in particular is toxic, and prevents wholeheartedness, because it conflates your behavior with who you are, corroding your belief in your ability to grow.** It also impedes action, because it makes you believe that if you do something bad, you are inherently bad, which prevents you from feeling like it’s possible to change. Therefore, shame is inherently destructive.

### Categories of Shame

Brown’s research identified 12 categories of shame that fall under three core themes.

##### **Body Image and Health**

  1. Mental and physical health: Fear of not having a fit enough body, not being strong enough, not being smart enough, and so on.
  2. Addiction: Fear of never feeling happy enough, or alive enough, or peaceful enough.
  3. Sex: Fear of unworthiness, or fear of being ugly.
  4. Aging: Fear of no longer being loved and admired for looks, or fear of mind deterioration.
  5. Appearance and body image: Fear of not having the right weight, the right make-up, clothes, and so on.



##### **Relationships**

  1. Motherhood or Fatherhood: Fear of being unprepared or unable to identify with the role of mother or father.
  2. Parenting: Fear of not being a good enough parent, not nurturing enough, or not respectable enough.
  3. Family: Fear of judgment, fear of loss, fear of not being stable enough, and so on. 
  4. Surviving trauma: Fear of not being safe, not being worthy of love, or not being connected enough.
  5. Religion: Fear of not being a good enough person, or fear of punishment.



##### **Social Status**

  1. Money and work: Fear of not having enough money, being criticized in front of coworkers, having to file for unemployment, and so on.
  2. Being stereotyped or labeled: Fear of not being fully seen, or fear of judgment.



What shame feels like is, for the most part, universal to all. That being said, the societal norms and cultural messaging at the root of shame tend to be gender-specific.

### Women and Shame

The expectation for women in our society is “be perfect, and make it look easy.” They’re caught in a catch-22. Be sexy, but only at the right times. Be honest, but don’t upset anyone. Be yourself, but only the good parts. Every choice leads to shame.

Women experience the most shame around appearance and body image, with motherhood clocking in at the number two spot. **And it doesn’t even matter if you don’t have kids—the value of a woman in our culture is still tied to motherhood.** Single women are often asked when they will be finding a spouse, and the only reason this question is asked is because marriage is seen as the first step to becoming a mother. Once married, the question becomes, “When are you having kids?” Once you have kids, the judgment begins, and the arising of shame is inevitable.

##### **Core Feminine Norms**

  * Be hot
  * Be thin
  * Be nice
  * Be humble
  * Be nurturing
  * Be in a relationship
  * Be sexual (but only with your partner)
  * Be effortless



It doesn’t matter if we intellectually understand that these expectations may be sexist or destructive, we still abide by them, and shame is what keeps them thriving. Later in the chapter, you’ll learn how to confront shame and find new ways to show up.

### Men and Shame

**No matter the category of shame, the message for men is “weakness is not an option.”** What, for men, falls under the umbrella of weakness?

  * Being afraid
  * Being nice
  * Being emotional



If you’re a man in our society, you are expected to show no weakness, but you are also expected to be seen as powerful at all times. It often results in a dichotomy akin to the insecure man with the loud, expensive car. **The misguided belief is this: If you’re loud, aggressive, and powerful, no one will see your weak spots.** Research notes that for men, the experience of fear or shame is very physiological, and their reactions to it are often very visceral, as opposed to women, who may process those emotions more cerebrally. Men generally have one of two reactions when they feel shame.

#### Male Shame Response #1: Anger

Anger is considered one of the only acceptable emotions for men to feel and express. When they experience the pain or fear of shame, expressing anger is a way for them to regain their sense of power.

An example might be a young man in high school being bullied by his peers. Let’s say his peers call him names meant to diminish his masculinity and highlight his “weakness” (a common one is “pussy”). He might, to save face, get into a physical fight with these peers. If he can shut them up with his anger, it has a twofold effect: he has “proven them wrong” and he is now the one with the power.

#### Male Shame Response #2: Numbness

If a man doesn’t want to express anger, he will typically shut his emotions down entirely as an alternative. Numbness involves suppressing emotions partially or completely.

For example, this might look like the man who, when faced with conflict at home, retreats to his office and shuts the door. Or, the man who, to avoid inner conflict, smokes a ton of weed to deaden his emotional reactivity.

#### Men and Shame Regarding Women

Research also shows women are actually major reinforcers of male shame. **How so?** They enact their own double standard, and criticize men for their lack of vulnerability, while simultaneously fearing that same vulnerability when it’s revealed. This fear can often communicate disillusionment, or even disgust, driving home the notion that expressing vulnerability is shameful. The message received? **Pretend to be vulnerable, but never be truly vulnerable.**

Another surprising thing discovered in research groups was the evidence that men feel quite vulnerable when it comes to sex. **Why?** Men are socialized to believe themselves responsible for making the first move sexually. Therefore, being sexually rejected is considered the ultimate male shame. Women are often concerned about how they are being physically perceived by men in a sexual scenario, but it turns out, men are more concerned with the emotional aspect of the experience.

Considering all this, it’s fair to say that part of the shame problem in romantic relationships is the fear and misunderstanding in the space between the male and female experience of shame. Later, when you learn about solutions, you’ll revisit this gap.

### What Happens When Shame Runs Rampant?

There are significant consequences to being part of a culture where shame is rampant. You internalize it, believe what it tells you about who you are, and act on those beliefs. Or, you fight against what it tells you and spend your life trying to prove it wrong. Either way, it controls you and prevents you from accessing a strong sense of self-worth.

#### What’s the Problem With Internalizing Shame?

You are unable to connect to your wholeheartedness. The effect of this is threefold:

  1. **Dependency:** Your self-worth becomes dependent on what others think of you, and because your worth is dependent on something external, you are not able to step into your most wholehearted self, and you are always at the mercy of external forces.
  2. **Risk aversion:** **In order to avoid pain, you take fewer risks**. Eventually, you may even decide taking risks isn’t worth it and stop trying entirely. Your life feels precarious, like a house of cards, at risk of crumbling if you stop people-pleasing the way shame requires.
  3. **Blocked Creativity & Innovation**: In a broader context, the internalization of shame kills both creativity and innovation. How so? Shame exacerbates fear. As mentioned above, when you’re afraid, you avoid taking risks. **Risks are a necessity for creativity and innovation.**



### Antidotes to Shame

There are three main antidotes to shame.

#### Antidote #1: Worthiness

  * From a place of worthiness, you can take risks, because your sense of self is not dependent on external approval. 



What is possible when your self-worth isn’t constantly at risk?

  * You can access courage more readily
  * You are willing to show people who you truly are



#### **Antidote #2: Separating** Y**ourself** F**rom** Y**our** F**ailure**

It’s crucially important that you learn to separate failure from your self-worth if you want to live a wholehearted life. **Failure is unavoidable, and if you allow every mistake you make to diminish you, you’ll never lead a life that feels fully expressed**.

Guilt, you might be surprised to find, is a healthier way to process your behavior, because it distinguishes your behavior as separate from who you are, allowing you the space to grow. It’s also actionable, because the discomfort of your actions not matching your values motivates conscious change. This discomfort ultimately supports wholeheartedness.

#### Antidote #3: Shame Resilience

How do you allow yourself to share shame with others when you’re afraid of their judgment or rejection? _Shame resilience_. Shame resilience is the ability to recognize when you’re experiencing shame, to move away from that lens, and to consciously engage with empathy. Shame resilience is the key to embracing your vulnerability.

### The 4 Steps of Shame Resilience

There are four steps to practicing shame resilience.

#### Step #1. Recognize Shame and Understand Its Triggers

Given that shame has biological roots, this first step is about noticing your experience of it. It’s often helpful to try being present with the physical experience first. For example, how does your body feel when you’re feeling shame? Is there a tightness in your chest? A sensation of hot or cold? Are these physical responses a reaction to a specific thought or external message?

You can also use context clues to determine when you’re in a state of shame. Are you behaving differently around different people? If so, notice how you feel in each environment. Do you feel present? Disconnected?

**The benefit of becoming aware within your experience of shame is that you’ll begin to notice repeating patterns, familiarize yourself with the associated sensations, and identify their triggers.** This allows you to demystify the origin of your shame, and empowers you to move to the next step of developing resilience.

#### Step #2: Practice Critical Awareness

This step is about taking a closer look at the thoughts, beliefs, or expectations that trigger your shame, and shining a critical light upon them.

Are the messages based in reality, or are they unreasonable? Would conceding to them align with who you are, or would you be living up to someone else’s expectations?

**Practicing critical awareness allows you to differentiate between what is attainable and unattainable, or authentic and inauthentic.** Once you do this within yourself, you’re ready to check in with others that you trust (detailed in the next step).

#### Step #3: Reach Out

When you’re in shame, empathy is an important part of the antidote, and you need to connect with others in order to facilitate that. Once you have developed critical awareness around an experience, you can reach out to a trusted friend or family member and share how you’re feeling. This is critical because it supports you to know that you are worthy of being heard, and that you are not alone.

#### Step #4: Speaking Shame

The final step is to become comfortable with speaking about shame, not just for the purpose of receiving empathy, but to advocate for your needs. This allows you to practice worthiness, which is a cornerstone of Wholeheartedness.

##### Why Is It so Helpful to Talk About Shame?

Shame wants you to stay silent and feel alone. The very experience of shame causes you to question your worthiness for being seen. **When you speak about shame, you are communicating to yourself and others: “I am worthy of love, connection, and belonging.”**

How does practicing shame resilience positively impact your relationships? As discussed earlier, there seems to be a lack of understanding between men and women in regards to shame. That misunderstanding hinders intimacy. Being able to engage in shame resilience alone, as well as together, allows men and women to build a bridge to one another (instead of remaining polarized in a gendered cycle of fear or false assumptions).

Shaming a loved one is one of the most serious trust violations you can engage in. Each time you misuse the trust and vulnerability you’ve cultivated by engaging in shaming behavior, you have done something that will be difficult to repair. When you practice shame resilience, you begin to reach towards others instead of moving against or away from others.

Shame resilience allows you to cultivate real, loving connections, where you engage in open, honest communication, and allow yourself to be truly seen and known. **Love, like shame resilience, is a practice, and when you develop resilience, you have the ingredients to feel deep connection and belonging in your relationships.** Along those lines, the most valuable result of developing shame resilience is your ability to become “real”. To be “real” is to reveal yourself to others in all your power and vulnerability, and feel that you are known, that you are loved, and that you belong.

Shame is the greatest obstacle to experiencing a Wholehearted life. In order to move beyond shame, you need to be willing to embrace vulnerability, and develop shame resilience. This allows you to show up authentically and facilitates meaningful connection, self-worth, and belonging.
