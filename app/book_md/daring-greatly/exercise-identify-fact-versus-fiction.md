## Exercise: Identify Fact Versus Fiction

Consider the myths that resonate with you and the steps you can take to confront them.

* * *

In what ways do these myths resonate? For example, are you someone who prefers to “go it alone,” or who considers vulnerability avoidable? Do you view darker emotions as weaknesses?

Think about one myth you most relate to. How do you think you came to believe it? Can you recall an early experience that may have influenced your belief?

What is one action you can take today to challenge that myth?
