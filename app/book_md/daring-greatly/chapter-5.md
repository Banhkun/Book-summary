## Chapter 5: Mind the Gap, Build the Bridge

In the previous four chapters, you learned the core obstacles to living a wholehearted life, and a number of ways to overcome these obstacles. In the final three chapters, you will explore the greater context of these concepts as they relate to some of the most significant areas of modern society: culture, education, work, and parenting.

In order to transform a culture into a wholehearted one, you need to address the discrepancy between your ideal values and the values you actually demonstrate. In chapter 5, you will identify how you want to show up, as well as how you show up in practice, and explore the importance of closing the gap between the two (on a personal and collective scale).

### What Does It Mean to “Mind the Gap”?

To mind the gap is to have a clear understanding of where you’re at, a clear vision of where you want to be, and the willingness to traverse the space between. In the context of _Daring Greatly_ , “mind the gap” is a message for the leaders of our society (parents, educators, innovators, and so on) that the discomfort caused by the gap between how you want to show up, and how you actually show up is necessary and transformative.

  * An example of a gap: Let’s say you’re an educator, and you have a large class of students. You want to give each student time and attention according to his or her needs, but in practice you become easily overwhelmed by the size of the class, and settle for taking a generic, across the board approach to your teaching. You want one result, in theory, but in practice, you have another. 



There are two gaps to close in our culture.

### Gap #1: Strategy vs. Culture

The gap is characterized by a disconnect between the strategies we use to achieve cultural goals, and the actual cultural environment in reality.

_Strategy_ : The method or plan for achieving a goal. You might say strategy is part of “how we want to show up”. Everyone utilizes strategy. Families utilize it to achieve life milestones like having a baby or moving across the country, religious groups use it to build their congregation, and teachers use it to facilitate student learning goals.

_Culture_ : Culture, or as Brown calls it, “the way we do things around here,” is defined by what behavior is acceptable within the collective. You might call culture “how we show up in practice”. Culture is made up of social contracts that formulate the status quo. From a goal-oriented standpoint, it’s less about the goal or the strategy of achieving it, and more about who or what the goal serves.

When we don’t find a way to align strategy and culture, we experience a greater societal disconnect, which prevents our ability to engage with one another in wholehearted ways on the broader scale.

#### How Can We Gain Insight Into the Culture of Any Group?

In order to see the gap between a society’s strategy and culture, you need to first understand what the culture of that society _is_. You can learn a lot about any particular culture by asking some key questions.

  * What actions are praised or rejected?
  * Where are people focusing their time, money, and attention?
  * What agreements are in place? Rules everyone follows? Rules everyone breaks? 
  * Do people feel able to safely express themselves and/or advocate for their needs?
  * Are there any stories beloved to the group? What values do they reflect?
  * What happens when someone messes up?
  * How do people react to the idea of being vulnerable?
  * Is there a lot of blame? Shame? In what ways?
  * How do people feel about discomfort? Threatened? Curious? 



### Gap #2: Aspirational Values vs. Practiced Values

According to Brown, the biggest cause of problems in our families, our schools, and our greater communities is disengagement. The root of this is the gap between who we say we want to be, and how we actually show up. These two ends of the spectrum reflect _aspirational values_ versus _practiced values_.

_Aspirational values_ reflect how you want to show up, how you see yourself, or values you want to live by.

_Practiced values_ reflect how you actually show up, how others receive you, and values you demonstrate through your actions or behaviors.

#### How Can You See This Gap in Our Society?

_Social contract disengagement_ : This type of disengagement occurs when, in various areas of society, your aspirational values do not match up with your practiced values.

**School:** Students disengage when the relationship between student and teacher is not reciprocal.

  * Consider the earlier example in which you’re an educator with a large class of students. You want to teach each student deeply (your aspirational value), but you become overwhelmed with the number of students, give up, and end up teaching the whole class at more of a surface level (your practiced value). The result of this is that the students disengage, because the depth of reciprocity they are receiving does not match the depth of their need. 



**Work:** You end up with a disconnected work environment when the relationship between the employees and the employer is not one of mutual respect and engagement.

  * Example: Let’s say you are a hardworking employee, and you consistently do high-quality work. You are used to receiving praise from your boss for this good work. Due to a family stressor, you have an off week, and make mistakes. Not only does your boss not respond with understanding, or concern, but they reduce your hours and criticize you in front of your coworkers. The respect from employer to employee, in this case, is conditional. The employer does not uphold their end of the social contract.



**Politics:** When lawmakers create rules they don’t follow, or claim to stand for values they don’t demonstrate in practice, voters lose trust and disengage.

  * Consider how often politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum speak of the importance of unity, but then tear each other apart in reality. The value they claim to care about (unity) is overshadowed by the reality they actually demonstrate (division). 



**Family:** When parents hold their children to standards or require behaviors they aren’t demonstrating themselves, kids lose investment in the standards being set, and perhaps eventually, the relationships with their parents, too.

  * An example would be if mom and dad try to teach their children to speak respectfully to others, but they are constantly putting each other down and engaging in unhealthy communication patterns. The kids will stop caring about those standards, because their parents aren’t demonstrating those standards in practice.



**Religion:** Religious leaders who preach about spiritual values, but don’t hold themselves to those values, communicate to devotees that those values are not actually important. Additionally, religious leaders who utilize fear and punishment as tools for enforcing compliance to those values corrode the very notion of faith, as faith requires vulnerability, and fear impedes it.

  * An example might be a leader of a religious cult. Let’s say the leader preaches the value of faith, but instead of allowing devotees to discover their own personal relationship with faith, the leader outlines a strict set of rules detailing how devotees can prove their faith. This invalidates the concept of faith, which is rooted in exploring the unstructured, and unknown, in favor of blind compliance to a specific set of restrictions. 



### How Does Closing These Gaps Benefit You?

Aligning who you want to be with how you show up practice keeps you meaningfully engaged and connected individually and as a society. When all areas of culture have aspirational values that match practiced values, a shift can be made from a disengaged, shame ridden culture, to a culture of Wholeheartedness, where everyone feels a sense of value and belonging.

#### How Do We Close Them?

If you want our cultural environment (what our collective experience actually is) to match the intention behind our strategies (what we want the collective experience to be), we need to, on a broad scale, find a way to align our aspirational values with our practiced values. This means engaging in thoughts and behaviors that reflect Wholehearted values, and steadily developing this broader alignment in our homes, schools, and other organizations.

Culture doesn’t always reflect the values you want to embody, leaving a disconnect where you need conscious engagement. If you want to address this, you need to look more closely at the areas of society where there is evidence of disengagement, and identify where your aspirational values and practiced values are out of alignment. You can close these gaps by practicing Wholehearted values. In Chapter 6, you’ll explore in more detail what it takes to do that, and who is responsible for taking action.
