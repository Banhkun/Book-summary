## Chapter 4, Part 1: Vulnerability and Armor

In the previous chapter, you learned about shame, and how it is an obstacle to vulnerability, preventing you from experiencing a wholehearted life. In part one of this chapter, you’ll learn about another significant obstacle to vulnerability: the “armor” you wear for protection. In part two, you’ll explore how to remove this false protection and embrace the vulnerability you’ve been shielding.

### Why Do You Protect Yourself From Vulnerability?

Vulnerability isn’t something that feels safe to lead with—most would prefer to keep it hidden (though it’s equally common to admire when others lead with it). We are afraid of what makes us feel most vulnerable, and we are especially afraid of allowing others to see those areas. If you don’t trust that you’re worthy of being seen as you are, your fear can cause you to live with protective armor to a point where, not only do your loved ones not know who you truly are, but _you_ might not even know who you truly are.

Everyone protects the masks they wear, and often in similar ways. You can call this our _Common Vulnerability Armor_.

#### Armor #1—Foreboding Joy

The feeling you get when you’re happy, but the happiness is followed quickly by a sense of dread.

  * An example might be realizing you are in love, and then immediately experiencing the fear of loss, or experiencing the joy of giving birth to a child and then feeling the fear of not being a good enough parent.



Research shows that, rather than feeling most vulnerable when experiencing negative emotions, you may actually feel most vulnerable when experiencing positive emotions---particularly joy. Brown actually describes joy as being one of the most difficult emotional experiences to fully access, because when you are unable to face your vulnerability, you are also unable to meet joy with gratitude or excitement, or any positive emotion. You instead feel unsafe and suspicious. You literally begin to dread the experience of joy and plan for disaster. “Too good to be true” becomes an internalized mantra.

The greatest danger with this shield is the way you can slip into experiencing life through a lens of perpetual disappointment, to a point where you don’t even feel joy, you just expect pain. **The tragedy of this is that you become starved for joy, but unable to be with the vulnerability that would allow you to access it.** All you’re really doing when you feed foreboding joy is trying to avoid being surprised by pain. You would rather practice the expectation of it, than be “caught with your pants down”, so to speak.

#### Armor #2—Perfectionism

The self-destructive belief that you can avoid shame if you do everything in life exactly right.

  * An example would be overachieving in school to avoid the shame of not feeling worthy enough or smart enough, or people-pleasing in our relationships at our own expense, to avoid conflict or rejection.



It’s common to believe that perfectionism is protecting you, when in reality, it is preventing the world from seeing who you truly are. Perfectionism is about approval. If you struggle with perfectionism, it’s likely you were rewarded for this behavior from an early age. The risk of being rewarded for perfectionism is that you eventually come to see your identity as directly determined by your accomplishments or validation from external sources. **Striving for perfection is a recipe for anxiety, depression, and addiction. It causes you to feel unable to take risks, make mistakes, or disappoint people without becoming debilitated by shame.** Perfectionism is also addictive because you associate your experiences of shame with not being good enough. This becomes a vicious cycle of blaming yourself for your shame, which causes more shame, which causes you to strive even harder to be perceived by others as perfect.

#### Armor #3—Numbing

The reaching for anything that will allow you to escape from pain.

  * An obvious example is substance abuse, but other forms of numbing are overeating, vegging out in front of the television, or keeping yourself constantly busy.



Interestingly, it seems that we all engage in numbing. Perhaps not to the point of addiction, but certainly enough that we engage in behaviors that devalue our resilience and suppress our vulnerability. Why are we numbing ourselves? It’s more than just avoidance of pain or feelings of inadequacy. We are desperate to experience either less or more of ourselves. So desperate, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death in the United States.

##### The Driving Forces For Numbing

**Force #1—Anxiety**

Anxiety arises as a result of social discomfort, and constant, unpredictable societal expectations.

**Force #2—Disconnection**

Often mixed up with depression in the research, but encompasses a number of experiences ranging from feelings of meaninglessness, disengagement, and social isolation. Disconnection creates deep pain because of our biological need for connection. Combine this with the unworthiness at the core of shame, and there is a high probability of numbing.

**Force #3—Shame**

This comes into play when you become so overwhelmed by the above factors that you begin to internalize everything as a result of your own weakness or inherent inability to cope (in other words, “if I could just get it together..”)

Numbing is dangerous because it prevents, once again, not just negative emotions, but positive ones as well. **It’s not possible to numb selectively.**

### The Four Shields

The above are pieces of armor everyone utilizes, but there are additional forms of protection you can pick up as well, though these are less common. They’re called _Shields._

#### Shield #1—Viking Mentality vs. Victim Mentality

**Viking:** Being the one with the power, usually through aggression and control. Never revealing vulnerabilities.

**Victim:** Being the one without the power, due to inherent weakness. Always feeling weak.

Those who use this shield see people in black and white (predators or prey, fighters or runners, strong or weak, and so on), and as a result, tend toward either the viking or victim mentality. Most of the time, those with viking mentality have led difficult lives in which they were forced to “eat or be eaten,” so to speak. This can be a result of surviving trauma (for example, abusive households), but also a result of education they may have received in their chosen career path (such as military or law enforcement). Those in professions correlated with viking versus victim mentality often have high rates of trauma-related behavior, like violence or addiction.

This is very prominent in our military veterans upon returning home from the battlefield. Experts on the subject acknowledge the lose-lose nature of military training, which emphasizes suppression of pain (both emotional and physical), and bypassing fear, in order to create a controlled internal state in combat. While it works for the battlefield, the high level of internal pressure also increases depression, addiction, and suicidal inclinations. Even in lower risk professions, like the field of law, the mentality is the same, and results in the same adverse effects.

Men make up the majority with this worldview, as men are typically more likely to be socialized to “win or lose,” but women are not immune.

Something that emerged in the research was that people who came to this perspective as a result of hardship didn’t see the resulting difficulties in their lives (such as addiction or anger management issues) as negative results related to this mentality, but instead saw them as misfortunes caused by the terrible nature of life, and therefore as confirmation that the mentality is both necessary and sound.

If you’re not of the “viking” mentality, you are still negatively impacted. Why? Believing yourself to be a “victim” only reinforces the dichotomy of extremes--you are either the one with the power, or without. This is limiting no matter which end of the spectrum you identify with. It leaves no room for the courage or vulnerability required for meaningful growth and change.

#### Shield #2—Oversharing

As detailed in chapter 2, oversharing is one of those things that is often seen as vulnerability, but in fact impedes true vulnerability, preventing healthy trust, connection, and engagement. There are two forms of oversharing in the context of shielding.

##### Shield #2a—Vulnerability Blast

This shield is characterized by sharing vulnerability with people you have not built a trusted connection with. You are, perhaps, hoping to establish fast intimacy by bonding through sharing of personal pain. **Unfortunately, if there isn’t an established relationship in which there is trust and empathy that goes both ways, the reaction to sharing vulnerability can reinforce shame.** It has the effect of being blasted with something intense and unexpected, and it usually results in feelings of rejection (for the sharer) and feeling overwhelmed (for the receiver). It can even cause the receiver to feel like they’ve been conned in some way. No matter the specific impact, a vulnerability blast usually results in disconnection and disengagement, which creates or reinforces shame.

  * Example: You are on a first date. Without being prompted by the natural flow of conversation, you tell your date about an intense trauma you experienced in childhood. Instead of responding with empathy, your date seems to recoil in discomfort. For the rest of the time, there is a bit of a wall up between you. You feel rejected, they seem disinterested. You don’t get a second date, and you feel ashamed for opening up.



##### Shield #2b—Hit and Run

The previous form of oversharing is a misguided attempt to use vulnerability as a tool for fast connection. The hit and run uses vulnerability for the purpose of manipulation. Another phrase for it is attention-seeking.**It’s characterized by sharing intense information without regard for boundaries, with the intention of getting a reaction from others, whether it be sympathy, attention, or something else.** It usually reeks of desperation, and people tend to get the “hit” they need and disappear without building any real connection.

  * Example: Consider the rising celebrity who is desperate for more fans. They might share an Instagram post about something deeply personal, like a trauma, but there is something inauthentic and performative about the way it’s shared. Maybe it's shared via video, and they appear to be crying, but there are no actual tears. Maybe they exaggerate the details and those who see the post have heard different versions of the same story. Either way, there is something off. 



#### Shield #3—Zigzagging

Zigzagging is what you do when you expend tons of energy avoiding vulnerability instead of just dealing with it, which often requires far less energy. What are some common forms of zigzagging?

##### Form #1—Trying to control your environment in order to avoid vulnerability

  * Example: You want to break up with your partner, but you are unable to gather the courage to be vulnerable enough to do so directly. Instead, you provoke your partner by treating them badly until they break up with you.



##### Form #2—Pretending you don’t care

  * Example: You get broken up with, and this makes you feel rejected, but instead of letting yourself process your feelings, you stuff them down and tell everyone you wanted to break up too, and you’re glad it happened.



##### Form #3—Pretending you don’t know what’s going on

  * Example: You steal money from your mom’s purse. She notices, and suspects you, but you feel too ashamed to admit you’re wrong, so you act like you have no idea what she’s talking about.



##### Form #4—Running away or hiding

  * Example: You did something that upset your friend, and you hear from another friend that your hurt friend is looking for you to talk about it. This makes you feel uncomfortable, so you spend the next week dodging and avoiding them.



##### Form #5—Lying

  * Example: You are dating someone, and develop a crush on someone else. Your boyfriend or girlfriend suspects, and asks you point blank if you like someone else. You feel ashamed, so you lie, and say no, but then secretly start dating your crush on the side.



##### Form #6—Procrastination

  * Example: You don’t know how to do your homework, but asking for help makes you feel vulnerable, so you just put off the homework until the last minute, or perhaps don’t complete it at all.



##### Form #7—Blaming

  * Example: You and your siblings are roughhousing, and you accidentally break your mom’s favorite vase. You feel ashamed, but aren’t willing to confront that, so when mom gets home, you blame it on your sibling.



#### Shield #4—Too Cool for School

This is a shield commonly used when you “don’t do vulnerability.” The vulnerability of others makes you uncomfortable, creating a mirror that reveals your insecurities and fears to you, and you attack or shame to protect yourself. This shield has four faces.

##### Face #1—Cynicism

Knee-jerk reactions to vulnerability that include dismissing the validity of someone’s painful experience, or being jaded as a personality trait.

  * Example: You’re a senior in high school and you tell your peers you want to apply to an Ivy League college. They tell you something along the lines of “that’s lame,” or “no one ever gets into those schools anyway,” or “you’re trying way too hard.”



##### Face #2—Criticism

Mean, attacking language used to demean and judge the motivations or expressions of others.

  * Example: You enter into the school talent show, and perform a song you love. Your classmates call you an attention-seeking, wannabe singer.



##### Face #3—Coolness

A specific form of cynicism that deplores the idea of enthusiasm, sees excitement or vulnerability as stupid or uncool, and values not caring too much about anything. Extremely common in middle schools and high schools.

  * Example: It’s often considered uncool to care about doing well in school. The less you care, the cooler you seem to others.



##### Face #4—Cruelty

Actions, words, or behaviors used to intentionally cut down others, often with relish.

  * Example: Making fun of someone for having a cognitive or physical disability.
