## Exercise: Make Dopamine Your Ally

Dopamine doesn’t have to derail you—it can work in your favor. If you can find a way to add a dopamine rush to your least favorite chore, it will become a lot easier and more fun.

* * *

Make a list of two or three tasks you've been putting off (perhaps raking the leaves, cleaning out the garage, or planning out next year’s budget).

Now ask yourself how you can make at least one of those tasks more fun by adding a dopamine hit—something that will tickle your brain with pleasure while you’re doing that unpleasant task. (You might consider playing your favorite music, lighting scented candles, or doing the task while drinking a mug of hot chocolate at your local cafe.)
