## Chapter 6: How Feeling Bad Leads to Giving In

When we want to access the willpower to work toward long-term goals, we need a positive state of mind. After all, it takes a certain amount of optimism to be willing to focus on the future. But even for the best of us, it’s impossible to stay upbeat all the time, so it’s key to understand what happens when our moods turn sour or we’ve had a rough day.

Our brains don’t like feeling bad, so they automatically start hunting for something to make us feel good. **Unfortunately, the things we turn to when we want to feel good are often the things that make us feel bad.** Ask any drug addict, food addict, or any other kind of addict—most will say that indulging in their addiction usually winds up making them feel worse, not better. Clearly we need to find a way to improve our moods that’s more consistent with our long-term goals.

### When Stress Makes Us Give In

It’s not surprising that the brain is more susceptible to temptation when we're stressed. In Chapter 2, we saw that stress engages our fight-or-flight response—the opposite of the pause-and-plan response that helps us make solid, carefully thought-out decisions. When you’re in fight-or-flight mode, any temptations that cross your path are suddenly more tempting than ever before. But instead of giving in, **try relieving the stress that's making you susceptible to temptation.**

According to the American Psychological Association, the best ways to relieve stress are exercising or playing a sport, praying, reading, listening to music, getting a massage, meditating or doing yoga, spending time outdoors, or spending time with friends or family. These methods actually boost the "happy chemicals" in your brain and diminish the stress response.

The worst ways to relieve stress are the strategies that promise a reward but don't actually deliver it—smoking, drinking, gambling, eating, shopping, playing video games, binge-watching movies or TV, and surfing the Internet.

And yet time and time again, we often choose the worst strategies over the best strategies. That's because **when we're stressed, our brains point us toward the wrong activities.**

#### Willpower Hack: Create a Goal Reminder Strategy

When you're feeling bad, your brain will likely point you in the wrong direction, so you need something to steer you the right way. Develop a reminder strategy that tells you what to do—and what not to do—when you're stressed. Here’s an example: Jane has a demanding job, and each day after work she comes home, opens a bottle of wine, and scrolls the Internet until her brain goes numb. Jane knows that she used to enjoy going to a yoga class after work, but her days are so challenging now that she can't resist the siren call of chardonnay and solo online time.

One day, Jane finally forces herself to go to yoga class, and it's even better than she remembered. She feels great and wants to make this a habit, but she’s afraid the habit won’t stick. So she makes a voice recording in which she talks about how great she feels after yoga class. **Every time her brain points her toward wine and Wi-Fi, she listens to this recording, which motivates her to go to yoga.**

### When Media Saturation Makes Us Give In

One of the reasons we lose our self-control is because our brains are engaged in "terror management." Whether we watch television, read the newspapers, or check our Facebook newsfeeds, we are constantly being reminded of terrible things happening in the world. **We turn to temptation for comfort—and paying excessive attention to the news will certainly make us crave comfort.**

Many people feel like it's a moral obligation to pay attention as the world's crises unravel. Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but it’s worth considering how your behavior might change if you diminish your news consumption. When you’re being bombarded with messages about terror and uncertainty, you probably won’t be motivated toward future-oriented goals like starting a new business or improving your fitness level.

### When Feeling Guilty Makes Us Give In

It’s a vicious cycle: We vow that we're going to stop stretching our credit limits in online shopping sprees, but then we get one of those irresistible emails from a favorite store offering 40 percent off if we shop before midnight. So we give in and buy that gadget we've been wanting. We feel great about our purchase for about two seconds, but then we feel terrible because we’ve committed another willpower failure. To assuage our regret, we check out a bunch of other shopping sites to see if those stores have any sales, and we buy more stuff we don't need.

That behavior makes no sense, right? Why not minimize the harm by stopping at one purchase? **This is what researchers call the "what-the-hell effect."** We go off our diets by eating one slice of pizza, and then we assuage our guilt and shame by eating three more slices. We know it's stupid even while we're doing it, but we can't stop. **Giving in a little makes us feel bad about ourselves, so we give in completely.**

To break the cycle, stop telling yourself that one small setback means you're a dismal failure. **When you criticize yourself in this way, you wind up giving yourself an excuse to indulge more.** Your brain feels the sting of your self-hate, and it immediately wants to soothe those feelings, which drives you straight toward whatever temptation comforts you—food, alcohol, cigarettes, shopping, and so on. It's a downward spiral that's hard to stop.

In fact, researchers believe we should try the opposite approach—instead of beating ourselves up, we should actually forgive ourselves for giving in. **Encouraging words like "don't be so hard on yourself" can stop a full-on binge before it gets started.**

Punishing yourself for failures doesn't work well with adult brains. Self-criticism is one of the fastest routes to poor motivation and self-control, and it's also a slippery slope that leads to depression. Self-compassion and forgiveness, on the other hand, are the pathways to greater motivation and improved self-control.

**Willpower Hack: Shush Your Inner Critic** How you handle your mistakes is far more important than the fact that you made the mistake in the first place. **You need to find a compassionate way to respond to perceived failures.** This exercise can help you silence your inner critic:

  * Think about a time when you gave in to procrastination or indulged in an activity that you had sworn off doing. Now ask yourself these questions: 
    * What are your feelings about this failure?
    * Do you feel critical about yourself? 
    * If so, what are your critical thoughts? Try to pay attention to those thoughts, perhaps even write them down. 
  * Next, tell yourself this: "Everyone struggles with self-control at times. Willpower failures are part of what it means to be human. Your setbacks do not mean that you are a weak or bad person; they mean that your brain is giving you poor instructions right now." 
    * Do you believe that these statements are true? 
    * Can you think of other people you respect who have struggled with temptation of some kind? 
  * Now ask yourself: If your best friend were in your position right now, would you offer them support or would you condemn them? 
    * If it’s the former, how would you encourage them to stay on track and not forget about their goals? 



### When False Hope Makes Us Give In

Think about how great it feels when we set New Year’s resolutions. When we vow to change our habits, our brains get a rush of happiness. We are filled with hope, and hope feels wonderful. After all, it's obvious how great our lives will be after we put those resolutions into place.

**Creating hope is a great strategy for feeling better—it's instant gratification—but the bad news is that the hard work is about to start.** Actually making the changes you've proposed is a lot harder (and less fun) than making those resolutions was.

It’s easy to get charged up and tell ourselves that because we created a great plan, we're in control. But promising to change our ways only deceives us into feeling good; it doesn't actually change our behaviors.

Announcing your goals can also offer a sense of false hope. If you tell your friends you're going to accomplish a goal—say, go to yoga class three times a week—your brain feels the pleasure of this accomplishment even as you speak the words. **You don't actually have to go to yoga class to feel good—just the idea feels good.** But since your brain has already registered this pleasure, you lose the motivation to go do it. To eliminate this possibility, many scientists believe it's actually more productive to keep your goals to yourself until after you've already carried them out.

#### Willpower Hack: Prepare for Willpower Emergencies

Here’s some good news: **Optimism mixed with a sprinkling of pessimism may make it possible to keep those New Year’s resolutions**. If you plan ahead for potential scenarios that could derail you, you can be the hero or heroine who saves yourself from a willpower failure. Here’s a scheme to add some stark realism to your plans:

  * Think about your Personal Willpower Challenge. Ask yourself: 
    * What stumbling blocks will I encounter as I move toward my goal?
    * What distractions are most likely to deter me from my goal? 
    * When will I be most likely to give in or give up? 
  * Now imagine yourself in those situations you've just illustrated. Imagine your willpower failing you as you face distractions and temptations. What will that feel like? 
  * Next, think about how you can save the day. What actions are needed to turn this imaginary failure into a real-world win? 
    * Do you need to remove yourself from what's tempting you? 
    * Do you need to remember why your goal is important to you? 
    * Are there other willpower strategies you've learned from reading this summary that you can use? 
  * Imagine yourself employing strategies to reinforce your willpower. Visualize your triumph over scenarios that might have derailed you in the past.
