## Introduction: Why Willpower Matters

Ask people if they'd like to have more willpower, and you'll almost always hear a resounding yes. It’s a critical commodity for anyone with goals to attain. You need willpower whether you want to start a business, train for a marathon, overcome procrastination, reduce your stress, give up sugar, eat more vegetables, write a novel, break up with your social media accounts, or achieve any other major goal.

Even if you're not looking to start a new habit or break an old one, **your ability to activate your willpower on an everyday basis has a direct impact on your health, relationships, career, and financial security—and also how you feel about yourself.**

_The Willpower Instinct_ by Stanford University psychology professor Kelly McGonigal explains how our natural willpower gets compromised by stress, distraction, lack of sleep, not enough exercise, and other external factors. Utilizing scientific research, McGonigal provides a framework for how to increase our willpower and access strategies for developing more self-control.

(Shortform note: The author uses the words “willpower” and “self-control” interchangeably, so this summary does the same.)

### Choose a Willpower Challenge

To get the most from this summary, choose a specific willpower challenge that you'd like to tackle. We'll refer to it as your**Personal Willpower Challenge.** Throughout this summary, you’ll find willpower exercises that you can apply to your specific challenge.

As you choose a challenge, **keep in mind that self-control consists of three separate functions—I will, I won't, and I want.** Your challenge will fall into one of these categories:

  * An "I will" challenge is something you aren’t doing now, but you'd like to make a long-term habit. What do you want to do—or do more of—because you know it will make your life better? 
  * An "I won't" challenge is an existing habit you want to break. What do you want to do less of because it's not serving your best interests? 
  * An "I want" challenge is a lifelong goal that you'd like to put more effort into, like improving your health or becoming a better parent. You can’t complete this effort in a short period of time—it’s more of an ongoing challenge—but you can take steps in the right direction. 



### Learn Your Willpower Pitfalls

We’d all like to believe that we have control over our emotions, appetites, and behaviors, but the truth is that accessing our willpower is often a struggle. We’re at odds with ourselves—we want to achieve our long-term goals, but we also want to do what feels good right now.

Traditional self-help strategies for gaining more self-control are not effective for most people. For example, goal-setting seems like a great strategy, but identifying what we want to achieve is only the tip of the iceberg. Each of us can name dozens of things that we know we should do, but we still don't do them.

Instead, take some time to figure out what causes you to give in to temptation and give up on progressing toward your goals. **The foundation of all willpower is understanding your own self-control traps and pitfalls.** Self-knowledge about how and why you fail at willpower helps you create strategies to succeed.

Each of this book’s chapters describes various reasons for willpower failures and proposes methods to circumvent those failures. Not all of these reasons will apply to you, and not all of these methods will work for you. **Make yourself the subject of your own science experiment, collect your data, and draw your own conclusions about what works best.**

(Shortform note: If you want to skip the background information and go directly to strategies for increasing your willpower, look for the sections denoted as “Willpower Hacks.”)
