## Exercise: Practice Tuning in to Your Body’s Needs

Tribole and Resch suggest that you can make food choices that align with your body's requirements, avoid feelings of deprivation, and rediscover the pleasure of eating by tuning in to your body’s needs. In this exercise, consider how you might implement their advice.

* * *

Reflect on what influences you to fixate on your weight and list anything that stands out. (For example, seeing your scale in the bathroom, receiving regular updates from diet bloggers, or hanging around with weight-conscious friends.)

Pick an item on your list and write down how you feel about eliminating it from your life. (For example, you might feel reluctant to get rid of your scale because you paid so much for it.)

Reflect on your last meal or snack and briefly describe the experience, noting what you ate, if you were eating due to physical or emotional hunger, and how you felt after the experience. (For example, you were hungry mid-morning and snacked on some nuts but didn’t eat enough to satisfy your hunger pangs.)

Think about the food you often crave but don’t allow yourself to eat. Write down what you believe about this food that makes you feel like you should deny yourself. (For example, you don’t allow yourself to eat cookies because you believe that they’re full of sugar and will cause you to gain weight.)

Try to recall the last time you ate the food you identified in the previous question and note down how it made you feel physically. Did you feel satisfied after eating the food? Explain why or why not. (For example, the last time you ate a cookie, it satisfied your craving for something sweet and gave you a much-needed energy boost.)
