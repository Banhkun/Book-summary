### Leadership

You must decide whether you will be a leader or a follower in your chosen field. Most successful leaders began as followers, then became leaders because they were intelligent followers, obtaining specialized knowledge from their leaders.

There are two forms of leadership — leadership by consent and leadership by force. The first is by far the more effective; leadership by force doesn’t last — dictators eventually fall, as Hitler and Stalin did. The relationship between leaders and followers today is a partnership based on cooperation.

To exercise leadership by consent you need the following personal qualities and behaviors:

**Personal qualities of a leader**

  * Courage: This is based on self-knowledge and self-confidence. No one will follow a person who lacks courage.
  * Self control: People who can’t control themselves can’t control others. A leader with self-control is emulated by followers.
  * Sense of fairness: You have to be fair to command respect.
  * Charisma: No one will follow a leader who lacks an attractive personality.
  * Empathy. Leaders must have empathy for and understanding of their followers to inspire respect.



**Behaviors of a leader**

  * A grasp of the details of the leadership position. 
  * Decisiveness: No one can follow an indecisive leader.
  * An effective plan: Your plan is your rudder, which every ship needs. Followers need a plan to follow.
  * A habit of doing more than expected. This inspires respect, credibility, and similar behavior among followers.
  * A grasp of the details of the leadership position. This allows you to use time efficiently — and delegate when necessary — rather than being too busy when something important must be done.
  * Willingness to take responsibility: Leaders take responsibility for the mistakes of their followers.
  * Cooperation: Leaders practice and inspire cooperation.



The flipside — negative personal qualities and ineffective behaviors — constitutes the most common reasons that would-be leaders fail.

**Negative personal qualities of failed leaders**

  * Fear of competition from followers: Shows a lack of courage and self-confidence. Leaders train understudies and delegate tasks.
  * Lack of imagination: Without imagination you can’t respond effectively to emergencies and develop effective plans for others to follow.
  * Intemperance: This shows a lack of self-control, and followers will not respect you.
  * Lack of humility: If you’re a great leader, no task should be too small for you to do.
  * Selfishness: Shows a lack of empathy and unwillingness to take responsibility for others’ mistakes. This sparks resentment.



**Ineffective behaviors of failed leaders**

  * Inability to organize details;
  * Seeking respect for what you know, rather than for what you do.
  * Disloyalty: If you are not loyal to those above and below you, you lose their trust.
  * Authoritarianism and emphasis on title: This is leadership by force instead of by consent, and it ultimately fails.



### How to Get the Job You Want

  1. Define job you want exactly. If it doesn’t exist, maybe you can create it.
  2. Identify the company or individual you want to work for. 
  3. Study your potential employer’s business and policies.
  4. Identify what you can offer the employer (experience, services, knowledge, ideas, connections), and develop a detailed plan of how you can help the company.
  5. Present it to the person with the authority to make the hiring decision. 



### Information to Include in a Resume

Prepare your resume or CV carefully. It should be clear, attractive and free of mistakes, and should include:

  * Education: State the schooling you’ve had as well as subjects you specialized in and why.
  * Experience: Include experience in positions similar to the one you’re applying for. Include the employers’ full names and addresses. Also emphasize experiences that would help you do the job you’re applying for.
  * References: Offer names of people who can provide information about your experience and capabilities. They can include: former employers, teachers, prominent people.
  * The specific position you are applying for. If you are not specific, it indicates you lack specialized qualifications.
  * Your qualifications for the specific position: Be detailed. This is the most important part of your application.



Other tips:

  * Offer to work on probation (without pay), to get a foot in the door and demonstrate your capabilities. Making this offer shows your determination and self-confidence.
  * Know the employer’s business: This shows imagination and a serious interest in the position.
  * Don’t be afraid of making your CV too long. Employers want all the information about you that they can get.
  * Check spelling and grammar, showing care and attention to detail.
  * Dress professionally.



### Selling Your Services

To market your services effectively you must follow the QQS formula:

  * Quality: You must handle every detail as efficiently as possible, with the goal of improving your efficiency.
  * Quantity: Provide as much service as you can, at all times. Continue to improve by increasing your skill and experience.
  * Spirit: Be pleasant and you will get cooperation from others. The spirit with which you deliver your service determines the price you get and the duration of your financial relationship. Spirit can make up for deficiencies in quality and quality, but there’s no substitute for it.



You need all three of these elements if you want to have long-term contracts and relationships.

### Self-Analysis

At the end of each year, you should conduct a self-analysis to reduce your flaws and increase your strengths. This will increase the value of what you can give (products or services) in return for riches. Annual self-analysis will show whether you’re making progress. Areas you should look at are your business interactions, and your personal goals and traits.

* * *

**Personal**

  * Have I reached my yearly goal? You should have an annual goal that dovetails with your one major life goal or purpose.
  * How can I better use my time and improve my habits to be more efficient?
  * Have I improved my personality? How?
  * Have I been disciplined or intemperate?
  * Have I been open-minded and tolerant?
  * How do I rank in mastering the principles of success? (Get a second, more objective opinion.)



**Business Interactions** :

  * Have I delivered the best quality of service?
  * Have I delivered the maximum quantity of service that I’m capable of?
  * How have I improved my ability to deliver service?
  * Have I worked cooperatively with others?
  * Have I persisted in following through on plans, avoiding procrastination?
  * Have I made decisions promptly and firmly?
  * Have my interactions with colleagues been pleasant or unpleasant?
  * Have I avoided egotism?
  * Have my customers been satisfied? Would I be satisfied were I a customer?
  * Have I inspired respect?
  * Have I been too cautious or not cautious enough?
  * Have I focused my energy on a single purpose rather than diluting it?
  * Have I provided better service than I was paid for?
  * Have I been unfair? How?
  * Have I budgeted my time, expenses and income wisely? Have I wasted time?
