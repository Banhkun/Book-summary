## Principles 13 & 14: The Brain and the Sixth Sense

(Shortform note: This is Napoleon Hill’s attempt to justify his principles with some scientific rigor. These ideas aren’t accurate by today’s science and they’re not important to applying the rest of the book, but something in here may resonate with you.)

We don’t know exactly how thoughts become reality. But we know that there are intangible forces at work in the universe, even if we can’t perceive them with our five senses.

Intangible forces move oceans, create thunderstorms, and fuel the soil that provides our food; electricity is an intangible force. For all of our education, we don’t understand the intangible force of thought, and how the brain and its network of nerves translate thought into reality. But we are learning more about the brain all the time. It’s likely that the brain, through its intangible processes, can communicate with other intangible forces outside us.

**Our brain performs as both a broadcasting and receiving station for thought vibrations.** From the ether or energy of the universe, our brain uses the “receiving set” of creative imagination to pick up thought vibrations from other brains — especially when amped up to a high rate of vibration by emotions such as sex. When at their highest level, **our thoughts can be broadcast by the subconscious mind to be picked up by other brains**.

Experiments in telepathy show that minds can communicate with other minds, without words being spoken. (In experiments, some people have been able to name cards in an unseen pack, or read a thought in another person’s mind.) Master Mind groups can work this way, exchanging, blending, and building on each others’ thoughts until solutions are reached.

### The Sixth Sense

Science can’t explain it, but humans can receive knowledge through other means beyond the five senses. The Infinite Intelligence can communicate with the subconscious mind through creative imagination, also known as the **sixth sense** , which is the thirteenth principle for acquiring riches.

The **sixth sense is a signal often referred to as a hunch** , inspiration, or intuition that provides answers we’ve been seeking, or a warning of danger that flashes into our mind and enables us to avoid trouble or an accident at the last second. For some people, the sixth sense takes the form of a guardian angel. A combination of the mental and spiritual, the sixth sense is almost indescribable.

Great leaders like Napoleon, Joan of Arc, Christ, Buddha, Confucius and Mohammed likely used the sixth sense. Our ability to use this power comes only slowly, if at all, as we learn to apply the principles.

Anyone who applies the principles can still succeed in achieving riches, without fully understanding the last principle, the sixth sense.

But if you want more — a complete philosophy for getting what you want from life — the principle of the sixth sense exists to increase your understanding of yourself, others, Nature, and happiness. As you digest the ideas in this book and chapter, eventually you may find you’ve acquired the power — the sixth sense — that has driven great achievements throughout history.

### A Master Mind of the Subconscious

In an unusual application of the method of communicating with other minds through heightened thought processes, author Napoleon Hill created and communicated with a Master Mind consisting of nine historical figures, whom he had studied to learn their secrets of success. They were Emerson, Paine, Edison, Darwin, Lincoln, Burbank, Napoleon, Ford, and Carnegie.

Each night as he was falling asleep he held an imaginary council meeting with them, in which he asked questions about traits they exemplified that he wanted to acquire. For instance, he asked Napoleon how he inspired people and turned defeat into victory.

Over time, his council of the mind seemed more and more real, and a conversational dynamic developed. While Hill never forgot that the meetings were imaginary, he found that they inspired his creativity and honesty, and that these were the times he was most tapped in to the sixth sense. He later found himself convening his council to get help when facing challenges, and the process generated solutions.
