## Exercise: Identify Feelings and Needs

Identifying feelings and connecting them to needs takes practice. Try it out now by revisiting a past conversation.

* * *

Think of the last time you had a disagreement with someone close to you (this could be a partner, child, friend, or coworker). What were you _feeling_ during that disagreement?

What were you _needing_? For reference, hereâ€™s the list of universal human needs from this chapter: **Autonomy** (the right to choose your own goals and values in life) **Celebration** (to celebrate happy life events and to mourn our losses) **Integrity** (authenticity, creativity, meaning, self-worth) **Interdependence** (acceptance, empathy, love, respect, support) **Play** (fun, laughter) **Spiritual Communion** (beauty, inspiration, peace) **Physical Nurturance** (air, food, water, shelter)

Now, think about the person you disagreed with. What were they feeling at the time?

What were they needing?
