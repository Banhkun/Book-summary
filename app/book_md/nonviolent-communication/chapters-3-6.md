## Chapters 3-6: The Four Steps of Expressive Nonviolent Communication

Now we’ll focus in depth on the four steps of expressive Nonviolent Communication: observing, identifying feelings, identifying needs, and making requests.

### Step 1: Observe Without Evaluating

One fundamental component of NVC is separating observation (“I feel afraid”) from evaluation (“That is scary”). The philosopher J. Krishnamurti calls this “the highest form of human intelligence,” perhaps because it is so difficult to do. Our brains are natural storytellers, so we often don’t even notice when we make evaluations based on what we see, hear, and feel. But **evaluative language is a form of moralistic judgment** that can easily alienate others by reducing them to a label rather than making a human connection.

Being fully objective is difficult and not always possible or even desirable (for example, when you have strong moral objections to someone’s behavior). In those situations, it's still possible to use NVC as long as your language separates the observation from the evaluation. To do this, reference **specific behaviors** you observe—like “John used two racial slurs in our conversation yesterday” rather than “John is a racist.” Whether or not the label is warranted doesn’t matter if the goal is to have a productive conversation about the issue rather than an argument.

To make this idea more concrete, here is a table of examples. The statements on the left have observations and evaluations mixed together, while the statements on the right express the same ideas but keep observations separate from judgments.

**Type of Communication** | **Observation and Evaluation, Mixed** | **Observation and Evaluation, Separate**  
---|---|---  
Using the verb “to be” to express opinions as facts  | You’re too pessimistic.  | When I hear you say, “There’s no point,” I think you sound too pessimistic.   
Expressing opinions as facts (without the “to be” verb)  | She definitely won’t win this race.  | I don’t think she’ll win this race.   
Expressing opinions as facts (through judgmental adjectives/adverbs)  | This class is boring.  | I struggle to pay attention in this class.   
Judging ability as fact, rather than opinion  | Reina is terrible at math.  | Reina got a C on her last math test.   
Using words with judgmental connotations  | Janella procrastinates.  | Janella doesn’t study for tests until the night before.   
Confusing predictions with certainties  | If you don’t stop smoking, you’ll get cancer.  | If you don’t stop smoking, I’m afraid you could get cancer.   
Attributing a description to a group rather than a specific person or interaction  | Immigrants don’t want to work.  | My next-door neighbor is an immigrant, and he is unemployed.   
Making always/never generalizations  | You’re always busy.  | You weren’t able to come to my last two parties.   
  
### Step 2: Identify and Express Feelings

After making an observation (without evaluation attached), the next step of NVC is to identify and express your feelings. Again, this sounds easy, but it’s often surprisingly difficult in practice. Our culture doesn’t value expressing feelings, so we’re never taught healthy ways to express strong emotions—instead, we’re told to suck it up, tough it out, and walk it off. That inability to identify and express feelings is an even bigger struggle in some career fields (like law, engineering, corporate management, and the military), where stoicism is a professional value.

#### Describe Feelings Accurately

The cultural taboo around showing emotion means that most of us have a limited vocabulary for expressing feelings. When we don’t have the words to talk about our feelings, we struggle to even identify them beyond broad categories of happy or sad. Building up a “feelings vocabulary” will help you identify and express your feelings more clearly.

The first major hurdle in expressing a feeling is understanding exactly what a feeling _is_(or, more importantly, what it isn’t). Feelings refer to internal physical and emotional states, not judgments of external events. That may sound obvious, but we often conflate thoughts and feelings because we use “I feel” to express opinions, not true feelings, in three distinct ways:

  * First,**if the words “I think” can replace the words “I feel” in a particular sentence, then whatever you’re expressing isn’t really a feeling.** For example, the statement “I feel that you should know better” isn’t referring to any kind of internal state. It’s a judgment of another person’s choices, not a feeling. 
  * Second, if the words “I feel” are immediately followed by “that,” “like,” or “as if,” you’re probably describing a situation rather than your feelings. For example:
    * “I feel _like_ my children don’t listen to me.”
    * “I feel _that_ I’m a good candidate for the position.”
    * “I feel _as if_ I’m responsible for everything.”
  * Third, if “I feel” is followed by a pronoun (I, you, he, she, they, it) or a person’s name or title, you’re not describing a feeling. For example:
    * “I feel _Carlos_ is being unreasonable.”
    * “I feel _my boss_ really appreciates me.”



These red-flag expressions can help you spot thoughts masquerading as feelings, but sometimes individual words are the problem. For example, the phrases “I feel inadequate” and “I feel ignored” express judgment rather than true feelings. The word “inadequate” is a judgment of your own worth; “ignored” is a judgment of someone else’s actions.

The phrase “I feel ignored” is especially helpful for illustrating the difference between feelings and judgments. If you’re chatting with a group of friends, feeling “ignored” might mean you’re actually feeling hurt. But if you’re a shy person surrounded by a group of strangers, feeling “ignored” might translate to relief, not hurt.

**To spot judgments posing as feelings, try not using the word “feel” at all.** In English, true feelings can be expressed without that word (for example, you can say “I’m sad” instead of “I feel sad”). On the other hand, judgments naturally sound strange if you swap in the verb “to be” for the verb “to feel” (for example, “I’m ignored” and “I’m unheard”). These sound unnatural because we know that “I am” only describes states of being, not judgments.

Another important factor in how we talk about feelings is specificity. When you say you feel “good,” you could mean ecstatic, mellow, fascinated, or many other specific feelings. If you feel “bad,” you might feel scared, bored, or furious. Each of these specific emotions merits a different response. **By just using the words “good” and “bad,” you give the person you’re speaking to very little information about how to connect with you in that moment** , so you’re more likely to be disappointed when they aren’t able to meet your needs or expectations.

Building up a vocabulary of specific feeling words can help you express yourself more clearly. Here are some examples of specific ways you might feel when your needs _are_ being met.

  * Affectionate
  * Comfortable
  * Proud
  * Enthusiastic
  * Grateful
  * Relieved



Here are some ways you might feel when your needs _aren’t_ being met.

  * Afraid
  * Exasperated
  * Lethargic
  * Disappointed
  * Panicky
  * Numb



#### Take Responsibility for Your Feelings

Once you identify _what_ you’re feeling, identify _why_ you’re feeling it. When our needs aren’t met, we often instinctively place the blame on our circumstances with expressions like “He drives me nuts” or “You disappointed me.” **But in reality, it’s the way you _react_ to your circumstances that determines how you feel, not the circumstances themselves. **

It’s important to understand that this doesn’t mean your feelings aren’t justified or that you can simply choose to feel happy instead of miserable. It just means you acknowledge that your feelings stem from your own needs and expectations and not from the actions of others.

Just as in identifying and expressing feelings, language plays an important role in taking responsibility for our feelings. There are three ways we deny responsibility for our emotions.

  1. Using “it” and “that” to describe your reaction (like “That makes me nervous” or “It annoys me when you do that”) implies that something external is causing your feelings.
  2. Using a pronoun other than “I” after the phrase “I feel this emotion because.” This looks like “I feel sad because he didn’t show up” or “I feel annoyed because she isn’t here yet.”
  3. Correctly labeling a feeling, but attributing it to someone or something else, like “When you forgot my birthday, I felt lonely.”



You can reword each of these statements to express a feeling (and take responsibility for it) by stating the feeling followed by the phrase “because I.” The table below shows three examples.

**Original Statement** | **Taking Responsibility for the Feeling**  
---|---  
“It annoys me when you do that.”  | “I feel annoyed because I don’t want to be distracted from my work right now.”   
“I feel sad because he didn’t show up.”  | “I feel sad because I was really looking forward to seeing him.”   
“When you forgot my birthday, I felt lonely.”  | “I felt lonely because I want to know that you care about me.”   
  
Taking responsibility for your feelings benefits everyone involved. Blaming a negative feeling on someone else’s actions creates a sense of guilt in that person—if their behavior changes after that, you have no way of knowing whether they’re motivated by guilt or genuine affection.

##### Reacting to Being Mistreated

Taking responsibility for your feelings isn’t easy, especially when you’ve been mistreated in some way. When that happens, you have four choices for how to react: You can blame yourself, blame the other person, notice your feelings and needs, or notice the other person’s feelings and needs. For example, imagine your partner says, “You’re so needy.” What are your choices?

  * If you choose to **blame yourself** , you take your partner’s words personally. This means you react by accepting that judgment, feeling guilty, and vowing to be less “needy.” Over time, this choice creates a pattern of guilt and shame that can harm your self-esteem.
  * If you choose to **blame the other person** , you get defensive. You might tell your partner, “I’m not needy, you’re just insensitive!” This is a recipe for anger and hurt. 
  * If you choose to **notice and communicate your own feelings and needs** , you take responsibility for your reaction. In that case, you might say, “When you say I’m needy, I feel hurt because I need safety to express myself in our relationship.”
  * If you choose to **notice and communicate the other person’s feelings and needs** , you’re choosing to empathize with what they’re really trying to express. You might ask your partner, “Are you feeling overwhelmed because you need more autonomy?”



Choosing to blame yourself or the other person is unlikely to move the conversation toward a satisfying resolution for everyone. Communicating your own feelings and needs is important, but it might not help you establish the empathy required to resolve the issue. The final choice—noticing and communicating the other person’s feelings and needs—is most in line with the principles of NVC and helps create a genuine connection.

### Step 3: Connect Feelings to Needs

Recognizing and expressing your feelings helps others to understand you, but it doesn’t give them much guidance on how to respond. For that, you need to connect the feelings to your underlying needs. Hearing the needs underneath your feelings helps other people empathize with you because most human needs are universal.

Every feeling arises from a particular need that is or isn’t being met. Identifying the need underlying a certain feeling helps you get clear on what your goals are for this communication, but it’s not always easy to identify the needs underlying our feelings since this is such a new idea for most of us. For reference, here is a list of the categories of universal needs that all humans share as well as some specific examples:

  * **Autonomy** (the right to choose your own goals and values in life)
  * **Celebration** (to celebrate happy life events and to mourn our losses)
  * **Integrity** (authenticity, creativity, meaning, self-worth)
  * **Interdependence** (acceptance, empathy, love, respect, support)
  * **Play** (fun, laughter)
  * **Spiritual Communion** (beauty, inspiration, peace)
  * **Physical Nurturance** (air, food, water, shelter)



Once you’re aware of your needs, express them out loud along with your feelings. For example, you could say, “I’m feeling nervous to tell you something because I need your acceptance” or “I’m feeling exhausted because I need to rest.”

Expressing needs can be terrifying in a culture that actively discourages us from expressing vulnerability. Instead, we often express our needs indirectly by judging or diagnosing others (for example, instead of saying, “I felt hurt when she yelled at me,” we might say, “She’s crazy”). This can make people feel criticized or attacked, which puts them on the defensive and makes them even less likely to recognize and fulfill our needs. As uncomfortable as it may be, being open about our needs makes it easier for other people to respond to us positively.

Gender roles can make this kind of vulnerability even harder. The “ideal woman” is the ultimate caretaker and sacrifices her own needs to meet those of others. For women, admitting to having any needs at all often feels like a failure. This is doubly true for women with partners or children, who are expected to give up their own needs the moment they become wives or mothers.

#### Stages of Emotional Liberation

When people begin to focus on identifying and expressing their own needs, they often pass through three stages: “emotional slavery,” “the obnoxious stage,” and “emotional liberation.”

  * In **stage 1** or “emotional slavery,” we feel responsible for other people’s emotions and engage in “people pleasing” to keep everyone around us happy (often at our own expense). If we can’t “fix” other people’s negative emotions, it feels like a personal failure and creates overwhelming distress. To cope with that distress, we often put distance between ourselves and the other person by labeling them as “needy.”
  * In **stage 2** or “the obnoxious stage,” we’re beginning to wake up to the reality that trying to meet everyone else’s needs at the expense of our own is making us miserable. In this stage, we might overcompensate by adopting a “not my problem” attitude and refusing to meet _any_ needs of other people (hence the “obnoxious” label). 
  * In **stage 3** or “emotional liberation,” we’re able to provide genuine care and empathy to others while still meeting our own needs. We take full responsibility for our own feelings and no longer feel responsible for the emotions of other people. Meeting our own needs first allows us to give to others purely out of compassion rather than guilt or obligation. In other words, focusing on ourselves first allows us to help others more wholeheartedly than if we prioritized their needs over our own. 
    * You can think of this as the emotional equivalent of airplane safety demonstrations that emphasize putting your own oxygen mask on before assisting others. If you pass out from lack of oxygen (or burn out by not meeting your own needs in general), you won’t be able to help anyone else. 



### Step 4: Make Specific Requests

Identifying and expressing the needs underlying your current feelings is an important step. But just stating your needs isn’t enough. Without a specific, action-oriented request, it’s easy to fall into the trap of assuming others intuitively know exactly how to meet your needs. If they don’t, you may end up unfairly resenting them for not intuiting what you need them to do.

People often request what they need from others in indirect ways. A child misbehaving in front of their parent might be indirectly requesting attention or autonomy; a man accusing his husband of working too much might be indirectly requesting connection or affection. These approaches are unlikely to result in our needs being met. If you want someone else to meet your needs, you need to make _specific_ requests using _positive action language_.

#### Make Requests for Positive Action

If you want others to meet your needs,**it’s more helpful to request what you _do_ want them to do than what you _don’t_ want them to do**. Making negative requests (like “Please don’t do that”) gives the listener very little information about what you’re actually asking of them. For example, imagine you’ve asked your spouse not to spend so much time at the office, and they respond by going out to eat with friends every night instead. Technically, they’ve complied with your request—but if your goal was to spend more time together, your need is still unmet.

On top of being unclear, people often perceive negative requests as criticism, which makes the listener unlikely to respond with compassion. Words like “don’t” or “stop” imply that whatever the person is currently doing is wrong, which is a judgment of their behavior.

#### Avoid Vague Language

In addition to positive language, **requests should be specific**. For example, if you ask someone for “help,” they’ll respond based on _their_ interpretation of “help,” which may or may not be what you had in mind. If you ask a friend to “be supportive” during a tough time and they respond by dropping off a meal, you’ll be disappointed if what you needed was a listening ear.

Sometimes, people might make vague requests because they haven’t thought through what it is they actually want. For example, a father asking his son to “be more responsible” is making a vague request. If what he really wants is for his son to do exactly as he’s told, then asking his son to be responsible is really a roundabout way of asking him to be obedient.

This kind of uncertainty can have serious consequences. In the case of the father and son, realizing that he’s really asking his son to obey his every command might make the father reflect on the values he wants to instill in his son. In other cases, not being clear on what we’re really asking for can contribute to depression. If we don’t know what we really want from other people, we won’t be able to ask for it, and our needs may go perpetually unmet.

#### Don’t Confuse Requests and Demands

Making requests before stating your feelings and needs is dangerous because **requests sound like demands or attacks if we don’t communicate the feelings or needs behind them.**

For example, if a parent asks their child, “Why don’t you get a haircut?” without explaining their motivation, the child might hear, “I don’t like your hair.” Parents can avoid causing unintentional hurt by prefacing the request with a statement of their feelings—for example, “I’ve noticed how your hair gets in your eyes when you’re riding your bike and I’m afraid you could get hurt.”

Even if you clearly state your reasoning, it’s possible for the listener to hear your request as a demand if there is an implicit (or explicit) threat of punishment if they choose not to comply. In this context, “punishment” can mean any kind of violent communication such as judgment, criticism, or guilt trips. If you respond to someone’s “no” with any of these tactics, it becomes clear that our request was really a veiled demand. **In a true request, there is no coercion or manipulation—the listener is free to say “no” without fear.**

So how can you use Nonviolent Communication to clearly communicate that you’re making a request rather than a demand? Although it can help to specify up front that the person is free to say no, the way you react to that “no” sends a _far_ more powerful message. Even if the organizational hierarchy says this person “should” obey your requests, if you respond to their “no” by invoking your authority, it blocks empathic communication and may lead to bitterness.

In NVC, the first response whenever someone denies your request is always empathy. This doesn’t mean you can’t advocate for what you want or make further requests—it just means that before you push back, you **take the time to fully understand and empathize with _why_ this person is saying no**. Making people feel heard helps to strengthen the relationship and increases the likelihood of finding a solution that works for everyone.

#### Request Reflection

Any time you communicate with another person, you make implicit requests, even if those requests are simply for acknowledgment that you’ve been heard and understood. **Go into each interaction with a clear idea of the requests you’re making of the other person.** Without knowing what you’re asking for, it’s hard to know when and if you receive it.

Once you’re aware of what you’re expressing and requesting, make sure that’s the same message the other person is hearing. To do that, ask them to reflect back what you’ve said in their own words. It might feel strange, but this extra step can save enormous amounts of time and struggle by catching any misunderstandings immediately rather than waiting for them to blow up. Keep in mind that you’re asking the other person to risk being “wrong,” which puts them in a vulnerable position. Regardless of how well they understood what you meant to say, be sure to show sincere gratitude for their willingness to risk being vulnerable.

**If there _is_ a misunderstanding, your response should make it clear that you accept responsibility for it. **Language is key here—the phrase “that’s not what I said” implies wrongness in the listener, but “I wasn’t as clear as I wanted to be, can I try again?” contains no judgments and is less likely to make them feel attacked.

#### Request an Honest Response

Once you’re sure your needs and requests have been understood the way you intended, it’s important to clarify what kind of feedback you’re asking for from the other person. When you’re asking for someone’s thoughts on something you’ve said, be as specific as possible to avoid wasting anyone’s time on feedback that isn’t valuable for you. For example, “What did you think of my presentation?” is vague, but “Did the order of the slides make sense?” indicates exactly what feedback you’re looking for. **Specifying what kind of response you’re looking for increases the chance of getting it.**

### Example: Expressing Concern Using NVC

To put all this together, imagine you’ve just discovered a pack of cigarettes in your teenage daughter’s car. To express your concerns nonviolently, you’d work through the four steps:

  1. **Observe.** “Honey, when you let me borrow your car, I saw a pack of cigarettes in the glove compartment.”
  2. **Identify and express feelings.** “I’m feeling very worried about you smoking...”
  3. **Connect feelings to needs.** “... because I need to keep you safe.”
  4. **Make specific requests.** “Can we talk together about the health risks of smoking?”
