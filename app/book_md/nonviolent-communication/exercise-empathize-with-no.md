## Exercise: Empathize With “No”

If you make a request of someone and they refuse, empathizing with their reasoning can stop you from accidentally turning the request into a demand. Try it out below.

* * *

Think of the last time you asked someone to do something and they refused (this could be a child, a friend, an employee, or someone else). Why do you think they refused?

What do you think they were feeling at the time?

What do you think they were needing?

Can you think of a time when you experienced that same feeling or need? Looking back, how did you want other people to respond to you in that moment? (For example, if you were feeling sad or needing affection, maybe you wanted someone to give you a hug.)

How does empathizing with this person’s feelings or needs change how you feel about or interpret their denial of your request? How will you approach similar situations in the future?
