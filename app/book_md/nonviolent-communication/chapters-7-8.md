## Chapters 7-8: Empathic Listening

The first six chapters of this book focused on expressing your own observations, feelings, and needs honestly. Now, we can apply that same approach to listening empathically when others share _their_ observations, feelings, and needs. “Empathic listening” requires listening on a deeper level than you may be used to by emptying your mind of preconceived ideas and judgments about the other person or the situation.

Empathic listening is different from a typical conversation, where it’s easy to drift into mentally preparing a response or coming up with solutions while the other person is talking. We unconsciously focus on thinking and acting rather than truly listening. On the other hand,**empathic listening requires resisting the temptation to argue, give advice, or try to “fix” the situation**. In other words, “don’t just do something, stand there.”

### Barriers to Empathic Listening

Most of us are never explicitly taught how to listen with empathy. Listening empathically is _hard_ , even with people we love, because modern culture encourages quick fixes and constant striving rather than empathy and stillness. Allowing someone to feel the full extent of their feelings without offering advice or reassurance requires staying present with someone else’s pain without flinching.

On the other end of the spectrum, listening empathically to people you have strong disagreements with can be equally difficult. In that case, empathic listening might require you to listen to hurtful words, accusations, or hatred without being provoked into anger and judgment. Maintaining a focus on hearing someone’s feelings and needs underneath layers of insults or bigotry might stretch your capacity for empathy to the breaking point—which is exactly when you need it most.

Rather than connect empathically with someone, we often turn to easier options. Here are some common mistakes people make when responding to someone expressing their feelings and needs.

**Tactic** | **Example**  
---|---  
Consoling  | “It’s okay, you tried your best.”   
Advising  | “If it were me, I would…”   
One-upping  | “That’s not so bad, I’ve been through way worse.”   
Storytelling  | “That reminds me of when my aunt went through the same thing…”   
Shutting down  | “Cheer up! It’ll all work out.”   
Sympathizing  | “I’m so sorry. You poor thing.”   
Interrogating  | “How did it happen?”   
Explaining  | “I was only late because of traffic.”   
Correcting  | “Are you sure that’s what he said?”   
Educating  | “You can learn a lot from this experience.”   
  
All of these tactics involve engaging with someone intellectually, **turning them into a project rather than a person.** Even mental health professionals often make the mistake of responding to someone’s pain with analysis rather than empathy.

### The NVC Approach to Empathy

Nonviolent Communication provides a helpful framework for maintaining empathic presence when people express themselves. Just like in expressive communication, when we listen to others in a nonviolent way, we focus on four things: observations, feelings, needs, and requests. Keep in mind that people are always expressing their feelings and needs when they communicate. Focus on listening for those feelings and needs, even when they’re expressed indirectly. For example, if someone says, “I hate my job,” they may really be trying to say, “I feel empty at work because I need recognition when I do a good job.”

#### Paraphrasing With Questions

When you focus on someone’s feelings and needs, be careful not to take your own interpretations of their words as fact. Instead, check in frequently to make sure you understand exactly what they’re saying. This prevents miscommunications from spiraling out of control and gives the other person a chance to make sure they’re being heard correctly (which ultimately saves everyone time and struggle). To do this, try **paraphrasing** the feelings and needs you hear in the form of a question.

To illustrate this, let’s look at an example based on a real-life married couple who attended a workshop on NVC techniques. When the husband told his wife, “You never listen,” Rosenberg challenged her to listen for the feelings and needs behind the statement and respond with empathy. Here were her first few attempts:

  * **“Are you feeling unhappy with me?”** This is an understandable question, but the words “with me” imply that her actions have _caused_ her husband’s emotions. She automatically takes responsibility for his feelings, but remember, each of us is only responsible for our own emotions. 
  * **“Are you feeling unhappy because you feel like I don’t understand you?”** Here, she’s listening for the feelings as well as the needs behind them. But her language focuses on what her husband might be _thinking_ about her rather than what he’s _needing_. 
  * **“Are you feeling unhappy because you are needing to be heard?”** This question reflects the husband’s feelings _and_ his needs. It doesn’t matter if she’s guessed incorrectly about either of these because the question format gives her husband a chance to correct any misunderstanding. 



You can also ask paraphrasing questions to clarify what someone is specifically observing (“Are you reacting to your boss skipping the meeting?”) or what they are requesting (“Are you wanting me to help you with this assignment?”).

Notice how these questions are different from questions like “How do you feel about that?” or “What do you need me to do?” These questions are well-intentioned but in practice can sound like analysis, which makes the listener feel like a problem you’re trying to solve. Instead, asking paraphrasing questions makes it clear that you’re really listening and empathizing with someone’s experience, even if you don’t interpret them correctly on the first try.

##### Things to Keep in Mind While Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is especially important when someone is expressing powerful emotions because the person is particularly vulnerable. In that state, empathy is crucial because offering advice or criticism is likely to make someone feel unheard and unsafe. This applies to both _what_ you say and _how_ you say it. **In an emotionally vulnerable situation, people are extremely sensitive to any hint of criticism, even through subtle vocal or body language cues.**

Again, this may be especially difficult when someone’s feelings and needs are buried beneath insults and hateful words. Thankfully, over time, focusing on those feelings and needs makes it easier to see people as hurting human beings rather than irredeemable monsters, which ultimately takes away their power to hurt or dehumanize us.

**When you paraphrase someone’s feelings and needs back to them, you act as a mirror that lets them take a deeper look at their own inner world than they may have otherwise.** That kind of introspection can trigger new insights as buried feelings are unearthed. As the listener, this may sound like the speaker has switched topics entirely, but that doesn’t mean they no longer need you to listen empathically—in fact, those deeper wounds are the ones _most_ in need of true empathy. For that reason, it’s important to continue listening without offering solutions for as long as it takes.

Once someone feels fully heard, there’s often a palpable sense of relief for both the speaker and the listener. You may notice a release of physical tension in your own body as the speaker winds down. When the process is fully worked through, the speaker will naturally stop talking as they sense their feelings and needs being fully understood.

It’s not always necessary or helpful to paraphrase someone’s feelings and needs verbally, especially if directly acknowledging the person’s emotions would cause embarrassment because of cultural norms. For example, Rosenberg once met a man who used NVC to transform his relationship with his father without ever paraphrasing out loud, because for a son to discuss his father’s emotions directly was socially taboo in traditional Chinese culture. In that case, it’s even more important to listen carefully for the feelings and needs being expressed, since you may not get the chance to check your understanding.

### When Empathy Hurts

There are times when true empathy is impossible, particularly when you’re starved for empathy yourself or worn out from empathizing with others. Likewise, if you’re feeling attacked or insulted by the other person, it’s natural to be pushed into a fight or flight response that blocks empathy. **If the topic affects you personally, it may not be possible to maintain focus on the other person’s feelings and needs**. Recognizing when you’re not able to give someone the kind of empathy that NVC requires is an important part of the process. In that case, you have a few options.

  * First, you can offer yourself emotional first aid by focusing on your own feelings in the same nonviolent way. Being present with your own pain or exhaustion without judgment is a powerful form of empathy.
  * Second, you can acknowledge that you’re simply not able to respond empathetically in that moment. Depending on the context, you can even directly ask for empathy in order to refill the “empathy tank.” 
    * When you’re truly worn down, it may not be possible to do this gently—it’s okay to release those difficult feelings by screaming as long as you do so nonviolently. In practice, “nonviolent screaming” just means expressing your own feelings and needs authentically, without holding back the intensity of your energy. The “nonviolent” part means that even if you raise your voice, you don’t blame, accuse, or insult anyone else. You simply call attention to your own desperate needs. 
  * Lastly, if neither of these approaches is useful, it may be necessary to physically step away from the conversation until everyone can cool down and refill their empathy tanks. This can help reboot an emotionally intense conversation and allow a fresh start when all parties are better able to empathize. 



### Empathy and Vulnerability

Practicing empathic listening can feel strange, especially when we’re not used to talking about emotions at all. But mastering this skill is important because empathy is an extremely powerful tool to create healing, improve performance, defuse danger, revive conversations, and provide a sense of safety.

The power of empathy affects both the speaker and the listener. When you offer someone deep, focused attention and keep your focus on their feelings and needs, it often becomes much easier to relate to them on a human level. For the speaker, having those feelings and needs fully heard and understood often provides enormous relief—**in many conflicts, true empathy may be all it takes to fully resolve the problem.**

Empathy is powerful even when there isn’t a conflict to resolve. For example, when several university faculty members learned the skills of NVC and began listening empathically to their students, the students responded by opening up about their personal lives. The relief of feeling heard and the trust created within that relationship led to students completing more work than they could before.

**Practicing NVC requires vulnerability, which is especially difficult when there is an uneven power dynamic at play.** This makes the college faculty example all the more impressive, because the professors were willing to let go of their authority figure personas and relate to the students on a common human level. Likewise, when talking to your boss, it might be difficult to open up for fear of seeming presumptuous or admitting to anything that might compromise your work performance. In these situations, empathy can help you transcend hierarchy and relate to each other more genuinely.

Even in situations where we’re on equal footing with another person, empathy can make it easier to connect authentically. In everyday conversation, being vulnerable and opening up about our feelings and needs can be scary. But **the more we offer empathy to the other person, the easier that kind of vulnerability becomes,** since focusing on that person as a human with feelings and needs just like us makes opening up seem far less intimidating.

### Empathy and Physical Violence

In volatile situations where there is potential for violence, the power of empathy to create common ground becomes even more important. For example, Rosenberg tells the story of a young woman who worked at a drug detoxification center and attended several NVC workshops. One night, while working alone, a man walked in off the street demanding a bed—when she explained that all their beds were full, he threw her to the ground and pulled out a knife, screaming that he knew she was lying and that he deserved more respect.

In that situation, the woman’s first instinct was to defend herself by arguing that they truly did not have any beds, but she stopped herself when she remembered her NVC training. Since arguing with an angry person often just escalates the situation, she focused instead on empathizing by reflecting the man’s feelings back to him, beginning with, “It sounds like you’re really angry.” After a full 35 minutes of offering empathy, the man finally got up, put the knife away, and allowed the woman to help him find a room at another detox center.

### Empathy and Conversation

Empathy can also help with everyday issues like boring, lifeless conversations. Many times, when someone drones on incessantly, tells the same stories over and over, or sticks to banal topics like the weather, it is a sign that they are disconnected from their own feelings and needs in that moment. **Interrupting with empathy can help the speaker connect to what they’re really trying to express and revive the conversation for everyone.** For example, if a friend is telling you the story of his breakup for the twentieth time, you might interrupt with, “Wow, it sounds like you’re still feeling really hurt because you needed him to show you more respect.”

Of course, interrupting someone while they’re speaking is often considered rude, but in this case, it’s the kind thing to do. The goal is not to talk over someone or shut them up—the goal is to give them the empathy that they may not even realize they’re asking for.

Let’s look at this from the speaker’s perspective. Imagine you’ve been talking to someone who is totally bored with what you’re saying and counting the minutes until they can excuse themselves politely. Would you rather they pretend to listen, or interrupt you to express genuine empathy and their desire to connect? When asked that question, **most people would rather be interrupted than humored because no one wants to be a burden or a bore.**

#### The Meaning of Silence

Sometimes, it can be more difficult to empathize with silence than with someone’s words.**In the face of silence, our storytelling brains invent all sorts of worst-case scenarios for what someone else must be thinking and feeling.** NVC challenges us to check those assumptions with the other person rather than assume we can read their mind.

For example, if you share something deeply emotional with someone who turns away with a disgusted look on their face, you may automatically interpret those silent cues as a sign that you’ve overshared or that this person disapproves of you somehow. But if you check those assumptions with empathy—“I’m sensing that you feel disgusted and you’d like me to keep my feelings to myself”—you may discover that their silence had nothing to do with you and everything to do with their own emotions about an experience you reminded them of.

If you sense disgust or rejection in someone’s silence, it can be difficult to empathize. But silence can convey other feelings, too. Maybe you’ve noticed a friend who looks visibly upset but doesn’t want to talk about what’s wrong. Or imagine a teacher pulling a depressed-looking student aside to ask if they’re okay and getting only a shrug in response. In these cases, use empathy to “listen” to what someone is expressing nonverbally and reflect it back to them. This may encourage them to open up, or it may not—either way, **what’s important is your ability to stay present and continue giving them your focused attention rather than walking away because you can’t “fix” their emotions.**
