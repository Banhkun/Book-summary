## Chapter 11: Resolving Interpersonal Conflicts With NVC

NVC is a helpful tool for any type of communication, but it is especially useful for conflict resolution, mediation, and counseling others. In the author’s years of experience applying NVC with all kinds of people and all types of conflicts, he found that almost every conflict can eventually be resolved if everyone commits to following NVC principles.

In this context, “conflict resolution” refers to the process of resolving conflicts between yourself and another person; “mediation” refers to helping others resolve a conflict in which you are not involved.

### The Importance of Human Connection in NVC

Establishing a human connection between the people involved in a conflict is the most important part of Nonviolent Communication. Without that connection, none of the other steps will be useful because neither party will be motivated to truly understand the other. **In fact, creating a genuine human connection is the true goal of NVC—either party getting what they want is a byproduct of that relationship.** To successfully resolve a conflict with NVC, everyone involved must understand and agree to that goal.

The emphasis on human connection differentiates the NVC approach from traditional mediation and conflict resolution techniques. In traditional mediation, the mediator’s goal is to get everyone to agree to a single solution. Establishing any kind of genuine connection between the people involved is out of their purview—many mediators even see the NVC approach as a form of psychotherapy, not mediation. In reality, the NVC approach to conflict resolution is much more efficient: Instead of offering solutions first and asking for feedback, NVC focuses on what both parties need and creates solutions that will meet those needs in full.

### Conflict Resolution

When the people on both sides of a conflict establish a human connection and a sense of mutual respect, they’ll understand that their own needs and the other person’s needs are equally important. Therefore,**the goal of conflict resolution in NVC is _not_ compromise. **In a compromise, neither party’s needs are fully met—even if the immediate problem is smoothed over, those remaining unmet needs will only cause further problems down the road.

Throughout the entire process of resolving a conflict using NVC, both parties should avoid language that labels, blames, or implies wrongness, since that kind of language often brings empathic conversations to a halt.

#### The Five Steps of NVC Conflict Resolution

The NVC conflict resolution process has five steps. (As noted, the first two steps are reversible—the important thing is to focus on giving everyone a chance to express their needs before moving on to solutions.)

  1. Express your own needs. 
  2. Identify the other person’s needs (this can also be done before expressing your own needs).
  3. Verify that both of you accurately understand each other’s needs.
  4. Provide empathy.
  5. Propose strategies that meet everyone’s needs. 



##### Step 1: Express Your Own Needs

In this step, be careful to differentiate between needs and strategies. **Needs are the fundamental physical and psychological resources that sustain life** , like water, food, meaning, and support. Needs can be met with a number of different _strategies_ —specific actions that fulfill a need. It’s sometimes difficult to tell needs and strategies apart because we’re not used to openly and vulnerably sharing our needs. **The fundamental difference is that need statements don’t refer to any person doing any particular action.**

For example, the statement “I need you to leave me alone for a minute” is a strategy, not a statement of need, because it references someone doing something. A true need statement in that situation might be “I need quiet in order to focus.” That statement leaves the door open for many possible solutions (like earplugs or going to a different room) instead of mandating a certain action.

It can be tempting to couch need statements in intellectual analysis by starting a statement with “I think” instead of “I need.” Unfortunately, **people often interpret analysis as criticism, which can shut down the conversation**. For example, saying “I need to express myself more clearly so I can feel understood” instead of “I think you’re misunderstanding me” avoids the analysis trap and keeps the focus on needs.

##### Step 2: Identify Others’ Needs

If the person you’re communicating with isn’t practicing NVC, they might express their needs in more indirect ways. Silence, rejection, judgmental comments, and nonverbal cues are all veiled statements of need. By recognizing these and translating them, you can keep the conversation flowing nonviolently even if the person you’re talking to isn’t playing along.

Identifying needs expressed through judgment or silence usually involves a degree of guessing. People often use the same cues to express different needs or emotions (like sighing heavily to express exhaustion, frustration, or sadness), so it’s important to check that guess with the other person. This might be a continual process, since most people are more likely to respond with a second indirect expression rather than a clear “Yes, you interpreted my needs correctly.”

##### Step 3: Verify That Everyone’s Needs Have Been Heard

Once you’ve expressed your own needs and identified the other person’s needs, it’s helpful to check that you both understand each other correctly. We often skip this step because we incorrectly assume that when one person clearly expresses a need, the other person hears that need exactly the same way.

In practice, this process is a simple but powerful way to avoid further miscommunication down the line. After you’ve listened to someone’s needs, paraphrase those needs back to them to check your understanding; after you’ve expressed your own needs, you can ask them to do the same.

##### Step 4: Provide Empathy

When people are hurting, they often can’t hear the needs and feelings of others until their own pain has been recognized and understood. The conversation can’t move forward until they get the empathy they need (but just like in any conversation, if you’re feeling too many strong emotions yourself to provide that empathy, it’s best to step away and give yourself some emergency first-aid empathy first). If you skip ahead to the solution phase, the underlying feelings and needs will linger—even if you resolve the conflict on a practical level, the relationship will suffer.

##### Step 5: Propose Solutions

Remember, solutions in NVC are courses of action that meet _everyone’s_ needs rather than asking people to compromise. Propose solutions using **present language** by requesting what you need **in this moment** in order to move forward. This keeps the conversation moving because it gives the other person the chance to either agree or refuse right in the moment. This creates an immediate feedback cycle—if they refuse, you can continue problem solving—rather than having to resume the conversation days or weeks later.

For example, instead of saying, “I want you to come to the party with me this weekend” and then having to wait several days to see if the person follows through, you can say, “I’d like you to tell me if you’d be willing to go to the party with me this weekend.”

It’s also helpful to use **positive action language** when proposing a solution (by asking for what you _do_ want right now instead of what you _don’t_ want) so that your request is clear and specific. However, word choice is important, as some positive action language is easy to mistake for a judgment or attack. For example, “I want you to listen when I speak” or “I want you to be responsible” feel like accusations.

To avoid this, focus your request on things that can be immediately seen or heard. **Imagine your conversation is being filmed—your requests should be for things that would be picked up on camera** (unlike “listening” or “being responsible,” which are abstract ideas).

Remember, a true request is one that the person is free to say “no” to without fear of punishment. If they _do_ refuse your request, listen for the need behind that refusal that is preventing them from saying yes, then try to propose solutions that will also meet that need.

#### Example: Resolving a Decades-Old Marital Conflict

Let’s use a real-life example to illustrate this process. In one of Rosenberg’s NVC workshops, he mediated a conflict for a married couple who had been arguing about their finances for almost forty years. **He began by asking the wife if she could identify her husband’s needs** in this conflict. Her answers reflect common mistakes people make when identifying needs:

  * First answer: “He doesn’t want me to spend money.” Whether or not this is true, it’s a strategy, not a need, because it references a specific person doing a specific action. 
  * Second answer: “He’s just like his father.” This is an analysis, not a need. Again, even if it’s true, this statement isn’t helpful for resolving the conflict. 



At this point, Rosenberg intervened and**asked the husband to express his needs directly.** The husband responded with “She’s a wonderful wife, but she’s totally irresponsible with money.” That’s a diagnosis, not a statement of need. Rosenberg listened for the underlying need and took a guess by asking the man if he was afraid because he needs to provide for his family economically. His guess was correct—they’d finally identified the husband’s underlying need.

After the husband finally expressed his need clearly, Rosenberg asked the wife to **repeat that need back to him**. She responded, “Just because I overdrew the checking account a few times doesn’t mean it will happen again.” This is self-defense, and it’s a common response that indicates someone is in too much pain to really hear someone else’s statement of need. In this case, the wife was so hurt from years of feeling distrusted that she wasn’t open to hearing her husband’s needs until that pain was validated.**Rosenberg empathized by paraphrasing her feelings and needs** around the issue of money.

A few minutes of focused empathy didn’t instantly erase forty years of hurt, but it did provide enough reassurance that the woman’s pain was being heard that she was able to finally hear what her husband was saying. In turn, she was able to express her own needs and clarify that her husband was hearing them correctly.

Once the two spouses had fully expressed their own needs and verified that they each understood the needs of the other, **coming up with solutions to the problem** only took about 20 minutes. Solving a forty-year-old issue in 20 minutes sounds impossible, but it highlights just how much of a conflict isn’t about the issue itself but the needs and feelings of the people involved.

### Mediation

In Nonviolent Communication, a mediator is a third party that helps two people through the five steps of conflict resolution. The mediator keeps the conversation on track by continually refocusing everyone’s attention on feelings, needs, and requests. Mediation can be especially helpful in conflicts where those directly involved are experiencing emotions strong enough to prevent them from listening with empathy.

For mediation to be effective, the mediator _must_ establish trust by reassuring both parties that they are not taking sides. Even if they have personal opinions about the conflict, the mediator’s job is not to secure a particular outcome but to help both parties express their needs, identify each other’s needs, and brainstorm solutions that will meet all those needs.

Mediating a conflict using NVC can be difficult because people often interpret the mediator’s empathy as taking sides. **Empathy is the mediator’s best tool for helping both people feel heard enough to effectively communicate.** For example, the mediator might respond to an accusation of taking sides by saying, “It sounds like you’re feeling annoyed, and that you need to know you’ll get a chance to say your piece?” This brief detour can help everyone stay open to communication instead of retreating into self-defense.

#### Informal Mediation

Informal mediation happens when someone intervenes in a situation and plays the role of mediator without being asked. While you may not want to make a habit of barging into other people’s disputes, it’s sometimes necessary to intervene if you suspect that one person could somehow harm the other (for example, if an argument between your coworkers starts to escalate into shouting).

To be helpful as an informal mediator, you need to be well-practiced in all the steps of NVC and particularly skilled at interpreting needs that are expressed through aggression, derision, or violence.

If you find yourself in the role of informal mediator (assuming there is no immediate threat of physical violence), **your first priority is to empathize with the aggressor in the situation**. If someone is already worked up to the point of shouting, making judgments about their behavior will only escalate the situation and put the other person at risk. Instead, listen for the feelings and needs behind the aggressive person’s behavior and show genuine empathy for those experiences. Once the person feels fully understood, they’ll be calm enough to work through the other steps of NVC conflict resolution.

#### Practical Tips for Mediation

One of the mediator’s biggest responsibilities is ensuring that everyone gets a chance to fully express their needs, which can be especially difficult when tensions run high and people talk over one another. In that case,**it’s helpful to keep a running list of what’s been expressed and by whom**. As a bonus, making a note of what was said last on a whiteboard or large paper can be a visual cue that helps everyone involved stay on topic and be reassured that they’ve been heard.

Additionally, it’s important to **keep the conversation focused on the present**. People in conflict may continually bring up things that happened in the past or their demands for the future. Keeping the focus on what everyone feels and needs _right now_ helps move the conversation toward resolution rather than dwelling on old issues or future possibilities.

In particularly thorny conflicts, people often get stuck in a cycle of repeating their position over and over and making no real progress. **The mediator can help break that cycle by using role-play to represent the needs and experience of both sides**. To start, the mediator will assume the role of one person and state that person’s needs and feelings to the other. This has two benefits: It reassures the person being represented that their needs are being understood, and it makes it easier for the other party to hear those needs because they’re being spoken by a neutral third party.

To keep things even, the mediator would then switch parts and repeat the process. The mediator should check in periodically with “the director” (the person they’re portraying) to make sure they’re on track. You don’t need to be an actor to use role-play—the important part is to tap into a common humanity and try to understand what that person is feeling and needing.

Role-play can also be a useful tool if the parties aren’t willing to meet in person. In that case, you can role play with each person individually, film it, and then show that filmed role play to the other party. This isn’t as effective as in-person mediation, but it can be a helpful tool if necessary.

If a mediation gets especially heated, **the mediator might need to interrupt in order to keep the conversation on track**. One way to do this is to repeat “excuse me” as many times (and as loudly) as necessary. When the shouting stops and you have the group’s attention, refocus the conversation on the most recent expression of needs that hasn’t been fully addressed. If you suspect you might need to interrupt the group frequently to keep the conversation productive, it helps to clarify in advance that you’ll only interrupt to keep the process moving and that everyone will get a chance to express themselves.
