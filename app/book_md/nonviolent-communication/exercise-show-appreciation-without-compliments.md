## Exercise: Show Appreciation Without Compliments

The NVC approach to appreciation might feel foreign if you’re used to relying on compliments. Let’s practice expressing appreciation without those judgments.

* * *

Think of the last time someone in your life did something that directly benefited you. For example, maybe your coworker brought you a cup of coffee or your spouse cleaned up the kitchen. What positive labels (like “helpful” or “generous”) come to mind to describe that person?

Instead of relying on those labels, how would you rephrase the compliment in the NVC formula? Remember, you want to express three things:

  1. What the person did
  2. What need their actions fulfilled
  3. What positive emotions that fulfillment created



Now, think of the last time you felt the urge to compliment someone for something that did _not_ directly benefit you. For example, maybe your daughter aced her science test, your friend got a new job, or your neighbor worked hard to improve her health. What positive labels (like “smart,” “talented,” or “dedicated”) come to mind to describe that person?

Instead of relying on those labels, how would you rephrase the compliment in the NVC formula?
