## Exercise: Rewrite Your Inner Dialogue

It’s not always easy to talk back to your inner critic. Luckily, NVC provides an easy formula to turn those judgments into solutions.

* * *

Think of the last time you judged yourself harshly. What was your inner critic saying about you?

Now, try rephrasing that criticism using the NVC formula: **“When _a_ happens, I feel _b_ because I need _c_. Therefore, I would like _d_.” **

If you reframed all your self-critical thoughts this way, how would it change the way you see yourself?

How would it change the way you interact with others?

How could you remind yourself to practice this skill in your everyday life?
