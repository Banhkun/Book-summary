## Exercise: Identify Your Empathy Limits

Sometimes, you may feel so threatened or upset by someone that you’re not able to offer genuine empathy. This exercise will help you make a plan for those situations.

* * *

Think of a person or group that violates your values so profoundly that you find them impossible to empathize with. When you’ve interacted with that person or group in the past, what emotions were you feeling?

When you think about that person or group now, what emotions come up?

Thinking about that person or group right now, while you’re not directly interacting with them, do you still find it impossible to empathize with them? What feelings or needs of theirs can you identify?

The next time you have to interact with this person or group, how can you show _yourself_ some emergency first-aid empathy?
