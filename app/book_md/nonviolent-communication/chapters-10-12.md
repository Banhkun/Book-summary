## Chapters 10, 12: Expressing Anger and Using Force in NVC

Historically, some groups promoting nonviolence have (consciously or unconsciously) used that approach to silence the anger of people experiencing oppression and unfair treatment. The implicit message was that being angry about being mistreated was part of the problem, so members of oppressed groups should just accept discrimination for the sake of keeping the peace. The irony is that demanding someone repress their feelings is an act of violence in itself. Instead, NVC outlines a way to honor the feeling of anger and express it fully—and in a nonviolent way.

#### Other People Are the Stimulus, Not the Cause

Just like with any feeling in Nonviolent Communication, fully expressing anger starts by taking responsibility for it. To do that, we have to accept that **other people are never the true cause of our anger.** Causal language (like in the phrase “He made me angry”) implies that someone’s behavior directly created your emotion—in reality,**what you feel is the result of how you _interpret_ that behavior. **

To illustrate this, imagine you have a friend over for dinner and they accidentally break a glass. If the glass was expensive or had sentimental value, you might be furious; if it was cheap or brought back unpleasant memories, you might not be bothered. Either way, how you _feel_ about the glass determines whether you get angry—not the broken glass itself.

**In the logic of NVC, we unconsciously cause our own anger by making judgments about other people and their behavior.** In other words, when you feel angry, you’re not reacting to someone’s behavior—you’re reacting to your own unmet needs, and that person’s behavior is just the stimulus that provoked the reaction.

This doesn’t mean anger is something you choose to turn on or off depending on the situation. The process of turning an external stimulus into a feeling of anger plays out unconsciously, and that**anger often disappears the moment you decide to tune into your needs and emotions instead**.

For example, if you were unexpectedly fired from your job, you might rage about how your boss is an idiot and attribute your fury to his decision. In reality, your boss is just the stimulus—the _cause_ of that anger is the fact that your needs for financial security and a positive self-image are now being unmet. In that case, anger is a secondary emotion that obscures your fear and sadness about not being able to financially provide for yourself or your family.

Making that distinction between stimulus and cause is especially difficult in a culture that discourages emotional vulnerability. It’s much easier and more culturally acceptable to be outraged after losing a job than to be honest about being afraid or dejected. The English language blurs the line between stimulus and cause even further—we use phrases like “You make me angry” and “I’m upset because he did that” to place the blame on others rather than taking responsibility for our own emotions.

#### Anger Highlights Unmet Needs

It can be especially hard to take responsibility for anger when it feels like “righteous indignation” or in situations where you’ve been directly harmed by someone else’s behavior. In NVC, that anger can be either a harmful distraction or a helpful tool depending on how you respond to it.

On a philosophical level, staying stuck in anger isn’t consistent with NVC because it requires committing to a moralistic judgment of someone else. **Anger stems from the judgment that a certain behavior is “wrong,”** and that kind of judgment hinders our ability to authentically connect with someone else, which is the goal of NVC. **Refraining from judging someone as “wrong” doesn’t mean you endorse their behavior** —it just means you’re choosing to frame it in terms of your own feelings and needs instead of name-calling.

On a practical level, anger can also be a helpful indicator of an unmet need—noticing the bodily sensations that go along with anger can act as a reminder to observe and identify our feelings and needs. However, once you’re aware of that unmet need, anger makes it even harder to get that need met because it distracts you with a focus on punishment and blame.

For example, if you hear a relative make a racist comment, your automatic response might be anger. Once you notice that feeling, **you have two options: Stick with the anger or dig deeper for the underlying need.** If you choose to stick with anger you might find yourself in a shouting match with your relative that ultimately goes nowhere. On the other hand, if you choose to look for the unmet need and approach it with empathy, you may discover that your anger stems from a need for all people to be treated with fairness and respect. If that’s the case, shouting at your relative or calling him a racist is unlikely to help you meet that need. Armed with that awareness, you can now consciously choose to approach the conversation with empathy and have a better chance at meeting your needs.

The example above is an ideal scenario. In reality, resisting the urge to lash out when someone says something ignorant or derogatory is easier said than done. Anger is a powerful emotion, so like every aspect of NVC, this requires extensive practice before it becomes a habit. But if the goal is to create a world in which people are treated fairly, anger isn’t the best strategy. People immediately shut down when they feel judged or blamed, so they’re far less open to hearing our needs and feelings.

#### How to Express Anger

Before you can fully express anger, you need to be sure the other person is in a position where they’re able to truly listen to that expression. In other words, **you need to offer empathy first before you can expect to be heard empathically**. This is one of the most difficult parts of dealing with anger nonviolently because it runs so counter to our fight-or-flight impulse. If your uncle starts making racist comments at the dinner table, offering empathy may be the last thing you feel like doing—but launching into expressing your anger without that step sets the conversation up to fail.

If you feel too worked up to offer empathy at first, it may be best to take a break and offer _yourself_ some emergency first-aid empathy before engaging. In practice, this means allowing yourself a moment to feel the full extent of your anger without judging yourself for being angry or thinking judgmental thoughts.

Although it’s difficult, **offering empathy to someone who makes you angry helps defuse the situation** by reconnecting you to a sense of common humanity. If you’re able to observe without judging, identify the person’s feelings, and connect to their needs, you’ll likely discover that you have something in common with them because all humans have the same fundamental needs. Connecting in this way instead of focusing just on the person’s opinions makes it much easier to engage respectfully.

After offering empathy, there are four steps to expressing anger in NVC:

  1. Stop and breathe.
  2. Identify any judgmental thoughts.
  3. Connect to your needs.
  4. Express your feelings and needs. 



For example, here’s how this process might play out after being fired unexpectedly.

  1. **Stop and breathe.** Try not to respond until you’re able to do so calmly.
  2. **Identify any judgmental thoughts** —but without judging _yourself_ for having them. Internally fuming about your boss’s every fault is a normal response to being fired. Instead of trying to stem the flow of thoughts, simply observe it and let it pass without criticizing yourself.
  3. **Connect to your needs.** When you feel calmer, try to identify the needs underlying your anger (for example, the need for financial security).
  4. **Express your feelings and needs.** For example, you might say, “I feel terrified because I need to support my family financially.” By working through each step, you’ve allowed yourself to fully feel your emotions (both the anger and the underlying fear) and to express them without placing the blame on your boss.



Even if you’re careful to express your feelings in a way that shows you’re taking responsibility for them, other people may hear that expression as blame. Since blame puts people into either self-defense or self-deprecation and shuts down their ability to listen empathically, slow down and clarify if you sense someone feeling blamed.

### When Using Force Is Necessary

Unfortunately, we can’t always resolve conflicts with conversation, especially if there’s a threat of immediate harm (for example, if you witness two teenagers launch into a fist fight). In that case, it may be necessary to use physical force in order to keep people safe. The NVC paradigm recognizes that force is sometimes necessary to prevent immediate harm, and that **force can be a tool of nonviolence as long as it is used protectively and not punitively**.

To understand this distinction, imagine a parent playing outside with their young child when the child suddenly darts into the street. Physically intervening by grabbing the child’s arm and pulling them back to safety is an example of protective force because the inten is to prevent immediate bodily harm. The parent’s sole focus is protecting their child, and they aren’t making any judgments about the child’s behavior.

On the other hand, if the parent then turns around and spanks the child for running into the street in the first place, that’s a punitive use of force—the parent has evaluated the child’s behavior, judged it as “bad,” and determined that the child deserves to be punished with force.

#### Protective Force

Protective force can take many forms in addition to physically restraining someone who is about to harm themselves or others. For example, in schools, the use of a “do-nothing room” where students can go if they’re not ready to work is a form of protective force. Students aren’t physically forced into the room—they can ask to go, or be asked by a teacher to go, if they’re causing a distraction for other students. (“Force,” in this case, refers to the distractions caused by rowdy students being contained to the do-nothing room.) The intent is to protect students who _do_ want to work, not to punish students for being off task.

What truly sets protective force apart from punitive force is the set of assumptions behind it. **When we use force protectively, the assumption is that the threat of danger is a result of ignorance, not malice**. In this context, “ignorance” can take several forms:

  * Being unaware of consequences (like the young child darting into the street)
  * Not being able to identify other strategies to meet a need 
  * Mistakenly believing that some people are “bad” and “deserve” punishment (in reality, “badness” is a subjective judgment, not an objective fact)
  * Delusional thinking or psychosis 



All of these definitions of ignorance acknowledge that **when people endanger themselves or others, they do so because they have unmet needs**(for justice, attention, medical care, and so on), not because they are fundamentally bad people.

#### Punitive Force

On the other hand,**the assumption behind the use of punitive force is that some people are evil, and when they do things we disagree with, they deserve to be punished.** The punishment should be severe enough to make them really suffer because only suffering will make them repent and change their behavior. These assumptions are the polar opposite of the tenets of NVC, and punishment often backfires by creating hostility or resentment instead of positive behavior change.

Even if punitive force _does_ create behavior change, it’s likely motivated by fear or shame rather than a genuine desire to do better. This distinction matters more than many people realize in day-to-day situations. For example, if you tell your child to clean their room, what do you want their motivation to be for doing it? Do you want them to do it because you hope to instill an appreciation for neatness and help them develop skills they’ll need in adulthood—or because they’re afraid of being punished if they don’t comply? Most parents would choose the former, but using punitive force is more likely to result in the latter.

Punitive force is not always physical. Using blame or name-calling as punishment is a form of punitive force because it assigns a value judgment to a person or their behavior. Withholding privileges can also qualify as punitive force when the intent is to punish someone and ultimately make them change their behavior.

##### Corporal Punishment

Corporal punishment is a type of punitive force that is mostly directed at children. **Any use of physical force on a child for the purpose of “teaching them a lesson” is corporal punishment—including spanking.** Some parents swear by spanking as an effective method to alter their children’s behavior. They think of spanking as a genuine act of love because it prevents their children from doing things that could be dangerous and provides the strict limits that generally make children feel safe.

The flaw in this argument is that viewing spanking as a loving act requires logical reasoning, which children haven’t yet developed. For a child, there is nothing loving about spanking—it just hurts. Over time, repeated experiences with spanking send the message that violence is an acceptable way to solve problems.
