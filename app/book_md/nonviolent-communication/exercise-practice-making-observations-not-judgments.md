## Exercise: Practice Making Observations, Not Judgments

Making objective observations instead of judgments about people you disagree with is difficult. Practice this skill by starting with _positive_ judgments you’ve made.

* * *

Think of a person or group that you’ve made a _positive_ moralistic judgment about recently. (For example, “My son is so smart” or “The U.S. women’s national soccer team is the best team in history.”) Write that judgment below.

How can you rephrase that judgment as an observation? (For example, “My son got an A on his spelling test” or “The U.S. women’s soccer team has won four gold medals.”)

Now, think of a _negative_ moralistic judgment you’ve made in the past. (For example, “My neighbor is a jerk” or “Gun owners are bad people.”) Write that judgment below.

How can you rephrase that judgment as an observation? (For example, “My neighbor blew all his leaves into my yard” or “Nonviolence is important to me, so I don’t support owning weapons.”)
