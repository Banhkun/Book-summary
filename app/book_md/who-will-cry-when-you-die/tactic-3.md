## Tactic 3: Be Mindful

In the last chapter, we talked about gaining control of your life by living every moment fully. In this chapter, we’ll introduce another way of seizing control of your life: being mindful at all times.

(Shortform note: Living fully and living mindfully have much in common. They both help you to get the most out of every moment of life. But while living fully may involve doing things you wouldn’t ordinarily do or shifting your perspective in some way, being mindful doesn’t imply this. **Instead, mindful living simply means being more present and self-aware at all times**.)

We’ll begin this chapter by discussing the need for mindfulness and the ways to achieve it. We’ll then move on to some specific areas of your life where mindfulness is especially useful.

### Always Be Mindful

Mindfulness __ is key to seizing control of your life, writes Sharma. **If you focus fully on the task at hand, you execute it to the best of your ability.** You gain more control over what you do and your impact.

(Shortform note: Intense focus on the present can be helpful in your work life, too, according to Cal Newport in _Deep Work._ Newport’s concept of deep work is an activity that demands all your concentration. As we move toward an economy in which deep work is more necessary than shallow work, honing your ability to do deep work increases your workplace value.)

Sharma recognizes that it’s hard to concentrate because our world is full of distractions. **But** **you possess** **the power to concentrate: Learn to control your thoughts and focus**. If you can’t, your attention will constantly shift, and you’ll never progress toward your purpose.

(Shortform note: Sharma’s advice to control your thoughts and avoid distraction has much in common with Buddhist teachings. In Buddhism, "Right Concentration,” the ability to focus on a single activity or idea, is part of the Buddha’s Eightfold Path that leads to enlightenment. Buddhist teachings add that learning to concentrate intently on negative desires or feelings, such as revenge, does _not_ lead to enlightenment. Your state of mind must be pure and open-hearted, with a desire to attain a higher level of awareness.)

Sharma recommends five specific strategies to build your ability to be mindful:

#### Strategy #1: Meditate

Meditation increases your ability to concentrate and be present,**** says Sharma. He recommends developing a regular meditation practice.

(Shortform note: Sharma recommends you start meditating regularly, but he doesn’t offer specific suggestions on how to do that. A basic practice is to develop an awareness of your body and breathing and to stay with the in- and outflow of the breath until your mind wanders. When you notice your mind wandering, bring your attention back to the breath without admonishing yourself for having lost concentration. Do this for a set amount of time, like 10 or 15 minutes.)

#### Strategy #2: Read Mindfully

Read something physical (like a book or magazine) and**mark in the margin of the text whenever you become distracted** , advises Sharma. This shows you how often you get lost in thought and lets you practice coming back to presence.

(Shortform note: Sharma advises you to notice when you get distracted while reading, but reading offers several other ways to strengthen your mindfulness muscle, too. For instance, turn off all technology while reading and notice how often you think about checking your phone or email.)

#### Strategy #3: Take Mindful Walks

**Go on walks without a destination and without thinking about your life’s worries** , advises Sharma. Be aware of your surroundings and bring your attention back to them when it has wandered.

(Shortform note: Sharma recommends leaving behind your worries when you go on walks. But how do you “leave behind” worries? In his book _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,_ Dale Carnegie __ recommends learning to accept what’s outside of your control and thinking about how likely it is your worries will come to pass—which usually isn’t that likely. Disengage from your worries before a walk by taking these steps.)

#### Strategy #4: Plant a Tree

Sharma proposes that you **plant a tree to become more mindful of the passage of time**. The changing leaves will keep you connected to the cycles of nature and ground you in the present.

(Shortform note: Beyond the mindfulness benefits, living near trees can actually reduce the negative impacts of depression and stress on health. This is because green spaces offer room to exercise and enjoy social interactions, activities that combat mental distress.)

#### Strategy #5: Mindfully De-Stress After Work

Finally, **after work, mindfully de-stress before engaging with your loved ones** , urges Sharma. Sit outside your home for a bit or take a quick walk to disengage from work and be more present with the people you love.

(Shortform note: Sharma gears his advice about de-stressing after work toward people who work in an office. But what about people working from home—how should they de-stress when there’s no barrier between their job and their personal life? One way is to set up an end-of-work ritual that helps you transition from work mode to after-work mode. Completely turn off your work-related technology, for instance, to give yourself time to prepare to be with your family.)

### Be Mindful of Your Instincts

We’ve just talked about the importance of mindfulness and the ways you can build your capacity for mindfulness. Now, we’ll talk about two specific areas of your life where mindfulness is especially critical.

The first area is your instincts. Sharma claims that usually, **your instincts about people, things, and circumstances are right** , and when you’re mindful of them, you’re more likely to make decisions that move you closer to your purpose.

(Shortform note: Sharma suggests heeding your instincts more often since they’re generally reliable. Research confirms that some of your instincts—specifically, first impressions of other people—are reasonably accurate indicators of whether or not you’ll get along with someone. In a study, researchers compared the first impressions of strangers meeting a person—who we’ll call Person A—to personality reports on Person A completed by their longtime friends. The first impressions were similar to the personality reports by longtime friends, showing that the participants’ instincts were accurate.)

### Be Mindful of Your Weaknesses

The other area of life you should bring mindfulness to, says Sharma, is**** your weaknesses. Understand what your personal hurdles are and then make necessary changes to overcome those hurdles and effectively seize control of your life.

(Shortform note: Sharma advises you to be aware of your weaknesses, but it’s often not easy to determine what they are in the first place. _Thanks for the Feedback_ offers advice on how to locate your blind spots: the weaknesses you’re unable to see. One way to do this is to record yourself in situations where you’re experiencing difficulty—perhaps in conversation with a co-worker. A recording tells you objectively how you behave and sound in that situation, allowing you to assess if the difficulty you’re experiencing is due to a behavioral blind spot (for instance, being rude to people).)
