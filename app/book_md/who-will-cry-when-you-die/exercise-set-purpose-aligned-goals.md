## Exercise: Set Purpose-Aligned Goals

Create a set of goals that move you closer toward your purpose each day, month, and year.

* * *

Note down your life’s purpose (or purposes). (As a reminder, your purpose is the special ability you were born with that you can use to make the world better. This might be: “to be a good caregiver,” “to always spread kindness,” or “to bring joy to the world through my art.”)

Now, think about how you want to grow toward your purpose over the course of a year. Describe one or two goals you can achieve in a year that align you with your purpose. (If your purpose is to always spread kindness, a year’s goal might be to find a new job in customer service, so you can spread kindness at work.)

Next, break down that year’s goal (or goals) into smaller goals you can accomplish each month. (To get a customer service job by the end of a year, each month, you might set the goal of sending out four resumes and attending one networking event.)

Finally, break your monthly goal down into smaller daily goals. (To attend a networking event once a month, every day, you might dedicate fifteen minutes to researching such events.)
