## Exercise: Spread Kindness by Educating Yourself

Find an area to expand your knowledge in the service of others.

* * *

Think about your friends and family: Who in your life is struggling in some way? (This might be a mental health struggle, an academic struggle, or some other struggle.) Note who this person is and be as specific as possible about what their current challenge is.

What knowledge or information could help the person overcome their struggle? Write down as many suggestions as possible. (For instance, if your friend suffers from social anxiety, read some articles by psychologists on how to cope with this form of anxiety.)

Now, how can you acquire the information that might help this person overcome their struggle? (For instance, what sorts of literature, documentaries, podcasts, and so on might you consume to assist them?) Write down as many ideas as possible.
