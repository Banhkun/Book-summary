## Exercise: Create Your Own Rejuvenating Break

Devise your own break that will keep you energized and purpose-aligned. Sharma proposes three types of specific, periodic breaks to build into your schedule. But you can also reflect on your unique needs and build in breaks specific to you.

* * *

First, think about your week: On what days or at what hours do you become unmotivated or sluggish? When do you find your energy sinking? (Do you often feel sluggish after lunch? Do you start your weeks with little energy and end them with lots of energy?)

For each of the slumps youâ€™ve noted, what type of break do you think will most help you to stay energized? (After lunch, do you need an energizing break? At the beginning of the week, do you need a break to reconnect to your purpose?)
