## Exercise: Apply Human-Focused Principles to Your Work

 _Humanocracy_ ’s authors argue __ that most companies have much more bureaucracy than they need and that we should replace bureaucratic practices with human-focused principles. Take some time now to think about how bureaucracy might be hindering your work and how you could replace it with human-focused approaches.

* * *

What’s one bureaucratic practice that you regularly engage in at work? (For example, maybe you’re a manager who demands daily reports from your team members, or you might be an experienced team member who still has to ask permission before giving any customer a refund.)

Is that bureaucratic practice absolutely necessary, or could you still carry out your job functions without doing it? Explain your answer. (For example, the manager could likely still monitor their team’s actions and results from a distance without demanding _daily_ reports. The employee could use their experience to judge when refunds are warranted and give them without needing permission.)

Hypothetically, how might you replace that bureaucratic practice with a human-focused practice? In other words, how could you meet the same business need while maintaining employee autonomy and encouraging creative solutions? (For example, instead of having to ask for manager approval to give refunds, what if you were empowered to give whatever refunds you saw fit and the manager simply reviewed them at the end of the week? As a manager, what if you trusted your employees to complete their tasks without demanding daily updates, instead encouraging autonomy and holding check-ins on an as-needed basis?)
