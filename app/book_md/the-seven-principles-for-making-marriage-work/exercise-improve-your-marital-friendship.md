## Exercise: Improve Your Marital Friendship

Now that you know that having a good marital friendship is essential to the health of your relationship, apply Gottman and Silver’s advice so that you can improve your marital satisfaction.

* * *

Briefly describe a recent argument you had with your spouse. What did you think about your spouse during that argument? For example, if your spouse dropped their laundry next to (and not in) the hamper, did you think, “Man, they’re so lazy!,” or “Wow, they must have had a busy day!”

Does your reaction indicate positive or negative sentiment override toward your spouse? Recall that if you have positive sentiment override, you trust that your partner is doing their best and assume that they have positive intentions. If you have negative sentiment override, you assume that your partner is sabotaging you and has negative intentions.

Which friendship-related principle do you think you and your spouse are most lacking in? (The principles are: Get to know your partner, foster and communicate affection, regularly respond to each other’s overtures, and keep an open mind by being receptive to your partner’s requests.)

What's something that you can do today to improve upon how well you practice the principle you named above? For example, if you usually tune your partner out when they talk about their hobby, commit to asking one question about it today.
