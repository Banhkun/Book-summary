## Shortform Introduction

In our fast-paced, high-stress world, nearly everyone is trying to find the source of true peace, joy, and fulfillment. We often look to religion, relationships, career accomplishments, and material possessions.

_The Power of Now_ insists that we can’t find the peace and happiness we seek in anything outside ourselves. Instead, **the only way to find true peace and fulfillment is through being present in each moment.** The more you live in the Now, the more you are able to connect with your true self and experience life fully. The concept requires you to **be solely and intensely present in each moment, by accepting external circumstances that you cannot change and resisting the temptation to dwell on the past and future**.

The text is written largely in Q&A format, curated from questions Tolle fielded through years of teaching and public speaking. This approach intends to address the questions and confusions readers are likely to have as they read the book.

However, the principles include some very abstract concepts relating to time, the mind, and personal identity. These ideas can be difficult to grasp and can be alienating to some readers (a _TIME_ magazine review notably called it “spiritual mumbo jumbo”), but are unavoidable in examining such inherently abstract concepts as mindfulness and inner peace.

The book does not align specifically with any religion, though it includes many examples of various religions preaching the same principles. Parts of the book are written like a guided meditation, to draw readers into understanding by practice, rather than purely explanations. This approach reinforces the notion that **these principles cannot be understood intellectually but must be grasped intuitively;** this is reiterated regularly in the book. To this end, don’t get caught up on the strict definitions of terms used to explain the concepts.

In this Shortform summary, we have divided the book’s contents into a step-by-step guide to understanding what it means to be present, how it can improve your life, and how to put it into practice.

  * First, we’ll talk about what gets in the way of us being present and why not being present creates so many of the problems in our lives.
  * Then, we’ll explore how to become more present and how it will impact your life. 



Given how abstract the principles can be, we have added examples to help illustrate many of the concepts. We will note them as (Shortform examples) when they are not directly from the book, but we believe they’re faithful to the author’s meaning.
