## Exercise: How Are You Using Time?

It’s possible to learn from the past and plan goals for the future while staying present: The key is not to get so consumed in the past or future that it distracts you from the Now. Use this exercise to assess how you are using time, and how you can avoid dwelling on the past or future.

* * *

Describe a mid- to long-term goal you are currently working toward.

What is your motivation for this goal? In other words, why have you chosen this as a goal to put your time and energy toward? What do you hope to gain from it?

Reflect on what you’ve already done to get closer to achieving your goal. Were you present enough to really experience each of those steps, or were you so focused on your goal that your actions were just a means to an end?

Think about how you can remain present and engaged in the journey as you continue working toward your goal. (Maybe you keep a journal of your experience along the way, or remind yourself that you can only take one step at a time.) Describe some strategies you could use moving forward.
