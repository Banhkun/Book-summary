## Principle 2: The Ego Prohibits Inner Peace

Now that we know that there is power in being present, let’s examine what keeps pushing your thoughts away from the Now: It’s that voice inside your head. It can be characterized as the devil or angel on your shoulder. It is the voice that analyzes what’s going on around you, comments on your interactions, dwells on the past, speculates about the future, complains, likes or dislikes things, and makes you question yourself in moments of doubt. **This internal voice is the ego**.

### What Is the Ego?

**The ego is a part of your mind that tries to control your thinking and behavior.** (Shortform note: This book personifies the ego as a thinking, feeling entity.)

The ego gives you an interpretation of the world, not a true reflection. **The only true way to see the world is by being fully present and experiencing the Now, without judging or analyzing it.**

(Shortform suggestion: Think of your mind as the screen in a movie theater — it can have rips, wrinkles, and other flaws that distort the movie being projected. Each one of us is watching the movie of life play on our own screens, which all have wear-and-tear from our past experiences, cultural conditioning, and other influences from our ego-created identity.)

Your ego is your “I” or self, how you distinguish yourself from others. **The ego creates your identity from your social status** ; job; possessions; education; appearance; relationships; personal and family history; beliefs; and membership in political, national, racial, and religious groups.

We tend to think that these thoughts and experiences define us, and that our ego is who we are — after all, it’s coming from inside our own head, so who else could it be? But, in fact, **the ego is not our true Being.** Our true Being is the essence of who we are, separate from our mind and body. We’ll discuss this more later.

In order to connect with your true self, you must stop identifying with your ego. You may resist letting go of this identity because if you are not made up by the contents of your mind, then who are you?**** But **problems arise when you identify with your ego, believing that your thoughts, memories, beliefs, and mental condition define you.**

While cultural conditioning, past experiences, and other influences can, indeed, affect your behavior, there’s no need to cling to them as your identity. Allow yourself to be present and their influence may or may not come out naturally.

### The Ego Manufactures Problems

**The ego only has as much power as you give it, and it gains power when you identify with it.** Your ego is threatened by your true Being because when you connect with your true Being, you realize that, by contrast, you are not your ego. (We will explain what, exactly, your True Being is in the next section.)

You can feel your true Being when you are present in the Now, so the ego is also threatened by presence. In the interest of self-preservation, **your ego will do whatever it can to prevent you from being present and identifying with your true self.**

  * The ego is the force pushing your attention away from the present to dwell on the past and future. 
  * The mind can only function in the past and future, because they only exist in your mind (in memories and projections). But the ego has no control over the present, so it pulls you away from the Now. 



#### **The ego uses fear as a tool to prevent you from being present.**

The ego creates worry about the past and future that cause you to dwell on problems and situations you often have no control over.

The ego is not responsible for productive forms of fear that comes in response to a present and immediate danger, which activates your fight or flight response for survival. The ego only creates hypothetical and speculative fear.

(Shortform example: when you’re stuck in traffic and running late to a meeting, the ego is responsible for your stress about walking in late, your worry that your coworkers will think you’re irresponsible, and the hypothetical scene playing in your head of the boss reprimanding you. In reality, your boss and coworkers may (or may not) be more understanding than you think, and some of them might even be caught in this traffic snarl too.

Regardless, stressing about it won’t make the cars move any faster. If you’re present instead, you’ll at least be calm and alert when you do arrive for the meeting, instead of frantic and distracted. Plus, with a clear head, you might even be able to think of another route to circumvent the traffic.)

#### **The ego creates more abstract fears, triggered by perceived threats to your ego-created identity.**

If a situation or person is challenging some aspect of your supposed identity — e.g. your religious beliefs — and you relent, will you no longer be _you_? No, you will continue to be yourself, and you may realize that this element or belief didn’t make you who you are. That epiphany is one step closer to understanding that your ego-created identity is a sham and to connecting with your true Being. This, again, is a threat to the ego.

For example, if you always need to be right in an argument, that stems from a fear of losing your sense of identity. If you believe your thoughts and your mental positions are part of who you are (based on your ego-created identity), then being wrong shakes the foundation of your identity. But if you know your true self is not tethered to your thoughts and beliefs, then it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.

Notice when you get defensive about something. Ask yourself, “What am I defending?” You are likely defending the identity your ego has created.

**The ego will feel threatened as you start practicing mindfulness and resisting its control** , so it may create more fears in an effort to stay in control.

#### The ego always has a feeling of lacking or being incomplete. This can manifest as not feeling worthy or good enough.

**The ego’s lacking feeling can create an intense, ego-fueled craving or desire for possessions, money, success, power, recognition, a relationship, or another temporary pleasure to fill that void.**

The ego falsely believes that temporary pleasures can make you feel complete. When we identify with our mind, we identify with those desires and cravings. We seek fulfillment and happiness through acquiring those things, but although they may momentarily satiate the craving, **satisfying a desire will never bring peace and enlightenment.**

  * In an extreme form, these cravings become addictions. 
  * The Buddha says that pain and suffering come from desire and craving.



Desires and cravings keep our focus in the future: “Once I attain this, I will be happy.” That mindset keeps us out of the present moment, which is the only place to find peace and enlightenment.

Your desires may even include enlightenment. You might think, “I will work to achieve enlightenment, and when I reach it, my life will be better.” Although enlightenment does bring joy and peace, your ego is still placing that in the future. Instead, you can experience joy and peace _now_ by being present.

#### Unconsciousness

When you identify with your ego and are not present, you are in a state of unconsciousness. There are two forms of unconsciousness: ordinary unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness.

**Ordinary unconsciousness is a normal state for someone who identifies with her ego, with a consistent low-level of unease, discontent, boredom, or nervousness.** This is like the hum of an air conditioner, a subtle background noise that you don’t notice until it stops.

**Deep unconsciousness is more acute and painful. This is when the panic alarm goes off** — when problems arise in life, you face a conflict in a relationship, or the ego is significantly threatened.

Deep unconsciousness inspires intense anger, fear, aggression, depression and other negativity, causing our more extreme actions like physical violence.

  * Deep unconsciousness can happen more easily when there is a crowd or community of people who create negative collective energy (think of phenomena like mob mentality).



If you already experience ordinary unconsciousness in day-to-day circumstances, challenges will typically intensify that to a level of deep unconsciousness. In other words, if you struggle to be present when life is calm, how will you do it when stress and chaos ensue?

For this reason, **it’s important to practice being present in day-to-day life when things are going relatively smoothly**. We’ll talk more about how to practice being present later.

How much time do you spend thinking about things besides what is happening in the present moment? Put another way, can you turn your mind off whenever you want? If not, then your mind is in control, instead of you controlling your mind.

Nearly everyone is constantly consumed in thoughts, so it’s considered normal, and we don’t stop and realize how it is affecting us.

### What Is Your True Being?

Who are you, if not your thoughts, beliefs, and experiences? Are those not the things that make you uniquely _you_?

Your ego leads you to believe that your identity must be steeped in the qualities that make you different from everyone around you. However, your true Being connects you with everyone and every living thing in the world.

**Your true Being is your deepest self, which you can connect with only when you are present.** Your Being is your life energy, which is unaffected by your physical body, your mind and ego, and any external factors.

The world is made up of life energy taking on physical forms (like humans, plants, animals). This means that every living thing has a true Being, and all Beings are connected by a unifying life energy. (Shortform note: This concept is very nebulous and difficult to grasp. Tolle acknowledges this, and says you can only grasp it by experiencing your true Being. He asks readers not to try to understand Being, but rather to feel it when they are present.)

**Your Being is indestructible, even in the death of your physical body; it exists before you are born and lives on after your death.** Think of your body as merely the physical form that your Being takes on. We should not get attached to the physical forms, because they are only temporary. (Shortform note: “Being” seems somewhat comparable to “soul,” though that word is never mentioned.)

**Connecting with your Being is the only way to attain true happiness,** and being present is the only way to connect with your true Being; you can’t have one without the other.

You can access presence and your Being only by shedding your ego-created thoughts and identity, which are responsible for your pain, fear, and unhappiness (We will explore this more in later sections). Thus, being present and connecting with your Being are the only routes to inner peace, joy, and true happiness.

### How To Disconnect From Your Ego And See Your True Being

How do you disconnect from the voice inside your own head? It takes deliberate effort, attention, and practice.

**You can begin to separate your true self from your egoic mind by observing your thoughts. This is called “watching the thinker.”** Thoughts come from your ego, making your ego the “thinker.” The part of you that can observe your thoughts without engaging in them is the “watcher,” your true self.

**Try this: think, “I wonder what my next thought will be.” Wait and watch.** Notice that your thoughts will likely stall for a moment while you are in this state of presence and alertness. You’ve just watched the thinker.

When you can understand that the watcher and the thinker are separate, then you can realize that you are not made of your thoughts. In moments when your mind is still and thoughts are quiet, you still exist and are still yourself.

**As soon as you witness your thoughts, you’ve separated yourself from them — even if only for a moment.** This is a victory in itself.

As you are watching your thoughts, be mindful not to analyze or judge them. Those analytical or judgmental thoughts would be your ego slipping back in through the back door. Instead, simply observe.

As you start practicing, you will experience states of "no-mind” — also called **presence or consciousness — when there is a pause in your thoughts and you are connected with your true self**. (In contrast, when you are not present you are under your ego’s control and are stuck in your thoughts.) These moments will be brief at first, but will extend with more practice.

Although your thoughts are quiet when you are present, it is a state of alertness and awareness of the present moment and of your true Being.

  * When you are present you feel peace and inner stillness, though this is not a trancelike state like meditation. You actually become more alert and aware because you are solely and intensely focused on the Now. Sounds become more distinct, colors are more vivid, and the world is clearer without the white noise of your internal monologue. 



**You can practice being present in your day-to-day life by putting your full attention on a routine, mindless task.** Here are a few examples.

  * When you walk up or down stairs, think about every step you take. Feel your body making every movement. Notice the warmth in your leg muscles. Pay attention to your breath. 
  * When you wash your hands, pay attention to the sound and feel of the water running over your hands. Focus on how you move your hands. Notice the smell of the soap. Feel the texture of the towel. 



We are so accustomed to the ego’s control — and the low, constant hum of thoughts running through our mind — that it can be easy to overlook. To notice if you are present, ask yourself, “Am I feeling joy, ease, and lightness?” If the answer is no, then you are not present.

If that’s the case, you may not need to change _what_ you are doing in that moment, but _how_ you are doing it. Focus your complete attention on each minute detail of the task at hand to bring yourself back to the present.
