## Exercise: Remember Personality Clashes in Childhood

Upbringing affects personality, but some qualities you’re born with. Begin thinking about your own innate characteristics as we enter this study of human personality.

* * *

What is a personality trait that you and a sibling don’t have in common? (If you are an only child, think about a childhood friend. Some examples include quiet versus outgoing, or adventurous versus cautious.)

Think back to a time when this difference caused a conflict between you and the other person. What happened?

Do you and this person still experience occasional conflict over this difference in personality? If yes, how so? If no, why not?
