## Chapter 1: Introduction

In _Surrounded by Idiots_ , **Thomas Erikson argues that there are four distinct personalities, and everyone reflects one or more of them** **in their behavior.** While he touches on how they affect personal relationships, the bulk of this bestseller discusses **how each personality type would behave in common workplace scenarios**. Throughout the book, Erikson advises readers on how to use this information to improve their work lives.

Erikson is a lecturer and self-described behavioral and communications expert. He teaches his personality system to businesses all over the world as a way to improve company culture and boost effectiveness. Erikson came up with the title _Surrounded by Idiots_ during a conversation with a prominent entrepreneur, in which the man complained to Erikson that everyone he hired turned out to be an idiot. When the man went into greater detail, Erikson realized that this businessman simply didn’t _understand_ his employees.

Erikson says most people think this way—that if someone behaves in a manner we can’t understand, they must be stupid. He contends that **by understanding your own personality type and those of your colleagues, you can stop viewing others as “idiots” and improve your relationships and communication skills.**

We’ve divided this guide into two parts. In Part 1, we explore the ways that Erikson says each personality thinks and behaves.**** Part 2 focuses on how to _use_ this information. Throughout the guide, we compare Erikson’s ideas about personality with other personality-typing models, and we add perspectives from psychologists to support or challenge his assertions.

### Personality Typing: History and Modern Use

Personality typing has garnered a lot of attention in recent years, with several bestselling books on the topic. However, it’s not a new idea to classify human behavior into distinct categories. In fact, **recorded evidence of personality typing goes as far back as the 5th century BC**. Erikson’s choice to designate **four categories of human personality has deep historical roots** : The ancient Greeks and Romans, the Aztecs, and others have all used a four-category system of classification.

The 20th century saw a resurgence of interest in the study and classification of human behavior. Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and William Moulton Marston are noted for directly influencing virtually every personality typing model being used today—and as you’ll see in the next section, Erikson’s use of the DISC model is no exception. The DISC model (on which this book is based) divides personalities into four categories: people who are driven by the traits of **D** ominance, **I** nfluence, **S** tability, and **C** ompliance.

(Shortform note: Despite being pioneered by a neurologist (Freud), psychiatrist (Jung), and psychologist (Marston), **personality typing is widely denounced by modern psychologists as well as the scientific community.** Often comparing it to astrology, its critics claim that personality tests are “pseudoscientific”—not consistent enough to be reliable and too subjective to be factual.)

**Rejection by the scientific community hasn’t affected the popularity of personality typing** , however. Erikson’s readers say that the personality typing in _Surrounded by Idiots_ helped them recognize their own behavioral tendencies and enabled them to empathize with those who don’t think and behave as they do. (Shortform note: His readers aren’t alone: According to an article in _The New York Times_ , personality testing is now a $500 million industry—and rising.)

**Personality Typing: Corporations’ Not-So-Secret Weapon** Businesses are increasingly investing in personality testing and consultants (such as Erikson) to boost productivity and improve interpersonal relationships. Polarization exists here as well: Critics claim that this segmentation pigeonholes people to specific teams and roles based on a personality self-assessment rather than actual performance. In some cases, personality tests have even prevented qualified applicants from being hired.  Currently, human resource departments are most commonly using the following personality typing systems:   
---  
**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator** | The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) divides people into 16 personalities based on four indicators: extraversion or introversion, intuition or sensing, thinking or feeling, and perceiving or judging. Based on the research of Carl Jung, the first version of the Myers-Briggs personality assessment was released in 1944 in the United States.   
**Enneagram of Personality** | Contemporary Enneagram theories were developed between the 1950s and 1990s. The Enneagram Institute was created in 1997 to give concrete form to the theories, which classify people into nine personalities (or enneagrams).   
**Hartman’s Color Code** | Published in 1987, Taylor Hartman’s _Color Code_ classifies people into four colors: Red, Blue, White, and Yellow. They are distinguished primarily by what motivates them: power, intimacy, peace, and fun (respectively).   
**DISC Model ** | Based on Marston’s work in the 1920s, the DISC model places people into one of four categories. The factors used to determine placement include: pace of living/working, interest in people versus task, and extroversion versus introversion.   
  
### Erikson’s Color Model

Erikson discusses four personality types in terms of colors: **Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue**. Throughout the text, he refers to people by personality type as Red people, Yellow people, and so on. Erikson’s color model is based on the DISC model, which categorizes people as Dominant, Inspiring, Stable, or Compliant. He explains that **he chose to use colors instead of the DISC terms because they are easier to understand, connect to, and remember.**

According to Erikson, **only 5% of people are one color, or have a single personality type; 80% are two colors or types, and 15% are three.** The Green personality type is the most common, and an entirely Red personality is the rarest.

(Shortform note: Erikson doesn’t explain how he determined these percentages, and because personality types can’t be classified with scientific certainty, the numbers are impossible to prove or refute.)

**Erikson’s Color** | **Red** | **Yellow** | **Green** | **Blue**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Traits** | Extroverted  Ambitious  Confident  Thrill-seeking  Hard-working  Innovative  | Extroverted  Optimistic  Social  Persuasive  Entertaining  Idealistic  | Introverted  Helpful  Easy-going  Cooperative  Regimented  Patient  | Introverted  Obedient  Organized  Meticulous  Cautious  Private   
**DISC Term** | **D** ominant  Driven by the desire to _dominate_ (or lead) others  | **I** nspiring  Driven by the desire to _inspire_(or influence) others  | **S** table  Driven by the desire for _stability_ (routine and security)  | **C** ompliant  Driven by the desire to _comply_ , or do things as they are meant to be done   
  
(Shortform note: Erikson cites the DISC model as the basis for his book but doesn’t specify how the two models align or differ. Depending on the source, descriptions of the DISC model vary. The exact words for the acronym DISC are up for debate, as Erikson uses a few variations in this book, and there are several others from various sources. For example, Erikson refers to the “I” in DISC as both “Influential” and “Inspiring.” Other sources name the “S” as “Submission” or “Steadiness,” and Erikson uses “Stable.” The general meaning behind all of the words remains the same, however.)

**As you read about each color, Erikson says you will recognize yourself and others.** While you might see characteristics that are not flattering, he urges you to remember that no color or personality type is good or bad in itself. Rather, he explains that some colors are better suited to certain roles than others, and each communicates in a unique style. **By learning more about yourself and the people you work with, you should experience greater work satisfaction.**

> **The Psychology of Color**
> 
> Erikson explains that he chose to use colors instead of the DISC terms for ease of understanding, but he doesn’t explain why he chose the colors that he did, or how he assigned them.
> 
> One field of psychology specifically studies the effect of color on our bodies and minds. The research is highly anecdotal, but enough patterns have emerged that psychologists believe there are some universal truths when it comes to color psychology.
> 
> **Red:**One study found a link between the perception of dominance, the color red, and testosterone. The participants (all men) who chose to wear red during a competitive event were determined to have higher levels of testosterone than the participants who chose to wear blue. In a questionnaire, the participants who chose red wrote that they associated the color with dominance and aggression, which they believed would help them in the competition.
> 
> **Yellow:**Color psychology says that people associate yellow with optimism, energy, and warmth—very likely due to our relationship with the sun. It has also been shown to cause feelings of frustration and overwhelm when overdone.
> 
> **Green:** Green often brings to mind images of nature, which tend to have a calming effect. Green has long been a symbol of fertility and new life because of its connection to spring. Green environments have both water and sunshine, so it is perceived as a safe and nurturing color, where living things will thrive.
> 
> **Blue:** Most people associate blue with water, which explains why it brings feelings of serenity and reliability. Unlike plant life, water doesn’t change colors through the seasons; it is always the color you expect it to be. Blue is perceived as conservative and safe, but cold.

### Why This Knowledge Is Power

How will knowing your personality and others’ help you in business and communication? According to Erikson, the short answer is that all communication happens in the listener’s language, not yours.**** He argues that **by learning how to communicate in the listener’s language, or style, you’ll become a better teammate and leader within your organization.**

#### You Will Learn Other “Languages”

Erikson says that one of the greatest challenges of communication is how little control the speaker has over what the listener hears**.** Think of each color or personality type as having its own language. If you’re not speaking in the listener’s language, he will not understand you. However, Erikson asserts that **if you adjust your behavior and communication style to the listener’s way of hearing, your intended message will be more accurately communicated.**

Erikson doesn’t claim to have the silver bullet for effective communication. Rather, he says **this book aims to educate the reader enough to avoid major blunders when it comes to communication basics.**

(Shortform note: Learning how to effectively _listen_ is equally as valuable as learning how to _speak_ in another person’s “language.” One strategy for engaging in active listening is to ask thoughtful questions that solicit detailed answers. People are usually willing to go deeper with their answers and share more information if they trust that you haven’t already made up your mind about the topic. As a result, you might receive additional information that can open your mind and strengthen your relationship.)

#### You Will Become a Better Teammate and Leader

Erikson explains that because there are four personality types, **the majority of people you work with _won’t_ be like you**. They won’t think or behave in the way that you do, and this can cause frustration on both ends. He says that **once you’re able to recognize other people’s personality types, you’ll be able to collaborate with greater ease and efficiency.** You will see that your weaknesses are their strengths, and vice versa. Erikson adds that you will also become better at predicting how others will react in certain situations, as well as recognizing where they’ll struggle and where they’ll shine.

If you manage employees, you will find these tools helpful when creating teams. Erikson stresses that **when you put the right group of people together, there are fewer disagreements, greater employee retention, and higher quality of work.**

> **Workplace Conflict Carries a High Price**
> 
> Erikson argues that this book will help you be a better employee, leader, and colleague because it will cut down on workplace conflict. How valuable is this, exactly?
> 
> The Uncommon League, a business training organization, estimates that each year, private companies in the United States spend more than $350 billion on conflict management. Conflicting leadership methods, work style differences, and personality clashes between co-workers were listed as three of the five most common types of workplace conflict. These conflicts cause employee disengagement, more absences, higher turnover, and greater risk of lawsuits.

### Things to Keep In Mind

Erikson acknowledges that **the process of categorizing people can feel like an oversimplification** and rub some people the wrong way. For this reason, he’s clear about a few things before diving in:

  * **This work analyzes mentally stable personalities**. Mental illness, addiction, trauma, and abuse are not taken into consideration.
  * **How you behave is a combination of genetic inheritance and environment**. Where you grew up and who raised you play a pivotal role in shaping the personality you were born with.
  * **This is a general form of categorization and analysis designed to help you understand yourself and others better** —it’s not an exact science.



(Shortform note: Erikson mentions that environment plays a role in personality development, and culture is a big part of that. In some cultures, personal space is highly valued, whereas in others, displays of affection are abundant. Some countries value individual freedoms over group comfort (such as the United States), and other countries believe the opposite (Japan, for example). Knowing a person’s cultural background would be an asset if you are considering typing their personality.)
