## Exercise: Begin Identifying Your Personality Type

Start to get an idea of what your personality type might be by looking at the chart below. Identify the way you are likely to respond in each of these situations and make note of any patterns you see.   
  


|  **Red** **Response** |  **Yellow** **Response** |  **Green** **Response** |  **Blue** **Response**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Do you enjoy meeting new people?** |  I do if they like the same activities as me.  |  I love it! The more the merrier!  |  Yes, if it’s one person at a time.  |  Not really.   
**Do you prefer to work quickly or slowly?** |  The faster the better.  |  Quickly.  |  I like to take my time.  |  The slower you go, the better you’ll do.   
**Do you like taking risks?** |  Definitely. I take risks all the time.  |  Yes!  |  No, I don’t.  |  Not unless I’ve had time to consider it.   
**What stresses you out?** |  Not being in charge.  |  Negative people.  |  Conflict.  |  Mistakes.   
**If someone has a complaint, how do you prefer they tell you?** |  Quickly and to the point.  |  Sitting side by side, with some compliments.  |  Privately and kindly.  |  In writing, with a detailed explanation.   
**I’ve been wrongly accused of being…** |  A bully.  |  Flaky.  |  Lazy.  |  Uptight.   
**One of my greatest qualities is…** |  My confidence.  |  My optimism.  |  My empathy.  |  My discipline.

Which personality type do you most strongly align with, and why?

Now think about someone you disagree frequently with. What personality type do you think they are, and why?
