## Chapter 3: The Introverts—Green and Blue

In this section, Erikson gives a snapshot of the mindset and behavior characteristics of the Green and Blue personality types, which are both introverted. **Erikson defines introversion as being more active in the internal world than the external**. Said another way, introverts spend more time thinking than acting.

(Shortform note: Myers-Briggs aligns with Erikson’s definition of introversion, adding that introverts prefer spending time alone or in small groups, and that they often enjoy the _idea_ of something as much as the real thing.)

### An Overview of the Green Personality Type

Erikson says that the Green personality, which Hippocrates would call “phlegmatic,” is the most common. He labels Green types as the most balanced and describes them as a little bit of every color.**Green personalities are even-tempered, kind, empathetic, and can go with the flow**. Erikson says they can be perceived as shy or unsure of themselves.

#### Green Personalities Go With the Flow

In terms of behavior, **Green personalities are unlikely to stand out in a crowd.** Because of this, Erikson says they bring a calm and laid-back energy to the group. For harmony’s sake, he says it’s important that most people are Green types. Imagine if _most_ people at a party were trying to be the center of attention, or if _most_ people in an office were trying to lead the meeting. Erikson explains that situations such as these would be terribly painful to take part in.

**Children with the Green personality type tend to do well in school.** Erikson says they follow the rules, complete their homework, and are conscientious toward their peers. They are the students teachers don’t have to worry about.

**Adults with this personality type are great employees because they’re dependable.** Erikson describes them as people who will take orders and do a good job. They hate to disappoint others and crave stability, so they enjoy knowing exactly what is expected of them. Erikson says Green types will put up with issues at work as long as their sense of stability isn’t being threatened, so they’re less likely to leave a job due to dissatisfaction.

> **Men With Type B Personalities Have Lower Risk of Heart Disease**
> 
> This portion of Erikson’s description of the Green personality type closely resembles the personality label “type B,” which is described as being laid-back, adaptable, and patient.
> 
> The terms “type A” and “type B” were coined by two cardiologists (Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman) in the 1950s during a nine-year study on 3,000 men, in which they looked for patterns between personality traits and heart health. They concluded that **those with type B personalitieshad fewer instances of coronary heart disease and high blood pressure than the type A participants**—even when accounting for other risk factors, such as smoking.

#### Green Personalities Are Helpful to Others

**Green types are caring people.** Erikson says they will remember your birthday, support your new venture, and notice if your feelings are hurt. They won’t compete with you or try to steal your spotlight. He adds that Green personalities are empathetic and terrified of offending others. If a Green-dominant person thinks he hurt someone’s feelings, it will keep him up at night with worry and guilt.

**Greens are excellent listeners.** Erikson says they care more about helping others than helping themselves. He says a friend with a Green personality type is the one you should go to for solid, heartfelt advice—as opposed to needing inspiration (from the Yellow-type friend) or tough love (from your Red-type friend).

**Someone with a Green personality type views the “team” above the “self,” and always offers to lighten the load for others.** Because Green types are so kind and helpful, Erikson says they risk being taken advantage of by others and also of burning themselves out. For a Green-dominant person to be stable, Erikson says it’s important that they’re taken care of in return.

> **Wanting to Be Helpful Versus Needing to Be Needed**
> 
> Erikson describes the Green personality as caring and helpful, but there is an important distinction between wanting to help others and feeling a deep desire to be _needed_. Respectively, therapist and professor Suzanne Degges-White refers to the two as “reluctant pleasers” and “relentless pleasers.” From the outside, they appear almost identical—the difference lies in their motivation.
> 
> **Reluctant pleasers help others because they struggle with saying “no.”** While they may agree in the moment, there is often an underlying feeling of dread, unappreciation, and resentment. If you are this person, Degges-White says you run the risk of being taken advantage of, and you should work on prioritizing your own needs before others’.
> 
> **Relentless pleasers help others because their self-esteem is reliant on being needed.** These people equate their value in a relationship with how much they’re able to give to the other person. This behavior can push others away, however, because some people feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable when so much assistance is offered. If you are this person, Degges-White advises you to only offer assistance to those who want it, and look for other ways to connect to those who don’t.

#### Green Personalities Prefer the Status Quo

When it comes to change, Green types are less enthusiastic**** than Red and Yellow personalities. Erikson explains that **Green personalities tend to be content with what they have and are less likely to take risks or seek adventure.** This isn’t to say that they avoid change altogether—rather, they just need time to warm to the idea and they need a compelling reason to do it. For example, a Green-dominant person is unlikely to leave a dull but stable career in search of something more exciting, but she would change careers if it benefited her family.

In relationships, Erikson says **Green types rarely believe that the grass is greener elsewhere.** As a result, they’re more likely to work on a struggling relationship than leave for someone new.

(Shortform note: Erikson describes both Green and Blue personalities as resistant to change. The Enneagram model takes a less simplistic approach, arguing that every personality type evaluates potential change based on their values. For example, Enneagram “sevens” wonder if the change will bring excitement, while “eights” ask if it will affect their independence.)

#### Seek a Green-Dominant Person If...

**If you find yourself in a frenetic state and need a calming influence, or if you want down-to-earth advice, Erikson says to find a Green type.** Green personalities are the friends who remind you that the world isn’t ending when you make a mistake or feel overwhelmed, and they’ll point out all the good you already have in your life.

Erikson lists famous Green personality types, including Mahatma Gandhi, Michelle Obama, and Fred Rogers.

### An Overview of the Blue Personality Type

The final personality type that Erikson discusses is Blue, which Hippocrates refers to as “melancholic.” Like Green types, Blue personalities are introverted—but that’s where the similarities end. Unlike a Green-dominant person, who will go with the flow, **the Blue personality is meticulous, deliberate, and cautious.** Erikson says that Blue types can be seen from the outside as know-it-alls and “negative Nancies.”

#### Blue Personalities Are Meticulous

**Blue-dominant people are extremely organized.** Erikson says they have a place for everything, know where every cent goes, and keep detailed schedules. It would not be unusual for a Blue type to plan meals weeks in advance.

Blue personalities are detail-oriented. Erikson says they live for fine print, and they would never sign a contract without reading every word and making adjustments. While a Red type will want to get started right away, a Yellow personality will go with their gut, and a Green type will agree if everyone else does, Erikson says a Blue-dominant person needs to have control over the situation before starting.

**Blue types value quality over speed,** and they like to make sure that everything is perfect. Erikson says engineers and other detail-oriented professionals are often Blue. They believe that a task is only worth doing if it’s done perfectly and that shoddy work is never an option.

> **The Difference Between Being Meticulous and Having OCD**
> 
> The term “OCD” has become slang for perfectionism, extreme cleanliness, and detail-orientation. However, **obsessive-compulsive disorder isn’t a personality trait—it’s a debilitating disorder characterized by high anxiety (not just discomfort) along with _unwanted_ obsessions and rituals.** Consider two (of the many) distinctions:
> 
> **Obsession:** A person without OCD might discover a new song or show that they enjoy and engage in it obsessively for days or weeks on end. By contrast, “clinical obsession,” which is what those with OCD experience, is when unwelcome and intrusive impulses or ideas plague the person’s every thought.
> 
> **Cleanliness and organization:** People without OCD feel at their best when their environment is spotless, and they may or may not enjoy cleaning. Those with OCD, however, often believe that something catastrophic will happen if their surroundings aren’t their version of “perfect.”

#### Blue Personalities Are Deep Thinkers

**Blue types are knowledgeable but don’t show off what they know.** Rather, Erikson says they’re likely to display their knowledge only when they feel it’s necessary. For instance, they’d speak up to correct a mistake they overhear. Erikson adds that **Blue personalities are so knowledgeable because they research topics in great depth**. For example, while a Red type might make a passing comment about a football game, the Blue-dominant person watched the game, studied old stats, and also read the star player’s biography.

Erikson goes on to say that if a Blue type is speaking about a topic, she probably knows more about it than you do. People with this personality type won’t speak up unless directly asked. For example, picture a classmate who knew every answer but never raised her hand. That person is likely a Blue.

(Shortform note: Quiet people are often misinterpreted as shy, but the two are not the same. To be shy is to feel nervous or intimidated in the presence of others and to fear embarrassment or disapproval. It is a state of being, not a personality trait. On the other hand, some people are quiet not because they are timid, but because they prefer to listen and observe. For them, it’s part of their personality. Keanu Reeves is no stranger to this topic. He has expressed frustration with the constant question of “why” he is so quiet. He explains that this is simply how he functions.)

#### Blue Personalities Are Cautious

**Blue types rarely take risks.** Erikson says if they do take a risk, it means they thought it through and have already calculated the level of danger. If they’re unable to predict the risk, they’re unlikely to take a chance on the activity. Blue personalities prefer to use proven methods over new ones.

(Shortform note: In the Myers-Briggs model, this trait most closely resembles ISTJ and ESTJ. Both of these types avoid unproven strategies and opt instead for the most efficient tried-and-true routes. They are willing to change course, however, if given enough time to research all options.)

#### Seek a Blue-Dominant Person If...

**If you need something done _right_ and aren’t in a hurry, Erikson says you should find a Blue-dominant person. **A coworker or friend with this personality type will also be helpful if you need someone to proofread a piece of writing or give honest feedback. He will be sure to point out where you can improve.

**Erikson lists** famous Blue personality types, including Bill Gates and Albert Einstein.
