## Exercise: Nail Collaborations

Partnerships and group projects can be fantastic or they can be torture. Think about what makes a great working partnership for you.

* * *

Think back to a time when you collaborated with someone on a project, and it was smooth and successful. What went well?

Now remember a time when a partnership didn’t work well. What happened to cause conflict?

Which personality type do you think you are, and which type do you believe you’d work the best with? Why?
