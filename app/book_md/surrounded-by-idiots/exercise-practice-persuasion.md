## Exercise: Practice Persuasion

Depending on the personality type of the person you’re speaking to, your persuasion strategy should change. Practice what you’ve learned with a hypothetical scenario.

* * *

Imagine you’re trying to convince a Red-dominant boss that you deserve a raise. How would you approach her and what would you say?

Now imagine you are approaching a Yellow-dominant boss with the same request. What would you do differently?

How would you alter this approach for a Green-dominant boss?

Finally, how would you ask a Blue-dominant boss for a raise?
