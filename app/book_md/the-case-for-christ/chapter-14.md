## Chapter 14: Is There Circumstantial Evidence for the Resurrection?

Through his discussions with Drs. Craig and Habermas, Strobel has grounded both the empty tomb and Jesus’s subsequent appearance in solid evidence—which is to say, **he’s grounded _the Resurrection_ in evidence**.

But let’s say for the sake of argument that the accounts in the gospels and in Acts and Corinthians aren’t true. Is there _circumstantial evidence_ —that is, evidence ancillary to the various narratives of the Resurrection themselves—that supports the truth of the Resurrection?

To answer this question, Strobel visits J.P. Moreland, a professor at the Talbot School of Theology. A chemist and philosopher by training, Moreland has published widely in scholarly journals on topics in theology and philosophy, and he’s written a number of books, including _Christianity and the Nature of Science, The Life and Death Debate, and Love Your God with All Your Mind._

### Five Pieces of Circumstantial Evidence

What are the facts—either historically or canonically grounded beyond a reasonable doubt—that prove the Resurrection happened as it did?

#### Piece #1: The Disciples’ Martyrdom

The skeptic’s argument that the Resurrection was a hoax entails an extraordinary ramification: **that Jesus’s disciples would risk incredible emotional and physical suffering—even _death_ —for the sake of a fabrication.**

Imagine a magician who makes a priceless piece of art disappear. The magician is then arrested for robbery, tried in court, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Would he endure his sentence for the sake of a silly magic trick? Doubtful. He’d reveal that the artwork’s disappearance was simply an illusion; he’d return the piece and be set free.

If Jesus’s Resurrection was a hoax, the disciples could have acted similarly:**** They could have renounced their beliefs the minute they were persecuted and consequently been spared**. But they didn’t.**

#### Piece #2: The Skeptics’ Conversion

A powerful rejoinder to the notion that the Resurrection was a conspiracy cooked up by Jesus’s followers is the fact that **Jesus’s skeptics saw him, too.**

In the gospels, we learn that Jesus’s family, including his brother James, were embarrassed by him. But through Josephus, the first-century historian, we learn that Jesus’s brother James later became a leader of the Jerusalem church and was executed for his faith. And Paul, who, as Saul of Tarsus, was known even to _execute Christians himself_ , later became one of Jesus’s most devoted disciples and a major contributor to the New Testament.

Their reason for this miraculous 180-degree turn? **Seeing Jesus alive after his death on the cross.** If they hadn’t truly seen him, the remarkable change in their worldview simply doesn’t make sense.

#### Piece #3: The Revolution in Jewish Society

At the time of Jesus’s teaching, Jews, as they had been for centuries, were persecuted for their beliefs. Due to this interminable abuse, they’d developed extremely resilient religious traditions, and they clung to them even as they were enslaved, tortured, dispersed, and murdered. They did so because they believed these traditions were given to them by God and held out the promise of glory in the afterlife. **Suffice it to say, they wouldn’t relinquish these traditions lightly**.

Yet, in the immediate aftermath of Jesus’s crucifixion, **some ten thousand Jews suddenly become followers of Jesus**. They were so convinced of Jesus’s importance, in fact, that they abandoned a number of the most essential institutions of Judaism, including the ritual sacrifice of animals, the observance of the Sabbath on Saturday, and the worship of God the Father only, without consideration of his Son and the Holy Spirit.

It’s hard to overstate how radical these changes would have been to a first-century Jew. A Jewish person renouncing these rituals would have been risking his or her friends, family, and soul. The fact is,**Jewish converts to Christianity would only change their lives so drastically if they had been inspired to do so by something truly extraordinary** : the Resurrection.

#### Piece #4: The Unique Character of Christian Rituals

The sheer fact that early Christianity adopted the practices of communion and baptism isn’t especially noteworthy—any religion has its own rituals that distinguish it from other religions.

What _is_ significant about communion and baptism is their _meaning_. Communion, for example, is a commemoration of Jesus’s grisly death (imagine devotees of Martin Luther King Jr. coming together to celebrate his assassination). Why would Jesus’s early followers devote a happy ritual to his abject suffering and death? **Because they recognized that he’d died for them, and then rose again**.

As for baptism, early Christians modified it from a Jewish form of baptism. In the Christian version, converts were submerged in water to signify Jesus’s death and brought to the surface to signify Jesus’s rise. Like Communion,**this ritual was developed explicitly in response to the Resurrection**.

#### Piece #5: Christianity’s Incredible Growth

It is a historical fact that Christianity spread at an unbelievable rate. After a mere twenty years, the religion had arrived in Rome, and it wasn’t long before it spread more widely (and eventually outlasted) the Roman Empire and its religion entirely. Now, devotees of Paganism are vanishingly rare, **whereas one can find robust communities of Christians almost anywhere on Earth**. How does one explain the incredible growth and resilience of this ancient religion, begun by the destitute followers of a humble carpenter? Secular historians are at pains to explain the phenomenon, but the best answer seems the most obvious one: **that people were compelled to become Christians by the fact of the Resurrection**.

### The Experiential Test

The five categories of evidence described above are highly persuasive, but they need to be supplemented with one final proof:**a personal experience of God**.

For Moreland, this happened when he was a chemistry student in 1968. Skeptical of the story of Jesus, he examined the evidence and eventually became convinced of the truth of the Resurrection. But in order to know for _certain_ that Jesus rose from the dead, he had to receive Christ as his savior and teacher and **open himself to a relationship with him**.

Since becoming a believer, Moreland has had experiences that simply can’t be explained naturally. The circumstantial evidence is more than convincing, **but his personal experience of a divine Christ closes the case**.
