## Chapter 8: Was Jesus Mad?

The evidence that Jesus believed he was the Son of God, the Messiah, cuts two ways: While it establishes that he did indeed believe himself to be divine, it also raises questions about his sanity. **If no other rabbi of the time felt compelled to make similar claims about his divinity, isn’t it possible that Jesus was simply crazy?**

Of course, the person to ask is a psychologist. Strobel visits Gary Collins, a clinical psychologist (Ph.D., Purdue University) who taught at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School for twenty years. He has written well over 100 articles for scholarly journals and has written 45 books on psychological and theological themes, including _Christian Counseling: A Comprehensive Guide_.

### “Listen to Me! I’m Jesus!”

A common symptom of mental illness is delusion, particularly delusions of grandeur. Many paranoid schizophrenics will at times believe they are someone famous or important: a Nobel Prize winner, the President of the United States—even Jesus himself. If misbegotten beliefs like this are so common among the mentally ill, who’s to say Jesus too wasn’t suffering from psychosis?

**What distinguishes Jesus from the mentally ill _is the lack of accompanying symptoms_**. Psychotics often have an inflated sense of their own importance, yes, but they also exhibit _emotional_ distress, like irrational anger, paranoia, or anxiety; difficulty thinking logically; and/or antisocial behavior, like dressing strangely or neglecting personal hygiene. **Jesus exhibits none of these traits**.

In fact, the gospels attest to a well-adjusted and emotionally balanced human being. Jesus befriended people from all walks of life, inspired love in his compatriots, and had deep compassion for his fellow man. He spoke eloquently and had a firm grip on reality, and he responded to people’s hardship with empathy. **In short, there’s nothing in his behavior to indicate he was mentally disturbed**.

### The View of Jesus’s Contemporaries

Of course, our understanding of Jesus is based exclusively on the biblical and historical evidence. It’s a fact that many of Jesus’s contemporaries believed he was crazy. For example, in John 20:20, we read that the Jews of the time believed Jesus was possessed by a demon and “raving mad.”

Although Jesus’s countrymen did indeed question his sanity,**their suspicion was prompted by Jesus’s _uniqueness_ , not any evidence of mental disturbance**. (In other words, they called him “insane” because his teachings were so unfamiliar.) And, unlike a paranoid schizophrenic with delusions of grandeur, Jesus established his divinity through specific acts: for example, healing the sick or bringing the dead back to life.

(Skeptics have charged that Jesus’s “miracles” are likely less impressive than they seem. For example, many conditions in the ancient world were psychosomatic—that is, imagined—and so Jesus’s ability to heal was tantamount to the placebo effect: Because people _believed_ Jesus was a healer, they simply willed themselves better once he administered to them.

**The problem with this argument is that _death_ is not a psychosomatic condition, **yet Jesus was nevertheless able to bring the deceased back to life.)

### Jesus as Hypnotist

Author Ian Wilson has advanced an elaborate argument that Jesus was simply a master hypnotist, able to induce trance- or coma-like states that mimicked death (for example, in Lazarus) and create illusions in the minds of his followers. **Wilson’s central piece of evidence for this theory is the strange fact that Jesus was unable to perform many miracles in his hometown of Nazareth**. Wilson believes this is because the awe surrounding a hypnotist is a major factor in his power to hypnotize, and Jesus’s family and friends wouldn’t find him mysterious enough to fall under his sway.

This theory has a number of shortcomings:

  1. Not everyone is equally susceptible to hypnosis (this is why stage hypnotists will talk in a “hypnotic” voice and scan the crowd to see who’s being lulled by their techniques). **It’s highly unlikely that even the most brilliant hypnotist could enchant the 5,000 people who witnessed Jesus’s multiplying of the bread and fish**.
  2. Hypnosis is often ineffective on those who doubt its legitimacy. **Yet even Jesus’s most recalcitrant doubters—James, Saul of Tarsus, Thomas—eventually saw his deity**.
  3. Both the Pharisees and the Roman Authorities found Jesus’s tomb empty. Although it’s _possible_ he hypnotized his disciples to see an empty tomb, **he could not have hypnotized the Pharisees and the Romans**.
  4. **Jesus didn’t say anything to the wedding guests who tasted wine when they drank water**. A glass of water was simply brought to the banquet master, and he said it was wine without prompting.
  5. **Jesus’s healings were immediate and total**. Whereas Wilson’s comparative example of hypnotic healing took several weeks and was incomplete, Jesus was able to heal ten lepers instantaneously. 
  6. For all the things the gospels do mention, **they never once recount _anything_ resembling hypnotism**. 



### Jesus as Exorcist

Jesus traced illness and strange behavior to possession by evil demons, and he healed people by exorcising those demons. Isn’t the belief in demons a sign of mental disturbation? Is there any _psychological_ evidence for the real existence of demons (or angels)?

Collins replies that, although he hasn’t personally encountered demons in a clinical setting, his colleagues have; and he also notes that many trained psychologists have been exploring the so-called “spiritual” world. In short, greater and greater numbers of psychologists are coming around to the possibility of supernatural influence on our behavior. A belief in supernatural beings having an effect on us, as far as Collins is concerned, **isn’t a sign of psychosis**.
