## Exercise: Review the Record

Test your knowledge of the evidentiary record for Jesus’s existence.

* * *

If someone skeptical of Jesus’s existence asked you for proof, what might you say? (Helpful hint: Review the chapters just above and pick the pieces of evidence most convincing to _you_.)

Why is it important that some of the source material for the gospels dates to within decades of Jesus’s death?

How would you respond to someone who believes Jesus of Nazareth really existed, but that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the product of legend?
