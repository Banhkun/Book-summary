## Part 2: The Analysis | Chapter 7: Did Jesus Really Believe He Was God’s Son?

A crucial facet of the “case for Christ” is understanding what Jesus thought about _himself_. Did he view himself simply as a rabbi or prophet, one who would be aghast at his subsequent deification? Or was he indeed convinced of his own deity? **Did Jesus truly believe he was the Christ?**

To answer these questions, Strobel travels to Kentucky to interview Dr. Ben Witherington III, a professor at the Asbury Theological Seminary. Educated at UNC-Chapel Hill, the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and the University of Durham in England, Witherington has taught at the Divinity School of Duke University and written over fifty books, including _The Many Faces of the Christ_ , _Jesus, Paul, and the Ends of the World_ , and _Women in the Ministry of Jesus_.__

### Jesus’s Shyness

It has long been remarked that the Jesus presented in the gospels is hesitant to refer to himself as the Messiah or Son of God. In 1977, a book coauthored by more than a dozen theologians argued that Jesus _never thought of himself as God or the Messiah_ , and that any references to his deity were added after his death.

However, **there are a number of clues that suggest that Jesus did indeed think of himself as God incarnate**.

  * Like God’s twelve tribes of Israel, Jesus has twelve disciples. These disciples, like the tribes, are intended to be the foundation of a people. Given that Jesus establishes these disciples, as God did the tribes, the implication is that Jesus sees himself as God.
  * Jesus describes John the Baptist as the “greatest _man_ on Earth” (emphasis added). However, Jesus goes on to perform amazing feats that far exceed John’s,**implying that Jesus didn’t think of himself as a mere “man.”**
  * Jesus’s pronouncement that defilement stems not from what enters a person but rather what comes out of his heart contradicts great swaths of Jewish tradition. When the Pharisees object to Jesus’s message, he assures them that God has new plans.**Jesus’s confidence in his authority implies he _believed_ in that authority**. 
  * Jesus was crucified during Passover with a sign over his head that read “King of the Jews.” That sign wouldn’t have been there unless he made the claim himself or someone thought he had.



### Jesus’s Miracles

The fact that Jesus performed miracles isn’t necessarily a token of his deity—his disciples later performed similar feats without claiming deity for themselves. Rather, it’s how he _thought_ about his miracles that sets them apart.

For example, when Jesus would perform a miracle, he would situate it in a very specific context: as a sign of the coming of the Kingdom of God. Rather than view himself as simply a worker of miracles, Jesus saw himself as an emissary of God, through which God’s promises would come to pass. **In short, he saw himself as transcendent**.

### Jesus’s Words

Some have latched onto the fact that Jesus was called “rabbi” by his followers to argue that he simply viewed himself as a religious instructor. **But Jesus’s _way_ of teaching and speaking distinguishes him from the rabbis of his time**.

For example, Jesus refers to God as “abba,” a term of intimacy a son would use with a beloved father. Whereas most Jews of the time tried to avoid saying God’s name at all, for fear of mispronouncing it and disrespecting Him, Jesus, by using “abba” and encouraging his disciples to use it, evidenced a personal familiarity with God.

(Jesus also referred to himself as “Son of Man.” See Chapter 1 for a discussion of this long misinterpreted phrase.)

### Jesus in the Gospels

Those familiar with the gospel of John will recall the poetic and powerful opening lines, wherein the author praises Jesus as the fleshly embodiment of the Word of God (_ergo_ God Himself). But the question is: **Would Jesus recognize himself in those lines?**

The scholarly consensus is “Yes.” Although John’s gospel is more interpretive than the Synoptic Gospels, commentators agree that John’s theological presentation is**the natural extension of the Jesus described in the first three gospels**.

And, even without John’s gospel, **a Messianic Jesus is inescapable**. In Matthew 16:15, when Peter names Jesus as the Christ, _Jesus affirms him_.

### The Historical Case

For all Jesus’s gnomic references to his own deity, **the history of the church immediately subsequent to his death strongly implies Jesus believed he was the Christ**.

For example, the oldest doctrinal and liturgical documents in the Christian church—the oldest sermon, the oldest secular report of the church, the oldest liturgical prayer—refer to Jesus as the “Lord” or “God.” Given that these artifacts were created within decades of Jesus’s death, while many of his original followers were still living, it stands to reason that they were honoring Jesus’s own beliefs about himself.

In sum, there is little doubt Jesus believed that he was the son and agent of God, put on Earth to save the world through his own sacrifice.
