## Exercise: Show Off Your Knowledge of Jesus

Review what you’ve learned about Jesus Christ.

* * *

How would you respond if someone claimed that Jesus never said explicitly that he was the Messiah? (Hint: Review Chapter 7)

Given that Jesus, Jewish himself, was steeped in Jewish scripture, isn’t it possible that he simply adopted the traits of the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament? Why or why not? (Hint: Review Chapter 10.)

If a skeptic told you that Jesus didn’t exhibit the traits of God, how might you respond? (Hint: Review Chapter 9.)

How has the analysis of Jesus, as both a man and a deity, changed your relationship to him (if at all)?
