## Chapter 5: Does the Archaeological Evidence Support the Accounts in the Gospels?

With the documentary evidence for the historical Jesus well established, Strobel moves on to investigate the _scientific_ evidence for Jesus’s existence. To do so, he visits John McRay, a professor of the New Testament and archaeology at Wheaton College in Illinois. McRay is the author of a 432-page textbook entitled _Archaeology and the New Testament_ , and he supervised several archaeological digs in Israel over an eight-year period.

### What Archaeology _Can’t_ Tell Us

Strobel’s object in interviewing McRay is to determine whether the accounts in the gospels are true and accurate. Archaeology can tell us about the history and geography of the ancient world, **but it can’t tell us whether the New Testament is the Word of God or whether we ought to commit our lives to Jesus**. These are spiritual truths whose value cannot be underwritten by scientific discovery.

But if the gospel writers’ references to particular places and landmarks prove consistent and accurate, it lends credibility to the _other_ parts of their accounts.

### Luke as __ Historian

Luke’s contributions to the New Testament, his gospel and the book of Acts, comprise almost one quarter of the entire text of the Bible. If we can be sure that Luke is a conscientious and trustworthy historian, we can be confident in his depiction of Jesus as well.

**The consensus among contemporary scholars is that Luke is indeed a careful, reliable recorder of history**.

In fact, over the years, scholars have asserted that Luke was mistaken about certain historical facts only to be proven wrong by archaeological findings. For example, many scholars saw Luke’s reference to Lysanias as the tetrarch (governor) of Abilene in 27 AD as a disqualifying error—Lysanias ruled Chalcis 50 years before; he was no tetrarch. An inscription found on a dig, however, later proved Luke right. **One study from the early ’90s reviewed each of Luke’s references to physical places and found not a single mistake**. It stands to reason that if Luke was assiduous enough to get the ancillary details correct, it’s likely he got **the really big stuff—like Jesus’s resurrection—right as well**.

### On John and Mark

John’s gospel, the last to have been written, has been doubted due to geographical inaccuracy as well—**until it too was vindicated by relatively recent archeological discoveries**.

For example, John describes Jesus healing an invalid at the Pool of Bethesda, which, in John’s telling, has five porticoes. Because no such pool had been found, many scholars doubted this part of John’s gospel (and, in turn, his gospel as a whole). **But then, lo and behold, the pool was excavated from 40 feet below ground—and it matched John’s description precisely**.

Mark, according to his gospel’s critics, was conspicuously ignorant of ancient Palestine’s geography. His mistakes are particularly troubling given that his gospel is widely accepted to be the first to have been written.

But are they really mistakes? Critics have fixated on Mark 7:31, wherein Jesus travels from Tyre through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee. Scholars of the geography of the time have pointed out that if Jesus were traveling from Tyre in the direction of Sidon, he would be moving _away_ from the Sea of Galilee.**But these scholars fail to take into account the mountainous terrain and winding roads of the region**. Based on the actual topography of the land,**the route Mark describes is perfectly logical**.

### Three Challenges

In McRay’s long career in archaeology, he has yet to come upon a finding that undermines the Bible—**in fact, everything he’s discovered or studied has confirmed the Bible’s veracity**. But Strobel is still hesitant. He puts three challenging riddles to McRay.

#### Riddle 1: The Judean Census

According to the narratives of Jesus’s birth, a census forced the citizens of Judea, including Joseph and Mary, to return to Joseph’s birthplace of Bethlehem, where Jesus was eventually born. Critics typically focus on two aspects of this story:

  1. Whether any such census did take or could have taken place; and
  2. Whether its alleged issuer, a Roman ruler of Syria named Quirinius, was in fact ruler at the time of the census.



In terms of #1, censuses like this—where inhabitants were required to return to the places of their birth—**did in fact occur in the ancient world**. An Egyptian prefect named Gaius Vibius Maximus, for example, ordered a similar census in the second century AD.

In terms of #2, the debate concerns the historical timeline: According to the Bible, Quirinius ruled Syria during the time of King Herod, but most secular sources show Quirinius ruling Syria in 6 AD, ten years after Herod’s death. **However, recent archaeological findings suggest there were _two_ Quiriniuses—one who ruled during the reign of Herod and one who reigned after**. (Other archaeologists have proposed an alternative theory: that there was only one Quirinius, but he ruled at two different times.)

#### Riddle 2: The (Non)existence of Nazareth

Unbeknownst to most Christians, there is spirited scholarly debate about whether Nazareth existed when Jesus was a child; there is no mention of the town in the Old Testament, the Talmud, the histories of Josephus—even Paul’s epistles! (Skeptics of Christianity argue the town was created and named later.)

Nazareth was likely overlooked by these writers because of its tininess—according to one scholar, its population was probably a maximum of 480. **And there is in fact archaeological evidence the village existed in the first century** : ancient documents, as well as tombs discovered in the area, indicate the village existed at least as early 70 AD and likely far earlier.

#### Riddle 3: The Massacre of the Innocents

In Matthew 2:16, Herod the Great, fearing that a recently born baby will grow to usurp his throne, orders his soldiers to Bethlehem to slaughter all male children under two. Joseph and Mary, of course, having been warned by an angel, escape with Jesus to Egypt.

It has long been noted among atheists and skeptics that there is no evidence for this event beyond Matthew’s account. Certainly a crime of this magnitude would have been noticed by contemporary observers?

**The answer is, Not necessarily.** First, in a town the size of Bethlehem (500–600 people), the actual number of babies singled out by Herod’s soldiers was likely small. Second, though it’s hard for us to imagine, **violence like this was not uncommon in the ancient world**. Herod was known as a particularly brutal king, and his executing a small number of babies in a humble village would likely not have risen to the level of breaking news. Thus the fact that Matthew is the only one to mention the event isn’t surprising—and certainly doesn’t undercut its factuality.

### The Dead Sea Scrolls

Arguably the most famous of twentieth-century archaeological discoveries, the Dead Sea Scrolls, found near Jerusalem in 1947, feature papyrus documents dating from 250 BC to 68 AD. **Skeptics of Christianity often note that none of these documents mention Jesus**.

While it’s true that the scrolls—which, in reality, mostly concern Jewish religious customs—don’t mention Jesus explicitly, **they nevertheless provide essential context that corroborates accounts in the gospels**. For example, in Matthew 11:3, John the Baptist’s emissaries visit Jesus to ask him if he’s in fact the messiah. He gives them an enigmatic answer that references Isaiah 35 from the Old Testament, but he adds the words “the dead are raised,” which don’t appear in the canonical Torah.

Incredibly, **a manuscript among the Dead Sea Scrolls includes a different version of Isaiah 61 with the phrase “the dead are raised.”** Jesus, John, and his followers would have been familiar with this earlier version of Isaiah, and thus Jesus’s answer isn’t enigmatic at all: **John and his followers would have known immediately that Jesus was proclaiming himself the Messiah** , the “one who was to come.”****

### For Comparison: Mormonism

Whereas archaeological research has repeatedly grounded the New Testament in fact,**it has shown Joseph Smith’s _The Book of Mormon_ , the central text of Mormonism, to be utterly baseless**.

According to authorities at the Smithsonian Institute, not a single piece of archaeological evidence of any of the cities, places, people, or events related in _The Book of Mormon_ has ever been found. Its account of early America is sheer myth**, whereas the New Testament is routinely corroborated by archaeological discoveries**.
