## Introduction

For much of his life, Lee Strobel, a Yale Law School graduate and legal affairs reporter for the _Chicago Tribune_ , was an atheist. For him, belief in God required too many leaps of faith: Why was there evil in the world if people were created by a loving God? Wasn’t the evidence of evolution far more compelling than that of a divine creator? **Weren’t miracles that flouted the laws of nature literally _incredible_?**

Strobel’s attitude toward Christ began to change in 1979, when his wife, a longtime agnostic, declared that she had become a Christian. Strobel worried that she would become puritanical and self-righteous, but when she began exhibiting greater poise and self-confidence, he became intrigued by the doctrine of beliefs that was improving her character.

He decided to treat Christ and Christianity like a story he was reporting on. He dived into the research scholarship on the Bible as well as the text of the Bible itself. He interviewed experts and studied the archaeological record. And as his knowledge grew, **he found himself drawn to a conclusion he’d previously thought absurd: that Jesus had not only existed, but was also divine**.

**_The Case for Christ_ is a reconstruction of Strobel’s spiritual journey from skeptic to believer**. Each chapter of the book is built around a particular question concerning Jesus: whether the eyewitness accounts of his existence can be trusted, whether Jesus truly believed he was the son of God, whether Jesus was in fact resurrected. To answer each of these questions, Strobel interviews an academic expert and analyzes the relevant historical and biblical texts. He lays out “the case for Christ” as a lawyer might—with ample eyewitness, documentary, and corroborating evidence—and asks us, his jury,**to approach his argument objectively and with an open mind**.
