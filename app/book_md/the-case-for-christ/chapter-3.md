## Chapter 3: Is There Ample Documentary Evidence for Jesus’s Biographies?

The text of the gospels that we know today is the product of generations of copying: from the original manuscripts of the gospel writers, lost long ago, to modern-day laser printers. Given that early copies were made painstakingly by hand, how can we be sure that the present-day text of the gospels is exactly the same as the gospel writers’ manuscripts? **And isn’t it possible that, in the early days of the Church, further biographies of Jesus were suppressed or discarded in favor in the four we know today?**

These two questions lead Strobel to Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey, where he meets with Bruce Metzger, an 84-year-old professor emeritus whose specialty is the New Testament.

### Generation Loss

With the advent of digital reproduction processes, we no longer have to worry about quality or fidelity loss as we copy materials, whether music files, digital images, or word-processing documents. Even modern-day Xerox machines produce near-pristine copies of originals.

When we’re dealing with ancient manuscripts, however, which had to be copied by hand onto fragile materials and transported on foot,**the risk of corruption or loss is great**.

Nevertheless, there are**three interlinked reasons** for us to trust that the gospels we have today are faithful to the originals:

  1. **The oldest surviving copies of the gospels were made comparatively soon after the originals were written**. Whereas the surviving copies of many ancient texts were made hundreds of years after the original—for example, Tacitus’s _Annals of Imperial Rome_ was written in the second century AD, but our oldest copy dates to 850 AD—there are fragments of the New Testament preserved on papyrus dating to the second century AD. (The earliest copy of the New Testament that survives is a small fragment of the gospel of John dating to between 100 and 150 AD.)
  2. **There is a wealth of early New Testament material**. When it comes to ancient texts, the lineage is typically sparse. Take the first-century historian, Josephus: In Greek, his native language, the only copies that exist date to the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries; the earliest version is a fourth-century Latin translation. **The New Testament, on the other hand, boasts more than five thousand Greek manuscripts**.
  3. **There is consistency among fragments in translation and from diverse geographical areas**. In addition to the thousands of Greek fragments, early versions of the New Testament survive in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Gothic, and other ancient languages. And in great numbers: For example, there are between 8,000 and 10,000 Latin Vulgate manuscripts. 



According to another esteemed scholar of the New Testament, F.F. Bruce, **the New Testament is unparalleled in terms of the textual evidence for its accuracy**.

### Discrepancies Among the Surviving Copies

There are certainly differences among the many ancient copies of the gospels (the highest estimates place the number of differences among the copies at 200,000). **But these differences are by and large insignificant**. For example, a great many differences occur because two Greek words are transposed (think “goes he” instead of “he goes”). But because Greek is an “inflected” language—that is, each word’s form indicates its part of speech—these kinds of “errors” have no effect on the text’s meaning.

And even more material variations—for example, the fact that the earliest manuscripts of 1 John feature no mention of the Trinity—don’t undermine the key doctrines of the Church. In the case of the Trinity, although the earliest versions of 1 John don’t mention it, other books (2 Corinthians, for instance) do.

### The Question of the Canon

The documentary provenance of the books included in the New Testament is considerable. But—as skeptics and more liberal Christian scholars are wont to point out—**those aren’t the only gospels to have been discovered**. In fact, some gospels—for example, those of Philip, of the Egyptians, and of Nativity of Mary—were suppressed by early Church leaders. Which raises the question: **How can we be sure the canonical gospels comprise the truest accounts of Jesus?**

In the early church, there were three criteria for canonization:

  * The gospel had to have been written by either an apostle himself or a close follower of an apostle.
  * The gospel had to conform to normative Christian tradition as the church saw it.
  * The gospel had to have been widely accepted and used.



Despite some disagreement among various fringe factions in the early church, **the four gospels as found in the Bible today satisfy these three criteria**. The noncanonized gospels, like those of Peter or Mary, had authors different from the names attached to them and were usually written later than the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

> **The Gospel of Thomas**
> 
> Discovered among the Nag Hammadi documents unearthed in Egypt in 1945, the Gospel of Thomas has found many adherents among liberal scholars of the New Testament. For example, the members of the Jesus Seminar—a scholarly collective active in the 80s and 90s—believed the Gospel of Thomas should be canonized.
> 
> One problem with the Gospel of Thomas, which comprises an array of Jesus’s sayings without any narrative,**is that many of Jesus’s pronouncements run contrary to those that appear in the canonical gospels**. For example, in the Gospel of Thomas, there are utterances that paint Jesus as a pantheist and misogynist—quite opposite to his teachings in the four canonical gospels.
> 
> These uncharacteristic pronouncements are why the early church didn’t accept the Gospel of Thomas as legitimate. Some believe that there was a conspiracy among the fifth-century councils to suppress the Gospel of Thomas, but the truth is simpler: **The early followers of Jesus _knew—_ in the same way they knew Jesus was God—that the Gospel of Thomas wasn’t an accurate portrayal of Jesus**. They _sensed_ its inauthenticity.

Considering the Bible as a whole,**there has been little scholarly dissension surrounding twenty (Matthew through Philemon, plus 1 Peter and 1 John) of the 27 books**. As for the remaining seven, though they were treated with some skepticism by the early church, they have now gained full acceptance.

The “pseudepigraphia”—a term for the array of documents that appeared in the centuries after Jesus’s death—on the other hand, are widely disputed. Strobel finds them ludicrous and inconsistent with Jesus’s teachings, and their origins in the fifth and sixth centuries are too distant from Jesus’s life to be credible testaments to Jesus’s historical existence.
