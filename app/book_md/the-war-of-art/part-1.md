## Part 1: Resistance—The Formidable Foe | Chapter 1: What Is Resistance?

Resistance is hard to overcome because it is sneaky, clever, and unflappable. But you can alleviate the power of resistance by understanding what it is, which behaviors it attacks, and how it does so.

### The Characteristics of Resistance

The following principles regarding resistance will help you understand what it is and where it comes from. When you understand these principles, you can learn to push past resistance.

**Principle 1: Resistance has no form.**

  * None of your senses will detect resistance. It is not tangible. **Resistance is a deflecting force. Its sole purpose is to repel you from fulfilling your potential.**



**Principle 2: Resistance is not an external force.**

  * You may think outside sources are the obstacles to success, but this is not true. Resistance is an enemy existing inside you. You create it and perpetuate it, regardless of external struggles. 



**Principle 3: Resistance is cunning.**

  * Resistance is the most formidable opponent you will encounter. It manipulates, lies, and deceives you anyway it can. It will present argument after argument for why you should not follow your instincts or dreams. It is a conman with one goal—to stop you from succeeding.



**Principle 4: Resistance is unyielding.**

  * When you live with resistance, you live in a totalitarian world. Resistance is a tyrannical dictator that cannot be persuaded and shows no mercy. It will never stop doing what it can to thwart your endeavors because it doesn’t know how to stop. You can only aim to overcome it on a day-to-day basis. 



**Principle 5: Resistance doesn’t discriminate.**

  * Who you are and what you have been through is superfluous to resistance. Its attack against you is not personal or motivated by malice. Resistance is like a tornado—a powerful force that destroys whatever is in its path. 



**Principle 6: Resistance is a compass.**

  * Think of a compass needle that is magnetized to always point North. Resistance is that compass needle. **It will always point in the direction of your most significant calling.** You can use this unwavering accuracy to your advantage. Whatever you feel resistance toward is exactly what you should go after. The appearance of resistance tells you the goal is important to your true spiritual fulfillment.



**Principle 7: Everyone experiences resistance.**

  * You are not alone in your struggle with resistance. Anyone with a soul experiences resistance. 



**Principle 8: A war with resistance is a battle to the death.**

  * Resistance doesn’t play nicely. Its aim is not to merely distract you or throw a wrench in your plans. Resistance is out for blood. It wants to destroy your genius and ensure you never succeed. Knowing this will help prepare you for the fight. 



**Principle 9: You give resistance its power.**

  * Resistance is not a foreign body implanted inside you. You give birth to resistance through fear. When you feel a pull toward your true calling, you feel fear. Resistance uses that fear as sustenance, and **the more you give in to your fears, the more powerful resistance becomes**. (We’ll cover fear in detail in Chapter 5.)



**Principle 10: You only feel resistance on the rise.**

  * You will only feel resistance when you attempt to seek a higher version of yourself (your _true self_), whether through enterprise, spirituality, or creative expression. If you pursue goals that don’t feed your spirit, you will feel no resistance because there is nothing personal to gain or lose. There is no fear. 



**Principle 11: The last hurdle is the hardest to cross.**

  * When you reach the point in which your dreams become a reality, resistance doubles down on its attack. Resistance is the most powerful when you are about to defeat it. Be ready for this final surge of power, and double your resolve against it.



**Principle 12: Resistance uses reinforcements.**

  * Although resistance is self-made, your efforts to defeat it may cause trouble in your external life. The people around you will notice a change in you. That change will appear as achievement or fortitude as you pursue your true calling. If others are losing their own battles with resistance, they may resent your success in defeating yours and become allies with resistance. Their efforts to make you feel bad or guilty about succeeding can weaken your drive, thereby strengthening your resistance.



### Targets of Resistance

**Resistance is only activated by pursuits that gratify your higher calling and lead to long-term growth and good health.** Some examples of these types of pursuits are the following:

  * Any creative art: writing, dance, film, music, visual art, and performance art 
  * Entrepreneurial endeavors, such as a new business venture, an invention, or a non-profit organization
  * Health pursuits, like diets or workout regimens
  * Spiritual or religious awakenings
  * Activities aimed to break habits or overcome addiction
  * Educational pursuits
  * Social and political action, especially those motivated by moral or ethical values
  * Philanthropic endeavors
  * Personal and emotional growth, including commitments to relationships
  * Behaviors that oppose adversity, especially those requiring courage



An example of how resistance differentiates between higher and lower callings is the life of Adolf Hitler. Hitler wanted to be a painter and architect. He applied to art school, but the resistance standing between him and his goal was too great. He struggled with criticism and was scared to put his dreams on the line. In the end, it was easier for Hitler to start a world war and oppress an entire population than go through the pains of committing to his art.

### The Signs of Resistance

You now know what resistance is and what behaviors it targets, but how do you know when resistance is affecting your life? The following symptoms are all signs that resistance is winning the war for your soul. When you recognize one or more of these symptoms, take action. You must treat resistance the same way you would treat an illness.

**Symptom 1: Inaction**

  * The most common form resistance takes is procrastination. You want to achieve your dreams, but you put off starting. For example, you want to write a book, and you intend to write it. But instead of starting to write your book, you put it off until tomorrow. You rationalize this decision as a lack of energy or time. Really, it’s resistance manipulating your motivation. 



**Symptom 2: Inaction as a way of life**

  * Procrastinating one day is normal. **Procrastinating day after day is a habit. That habit can become a personal character flaw if you let it.** You have the power every day to stop resistance in its tracks. All you have to do is take the first step toward achieving your goal. If you put that first step off again and again, you have made procrastination a lifestyle and resistance your best friend.



**Symptom 3: An unnatural fixation with instant gratification**

  * Sex, drugs, alcohol, television, eating, and shopping all provide immediate gratification. Resistance uses these things to distract you. Of course, these behaviors are not always the work of resistance. The trick is to pay attention to the value of the pleasure. If your pleasure-seeking behavior was truly to experience pleasure, your gratification will be pure. If your behavior was the work of resistance, you will likely feel empty or guilty afterward. **The more flimsy the gratification, the more likely it is that resistance manipulated your behavior.**



**Symptom 4: A gravitation toward trouble**

  * When you make trouble for yourself or engage in activities that are high-risk, you willingly create an environment that detracts from positive work. Trouble draws your attention away from the scary act of pursuing your true nature. Resistance takes the shape of jealousy, emotional or physical infidelity, tardiness, or illicit substance abuse. Hypochondria or a complacence with poor health are also forms of resistance. When you seek trouble, you seek an escape from the work required to reach your full potential. 



**Symptom 5: Dramatic behavior**

  * Have you ever known someone who acts like a drama queen? How productive is that person? Likely not very. When you create drama in your life, you open the door to distraction. **Resistance loves drama because it gives significance to everything besides the important work you need to be doing.** A happy life is a productive life. A life of drama is a life of overinflated emotional investment. There is no room left for your spirit to shine when all you experience is drama. 



**Symptom 6: Self-soothing behaviors**

  * The world is full of guidance on how to reduce anxiety and depression. To be clear, this is not an attack on mental illness. Mental health disorders are real, and medications can help. But many people experience smaller and infrequent versions of these afflictions and choose to self-soothe instead of self-improve. For instance, drug use, whether with prescription, over-the-counter, or illegal drugs, helps assuage feelings of despair and anxiety. Instead of working to reach a stable place of satisfaction and positivity, you allow resistance to lead you to the quick fix. 



**Symptom 7: Playing the role of victim**

  * The willingness to be a victim is a form of resistance. When you jump from illness to illness, blame your inaction on others, or always feel injured by the actions of others, you are playing the victim and your behavior is passive. No work is achieved through passive behavior. 



**Symptom 8: Supporting another’s dream**

  * You will always experience a lack of resistance when you put energy into the dreams of a loved one. You have no higher connection with another’s fulfillment of their calling, so there is no risk. For instance, if your spouse fails at his dream, your lifestyle or relationship may change, but your personal spirit is uninvolved. You may even choose a spouse who is winning the war over resistance because it makes your calling seem insignificant in comparison. **Supporting another’s dream is resistance giving you the perfect excuse to not put energy toward your own dreams.**



### The Consequences of Resistance

Perhaps you believe never achieving your true calling is not a big deal. You’ve found a way to be content with life, so why rock the boat? You may think you’re content, but what you don’t realize is that **allowing resistance to have power in your life eventually leads you down a path to profound unhappiness**. The author’s experience writing this book serves as a useful example of the damage resistance can cause.

#### The Author’s Journey

When Steven Pressfield decided to write this book, the voice in his head criticized the decision. He was a fiction writer, not a nonfiction writer. He would fail at his attempt to expose resistance and the related principles. The voice also said he wasn’t a true authority on resistance, and claiming to be would ruin his career. The voice told him he would come off as vain, untrustworthy, and conceited.

Pressfield was scared and nervous. The voice presented some good arguments, for which he had no comebacks. He started to develop symptoms of resistance and became unhappy. The only thing that made him feel better was thinking about writing this book. He decided to push through the resistance and start to write. Once he did, the fear dropped away, the voice faded, and he was able to finish.

#### When Resistance Wins

When you don’t live up to your true potential, you feel an undertone of discontent in life. You become unhappy. You get bored or anxious. You experience a deep sensation of guilt, but you don’t understand why. You crawl under the covers because you don’t know what else to do. Or you seek activities that will help you continue to live with resistance, like drugs, sex, or entertainment. **You start to feel ashamed and hate your life because somewhere inside you know you should be doing more.**

Over time, these feelings grow and invite trouble into your life. Left unchecked, resistance can lead to mental disturbances, such as a quick temper, depression, or reduced functionality. You may harm yourself or others.

This is what feeling trapped under the power of resistance is like. You must revolt against these feelings and symptoms. You must cut the ties with get-help-quick schemes. You must realize that the external world cannot help you fight resistance. Only by taking the steps to fulfill your calling will you be able to beat resistance and become happy with yourself and life.

(Shortform note: The author includes a section on resistance and fundamentalism, whether religious or political. He draws a parallel between the search for the meaning of life for both the artist and fundamentalist. However, this section provides little information regarding your relationship with resistance, so we haven’t included it in the summary. If you are interested in learning more about how resistance relates to fundamentalism, we encourage you to read the original text.)
