## Exercise: How Committed Are You?

You likely have an unrealized dream you donâ€™t know how to achieve. Now that you have an understanding of what is required of you, how does this change your approach to fulfilling that dream?

* * *

What is one calling you feel and wish you could pursue? What is stopping you from fulfilling that dream?

What would committing to your dream like a professional look like? (For example, would it mean showing up every day regardless of whether or not you feel like it or putting your work into the world for judgment?)

Name two things you can change today to start working like a professional toward your dream.

In what ways do you feel miserable when you do try to pursue your dream?

How can you learn to love this misery?
