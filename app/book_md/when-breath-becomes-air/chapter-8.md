## Chapter 8: My Final Act

Time has lost its meaning and luster for me. Each moment moves me farther away from the last relapse. But that same moment is another step toward another one or the final one. Death may still be far off, but I am certain it is not as far off as I would like. With this knowledge, it would be easy to try to cram as much “living” as I can into the time I have left. But cancer is a fickle companion. It doesn’t necessarily take away your time as fast as you think it will, but it makes your body too weak to enjoy it the way you’d like.

There is little to differentiate the days now. If time was arbitrary when I was operating, now it was meaningless. The time of day holds no weight, nor does the knowledge of whether it is Tuesday or Friday. I am static. I am simply existing.

I also don’t know how to think of myself, what tense to use. _Was_ I or _am_ I a doctor? Or perhaps I should think I was previously a neurosurgeon and might be one in the future? Graham Greene stated that you live for 20 years and reflect for the rest. Is this life, then, a reflection of the past already?

Most people either fulfill their hopes or leave them behind. Both states are past; thus, the future becomes the present. My present is all the future I have, but that is not the case for my daughter. I hope to be around for enough time that she will remember me. There are so many things I want to share with her, but writing them down feels presumptuous. I have no inkling of who she will be and what will be important to her.

In this place, where our lives intersect for a brief moment of time, I can only think of one appropriate message to leave her with: when life dictates you gather the evidence of your worth, as it will at various times, remember that by living, you helped me live. It is of no small consequence that you brought a peaceful calm to my dying days, one like I had never known. The joy you gave me is enough, and never doubt that it was everything.
