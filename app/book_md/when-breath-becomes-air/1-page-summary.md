## 1-Page Summary

_When Breath Becomes Air_ recounts the life of Dr. Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon diagnosed with lung cancer during his last year of residency. With elegant and beautiful prose befitting a novelist more than a doctor, Paul guides readers through his life before and after his diagnosis, a life marked by a search for understanding life, death, and meaning.

As a young man, Paul never considered becoming a doctor, a profession many in his family had chosen. Thanks to his mother’s determination to see her three sons surpass the boundaries that a rural education in Kingman, Arizona could provide, she instilled in them a love of books. Paul quickly became enraptured by literature and decided to follow that love through his undergraduate and graduate studies at Stanford University.

Along the way, Paul also became fascinated with the brain. He wanted to understand how this organism was involved in creating meaning in life. Therefore, coinciding with his literature studies, he also studied biology. These two passions would guide the rest of his life. Through literature, he wanted to find language that gave depth to human experiences. Through science, he wanted to find the boundary separating life from death and what constituted each. When words became insufficient, he decided to enroll in medical school to become a neurosurgeon.

Throughout the book, Paul takes us on his journey through medical school and into his practical training as a neurosurgical resident. He walks us through his work with patients, learning, sometimes the hard way, that there was more to being a doctor than merely diagnosing and treating. He became a beacon for his patients, providing a safe harbor for them to traverse the transition from the life they had to whatever lay on the other side after a traumatic brain injury or disease.

Paul’s work allowed him to face death on a daily basis. He didn’t view death as an enemy to be thwarted. Rather, he saw it as one side of the coin of life and often as the most humane decision for those whose lives would never be the same because of their diagnosis. In approaching death in this way, he was able to face his diagnosis of lung cancer with integrity.

When he was diagnosed, Paul learned the difference between facing death as a doctor and as a patient. Although he’d assisted patients and their families in learning how to move forward and forge a new life or accept the end of life, he wasn’t clear at first what his new life would be. His identity, a concept he cherished and used to guide his treatment of patients, was wrapped up in the future he’d planned with his wife, Lucy.

As that future slowly disintegrated, he had to determine who he could and should be with the time he had left. Should he dive into the personal and spend the time with family, friends, and his new child? Should he move into a teaching role? Or should he be a neurosurgeon again? In the end, his calling as a neurosurgeon won out, and he continued that work until his cancer relapsed and ended his career for good.

Paul’s memoir is about his personal journey of discovery as much as it is a dissertation on what it means to live and die. He believed that human relationships and experiences gave life purpose and depth, and he strove to celebrate both in his life and the life of his patients. The legacy Paul left behind exemplifies the strength and wisdom possible in accepting the inevitability of death and living despite it.
