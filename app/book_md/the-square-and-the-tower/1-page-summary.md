## 1-Page Summary

In _The Square and the Tower_ , best-selling author and Stanford University historian Niall Ferguson applies network theory—the study of how people and other entities connect with each other—to the study of world history. He notes that historians typically focus on the history of governments and other institutions that are organized as formal hierarchies, but that other types of networks affect society as well. He sets out to show how such alternate networks have affected the world.

The title of the book is a metaphor for the interplay between formal hierarchies and other types of networks: The tower represents governmental authority and formal hierarchies, while the town square represents social and commercial networks outside the governmental hierarchy.

Ferguson spends most of the book describing social, commercial, and other networks that existed at various times in history, as well as looking at the evolution of governments. In the final section of the book, he turns his attention to the future, discussing how the growth of global networks of e-commerce and social media may affect the balance of power in the world.

In this guide, we’ll explain the basics of network theory before diving into the key principles in Ferguson’s discussion of history. We’ll conclude by considering his perspective on the future, which is based on these principles.

As we discuss Ferguson’s principles, we’ll compare them to those presented in Keith Ferrazzi’s _Never Eat Alone_ , the Arbinger Institute’s _Anatomy of Peace_ , Yuval Noah Harari’s _21 Lessons for the 21st Century, _and others, providing supplemental information and contrasting perspectives _._ Then, as we consider Ferguson’s view of the future, we’ll look at some of the developments since the book’s publication, such as the EU’s passage of the Digital Services Act.

### Network Theory

Network theory is the study of how people or other entities connect and interact with each other to form networks. It examines how different kinds of networks operate and how they affect the world around them.

As Ferguson explains, networks can take many forms, because **different types of entities can connect in many different ways**. You can have a network of computers connected via digital communication protocols. You can have a network of businesses connected by supply chains and cash flows. And you can have a network of people connected by shared interests, family ties, or other bonds of loyalty.

Ferguson observes that humans seem to have an innate proclivity for connecting with each other and forming networks. This has led to the creation of governments, social clubs, and all the other interpersonal networks that collectively make up human society.

> **Networking in Real Life**
> 
> Although networks can take non-human forms, such as supply chains or computer systems, all such networks are ultimately controlled by _people_. Business entities can form networks of supply and distribution, but the businesses are still run by people. Computers can exchange information on a digital network, but only in ways that humans tell them to. This is why, as Keith Ferrazzi explains in _Never Eat Alone_ , if you want to make networks work for you, you need to know how to connect with _people._
> 
> The problem is that while humans may have an instinct to form networks of social bonds, as Ferguson observes, we’re not all equally good at it. To improve your networking skills, Ferrazzi says there are four key beliefs you need to adopt. First, connections are for _mutual_ benefit. Second, goodwill is infinite—in fact, the more you ask someone for help or expertise, the more you’ll _strengthen_ your relationship with them, not wear it out. Third, people like to help people that they already know—so don’t wait until you need their help to establish a connection. And fourth, it’s OK to connect with strangers—in fact, it’s imperative that you intentionally network with people outside your circle of existing contacts.

#### Classifying Networks

Ferguson discusses how networks can be categorized based on their structure. In most networks, some entities are more important or powerful than others. If you know the structure of a network, that is, which entities are connected to each other, you can infer the importance of any given entity in the network based on its “centrality.”

Centrality has three components:

  * **Degree:** The number of other entities that a given entity is directly connected to. For example, if Airport A is directly connected to 15 other airports, it has a higher degree of centrality than Airport B, which is directly connected to only four other airports. 
  * **Closeness:** The average number of steps you must take to get from the entity in question to each of the other entities on the network. If a traveler from Airport A can reach all other airports in an average of three connecting trips, but a traveler from Airport B must make five connections on average to reach the other airports, Airport A has more closeness.
  * **Betweenness:** The amount of information that passes through a particular entity as it flows through the network. If more travelers connect to other destinations through Airport C than through Airport D (because, say, it serves as an international port of entry), then Airport C has more betweenness. 



> **How to Determine Importance**
> 
> Ferguson doesn’t give a formula for calculating the overall “centrality” or importance of an entity based on its degree, closeness, and betweenness. However, we can infer that you just compare the three measures separately and then use the one that varies the most in the network as your overall measure, because it produces the clearest ranking of importance.
> 
> Which measure varies the most depends on the structure of the network. In his historical analysis, Ferguson most often seems to use betweenness as his primary measure of importance. This makes sense because, especially before the advent of electronic communications, most people could only maintain a certain number of connections, so degree and closeness didn’t vary much from one person to the next. But betweenness measured how many people _indirectly_ reported to them or communicated through them, which provided a good measure of their importance.
> 
> In certain cases, such as social media networks, though, Ferguson uses degree instead of betweenness as the primary measure of importance. In the case of a Twitter or YouTube account, a person’s degree of centrality would be her subscriber count, which is an intuitive measure of importance and varies over a much wider range than the number of in-person connections that people maintain.

##### Hierarchies as Networks

According to Ferguson, a hierarchy is a specific kind of network in which one entity exercises authority over others, who in turn exercise authority over others, and so on, without any other connections of authority or loyalty. This means that the first entity automatically has the most betweenness, because all information flows up from every lower entity, passes through the person at the top, and only then is distributed elsewhere. The importance of individual entities diminishes as you go down the tiers of the hierarchy, because each entity is connected only to its own subordinates and its lone superior.

(Shortform note: In principle, a hierarchy doesn’t have to be about interpersonal power. Ferguson focuses mostly on _government_ hierarchies and similar power structures, where most of the connections between individuals involve bonds of loyalty or authority. But computer scientists have found that hierarchical networks are a very efficient way to connect computers and peripheral devices. A hierarchical network of computers illustrates how the same network structure can distribute data rather than authority.)

### Three Principles of Hierarchies

As he applies network theory to his analysis of world history, Ferguson makes three key observations: Hierarchies are necessary to maintain social order, additional networks tend to undermine hierarchies, and hierarchies can only deal with a limited amount of complexity.

#### Hierarchies Maintain Order

Ferguson observes that many important networks, such as governments and corporations, are at least approximately hierarchical in their structure. He suggests that these networks tend to take the form of hierarchies because hierarchies are particularly efficient when it comes to coordinating activities and resolving disputes. He explains that hierarchies facilitate dispute resolution because any two entities that disagree can appeal to their shared superior. But if they don’t have anyone that they both regard as superior, then their differences continue to fester—sometimes until they go to war and the victor emerges as the superior in a new hierarchy.

For this reason, Ferguson goes so far as to say that **peace and social order is only possible when there is a clear hierarchy that everyone accepts as legitimate**. In most cases, a government is the hierarchy that maintains order. But sometimes, alternative entities establish the hierarchy. For example, international treaties often have the effect of creating a hierarchy of national powers: The treaty itself acts as a moderator between nations by establishing agreements and relationships between them, as well as provisions for enforcement, yet without creating an international government, per se.

> **What Does It Take to Keep the Peace?**
> 
> Some people disagree with Ferguson’s assertion that hierarchies are the only way to keep the peace. For example, in _The Anatomy of Peace_ , the Arbinger Institute argues that conflict is something we create unnecessarily by adopting a combative mindset.
> 
> The Institute says that if you treat other people as obstacles to your own success, they tend to react defensively. This makes it difficult to resolve your disagreements without a court or other power structure to arbitrate between you and enforce its rulings.
> 
> But if you rethink your situation, set aside your own biases, and look for ways to help others instead of seeing them as obstacles, you can build cooperative relationships with them. Your relationship then makes disagreements easy to resolve whenever they do arise, without having to appeal to a higher authority. If everyone took this approach, then the resulting network of cooperative relationships would provide an alternative means of keeping the peace to the hierarchy that Ferguson says is necessary.

##### The World Hierarchy Throughout History

As evidence that hierarchies are necessary for peace, Ferguson outlines how world hierarchies have changed over the course of history, and he correlates **periods of relative peace to times when there was a clear hierarchy** and periods of widespread violence to times when there wasn’t.

For example, when the Protestant Reformation of the 1500s undermined people’s faith in the religious and political hierarchy of the Catholic Church, the result was widespread religious conflict and civil war throughout Europe. Similarly, in the 1700s, France went through a series of revolutions. One group after another succeeded in overthrowing a French government that people didn’t perceive as legitimate, only to set up another government that wasn’t widely recognized as legitimate.

In the 1800s, by contrast, Europe enjoyed relative peace under the “pentarchy,” a hierarchy of European nations established by international treaties. Great Britain played the role of “Chief Balancing Power” at the top of the hierarchy, with France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia making up the remainder of the pentarchy and other nations occupying lower tiers in the hierarchy.

But by the early 1900s, the pentarchy no longer reflected reality. The unification of Germany, changes to the European network of treaties, advances in military and industrial technology, and the growth of some European powers’ colonial empires had changed the balance of power, but it wasn’t clear what the new hierarchy was. In Ferguson’s view, the First World War was the inevitable result of this lack of a clear hierarchy. This is because disagreements between nations are inevitable, and without a mutually respected moderator to resolve them, sooner or later the conflicts will escalate.

After the Second World War, a new global hierarchy emerged. The United States became the main world power and was joined by Russia, China, France, and the UK on the UN Security Council. Ferguson sees the Security Council as a new pentarchy under which other nations in the UN make up the next tier of the global hierarchy. This new hierarchy facilitated a period of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere (the Cold War never turned into all-out war) that has lasted until the present.

> **What Makes a Governmental Hierarchy Legitimate?**
> 
> There are two ways to define governmental legitimacy. “Descriptive” legitimacy is based solely on whether people believe the government is legitimate: If enough people support the government for it to stay in power, it’s legitimate. Ferguson appears to be using the “descriptive” definition of legitimacy.
> 
> Then there is “normative” legitimacy, which sets forth standard criteria for assessing whether any given government is legitimate. Various political theorists have advanced different standards for assessing normative legitimacy. For example, in _The Social Contract_ , Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues that a legitimate government only forms when members of a society come together as equals and agree to act cooperatively for mutual protection and benefit. As such, he considers governments illegitimate if they prioritize the freedom or welfare of some of their people over others.
> 
> Although they provide different definitions of legitimacy, normative and descriptive legitimacy are related in that normative standards help us understand people’s reasons for accepting or rejecting a given regime. To delve deeper, let’s apply Rousseau’s normative standard to Ferguson’s examples.
> 
> The hierarchies of the revolutionary French governments gave some people (like Napoleon) a lot more freedom and power than others, making them illegitimate by Rousseau’s standard. This helps to explain why these hierarchies weren’t more widely accepted: Only those who stood to benefit by supporting the new government gave it their support, and there were enough who didn’t stand to benefit to compromise its legitimacy.
> 
> The five nations that made up the pentarchy met as equal powers in the 1800s and made treaties for their mutual protection and benefit, making it legitimate by Rousseau’s criteria. But, as Ferguson notes, the balance of power shifted so that by the time of the First World War they no longer saw each other as equals benefiting equally from the treaties that established the pentarchy. That would have eroded its legitimacy by Rousseau's standard.
> 
> In the hierarchy of powers established after the Second World War, the nations participating in the UN may not have equal power on the world stage—as the hierarchy that Ferguson describes illustrates—but they equally stand to benefit by cooperating to avoid another global war. So, again, the world hierarchy seems to at least approximate Rousseau's idea of legitimacy. (However, the recent moves by Russia to expand its empire suggest that it no longer accepts its place within the hierarchy, signaling a potential breakdown in the perceived legitimacy of the established order.)

#### Additional Networks Undermine Hierarchies

Ferguson’s second conclusion is that **any other network that creates additional connections of loyalty between entities within a hierarchy weakens the power of the hierarchy.** This is because the additional connections reduce the betweenness of the entities in the tiers above them so that the higher-up entities no longer are the sole pass-through points for information. Any network that allows people to share ideas outside of official communications has the potential to spread ideas that are contrary to the hierarchical order, even if that’s not the network’s primary purpose.

And the more loyalties people have (to friends, ideologies, and so on) outside the official hierarchy, the less complete their loyalty to the hierarchy becomes. Thus, according to Ferguson, there is usually some amount of tension between formal hierarchies and other networks.

> **Hierarchies and Other Networks Support Different Kinds of Freedom**
> 
> In _Thank You for Being Late_ , Thomas Friedman provides additional perspective on the principle that other networks undermine hierarchies. He contrasts two types of freedom, freedom _from_ oppression and freedom _to_ do what you think is worth doing, and he discusses how they relate to networking.
> 
> As Friedman explains, informal peer-to-peer networks such as those found on social media are great for making people more difficult to coerce and empowering them to throw off oppression. These networks naturally promote freedom _from_ coercive influences. But, according to Friedman, they _don’t_ generally empower people _to_ do things. This is because the freedom _to_ do things is contingent on having infrastructure or systems in place that enable you to do the things you want to do, and informal networks can’t provide that.
> 
> Ferguson would probably add that building infrastructure and organizing support systems is something that hierarchies excel at. So, hierarchies promote freedom _to_ do things that the hierarchy supports, while other types of networks promote freedom _from_ coercion by the hierarchy.

##### Totalitarian Hierarchies Isolate People

Ferguson recounts that the tension between hierarchies and other networks is most evident in totalitarian states, such as Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Communist China. In these regimes, the government hierarchy attempted to control every aspect of life and thus tried to isolate individuals from all other networks.

(Shortform note: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn provides additional vivid examples of how the Soviet Union isolated citizens from each other in _The Gulag Archipelago_.)

The government hierarchies in these states controlled people primarily through fear, using brutality and surveillance to instill in _everyone_ the fear of being punished for the mere suspicion of conspiring against the government. This fear of raising suspicion prompted people to avoid having any contact with each other outside official channels. Ironically, the higher up in the government hierarchy you were, the _more_ likely you’d be suspected, because you’d be more valuable to a conspiracy if there was one.

(Shortform note: If totalitarian regimes invariably try to consolidate their power by isolating their people, does that mean that isolating people by preventing them from sharing their perspectives leads to totalitarianism? Some authors warn that it does. For example, in _Cynical Theories_ , Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay express concern over the direction of the contemporary “social justice” movement. They observe that the movement tends to gang up on anyone with a dissenting viewpoint, using threats and social alienation to police people’s language and culture. The authors interpret this as a warning sign that the movement has metamorphosed from a force for good into a dangerous totalitarian initiative.)

##### Conspiracy Theories Don’t Work

The tension between hierarchies and other networks also implies that **most conspiracy theories are wrong**. In Ferguson’s experience, the most common conspiracy theories allege that there’s a secret conspiracy controlling some official hierarchy from behind the scenes. But in reality, conspiracies between individuals or groups within a hierarchy tend to undermine those hierarchies, not absorb them. Based on historical precedent, it’s not unusual for a conspiracy to overthrow a hierarchy, but it’s extremely unusual for a conspiracy to surreptitiously control one.

> **Debunking Conspiracies Is Complicated**
> 
> Conspiracy theorists might argue that Ferguson misunderstands or, at best, oversimplifies their perspective. For example, in _The Creature From Jekyll Island_ , Edward Griffin describes two conspiracies: a secret society bent on world domination, and the Federal Reserve, which he alleges to be a creation of a banking cartel rather than a legitimate government agency.
> 
> Griffin describes the world-domination conspiracy as a rigid hierarchy on top of the world’s visible national hierarchies that controls them from behind the scenes. If a conspiracy of this kind existed, its structure wouldn’t undermine governmental hierarchies as other types of conspiracies could, because the conspiracy itself is just a part of the world hierarchy that isn’t readily visible.
> 
> Griffin also explains that one reason the banking cartel designed the Federal Reserve the way they did was so that it would leverage the existing government hierarchy to enforce the cartel’s rulings on bank policy. According to Griffin, this gave the bank cartel much greater stability than most criminal cartels. Given Ferguson’s principle that hierarchies maintain order, it makes sense that cartels or other conspiracies that managed to integrate themselves with a government hierarchy like this would operate more smoothly.
> 
> Thus, Griffin shows us a couple ways that conspiracies could, in theory, fit into the visible hierarchies of power and use them to benefit their own agenda without violating the principles of network theory. Consequently, Ferguson’s observation that other networks undermine hierarchies’ authority debunks only certain kinds of conspiracy theories.

#### Hierarchies Struggle With Complexity

Finally, Ferguson notes that although hierarchies are efficient for resolving disagreements and maintaining order, they are _inefficient_ when it comes to developing creative solutions to complex problems. This is because decisions tend to be made in the upper tiers of the hierarchy. In an extreme case where all the decisions are made by a single person at the top,**the system could never adapt to any situation that was too complex for that single person to fully comprehend.**

Though hierarchies where one person makes _all_ decisions are rare, Ferguson observes that hierarchies in general are notoriously inflexible, even ones whose lower tiers have some decision-making authority. At best, they take longer to react to changing situations than networks in which authority is more diffuse and individuals function more autonomously. At worst, they’re completely incapable of adapting to complex situations. This is why some networks, such as the economy as a whole, cannot effectively adopt a hierarchical structure.

This observation also explains why guerilla warfare sometimes enables small, relatively disorganized bands of insurgents to defy much larger hierarchically organized military powers: In the chaotic environment of guerilla warfare, a formless network of small, autonomous bands operates more efficiently than a traditional organized military.

> **Turning Military Hierarchies Around**
> 
> In _Turn This Ship Around_ , former US Navy Captain L. David Marquet observes that the traditional military hierarchy (what he refers to as the leader-follower model) works well for coordinating simple physical labors like building pyramids. But it doesn’t work as well in more complex, thought-intensive situations, like operating a nuclear submarine. This corroborates Ferguson’s observations. Marquet goes on to provide a practical blueprint for modifying the hierarchy to empower those at the bottom and improve performance.
> 
> According to Marquet, the key is to transition to a “leader-leader model,” where most decisions are made lower down in the chain of command because _everyone_ thinks like a leader in the hierarchy. To foster this kind of thinking in the lower ranks, he recommends changing how subordinates in the hierarchy address their superiors: Instead of asking what to do, or even making suggestions, they should come up with their own solutions and state what they intend to do. In most cases, their superior then simply approves their plans. Marquet also recommends eliminating the traditional top-down approach to monitoring work, instead having people track and report on their own progress.
> 
> Marquet’s techniques made his submarine one of the best-performing ships in the US Navy, and, he argues, can be applied to almost any organization that deals with complex information and situations.

### Prognosis for the Future

As Ferguson recounts, certain visionaries, social media proponents, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have argued that making the world more connected through social media and global commerce will contribute to building a utopian future of world peace and equality. Ferguson contends that this is not the case. He stops short of making specific predictions about what the future _does_ hold, but **he identifies a number of trends contradicting the idea that the growth of current networks will precipitate world peace and equality**.

#### Network Growth Doesn’t Bring Peace

First of all, as we’ve discussed, the growth of networks independent of a hierarchical power structure tends to weaken that power structure. Thus, Ferguson says, if the growth of new networks sufficiently undermines the hierarchies that are responsible for maintaining order, the result is anarchy, not peace.

In the case of social media, this scenario is not entirely hypothetical. As Ferguson points out, the proliferation of “fake news” and other inflammatory information passed around social media networks has **increased the polarization of opinions and created some unrest** in the United States.

(Shortform note: In _The Four_ , a book about the four biggest tech companies in the US, Scott Galloway discusses how social media’s business model makes it inherently prone to promoting polarization. Social media companies like Facebook make most of their revenue by selling targeted advertising. They tend to run ads that target the audience with the most radical views because it’s easier for their algorithms to identify the interests of users who have strong opinions or radical views. Ads that target radical views tend to be more polarizing and are more likely to stoop to the level of fake news.)

Furthermore, says Ferguson, Islamic **insurgent groups such as ISIS have made effective use of social media** and messaging apps to grow their networks and coordinate their activities. This growth of insurgent networks in the Middle East led to extensive violence and the overthrow, or partial overthrow, of government hierarchies in Iraq and Syria.

> **How Networks Facilitate Terrorism**
> 
> As Yuval Noah Harari explains in _21 Lessons for the 21st Century_ , media networks play a key role in helping terrorists destabilize national governments, not just in allowing them to recruit operatives and coordinate attacks. The strategic principle of terrorism is that a relatively small attack can create enough public fear to undermine people’s faith in the government’s ability to maintain peace, ultimately compromising the government’s legitimacy.
> 
> A successful terrorist attack might only kill a dozen people, but it makes millions of people feel unsafe. This is only possible if news of the attack spreads widely and sensationalizes it out of proportion. Thus, terrorists owe a large part of their success to the fact that both social media networks and traditional mass media networks are effective at spreading and sensationalizing news of terrorist attacks.

#### The Global Hierarchy of the Future Is Uncertain

Another reason Ferguson doesn’t expect the growth of extra-governmental networks to lead to peace is that they threaten the existing established hierarchy. As we’ve discussed, Ferguson believes that it takes a universally accepted hierarchy to maintain order and stability in society. He’s concerned that the world hierarchy established after World War II has decayed, much as the old pentarchy did before World War I, and that there isn’t a unified global vision for what the world hierarchy looks like, or should look like, going forward.

One reason for this breakdown is the rise of online commerce and communications networks such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, which have emerged as powerful entities. It’s unclear exactly how these platforms will fit (or should fit) into the hierarchy of the global power structure. The only certainty is that they will, in some way, be solidly a part of it: The elections of 2016—both in the US and in the UK—showed decisively how social media can influence democratic governments by influencing voters.

> **Troll Farms Add to the Uncertainty**
> 
> To complicate matters even beyond what Ferguson discusses, in recent years, troll farms have added a new dimension to the relationship between social media networks, citizens, and government hierarchies.
> 
> In internet parlance, “trolling” consists of creating spurious profiles on social media and using them to spread rumors, disseminate misinformation, or heckle others who post on social media. Troll farms are organizations that use coordinated trolling to influence the public narrative, often for the purpose of manipulating an election.
> 
> Some governments now have their own troll farms integrated right into the formal hierarchy. Other governments hire private agencies to provide trolling services. They may use troll farms to control the narrative in their own country or to manipulate elections in other countries, ultimately to advance their own agenda on the international stage.
> 
> All three networks that Ferguson mentions—Facebook, Google, and Amazon—have proven to be fertile soil for troll farms. Some of Facebook’s highest-traffic pages related to the US 2016 and 2020 elections were run by troll farms in Eastern Europe. In the realm of ecommerce, merchants can hire troll farms to flood their product pages with positive reviews, causing Amazon’s algorithms to rank their products higher and show them to more customers. Similarly, trolls can be enlisted to artificially boost traffic and other metrics so that a web page will rank higher in search engines like Google.
> 
> In some sense, state-sponsored troll farms provide a convenient mechanism for government hierarchies to informally integrate social media networks into the formal hierarchy, using social media to control the public narrative without officially regulating media platforms. Yet they also have the potential to undermine the legitimacy of the governments that use them. In any case, they add one more variable to the power equation, making future hierarchies more difficult to predict.

Ferguson examines two contrasting approaches some governments are taking to regulating social media platforms as they try to incorporate them into their existing power structures. One approach hails from Europe and the other from China.

##### The European Vision

**While the US government has left social media networks largely to their own devices, European governments have increasingly tried to regulate them.** European regulators demand that social media companies promptly remove and report any posts that call for violence or otherwise violate the law. However, they have allowed social media companies to remain otherwise independent.

Ferguson notes that in some ways, this regulatory relationship between governments and social media platforms makes the platforms even more powerful: The government depends on them to enforce its own laws online, but the platforms are also free to censor whatever opinions or information they please (unlike most democratic governments). That said, Ferguson also suggests that social media platforms may not be _able_ to censor content effectively because they have so many users and relatively few employees.

> **The Digital Services Act**
> 
> Since Ferguson wrote _The Square and the Tower_ , Europe has continued down the path of increasing regulatory scrutiny of social media and other big tech companies. Most significantly, in 2022, the European Union passed the Digital Services Act (DSA), which is aimed at regulating big tech.
> 
> The DSA codifies most of the demands that Ferguson identified, requiring digital service providers to remove and report illegal content promptly when they discover it. Social media sites, messaging apps, e-commerce platforms, and search engines all qualify as digital service providers and thus are required to comply with the act in order to conduct business in Europe. Violations are punishable by steep fines.
> 
> Additionally, the DSA requires large companies (those with at least 45 million active users per month in Europe and a net worth of at least 75 billion euros) to submit to special government supervision of their operations and to pay a fee to cover the cost of this supervision.
> 
> But—as Ferguson anticipated—the DSA leaves online platforms free to censor any content they choose in addition to what the government requires them to delete, assuming they (or their algorithms) can actually find and filter the content as it’s posted.
> 
> As of 2023, it still remains to be seen how effectively the EU will be able to enforce the DSA and how much the law will affect what content is posted online. Thus, while the DSA certainly strengthens the connection between government and big tech in Europe, it’s still not clear exactly where big tech will fit within the hierarchy of power.

##### The Chinese Vision

**China, by contrast, has largely blocked access to Western social media sites, instead setting up its own platforms over which the government has complete control.** Ferguson notes that China’s social media, web search, and e-commerce platforms are now comparable to Facebook, Google, and Amazon in terms of their usership and revenue. And because of their broad usership, they’ve become powerful tools that help the Chinese government keep its citizens under surveillance.

(Shortform note: International commerce adds another dimension to China’s use of social media. Because Chinese customers represent such a profitable market, China can use its own social media platforms to pressure companies in other countries—and thus, indirectly, the international community—to accept China’s stance on international issues like the question of sovereignty over Taiwan. This is possible because, given the size of the market, companies are becoming increasingly reliant on publicity on Chinese social media. They don’t want to risk a loss of sales if their brand is accused of failing to respect China’s interests.)
