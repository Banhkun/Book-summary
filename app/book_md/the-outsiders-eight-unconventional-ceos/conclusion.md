## Conclusion: Relevance of the Lessons

We’ve covered 8 standout CEOs and their companies, mostly in the latter half of the 20th century. But how applicable are the lessons here? Are they still relevant in the modern day? And are the lessons relevant for small businesses or managers? The author argues yes to both.

### Modern Relevance

The author argues the principles in this book are timeless, studying two examples: Pre-Paid Legal, and Exxon.

#### Modern Example: Pre-Paid Legal

Pre-Paid Legal (known today as LegalShield) provides legal insurance—for a fixed annual premium, customers have their unexpected legal costs covered, including expenses for litigation, wills, and trusts.

Growing quickly through the 1990s, its revenue flattened. Despite the lack of revenue growth, its stock price grew by 4 times. How did Pre-Paid Legal achieve this? As you might expect, the answer came in its capital allocation decisions:

  * They optimized free cash flow.
  * Recognizing that the industry was mature and further investment would likely have low returns, the CEO instead repurchased shares aggressively, buying back over 50% of shares.



The company sold for $650 million to private equity in 2011.

#### Modern Example: Exxon

From 1977 to 2011, ExxonMobil showed a 15% annual return for investors, exceeding the overall market and competitors. The cause, once again, was intelligent capital allocation:

  * ExxonMobil maintained discipline around requiring a minimum 20% return on projects. This meant some contrarian decisions, such as pausing unprofitable production during low energy prices, even when Wall Street analysts complained it reduced short-term financials.
  * They repurchase shares when it seems economically profitable, buying back 25% of shares in a recent 5-year period.
  * They made acquisitions patiently and opportunistically. For over a decade, Exxon hadn’t made a significant acquisition, until it purchased Mobil in 1999, a transaction worth half its enterprise value.
  * They enforced a company culture of frugality, returns, and low ego.
  * The CEO Tillerson rarely interacted with Wall Street or industry conferences, avoiding the spotlight to focus on the business



### Relevance for Everyone

What if you’re not a CEO of a large public company? Are the decisions relevant to everyday managers and business owners?

The author argues yes—what’s shown here is a rational approach to capital allocation: **figure out the value of all the options available to you, then choose the most profitable ones, ignoring conventional wisdom and what your competitors are doing**.

Here’s a realistic example. Imagine you own a single-location bakery, and you have more demand than you can service. You consider two possible options: 1) expanding your current store, 2) opening a second store in a new location.

Using the checklist of the outsider CEOs, work through the following steps:

  * Determine your personal hurdle rate for investments. Say it’s a 20% annual return on investment.
  * Calculate the costs of both options.
    * 1) Expanding your current store might cost $50,000 for a new oven and $50,000 for renovations, for a total upfront cost of $100,000
    * 2) Opening a second store might cost $50,000 for a new oven and $150,000 for new building expenses, for a total upfront cost of $200,000.
  * Calculate the additional profits enabled by each option.
    * 1) Expanding your current store allows you to service the existing demand that you currently can’t serve. You estimate, after operating costs, expanding will net $20,000 in additional profits.
    * 2) Opening a second store lets you access more demand than your current store, but there is also risk in misestimating demand. You estimate, after operating costs, opening a second store will net $40,000-$75,000 in additional profits.
  * Calculate the ROI of each option, and compare to your hurdle rate.
    * 1) $20,000 in additional profits over $100,000 in upfront costs is a 20% return. This just meets your hurdle rate.
    * 2) $40,000-$75,000 in additional profits over $200,000 in upfront costs is a return between 25% and 37.5%. This is a higher return, accompanied by higher risk.
  * Consider the major assumptions in your understanding of the situation.
    * How confident are you in the sales estimates for your second location in a new location? How might you be wrong about this?
    * Opening a second store requires $100,000 more investment than expanding your current store. How can you access this capital? How much will it cost?
    * Are there any qualitative benefits to the new store? For example, does it better build capabilities to pave the way for future expansion? Does it diversify your revenue so you are less dependent on your current store?



Even though this example concerns a relatively small business, it uses the same thought process that CEOs of Fortune 500 companies use. And by going through this decision methodically like outsider CEOs, you’ll arrive at the optimal answer for your situation—regardless of what conventional wisdom tells you to do or what your competitors are doing.
