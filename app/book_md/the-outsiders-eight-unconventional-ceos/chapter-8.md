## Chapter 8: Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway

Saving the best for last, the author ends with Warren Buffett’s staggering returns over the 50-plus year history of Berkshire Hathaway. Starting with buying a textile company in 1965, Buffett grew Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world’s largest companies.

Over the years, Buffett excelled in all manners of investments—in both public and private companies, with ownership of both minority and total stakes. He famously made use of insurance float to fund investments in higher-return companies, held a small basket of companies for very long periods of time, and acted aggressively when everyone else was ducking for fear.

### Performance

From 1965 to 2011, Berkshire Hathaway showed a 20.7% annual return rate, compared to 9.3% for the S&P 500.

$1 invested at the beginning would have been worth $6,265 by 2011. This outperformed the S&P by a staggering 100 times.

### History

Born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett was the son of a stockbroker and the grandson of a grocery store owner. His early entrepreneurial activities included paper routes and reselling soft drinks.

When he was 19, he read _The Intelligent Investor_ by Benjamin Graham, which converted him into value investing—buying companies that were cheap relative to their intrinsic value (which was based on the company’s balance sheet). He began investing the profits from his ventures, worth about $10,000 in today’s dollars.

When pursuing his MBA, he chose to go to Columbia, where Graham was a professor. After graduating, Buffett asked Graham for a job at his investment firm, but Graham declined. Buffett returned to Omaha to work as a stock broker, where he continued researching investments. Here he happened on GEICO, an insurance company that featured competitive advantages and a great value for the price. He invested most of his money in GEICO.

In 1954, Graham finally offered Buffett a job, and Buffett continued researching underpriced public companies, which were often cheap, low-quality companies (Buffett called them “cigar butts”). When Graham closed his firm in 1956 to focus on other interests, Buffett started his own fund in Omaha, raising $105,000 (a bit under $1 million today). Over the next decade, Buffett continued investing by Graham’s value philosophy, achieving an average 30% annual return even without using debt.

#### Buffett Refines His Investing Style

But in the mid-1960s, **Buffett began deviating from the value method, instead investing in high-quality companies that had a strong competitive profile and long-term prospects**. His early investments in this style included Disney and American Express.

In 1965, Buffett purchased the textile company Berkshire Hathaway, a 100-year-old family business, through a hostile takeover. The company was only worth $18 million in enterprise value and was in a commodity business, but Buffett saw it as a platform to build his investments around. After installing a new CEO, who optimized operations, Berkshire Hathaway had $14 million of profit.

Buffett used this profit to buy National Indemnity, an insurance company that generated a large amount of float—the value of premiums received before they are paid out as claims. Insurance companies rely on investment returns from float to generate a profit; sometimes years can pass between when premiums are received and when they need to be paid out. In essence, **Berkshire was able to receive cash at 3% and invest it at 13%**. Buffett used this float to invest in businesses, sometimes buying them outright. His purchases included a newspaper in Omaha and a local bank in Illinois.

His investing style was further honed in the 1970s, as inflation was a common concern among investors. The typical thinking was that hard assets like gold were the best protection against inflation. Buffett saw differently, and developed key components of his investment thesis:

  * **He believed that companies that had the ability to raise prices and that had low capital requirements were best protected against inflation**. These companies included beloved consumer brands that were market leaders.
  * The best way to value a company was based on income statement and cash flows, as well as intangibles like brand power and market share. This was a departure from Graham’s method of using balance sheet and net working capital. 
  * To avoid leakage of growth to taxes, Buffett would prefer holding investments for a long time. This allowed for longer periods of compounding growth without paying taxes on exiting positions.



In short, where Benjamin Graham might have considered a company too expensive based on its book value, Buffett saw it could be cheap, because of the company’s long-term potential to consistently generate high returns on capital.

One example is illustrative—in 1972, Buffett purchased See’s Candies for $25 million, when it had $7 million in book value and $4.2 million in pretax profits. **At 3 times book value, it would have been too expensive for Graham, but at 6 times pretax income and strong brand loyalty, it was a reasonable purchase**. Over the decades, See’s Candies has not grown unit sales tremendously, but its strong brand allowed it to raise prices consistently. See’s earned a 32% annual return over 27 years and has provided $1.65 billion in cash flow for reinvestment.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Buffett thus began investing in high-quality, enduring companies, such as the Washington Post, GEICO, and General Foods. He both made minority investments and purchased companies outright, such as with See’s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart.

#### To Today

Among its many investments in the decades since, Berkshire Hathaway is known for these highlights:

  * In 1986, he made the firm’s largest investment yet—$500 million to help Tom Murphy (another outsider CEO) acquire ABC, ending up with 18% of the combined company.
  * In 1989, he purchased a whopping 7% of Coca-Cola, with the stake being a quarter of Berkshire’s book value
  * In the 1980s, Buffett invested in Salomon Brothers, Gillette, and US Airways.
  * In the 1990s, Buffett invested in Wells Fargo, General Dynamics, and American Express.
  * In 1998, he purchased reinsurer General Re for $22 billion, the largest deal yet.
  * Around the time of the September 11 attacks, he opportunistically purchased in industries the market had turned away from, such as with Benjamin Moore Paints and Shaw Carpets.
  * In 2003 and 2004, Buffett invested outside equity markets, investing in junk bonds and currency (where he bet against the dollar). 
  * After a relatively quiet few years, he leapt into action during the 2008 financial recession. In the few years following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, he deployed over $80 billion, including:
    * $8 billion in convertible stock from Goldman Sachs and General Electric
    * $9.5 billion in mezzanine financing to Mars/Wrigley and Dow Chemical
    * $8.9 billion in distressed debt securities
    * $26.5 billion for the remaining 77.5% of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the country’s largest railroad network, that he didn’t own
    * $10.9 billion in IBM stock



Berkshire Hathaway continues to be one of the most highly valued enterprises in the world. Having avoided stock splits in its history, Berkshire shares are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each.

### Management Practices

#### Insurance Float

A big part of Berkshire’s investment strategy is its **use of low-cost insurance float to invest in higher-return businesses**. As a reminder, insurance float is money the company receives in premiums before they are paid out as claims. The time gap can be many years. In essence, this is like getting cash at 3% to reinvest at 13%.

Over the years, Berkshire continued scaling up the strategy in an accelerating flywheel effect. He could use insurance float to purchase companies that generated cash flow, which in turn he could use to buy more insurance companies, which generated more float to purchase companies. Insurance float grew from $237 million in 1970 to $70 billion in 2011.

As a large diversified company, Buffett also had more control over his insurance companies’ underwriting to maximize profitability. When premium pricing was low, Buffett’s insurance companies would underwrite fewer premiums; when pricing was high, it would take advantage by underwriting multiple-fold more in premiums. For instance, between 1984 to 1986, premiums grew sixfold, then shrank 73% by 1989. It’d be difficult for an independent public insurer to do the same, since its investors expect smooth performance.

#### A Wide Range of Investment Options

Having had extensive experience in investing before starting Berkshire Hathaway, **Buffett had a wider range of investment options than most CEOs**. Typical CEOs only look within their immediate industry. In contrast, Buffett has made investments in a vast array of industries (from beverages to industrials). Even his investments take a wide range of flavors, including investments in both private and public companies, both minority investments and complete acquisitions, and at times making big bets in bonds and currencies.

#### Opportunistic Temperament

Buffett has said that as an investor, **it’s important to be “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”**

Buffett is content to be patient for years when companies are overvalued and he doesn’t see acceptable opportunities. Then, when other investors are in turmoil (as in the 2008 financial crisis), Buffett strikes aggressively.

Beyond larger trends, Buffett enjoys finding opportunities within industries and individual companies. **Pessimism within an industry can obscure strong performers** within the industry—Buffett invested in Freddie Mac in 1989 during the recession, and in General Dynamics in 1992 during the defense industry slump. He also finds **companies in the midst of a major strategic change** , such as when a new CEO announces a focus on the company core and divestments of low-performing businesses.

This also means being ruthless about not tolerating poor performance and low returns. When Buffett purchased Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, he chose never to enter textiles again, seeing it as a commodity business with poor long-term prospects. Instead, he merely harvested capital from Berkshire and invested it elsewhere. Choosing what _not_ to do is often as important as choosing what _to_ do.

#### Portfolio Management

Portfolio management concerns 1) how many stocks an investor owns and 2) how long he holds them.

Buffett believes that great companies are rare, and that concentrated portfolios generate great returns. Berkshire has advised students that if they were only limited to 20 total investments throughout their career, they would drastically improve their performance. As a result, **Berkshire is famously concentrated among its holdings**. The top five holdings typically make up 60-80% of Berkshire’s value. At one time, Buffett had 40% invested in American Express.

In contrast, mutual funds are often made up of hundreds of stocks, with no single stock making up more than a few percentage points.

Buffett also holds stocks for a very long time—his top holdings have been held for over 20 years. This lack of transaction activity allows compound interest to continue generating massive returns without leakage through taxes. In contrast, mutual funds often hold for less than one year.

Inversely, Buffett aims for Berkshire shareholders to be long-term partners as well. He has never split Berkshire shares, which currently trade at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

#### Decentralization of Operations

Despite Berkshire’s companies employing 270,000 people, its headquarters has only 23 people.

Warren Buffett is famously hands-off with his management of owned companies, believing this reduces overhead and encourages entrepreneurship. When he buys a company, he leaves the management team in place and rarely makes changes. Then Buffett doesn’t expect the CEO to call him unless Buffett can help. There are no regular budget meetings. As long as the company performs, Buffett leaves them alone.

This is a major part of Berkshire’s appeal when sellers consider being acquired by Berkshire—unlike a private equity buyer or larger company, Berkshire will allow management to continue running the business. This gives Berkshire an advantage in appealing to certain types of sellers.

#### Centralization of Investments

However, like most other outsider CEOs, Buffett is completely centralized in capital allocations. All capital flows to headquarters to allocate. Buffett personally takes charge of negotiations, and he does not rely on investment bankers or business development to make deals.

Buffett also believes in having a relatively small board, and **requiring all board directors to have a personal stake in decisions**. This means:

  1. A meaningful investment of personal capital into the business
  2. No insurance 
  3. Avoiding fees that represent a large percent of the director’s income



This aligns board members much better with the performance of the business. In contrast, board members who have little ownership in the business, have insurance that protects them from downside, and are paid large fees are far less interested in guiding the company correctly.

#### Acquisition Style

Buffett is remarkably quick at making a purchase decision. He spends less time on due diligence and often makes deals within days. He never visits company locations and rarely meets management. He can move quickly because he only invests in industries he knows deeply, and he has honed his investment criteria. This lets him filter the key performance indicators of a business.

Buffett also avoids auctions, believing they drive up valuation needlessly. He prefers that owners call him and offer a price, with Buffett returning his answer within 5 minutes.
