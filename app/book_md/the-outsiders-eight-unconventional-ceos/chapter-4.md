## Chapter 4: John Malone and TCI

Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) was a cable television provider founded in 1958. It grew to be the largest cable company in the country, owning both cable providers and content programming. It was acquired by AT&T in 1999 for $43.5 billion in stock and, through a series of transactions, would ultimately become Comcast.

As CEO from 1972 to 1991, John Malone pursued a **virtuous cycle strategy** —grow subscriber count through acquisitions of cable providers, which would give scale to negotiate lower fees with content providers, which would make acquisitions of cable companies further cheaper.

### Performance

From 1973 to 1998, Teledyne showed a 30.3% annual return rate, compared to 14.3% for the S&P 500 and 20.4% for public cable companies.

$1 invested at the beginning would have been worth $900 by 1998. This outperformed the S&P by 40 times, and his peers by 5 times.

### History

John Malone was born in 1941 and earned bachelor’s degrees from Yale in economics and electrical engineering, as well as graduate degrees in operations research from Johns Hopkins. He worked at Bell Labs, studying financial strategies in monopoly markets. Unhappy with the bureaucratic culture at AT&T, he joined McKinsey as a consultant.

While at McKinsey, he studied the cable industry, and he immediately saw an attractive opportunity:

  * The cable industry had stable subscriber bases, which led to predictable revenue and thus accurate forecasting and strategic planning.
  * The nature of the business allowed tax maneuvers to reduce taxes on cash flow. Essentially, they could use debt to build new cable systems and depreciate the costs. The depreciation charges and interest expenses were both tax-deductible, which would decrease net income and thus taxes. A cable company with healthy cash flow could thus pay little in taxes; furthermore, **it could repeat this cycle indefinitely, continuously taking on debt to acquire more cable systems**.
  * The cable industry was growing extremely quickly, with subscribers growing 20-fold over a matter of years in the late 1960s and early 1970s.



In 1970, one of his clients at McKinsey, General Instrument, made an offer to him to run Jerrold, its cable television equipment division. Within two years, he was made an offer by TCI to join as CEO.

TCI was founded in 1956 by Bob Magness and had gone public in 1970. In 1973, when Malone joined, it had 600,000 subscribers and was the #4 cable company in the US. It had taken on a troubling amount of debt—17 times revenue—and was dangerously close to bankruptcy.

#### 1973-1977: Stabilization

**Malone’s first priority was to keep TCI out of bankruptcy.** He instituted a new lean culture focused on financial discipline, estimating that growing subscribers by 10% per year while maintaining margins would keep them out of bankruptcy. He maintained frugality at headquarters, keeping just a single receptionist and grouping multiple executives in the same motel room when traveling.

Characteristic of outsider CEOs, Malone had a COO, J.C. Sparkman, who enforced budgeting and cash flow benchmarks at the operating divisions. Managers who underperformed were fired.

Over his first 4 years, Malone pushed TCI to produce the highest margins in the cable industry and saw consistent subscriber growth and cash flow.

#### 1977 -1990: Growth

Once TCI stabilized, Malone could pursue his master strategy: a virtuous cycle of growth.

At cable companies, the largest expense (40% of operating expenses) was paid to content suppliers (called programmers) like HBO and MTV. Larger cable providers were able to negotiate lower fees per subscriber. Malone realized that the key was to increase size, which would allow for increasingly better business economics, which would in turn allow for increased size.

**Here’s how the virtuous cycle worked in more detail:**

  * Buying more cable systems would lead to more subscribers.
  * This would lead to lower programming fees per subscriber, which would increase cash flow.
  * Higher cash flow allowed the company to take on more debt, which could be used to buy more cable systems.
  * This would further improve programming fees, and so forth.



In essence, larger cable companies could pay more for acquisitions than smaller competitors, since they could extract more value from them.

Malone executed the strategy relentlessly, **acquiring 482 companies from 1973 to 1989**(this was a rate of one every two weeks). His sole focus was on acquiring subscribers at good prices.

Maintaining financial discipline, Malone avoided the costly competitions for urban markets, instead focusing on rural and suburban areas. He felt other cable companies were bidding up the price of urban markets, thus making them unprofitable; indeed, when years later the urban companies failed under too much debt and low profits, Malone acquired them at much lower prices, leading to better economics.

In 1982, TCI became the largest cable provider, with 2.5 million subscribers.

##### Joint Ventures

In addition to growing subscribers, Malone was interested in partnering with cable programmers. He took minority stakes in new programming businesses, in exchange for capital and access to TCI’s subscriber scale. Thus Malone built partnerships with rising channels such as BET, Discovery, and QVC. He was unique among cable companies for doing so at the time. These investments would be a large part of TCI’s ultimate value.

#### 1990s: Spinoffs and Sale

Through the 1990s, a shifting environment put a damper on the cable industry. New regulation limited cable rates and access to debt for cable companies, which stifled growth. Furthermore, the cable industry faced increasing competition from satellite television.

Realizing that better opportunities might lay outside cable, Malone shifted his focus:

  * He helped create two new businesses: Teleport, a telephone service, and Sprint/PCS, a partnership with Sprint for cellular service. These would later generate significant value—Teleport was sold to AT&T for $11 billion (a 28x return on investment) and Sprint/PCS was sold to Sprint Corp. for $9 billion.
  * He spun off 14 non-core businesses; for instance, minority investments in programming were packaged as Liberty Media. He believed this would increase transparency into the operating divisions of TCI and reduce regulatory antitrust attention.
  * He contracted General Instrument to produce 10 million set-top boxes that would enable competition with satellite TV, in exchange for 16% equity in the company. Motorola later acquired General Instrument for $11 billion in1999.



As the 1990s wore on, Malone became increasingly concerned about TCI’s future. In addition to the regulation and competition from satellite television, TCI’s rural cable networks were also wearing down and would need to be upgraded at significant expense. He also didn’t have a clear successor (his COO Sparkman retired in 1995).

In 1998, he found a buyer in AT&T and negotiated a striking deal—$43.5 billion in stock, which was 12 times EBITDA and $2,600 per subscriber. In addition, he negotiated a long-term deal for Liberty Media’s programming on AT&T cable.

### Management Practices

#### Intelligent Use of Debt

Like many acquisitive outsider CEOs, **Malone used debt to finance acquisitions**. As described earlier, he saw that growth for cable companies could come more cheaply than expected—depreciation of capital expenditures and interest expenses would reduce taxes, even if the company had healthy cash flow. Furthermore, increasing scale allowed TCI to access cheaper debt.

Through much of his tenure, he maintained a **ratio of 5x debt to EBITDA**. Malone also structured the debt intelligently to prevent defaults in one loan from cascading and causing systemic problems—in technical terms, he avoided cross-collateralization. (Shortform note: Enron’s downfall was caused in large part because of complicated dependencies between their loans. Read our summary of The Smartest Guys in the Room to learn more.)

#### Acquisition Strategy

As described earlier, Malone engaged in acquisitions to fuel the virtuous cycle of subscriber growth, leading to better economic terms with content programmers, leading to further subscriber growth.

Like many outsider CEOs, Malone wasn’t haphazard about acquisitions. He had a clear rule—pay a maximum of five times cash flow, after all the fee discounts and operational efficiencies were realized. **This simple rule let him move quickly when the price was right** , and let him walk away quickly when it exceeded his maximum price.

After the acquisition, like Tom Murphy and Capital Cities, Malone and Sparkman would institute a lean environment and cut all unnecessary expenses. For example, for one cable franchise, TCI cut payroll in half and moved the team from a downtown skyscraper office to a tire warehouse.

#### Unconventional Financial Analysis

Malone believed that the conventional measure of company performance, earnings per share, was a foolish yardstick for the growing cable industry. He saw that higher earnings meant paying more taxes, which would bleed money that could be used to scale a cable company.

Therefore, he ignored EPS, instead focusing on cash flow. In fact, **Malone pioneered the use of EBITDA**(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). At the time, EBITDA was a radically new reflection of a company’s cash flow; today, it’s universal in financial analysis.

#### Limited Capital Expenditures

As a capital allocator, Malone only invested in projects that provided clear and compelling returns. One project that often did not meet this bar was improving cable infrastructure. Capital expenditures would reduce cash flow, and he did not see the return on investment on upgrading to new technology. Knowing that implementing new media technology was costly and difficult, **he preferred to wait for his competitors to scramble over each other and pave the way first** ; then he learned from their mistakes and pursued only the paths proven to be economically viable.

He was not shy about one area of investment—joint ventures. At the time of sale, he had developed 41 partnership interests, many in programmers. Among his competitors, he was unique in recognizing the value of investing in cable entrepreneurs and having a mutually beneficial relationship by providing scale to the burgeoning programmers.

#### Stock Buybacks

Like other outsider CEOs, Malone repurchased a large portion of shares—over 40% of outstanding shares. He took advantage when TCI stock reached especially low multiples. When allocating capital, he would compare the value of buying back stock to making more acquisitions, then make the more profitable transaction.
