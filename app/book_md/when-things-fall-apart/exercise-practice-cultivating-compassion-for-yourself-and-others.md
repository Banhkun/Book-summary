## Exercise: Practice Cultivating Compassion for Yourself and Others

Chödrön teaches that developing an attitude of loving-kindness towards yourself and others is key to navigating painful and challenging circumstances. This exercise walks you through reflections that will help you cultivate compassion.

* * *

Take a moment to think of a challenging situation you're currently facing. Now ask yourself: How do I feel about this situation? Can I recognize the emotions that I have about my circumstances? Write a few sentences about your emotions.

Next, acknowledge the pain or suffering you're experiencing. Can you sit with it and allow yourself to feel it without judgment or resistance? Does allowing the pain or suffering change your experience of it? Write about what it's like to allow pain and suffering to exist.

Visualize yourself offering kindness and support to yourself. What words or actions could you offer yourself to help ease your suffering? Write these down.

Now shift your focus outward by bringing to mind someone you care about who is having a hard time. What is this person experiencing right now? Can you imagine how they might be feeling? Write down your thoughts about what they might be going through.

Lastly, reflect on your own emotions as you contemplate their suffering. What feelings come up as you think about their pain? Can you offer yourself compassion for these feelings? Write down your reflections and anything else that comes up for you.
