## Part 2: The End of Summer

Junior says that most people think the worst thing about being poor is being hungry. He acknowledges that sometimes, he and his family go upwards of 18 hours without eating because they don’t have the money for food. But Junior always knows that eventually, one of his parents will come home with KFC. And KFC tastes even better when you’re hungry.

Junior sometimes wants to blame his parents for their poverty, but he knows he can’t. He knows his family’s poverty is not his parents’ fault, and he knows they dreamed of more. But **no one on the reservation realizes their dreams. They don’t get the chance. They’re too poor.** And that creates a cycle that’s hard to escape.

  * First, you believe you’re poor because you’re stupid.
  * Then, you believe you’re stupid because you’re Indian.
  * Finally, because you’re Indian, you believe you will always be poor, and the cycle repeats itself.



Poverty doesn’t make you strong or perseverant. **Poverty just “teaches you how to be poor.”**

#### Oscar

For Junior, **the worst thing about being poor isn’t hunger. It’s the inability to save his best friend, his dog Oscar.** When Oscar gets sick, Junior begs his mom to take Oscar to the vet, but the family doesn’t have the hundreds of dollars needed for the operation. Junior promises to get a job to pay the vet, but he knows that employment options for Indian boys are few: He’s too young to work at the reservation casino and there aren’t many lawns on the reservation to mow. Helpless, Junior lays next to Oscar for hours, petting him and whispering to him.

When Junior’s dad comes home, he gets out his rifle and bullets and tells Junior to take Oscar outside. At that moment, Junior simultaneously hates and deeply appreciates his father. Junior knows his father doesn’t want Oscar to suffer. Junior sees that his dad is crying, and Junior knows that he can’t blame his father for the poverty that’s forcing them to end Oscar’s life this way. Vet visits are costly, but bullets only cost two cents.

When Junior takes Oscar outside and tells him that he loves him, Oscar seems to understand what’s happening and looks relieved to be put out of his misery. As Junior’s dad prepares the rifle, Junior runs away as fast as he can, but he can’t outrun the speed of sound—so he hears the shot that kills his best friend.

### Junior and Rowdy at the Powwow

After Oscar’s death, Junior wants to disappear into a hole and stay there forever. But Rowdy tells him that no one will notice that he’s gone, so he might as well stay.

Every year over Labor Day weekend, the Spokane Tribe has a powwow. It includes singing and dancing, food, alcohol, gambling, and lots of drunken fighting. Junior doesn’t want to go because the weakest Indians always end up getting beat up, and he knows he’ll be an easy target, but Rowdy says he’ll protect Junior and convinces Junior to go with him.

Once there, Rowdy wants to find some bootleg whisky. On the way, Rowdy trips on a tent pole and smashes into a minivan, injuring his face and shoulder. Junior doesn’t handle the situation well:

**Mistake #1:** Junior laughs. This makes Rowdy mad, and he pushes Junior to the ground. But Rowdy realizes he can’t actually hurt Junior because Junior is his only friend. So instead, he lets Junior go, grabs a shovel, and starts destroying the van, denting doors, knocking off the rearview mirrors, and smashing the windows.

**Mistake #2:** Scared of both Rowdy and the thought of getting caught at the scene of the crime, Junior flees. But he runs right into the Andruss brothers, 30-year-old triplets who have a history of bullying 14-year-old Junior. They form a circle around Junior and push him toward one another, calling him names like “Hydro Head” and “Hydromatic,” uninspired puns based on Junior’s brain disorder, hydrocephalus. Then one of them knees Junior in the testicles.

The Andruss brothers walk away laughing, and Rowdy finds Junior lying in a ball on the ground. After checking to make sure Junior’s head is ok, Rowdy concocts a plan for revenge. He and Junior wait outside the Andruss brothers’ tent until the drunk brothers return at 3 a.m. Rowdy sneaks in and shaves off their eyebrows and cuts off their braids. Cutting off an Indian’s braids is one of the worst things you can do to him because those braids have taken him years to grow. Junior loves Rowdy for doing it, even while feeling guilty about loving him for it.

### Junior’s First Day of High School

Junior loves to learn and is excited about being a freshman at Wellpinit High and finally getting to take geometry. His teacher is Mr. P, a white man who has a reputation for occasionally forgetting to come to class. This happens when he falls asleep in front of the TV at night. In these situations, a student has to go find him in the morning. It’s not unusual for Mr. P to come to school in his pajamas.

All the teachers at Wellpinit live on the reservation, even though they’re white. **Junior divides the teachers into two categories: “liberal, white, vegetarian do-gooders” and “conservative, white missionary saviors.”** They all want to “save” their Indian students, all except Mr. P. He doesn’t seem to fall into either category.

Junior’s so excited about learning geometry that he opens his textbook to kiss it as a sign of devotion to the subject. As he leans in, he sees “Agnes Adams” written on the inside cover. Agnes Adams is Junior’s mom.

With horror, Junior realizes that the book he’s holding is at least thirty years old. To him, the fact that his tribe is so poor that students have to use the same books their parents did is the “saddest thing in the world.” He feels his hopes for the class, and for his life, evaporate.

Without really understanding why, Junior suddenly hurls the textbook across the room, hitting Mr. P in the face and breaking his nose.

Junior is suspended from school. This is the first time he’s ever gotten into trouble in his life. His parents tell him how disappointed in him they are and his grandmother just cries and cries in her rocking chair.

#### Mr. P’s Visit

A week into his suspension, Junior is sitting on his front porch when Mr. P comes to visit. Junior apologizes for breaking his teacher’s nose. To Junior’s surprise, Mr. P says _he’s_ sorry that the school suspended Junior. This makes Junior nervous—Why is Mr. P being so nice to him?

Mr. P tells Junior that even though hitting him with the book is the worst thing Junior has ever done, that he has forgiven Junior. Not only has he forgiven Junior, but he also feels he owes Junior an apology. Mr. P says that when he first started teaching on the reservation, he beat students. This was a common practice. **All the teachers had been taught to “kill the Indian to save the child,” to beat all of the Indian’s culture out of him.** Mr. P says he can’t apologize to all his former students, but he can apologize to Junior.

Then Mr. P tells Junior that he doesn’t want him to turn out like his sister, Mary. Mary was a star, a brilliant writer, who faded gradually until she became practically invisible, a recluse. Mr. P is determined that Junior won’t fade away. He tells Junior he’s the smartest kid in the school and that he deserves better than what the school can give him.

Mr. P tells Junior to say it out loud: “I deserve better.” But Junior can’t say it. How can he say it when he doesn’t believe it? At this point, Junior starts to cry. He’s baffled by this teacher, this white man, who’s telling him that he deserves the world.

Mr. P says he has one more thing to say to Junior, but Junior has to promise not to repeat it to anyone: “You have to leave this reservation.”

Mr. P is suddenly angry. He says that every white person on the reservation deserves to be hit in the face with a book, but that every Indian deserves it, too. **The only thing that white teachers and Indian parents are teaching reservation kids is how to give up.** Now it’s Mr. P who’s crying. He says that Junior threw the book because a small part of him refuses to give up. But if Junior stays on the rez, that part of him, that resilience, will be snuffed out. Mr. P tells Junior to take his hope and find others who have hope. To grow his hope, Junior needs to “multiply hope by hope.” And the further Junior goes from the hopeless reservation, the more hope he’s likely to find.
