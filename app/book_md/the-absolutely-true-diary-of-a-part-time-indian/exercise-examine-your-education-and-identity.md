## Exercise: Examine Your Education and Identity

Junior’s excitement about school is ruined when he realizes that his school’s resources are the same today as they were when his parents went there. He feels like his community has given up on him. Think about your own educational experiences and sacrifices you’ve made to achieve your goals.

* * *

After reading about Junior’s first day at the reservation school, do you see any similarities in your own educational background? Can you identify any aspects of your education that you’ve taken for granted? What are they?

Mr. P tells Junior, “We were supposed to kill the Indian to save the child.” Have you ever felt that you needed to hide, subdue, or “kill” parts of your culture or identity to get ahead in the world or fit in somewhere? What was the situation, and what were the consequences? If you could go back in time, would you do anything differently?
