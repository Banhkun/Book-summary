## Exercise: Reflect on the Themes

Think about the theme of identity in _The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian._

* * *

What was the most important thing Junior learned by the end of his first year at Reardan?

Junior often feels like he’s two different people, and not fully either of them—he’s a part-time white student and a part-time Indian. Have there been times in your life when you felt different parts of your identity conflicting? What parts of your identity were those? How did they conflict?

When feelings of conflicting identities arise in the future, what lessons can you apply from Junior’s epiphany that he is a member of many tribes (the basketball tribe, the cartoonist tribe, and so on)?
