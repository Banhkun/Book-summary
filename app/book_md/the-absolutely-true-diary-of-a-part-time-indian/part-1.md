## Part 1: Welcome to Spokane

14-year-old Junior lives in Wellpinit, Washington, a small town on the Spokane Indian Reservation, known to residents as “the rez.” Junior describes the rez as “located approximately one million miles north of Important and two billion miles west of Happy.” **Reservations like Spokane’s were created in the image of death camps.** Junior speculates that the government hoped Indians would go there, die out, and disappear. But the Spokane tribe didn’t disappear, and now tribe members stay of their own free will. They’re born on the rez and they die on the rez. No one ever leaves.

The rez is characterized by the poverty and alcoholism of its residents. But the rez is also an extended family—everyone knows each other and comes together in times of need.

This doesn’t mean that life on the rez is always peaceful. As happens in communities where everyone knows everyone else’s business, disagreements are frequent, and there are unofficial rules for handling conflict and defending your honor.

### Junior and His Family

#### Junior (Arnold Spirit Jr.)

Narrator Junior was born with too much cerebrospinal fluid in his brain, which he initially describes as a brain drowning in grease. But because this makes his brain sound like a big French fry, he decides it’s more poetic to say that at birth, he had “water on the brain.”

At six months old, Junior had a surgery in which the extra fluid was sucked from his brain. His doctors predicted he’d live as a “vegetable” if he didn’t die during surgery, but he survived with only relatively minor problems relating to his brain damage. These include:

  * Nearsighted vision in one eye and farsighted in the other
  * Seizures
  * A stutter and lisp
  * 42 teeth (most people have 32)
  * A huge skull



The extra teeth cause particular problems. When Junior’s teeth get so crowded he has trouble closing his mouth, he goes to the Indian Health Service. The Indian Health Service only does this kind of work once a year, so Junior has to get all ten extra teeth pulled at once. Further aggravating the situation is the fact that **the white dentist apparently doesn’t think Indians feel as much pain as white people, so he only gives Junior half the Novocain.**

Junior’s large head also causes issues. Bullies on the reservation call him “Globe”: They grab him, spin him around, and put their finger on his head, saying, “I want to go there.” Due to Junior’s physical challenges and speech impediment, people on the reservation regularly beat him up and refer to him as a “retard.”

##### Cartoons

Junior spends most of his time at home drawing cartoons. There are many reasons he loves to draw:

  * Drawing at home is safer than being outside.
  * Drawing is a more dependable and universal language than words. Only certain people understand particular languages like Spanish and Chinese. But everyone understands drawings.
  * Drawing brings Junior hope. While most of the time he feels like a “zero” on the rez, he feels important when he’s drawing. Junior thinks he might be a famous artist one day. **He believes his art could be his ticket to a better life.**



#### Junior’s Mom and Dad

Junior’s mother is an avid reader and can recite entire pages of text verbatim. She dreamed of going to college and might have become a professor.

Junior’s dad dreamed of being a musician. He has an amazing voice and plays the guitar and piano. He still keeps a high-school saxophone that he takes out to shine every once in a while.

But no one believed in their dreams. Junior’s parents come from a long line of poor people, and **like most of the other Indians on the reservation, they couldn’t escape the cycle of poverty.** Both are alcoholics and suffer from depression. When Junior’s dad isn’t out drinking, he sits alone in his bedroom and watches basketball games on TV. But he doesn’t cheer or boo or react much at all to what he’s watching.

Despite their poverty and struggles with depression and alcoholism, Junior’s parents are devoted to their son and encourage him to pursue his dreams, as we’ll see.

#### Mary Runs Away (Junior’s Sister)

Mary’s family calls her Mary Runs Away because she’s so “crazy and random.” Mary’s former teacher, Mr. P, says she’s one of the brightest students he’s ever had. In high school, she dreamed of being a famous romance novelist, but after she graduates she “freezes,” and no one knows why. She doesn’t get a job or go to college. She spends most of her time alone in the family basement. Junior speculates that, like his parents, his sister is depressed.

#### Rowdy

Rowdy is Junior’s best (human) friend. (Junior’s _best_ friend is his dog, Oscar.) Junior considers Rowdy to be the “most important person in [his] life,” even more important than the members of his own family. Rowdy and Junior were born on the same day in the same hospital, and they’ve been friends ever since.

Rowdy is the toughest kid on the reservation. He’ll fight anyone—girl or boy, child or adult, human or dog. He even throws punches at the rain. He got into his first fist fight when he was in kindergarten: A first-grader had thrown a piece of ice during a snowball fight, which made Rowdy mad. He punched the first-grader and two of the first-grader’s friends, and then he punched the teacher who tried to stop the fight.

Rowdy’s father is a mean drunk who beats him and Rowdy’s mother, so they both always have bruised and bloody faces. Rowdy spends most of his time at Junior’s house because it’s a “safe place.” Rowdy loves comic books, and not the “cool” ones. He likes things like _Casper the Friendly Ghost_ , comics meant for younger kids. These are perfect for Rowdy because he has a juvenile sense of humor and he struggles to read on grade level. When Rowdy reads, his tough-guy persona disappears and he becomes childlike, laughing at all the dumb jokes. As does Junior, **Rowdy pretends he lives inside these fictional worlds—they’re far better places to live than his real life.**
