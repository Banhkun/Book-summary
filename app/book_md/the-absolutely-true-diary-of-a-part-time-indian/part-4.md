## Part 4: Late Fall

When Junior gets home the day he contradicts his geology teacher, he finds his mother crying. His sister has gotten married to a Flathead Indian she’s just met at the casino and has moved to Montana. She didn’t tell anyone she was going. She just called her mom from Montana to let her know she was married.

Since 1881, when the Spokane Reservation was founded, no one in Junior’s family has left, and now Junior’s parents have lost both their children to the “outside world.” Junior wonders if they feel like failures.

At first, Junior is worried about his sister. But then he realizes that his sister is trying to live her dreams. She’s living the romance novel she always wanted to write. This is a step up from isolating herself in the basement. The move proves to Junior that **Mary’s spirit hadn’t died. She hasn’t given up.** It’s a big deal for anyone to leave the rez, and Junior is proud of her. He also realizes that he’d shamed her by leaving first. His bravery had inspired hers.

### Junior Gets a Study Buddy

Junior is himself inspired by his sister’s bravery. The next day, he approaches class genius Gordy, who says he’s too busy to talk to Junior because he has to go debug some PCs. Gordy’s mildly irritated because he prefers the “poetic” Mac to the PC. After Junior shrugs and says that “computers are computers,” Gordy sighs and asks if Junior wanted to talk to him or just bore him with tautologies. Junior doesn’t know what tautologies are, but he doesn’t want to let on that he doesn’t know and look like an illiterate Indian. But Gordy quickly gathers that Junior doesn’t know the term and teaches him that it’s a redundancy.

Junior asks if “Gordy is a dick without ears and an ear without a dick” is a tautology. Gordy says no, it’s not, but he thinks it’s funny and tells Junior he has a “singular wit.”

This is the inauspicious start of their friendship. Junior thinks Gordy is weird, but he also thinks he and Gordy have a lot in common. **Junior believes that, just like he is, Gordy is lonely and terrified.** While they don’t become best friends, they start to study together, and Junior finally has an ally at Reardan.

#### The Joy of Learning

One day, Junior is shocked when Gordy tells him that books should give Junior a boner. Not knowing what to make of that, Junior runs with Gordy to the library, where Gordy demands that Junior marvel at all the books.

Junior’s unimpressed. It’s a small library. Gordy confirms that there are exactly 3,412 books (he’s counted), making it a relatively small library. But he points out that you could read one library book a day and it would take almost ten years to read every book in the room. **Even small pockets of the world are full of potential knowledge.**

This makes Junior think of his hometown, Wellpinit, and he realizes that **even the smallest, most seemingly insignificant places are full of mystery.** Junior finally gets Gordy’s point and is in awe, understanding that the more you learn, the more you learn that there’s more to learn. _This_ is the idea that Gordy thinks should give everyone a “metaphorical boner,” his comical term for joy. Gordy teaches Junior that the hard work of learning can be joyous.

### Junior Seeks an Old Friend and Makes a New One

Rowdy usually spends part of Thanksgiving at Junior’s house, but he and Junior still aren’t speaking, and Junior misses him, so he draws a cartoon of the two of them as superheroes. He walks to Rowdy’s house to give him the cartoon and Rowdy’s drunk father opens the door. When Junior hands the dad his cartoon to give to Rowdy, the father looks at the cartoon and says, “You’re kind of gay, aren’t you?” He agrees to give Rowdy the cartoon, even though it’s “a little gay.”

Moments later, Junior looks up at Rowdy’s bedroom window and sees him holding the cartoon. When Junior waves, Rowdy gives him the finger, but Rowdy doesn’t rip up the cartoon, which gives Junior hope that maybe Rowdy still respects him, or at least his art, a little.

#### Penelope

One day, Junior’s bored in class and asks to go to the bathroom. While he’s washing his hands, he hears the sound of someone retching in the girl’s bathroom next door.

He waits outside the bathroom to make sure the student is ok, and Penelope soon walks out chewing cinnamon gum, trying to cover the smell of vomit. When she asks him what he’s looking at, he tells her, “I’m looking at an anorexic.” She corrects him: She’s _bulimic,_ not __ anorexic. There’s a difference. “Anorexics are anorexics all the time,” but bulimics are only bulimic when they’re throwing up.

This reminds Junior of the way his father always insists that he’s only an alcoholic when he’s drunk. **He tells Penelope the same thing he tells his father when his father is drunk: “Don’t give up.”** Junior thinks this advice is kind of corny, but it hits a nerve with Penelope, and she starts to cry. She tells Junior that she’s scared and unhappy but no one allows her to be scared and unhappy because she’s so beautiful and smart. As she tells Junior this, Junior contemplates the size of her ego, but he finds her self-confidence attractive.

After this incident, Junior and Penelope start hanging out and become “friends with potential.” Junior knows that **she’s only “semi-dating” him because she’s tired of being perfect and dating an Indian gives her a blemish, with the added benefit that it pisses off her racist dad.** Junior doesn’t mind that Penelope is using him because, as he sees it, he’s using her, too. Penelope is his way into the social scene at Reardan. Once he starts dating Penelope, he becomes relatively popular.

Penelope and Junior also have things in common: **They’re both dreamers who feel trapped in their small towns.** Penelope’s dream is to study architecture at Stanford; Junior’s dream is to become a famous artist. They both want to create beautiful things, and they bond over that dream.

##### Seeking Advice

Junior doesn’t know how to deal with his feelings for Penelope, so he emails Rowdy, even though he doesn’t expect to hear back. To Junior, Rowdy’s still his best friend, even though Rowdy hates him. Junior tells Rowdy he’s in love with a girl who’s white and doesn’t know what to do. Rowdy responds a few minutes later, telling Junior **he’s just another Indian “treating white women like bowling trophies.”**

Junior doesn’t find this advice helpful, so he turns to Gordy, asking how to make a white girl love him. Being Gordy, he decides to do some research. Days later, Gordy delivers his report: He has found an article on a young white woman whose disappearance in Mexico generated a lot of media attention. The same article points out that hundreds of Mexican girls have disappeared from the same area, but people don’t really pay attention to those disappearances. The general population cares more about white girls than any other group of people.

Junior doesn’t get how any of this applies to him. Gordy clarifies, bluntly telling Junior that it means he’s a “racist asshole like everybody else,” essentially what Rowdy said.

#### The Winter Formal

Junior continues to feel like a stranger no matter where he is: In Wellpinit, he feels half white; in Reardan, he feels half Indian. At school, he doesn’t correct classmates who assume that he’s rich because there’s a casino on the Spokane reservation. He uses the fact that **all white people think Indians get free money from the government** to hide his poverty.

Junior worries his charade will be exposed when he takes Penelope to the Winter Formal. He knows that his $5 won’t pay for much during the night, but he also knows that if he doesn’t take Penelope to the dance, someone else will. So he decides to wing it.

Because he doesn’t own a suit, Junior wears one of his dad’s polyester, bell-bottomed suits from the 70s. He expects his classmates to make fun of him, but Penelope makes sure to loudly compliment his “retroactive” suit as soon as he walks into the dance, and suddenly, disco is cool at Reardan.

##### Pancakes with the Popular Kids

As the end of the night nears, Junior thinks he has successfully hidden his poverty, but then Roger, the big guy he punched, and some other popular students decide it would be the coolest thing in the world to drive to a Spokane diner for pancakes. Because Penelope is popular, she and Junior get an invite as well, even though they’re only freshmen.

Junior can’t pay for pancakes. But knowing that the jig is almost up, he throws caution to the wind and orders not only pancakes for himself and Penelope, but also toast, fries, orange juice, hot chocolate, and coffee.

Terrified at the prospect of being exposed, Junior feels sick and goes to the restrooms half-way through the meal. Roger comes in and hears Junior retching. Junior tells him that he’s feeling sick because he forgot his wallet at home and can’t pay for the meal. Roger tells him he should have said something sooner and lends him $40. Junior is grateful, and **he can’t imagine what it must be like to be able to casually hand over that much money to a near-stranger.**

At 3 a.m., Roger drives Junior and Penelope back to the school. Junior tells them his dad is on his way to pick him up, which is clearly not true. Junior and Penelope step out of the car for a private moment and Penelope tells Junior she knows Roger lent him money. She aks Junior if he’s poor. Junior’s tired of lying and tells her that yes, he’s poor. In response, Penelope kisses him on the cheek. She then asks if his dad is really coming to pick him up. At first, Junior insists that he is, but finally admits that he usually walks home or hitchhikes. The thought of Junior walking home makes Penelope cry, and before Junior can stop her, she asks Roger to drive Junior home. This is the first of many nights that Roger will drive Junior home from school.

**Junior realizes that while he’s been preoccupied with Penelope’s looks, she’s actually been concerned about him.** This realization makes him feel shallow. Junior sees that when you’re honest with people, those people can turn out to be pretty incredible.

Not long after, Junior’s sister Mary writes to him to tell him that she and her husband have moved into a trailer, the most beautiful home ever. She still can’t get a job because she lacks experience, but she’s started to write a memoir. Mary is happy for the first time in a long time. **Her memoir is about the nature of hope. She’s thinking of calling it “How to Run Away From Your House and Find Your Home.”**
