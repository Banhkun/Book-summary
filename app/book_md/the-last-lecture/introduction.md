## Introduction

When computer science professor Randy Pausch was invited to deliver a “Last Lecture” at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in September 2007, he’d been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Last Lecture was a Carnegie Mellon speaker series in which professors were invited to present their philosophy of life, imagining the lecture was their last chance to share personal and professional life lessons.

In Pausch’s case, it really _was_ a last chance to impart life lessons—he’d been given just months to live. But more importantly, he viewed the lecture as his legacy for his three young children, who would grow up without him there to guide them.

**Pausch’s lecture, titled “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” quickly went viral and was viewed by millions around the world** (https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/). With the help of Wall Street Journal reporter Jeffrey Zaslow, he expanded it into a best-selling book, _The Last Lecture_ , before he died 11 months later.

Pausch begins his book by characterizing his terminal illness dispassionately, as “an engineering problem” to be described, analyzed, and tackled. But an emotional undercurrent also runs through the book—his desire to leave his wife and children with an abiding sense of his love for them, and his love of life, after he’s gone.

Like an engineer, he clearly describes his problem—10 tumors in his liver—then moves on to **his “solution”—to use every moment he has left as productively as possible.** He has too little time to waste any of it feeling sorry for himself. He has no choice but to play the cards he’s been dealt.

Pausch’s plan is to spend every possible moment with his family, to help smooth their transition to a life without him, and to encapsulate in his Last Lecture the joy of life and his appreciation of it. He describes it as trying to put himself into a bottle that would wash up on the beach years later for his children, then aged 5, 2, and 1.

A videotaped lecture can’t replace 20 years of parenting. But the purpose of engineering isn’t to find a perfect solution—it’s to do your best with the limited resources you have, and that’s what Pausch resolves to do.

(Shortform note: This summary combines the introductory and biographical information in Parts 1 and 2 of the book. Parts 3-6 focus on the content of Pausch’s lecture plus similar material that was added in his book.)
