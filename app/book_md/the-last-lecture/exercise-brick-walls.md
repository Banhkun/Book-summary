## Exercise: Brick Walls

Pausch liked to tell his students that when you run into brick walls, they’re an opportunity for you to demonstrate how badly you want something.

* * *

Think of a time when something threatened to prevent you from getting what you wanted. What did you want and what was the obstacle?

What was your first reaction? Did you question whether you really wanted it or start thinking of ways around the obstacle? What did you end up doing?

What’s another brick wall you currently face? What action will you take and why?
