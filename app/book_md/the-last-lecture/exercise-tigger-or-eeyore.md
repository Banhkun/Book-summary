## Exercise: Tigger or Eeyore?

Pausch urged his audience to choose which _Winnie the Pooh_ character they wanted to beâ€”the exuberant Tigger or gloomy Eeyore.

Are you mostly a Tigger or an Eeyore? Why do you say that?

How has a Tigger or Eeyore outlook affected your life? Give an example.

Think of a situation in your life that you approached with an Eeyore-like attitude. How would approaching it as a Tigger have been different?
