## Exercise: Adjust Your Thought Pattern

Now that you’re familiar with Seligman’s concepts of pessimism and optimism, take some time to think about which way your own thoughts tend to go. Also, consider how you might develop a stronger sense of balanced optimism. You can repeat this exercise as often as needed, and you might find it especially useful after a difficult or upsetting event.

* * *

Describe something negative that has recently happened to you. Explain why you think things turned out the way they did.

What makes this explanation either optimistic or pessimistic? For example, does the explanation rely on some perceived shortcoming or mistake of yours (pessimism)? Does the explanation suggest that the problem is temporary, or that you’ll do better next time (optimism)?

How could you explain this event in a way that balances optimism with realism? (Note: On rare occasions, there may not be an optimistic explanation for something. However, even in those cases, keeping a mindset of realism rather than pessimism will help you to stay in control and respond appropriately.)
