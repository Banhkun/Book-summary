## Exercise: Reflect on Your Investing Habits

Marks contends that the key to successful investing is value investing, which involves finding disparities between securities’ prices and their intrinsic value. In this exercise, reflect on your own experience and consider ways that you could integrate Marks’s recommendations going forward.

* * *

Write down the securities that you’ve invested in, and pick a handful of them. What reasons led you to invest in these securities?

In hindsight, to what extent do you think your decision to invest in these securities was well-founded? For example, were there any obvious mistakes in your reasoning?

How could you have used Marks’s recommended approach to investing to inform your decision to invest in these securities?

In the future, do you think you’ll try to use lessons from value investing (like creating a margin of safety) when you invest? Why or why not?
