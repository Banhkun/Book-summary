## Exercise: Assess Speculation in Different Asset Classes

Shiller suggests that speculation has influenced pricing in several different asset classes, namely stocks, bonds, and housing. In this exercise, evaluate Shiller’s arguments and reflect on speculative bubbles in your own country.

* * *

Of the three asset classes that Shiller discusses (stocks, bonds, and housing), which do you think is most clearly susceptible to speculation at the moment? Why?

Of these same asset classes, which do you think is _least_ susceptible to speculation? Why?

To what extent are you worried about speculative bubbles in your own country’s financial markets? Explain your answer.
