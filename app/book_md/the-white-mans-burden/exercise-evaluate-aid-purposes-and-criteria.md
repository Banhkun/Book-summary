## Exercise: Evaluate Aid Purposes and Criteria

Explore how and why international aid should be distributed.

* * *

What do you see as the appropriate rationale for providing international aid? Should the reasons be moral, pragmatic, or strategic?

How would you prioritize providing aid (what criteria would you use)? What, if anything, would you want to see in return?

Do you think governments should refuse disaster or humanitarian aid to other governments deemed to be authoritarian or corrupt? Explain why or why not.
