## Exercise: Explore Free-Market Reforms

Explore how free markets come into play in global development.

* * *

Do you think free markets are a force for good that enhances personal and economic freedom, or do you think they exploit societyâ€™s most disadvantaged people? Why?

Do you think entrepreneurship generally helps or hurts people in developing countries? Why or why not?

What baseline conditions do you think a society needs to meet in order to have a functioning free-market economy? Do you think these conditions can be created from the outside or do they need to arise organically within a society?
