## Exercise: Embark on a Challenging Adventure

To overcome limiting comforts in your life and discover more of your potential, Easter says it’s valuable to challenge yourself with an adventure that tests your mental and physical capabilities. To do this effectively, he says it’s important to make your challenge _truly_ difficult and to ensure your goal is to improve yourself rather than to seek attention or to compete with someone else.

* * *

Describe a time you intentionally challenged yourself and came away from the experience disappointed or unsatisfied. Was the challenge too difficult or too easy, or were the results different than you expected?

If you could redo this challenge, what would you change? For example, would you adjust your expectations, your preparation, or your measures of success?

Think about a new way you could challenge yourself that would be unique to you rather than competing with someone else. Write about how you could push yourself in this challenge so that you have roughly a 50% chance of succeeding.

To help align your goal with personal growth, write about why you’d like to challenge yourself and what pushing yourself in this challenge would mean to you. Keep in mind that a good challenge pushes you, but it doesn’t require that you cross a finish line.
