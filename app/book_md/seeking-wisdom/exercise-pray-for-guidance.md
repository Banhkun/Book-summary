## Exercise: Pray for Guidance

Cameron explains that writing a question down and then writing whatever response comes to mind is one of the most effective strategies she uses to receive God’s guidance. Use this technique to ask your God for help with something that you’re struggling with in your life.

* * *

Think about something you need guidance on in your life—for example, you can ask what to do about a certain relationship, whether you should give up on a project you’re working on, or what you should work on next. Write your question below.

Now read your question back to yourself and write whatever advice or solution comes to your head.

Read your responses to the previous question. In the box below, make a list of anything that doesn’t sound right or that you still have questions about. Once your list is complete, take each question to a new page and follow the same process of writing whatever answers come to mind.
