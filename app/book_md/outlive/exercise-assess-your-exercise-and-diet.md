## Exercise: Assess Your Exercise and Diet

Healthy exercise and nutritional habits are two foundational components of a healthy, longevity-focused lifestyle. Assess your current fitness routine and diet and brainstorm how you could improve them.

* * *

Describe your current exercise routine. As an estimate, how many hours a week do you exercise? How much of that time do you spend training Zone 2 endurance, VO2 max, and muscle strength? For example, you may play ultimate frisbee for 90 minutes once a week (Zone 2, some VO2 max) and lift weights at the gym for 45 minutes twice a week (muscle strength).

What’s one change you could make to improve your exercise routine? Recall that Attia recommends three hours a week of endurance training, one session of VO2 max training a week (around 45 minutes), and enough strength training to consistently gain and maintain muscle. (For example, you could supplement your ultimate frisbee with 30-minute jogs three days a week and intentionally run sprints while playing ultimate frisbee.)

Describe your current diet—what meals do you eat on a typical day? Estimating roughly, would you say you eat too many or too few carbohydrates, proteins, and fats? (For example, you may typically eat a bowl of cereal in the morning, a sub sandwich for lunch, and a cream-based pasta for dinner. If so, you could presume that you eat too many carbohydrates, not enough protein, and a healthy amount of fats.)

What’s one change you could make to improve your diet? (For example, you could replace your carb-heavy breakfast cereal with a protein-heavy omelet and some Greek yogurt.)
