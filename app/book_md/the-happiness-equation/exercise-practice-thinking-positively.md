## Exercise: Practice Thinking Positively

Pasricha claims that you can train yourself to think more positive thoughts by regularly practicing six methods: get active, do good deeds, switch off, engage fully, practice meditation, and be thankful. Letâ€™s explore how you can incorporate these methods into your daily routine.

* * *

Do you already practice any of these methods? Describe how they show up in your daily life.

Of the methods you have yet to adopt, which do you think will be the easiest to fit into your current routine? Explain why.

Which methods do you think will be most difficult to fit into your current routine? Explain why.

Write down two or three ways to adapt your routine so that you can regularly practice all seven methods. (For example, you might get active by adapting your daily commute so that you walk part of the way, and you might set your alarm to wake you up 15 minutes earlier to give you time to write about your gratitude while you have your coffee.)
