## Exercise: Hone Your Negotiation Skills

Negotiation experts agree that you should prepare for your negotiation, understand what motivates your counterpart, and plan your moves and countermoves ahead of time. Consider how you can apply these ideas the next time you sit down to negotiate.

* * *

Do you think negotiations are determined more by the emotional needs of the parties involved, or are they determined more by rational tradeoffs and objective measures? Explain how your answer might affect the negotiation tactics you use.

What was the most recent situation where you had to negotiate with someone? Describe the situation. What were you looking to get from your counterpart? What did they want to get from you?

In this negotiation, what were the minimum conditions you needed the other person to meet to accept an agreement? Did you have a best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA)? If so, describe what it was and how you determined it.
