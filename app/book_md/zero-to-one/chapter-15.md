## Chapter 15: Four Views of the Future

In the concluding chapter to his book, Thiel contrasts four general views of the future of technological progress, which he attributes to Oxford processor Nick Bostrom:

  1. **The cyclical perspective:** Technology will progress to some maximum threshold and then crash. After the crash, people will gradually rebuild and technology will advance again, eventually achieving about the same maximum level before it crashes again. The cycle will repeat itself indefinitely, with human technology oscillating between minimum and maximum values. Thiel acknowledges that many ancient civilizations held this perspective, but in the modern world he cannot conceive of any type of disaster that could realistically send all of humanity back to the Stone Age without bringing about human extinction.
  2. **The doomsday perspective** : Technology and human civilization will progress up to some maximum point and then crash, resulting in the annihilation of humankind. Thiel acknowledges that this is a possibility.
  3. **The convergence perspective:** Technology will progress up to a certain point and then remain relatively static. Soon the “developing nations” will catch up to the West in terms of their technological development. Technology and society around the world will become increasingly homogenous. Thiel sees this as the prevailing view in the modern world, but he argues that it isn’t actually possible due to scarcity of resources.
  4. **The acceleration perspective:** Technological progress will continue to accelerate, making the future different and better in ways that are currently beyond our ability to imagine. Some people believe that this acceleration of technological progress is inevitable. Thiel contends that this is the future we need to pursue, but it won’t happen on its own. Instead, we need to actively pursue technological development and search for new breakthroughs that can unlock a better future. Because **if we don’t make new breakthroughs that create new resources, competition for existing resources will lead to conflict and ultimately extinction.** This is why Thiel believes it’s so important to create new technology.
