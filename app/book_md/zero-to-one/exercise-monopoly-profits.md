## Exercise: Monopoly Profits

How your company chooses and expands its markets is critical to its success. You should target a small niche that you can dominate, then slowly expand to related markets and eventually larger markets while maintaining monopoly control.

* * *

Think about your business or a potential future business. How would you define the market (target customer and size, other potential players)? How could you check to make sure that your intended market actually exists?

Does/will your company dominate your defined market? How do you measure market dominance?

What is your next logical step for expanding your market from a small niche to something related?

What would it take for your company to be the last mover (to make the last spectacular improvement that ensures years of monopoly profits) in your ultimate market?

Thiel argues that a 10x better product is necessary to building a monopoly. Is your product 10x better? If not, what could possibly make it 10x better?
