## Exercise: Your Distribution Plan

Some entrepreneurs develop a great product but fail to plan for its distribution, or the process for selling the product (advertising, sales, marketing, and distribution). But customers arenâ€™t going to buy it automatically. Distribution should be part of your product design.

* * *

Think of a product you currently sell or a potential product. What are your current or planned methods for marketing/selling it?

How did you decide your sales methods? How do they target your most valuable customers?

How do you measure your sales effectiveness? How could you make your methods more effective?
