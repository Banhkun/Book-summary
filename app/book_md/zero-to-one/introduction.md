## Introduction

(Shortform note: While our guide sticks to the general structure of Thiel’s book, we’ve made a few adjustments: We’ve grouped Chapters 9 and 10 together because they discuss similar ideas, and we’ve switched the order of Chapters 12 and 13 so as to present Thiel’s ideas in a more streamlined manner.)

Some animals have a drive to build things like dams, but only humans have the ability to invent entirely new things. In _Zero to One_ , PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel contends that **creating new things is the best way to profit economically, as well as the only path of human progress.**

This book, written with Blake Masters, is about launching companies that create new things. It stems from a course Thiel taught at Stanford in 2012 on startups. Masters was a student in the class and his notes, which were widely shared online, evolved with Thiel’s collaboration into this book.

The ideas are drawn from Thiel’s experience as a tech entrepreneur and investor, but they don’t comprise a formula for success—no one can tell you how to be innovative, because every innovation is by definition new and unique. However, the key to success is to look for value where no one else is looking.

Thiel refers to developing new technologies as “going from zero to one,” because there are zero units of a product until you create the first one. He contrasts going from zero to one with going from “one to n,” by which he means making more of something that already exists.

In Thiel’s view,**technology has stagnated today**. Much of what companies produce today simply replicates what they produced yesterday or, at best, improves upon it incrementally. This is because it’s easier to replicate existing designs than to create new and fundamentally superior ones.

In business, each jump from 0 to 1 happens only once. The next Bill Gates won’t invent an operating system; the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t build a social network. The next innovator of the same caliber will build something unimagined to this point. Successful people don’t look for formulas or choose from existing options, they “rewrite the plan of the world.”

**Unless companies create new things, they’ll eventually fail, regardless of how profitable they are today.** There’s a limit to what we can gain by refining things, a point at which best practices won’t get us any further. We need to open new paths.

We need miracles, which only technology can produce. Technology enables us to do more and keep pushing the envelope of our capability.
