## 1-Page Summary

It’s a simple fact that life’s full of problems and challenges that you’d rather not face. If you’re like most people, you probably assume that you’re _supposed_ to feel emotional pain when things don’t go the way you want—and that it’s not possible to feel positive emotions unless your experiences improve.

But what if there’s a way to feel positive no matter what happens in your life? In _Loving What Is_ , best-selling author and spiritual teacher Byron Katie argues that life experiences don’t cause emotional pain. Rather, **only resistant thoughts that judge these experiences as somehow _wrong_ or _unwanted_ cause emotional pain**. Therefore, the only way to achieve inner peace is to release resistant thoughts and accept each moment that occurs.

(Shortform note: Psychologists and self-help practitioners commonly refer to the types of resistant thoughts Katie explores throughout the book as “negative thoughts.” We’ve chosen to use the term “resistant thoughts” so as to underscore how these thoughts oppose and actively work against the practice of _acceptance_.)

This guide discusses Katie’s advice for accepting life and achieving inner peace in two parts. In the first part, we’ll explain her argument that all negative emotions spring from resistant thoughts about life experiences. In the second part, we’ll present Katie’s step-by-step method for releasing resistant thoughts about any unwanted situations in your life.

> **Schools of Thought on Acceptance Versus Resistance**
> 
> Many different philosophical traditions mirror Katie’s view that the key to maintaining inner peace is to accept life as it occurs instead of resisting it. However, they all offer different reasons for acceptance:
> 
>   * Stoicism argues that your experiences are what the gods and nature have decreed for you. Since a human can’t hope to resist the will of the gods, it’s better to just accept whatever happens. Marcus Aurelius discusses the central tenets of Stoicism in _Meditations_.
> 
>   * Hinduism says that everything you perceive and experience is illusory and that God is the only true reality. Since your experiences are unreal and temporary, you mustn’t let yourself be affected by them. Eknath Easwaran clarifies the relationship between illusion and reality in his translation of _The Bhagavad Gita_
> 
>   * Buddhism teaches that you should welcome your experiences, but not let them rule you. In other words, your experiences shouldn’t affect your thoughts or your actions. Tara Brach explores this topic from a Buddhist perspective in _Radical Acceptance._
> 
>   * Less religious schools of thought talk about the benefits of “living in the moment,” or being fully present instead of lost in thought. For example, Eckhart Tolle’s _The Power of Now _teaches that being fully present in each moment is the _only_ way to find happiness, peace, and fulfillment in your life.

### Part 1: Inner Peace Comes From Accepting That Life Is Inherently Perfect

Katie argues that you have no _real_ reason to feel emotional pain. She explains that every moment that occurs is inherently good—**there is no such thing as a bad experience**. Her reasoning for this is as follows: Only things that are _meant_ to happen happen. And, anything that’s meant to happen is _good_. Therefore, everything that happens is good.

Understanding this concept allows you to accept and feel at peace with every moment that occurs, regardless of what happens.

> **Humans Turn to Benevolent Higher Powers to Control the Uncontrollable**
> 
> While Katie doesn’t claim to have a religious background, her claim that everything that happens is good builds from her logic that whatever happens is God’s will, and that God’s will is inherently good. This line of thinking stems from a long history of putting circumstances “in a higher power’s hands” as a way of making sense of and accepting them.
> 
> Yuval Noah Harari (_Sapiens_) explains that the idea of a benevolent God originally arose from the human need to rationalize uncontrollable events and feel in control of our circumstances. To avoid facing the frightening idea that terrible experiences—for example, droughts and epidemics—occur for no reason, humans created gods with distinct personalities and assigned them the power to control the things humans couldn’t. Having gods in control of events meant that humans could rationalize why terrible things happened and have somewhere specific to place blame. For example, “This happened because the gods were angry with us.”
> 
> Harari argues that even though humans assigned these gods control over what happened, they still believed that they could exert their own personal control over events by appealing to the will of these gods. For example, they prayed, provided offerings, or made sacrifices in an attempt to negotiate their fates.

#### Inner Turmoil Comes From Wanting Life to Be Different From What It Is

Since every experience is inherently good, why is it that certain experiences make us feel negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, or anger? According to Katie, it’s not the experiences that make you feel pain. Rather, **all your negative emotions spring from resistant thoughts that judge these experiences as _wrong_ or _unwanted_**.

These resistant thoughts distort the truth of reality (that it is inherently perfect) by preventing you from seeing the good in your experiences. The more resistant thoughts you think about your experiences, the more you fail to see what’s good about them. As a result, you easily find even _more_ reasons to feel unhappy about your experiences—and this is why you feel negative emotions.

(Shortform note: If resistant thoughts make us feel so bad, _why_ do we continue to think them? Neil Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_) explains that it’s a result of evolution: To ensure survival, your ancestors had to constantly stay alert to danger. Letting their guard down made them vulnerable to predators and competitors. Though you don’t face the same risks now, your instinct to avoid danger hasn’t evolved. However, instead of protecting you from threats to your survival, this instinct now encourages you to focus on “threats” such as what you don’t have and what needs to improve.)

Examples of resistant thoughts include blaming others for not behaving in ways that you believe they should, complaining about things because you think they should be different, and worrying about all of the bad things that might happen.

(Shortform note: The tendencies that Katie refers to as examples of “resistance” can sometimes underpin a victim mentality—the belief that bad things always happen to you through no fault of your own. This victim mentality creates feelings of apathy because when you feel like external, uncontrollable factors are always trying to thwart you, you feel powerless and lack the motivation to make the best out of your situation.)

Katie clarifies why resistant thoughts lie at the root of all negative emotions by explaining how they:

  1. Cause you to misinterpret reality
  2. Convince you that reality must change before you can accept it



Let’s explore these two effects in detail.

##### Effect #1: Resistant Thoughts Cause You to Misinterpret Reality

Katie argues that **resistant thoughts keep you mired in a world of possibilities that _don’t_ exist**: Instead of focusing your mind on what has happened or is happening, they focus your mind on what should have happened, could have happened, or might happen.

**These thoughts keep you locked in an _imaginary_ narrative that has nothing to do with reality.** As a result, they cloud your judgment and prevent you from clearly perceiving, interpreting, and responding to the situation as it is.

According to Katie, the more you let your internal narrative blind you, the more you misperceive and misinterpret reality as bad. This causes you to engage in emotional reactions and behaviors that exacerbate your negative feelings and prolong your emotional pain.

**Example:** It’s your birthday and your partner hasn’t yet mentioned it. You _assume_ that she’s forgotten about you, and this upsets you. Since you’re upset, you can’t think clearly about how much she cares about you—instead, you focus on all the ways she neglects your needs. This exacerbates your negative feelings and causes you to emotionally withdraw from her. As it turns out, your partner didn’t mention your birthday because she’s planning a surprise for you—which means you don’t have a real reason to feel pained by the experience. **Only your misinterpretation of her behavior, coupled with your negative internal narrative, creates and prolongs your pain.**

(Shortform note: Katie argues that resistant thoughts provide your brain with false evidence that reality is bad, trapping you in a negative mindset that prolongs your emotional pain. Psychologists explain that**the tendency to dwell on negative interpretations of reality comes from thenegativity bias**. This bias causes _apparently_ negative experiences to have a greater emotional impact on you than positive ones. Consequently, you’re likely to notice, react to, and remember criticism more than praise, sad memories more than happy memories, bad news more than good news, your mistakes more than your successes, and negative traits in others more than their positive traits.)

##### Effect #2: Resistant Thoughts Convince You That Reality Must Change Before You Can Accept It

Katie explains that while resistant thoughts distort the truth of reality and are therefore the cause of your emotional pain, you often don’t realize this—**because those very same resistant thoughts convince you that something _external_ is to blame for your emotional discomfort**. So, to seek relief from your emotional discomfort, you attempt to exert control over and change things you _can’t_ control, such as other people or external circumstances.

(Shortform note: Research on the topic of cognitive distortions supports Katie’s argument that resistant thoughts compel you to try and change external circumstances. Cognitive distortions are irrational thought patterns that manifest as negative emotions and irrational behavior. They’re more likely to occur when you habitually think negative, resistant thoughts—because continually interpreting life negatively **wires your brain to _always_ respond negatively to your experiences**. As Katie says, due to a lack of self-awareness, many people don’t recognize when they’re engaged in irrational thinking and mistakenly assume that external causes are to blame both for their emotional states and their resulting actions.)

However, she argues, it’s impossible to control anything that’s outside of yourself—**the people and situations in your life are _never_ going to change no matter how many resistant thoughts you think about them**. Attempting to do so just fuels additional resistant thoughts (for example, “I hate this because it _should_ be different!”) that prevent you from accepting and making the best of your circumstances.

**Example:** Each time your roommate leaves dirty dishes in the sink you get angry and snap at him. You believe that he’s to blame for your anger and that he must change his behavior so that you can feel better. However, no matter how angry you feel, or how often you lash out at him, he continues to leave dirty dishes in the sink. Because you don’t see the truth—that only your resistant thoughts about the dishes in the sink make you angry—you allow your negative emotions to escalate and fail to find peace with the situation.

(Shortform note: While Katie argues that it’s not possible to control external circumstances, and that attempting to do so fuels emotional discomfort, “law of attraction” practitioners disagree. They argue that **your thoughts _create_ your external circumstances**, and that you can control your experiences by aligning your thoughts with what you want. In this way, you can manifest the reality you desire—not by negatively thinking about your circumstances, but by imagining more ideal circumstances. For example, focusing on what you want—your roommate to clean up after himself—will _influence_ him to behave the way you want. As a result, this situation will no longer upset you.)

### Part 2: A Step-by-Step Process to Release Resistant Thoughts

We’ve just explained Katie’s argument that all negative emotions spring from resistant thoughts about experiences, not from the experiences themselves. It follows then that the only way to accept and feel at peace with your experiences is to release the resistant thoughts you have about those experiences.

(Shortform note: Throughout her book, Katie argues that you need to experience peace _internally_ before you can feel positive about what happens _externally_. _The Happiness Advantage_ clarifies the science underlying Katie’s argument: According to research in neuroscience and positive psychology, **happiness isn’t the _result_ of a positive situation, but the _cause_ of it**. When you choose to cultivate the habit of thinking positive, nonresistant thoughts, you train your brain to find opportunities in adversity and overcome challenges and setbacks. This creates positive momentum in your life and fuels further opportunities to feel happy.)

But, how can you release resistant thoughts, especially when there’s a situation in your life that you find difficult to accept or feel good about? Katie suggests that you can achieve this by practicing a three-part process:

  1. Write down your thoughts about the situation.
  2. Ask yourself four particular questions to explore your thoughts.
  3. Reframe your thoughts until you feel at peace with the situation.



Let’s explore each of these steps in more detail.

#### Step #1: Write Down Your Thoughts About Your Situation

**The first step toward achieving inner peace involves writing down resistant thoughts about a specific situation.** Katie claims that you’ll have more success with her three-step process if you write down your thoughts, rather than if you try to list them mentally.

This is because your mind doesn’t like change: Once you’ve made a habit of thinking resistant thoughts, your mind becomes so attached to them that it doesn’t want to let go of your negative perspective. To protect this perspective, your mind releases a stream of unfocused defensive thoughts to interrupt any attempts you make to change your feelings. It does this to convince you that you’re _right_ to hold onto your resistant thoughts and the emotional pain that they incur.

On the other hand, Katie claims, **writing down your thoughts will focus your mind** only on what you’ve written and reduce these mental interruptions.

To complete this first step, she suggests that you think about something in your life that you’re unhappy about. This might be related to something that’s happening in your life now, a memory from the past, or a worry about the future. Then, **write short simple sentences to honestly express how you feel about the situation**.

**Example #1:** “My children never help with the chores because they don’t respect me.”

**Example #2:** “I never have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure.”

> **Writing Your Thoughts Down Calms Negative Self-Judgment**
> 
> Research expands on how writing your thoughts down reduces mental interruptions that get in the way of acceptance.
> 
> According to clinical psychologists, it’s difficult to disentangle yourself from negative thoughts because **negativity influences you to _think judgmentally about your negative thoughts_**. This adds an additional layer of distress to your _original_ negative thought and makes you feel powerless to change your thinking.
> 
> For example, if you feel resentful toward your children, you’ll then berate yourself for this feeling and think that you _should_ be more loving. This judgment disempowers you because it makes you feel like you’re flawed in some way, and it increases your emotional distress—creating emotional turbulence that prevents you from considering other ways to think about your situation.
> 
> However, as Katie says, writing your thoughts down focuses your mind and prevents you from falling into the trap of self-judgment. This is because the act of expressing yourself through writing helps you vent both conscious and unconscious negative feelings about a situation. Because you’re releasing your negative emotions, you’re less likely to get caught up in them. As a result, you’re more able to _objectively_ explore, clarify, and question the validity of your thoughts and feelings.

#### Step #2: Ask Yourself Four Questions

Once you’ve expressed your thoughts in writing, **analyze each of your statements by asking yourself four questions** :

  1. Is this an absolute truth that I cannot disprove? 
  2. How do I feel and behave when I think this thought?
  3. How does this thought benefit me?
  4. How would I feel and behave without this thought?



Let’s explore the purpose of each of these four questions.

##### Question #1: Is This an Absolute Truth That I Cannot Disprove?

The purpose of the first question, “Is this an absolute truth that I cannot disprove?” is to **search through your memories for at least one piece of evidence that _disclaims_ your statement, revealing it as untrue**. According to Katie, your answer should be a simple “yes” or “no.”

**Example #1:** If you remember at least _one_ time that your children helped you with the chores or showed you respect, the statement, “My children _never_ help with the chores because _they don’t respect me_ ,” reveals itself as untrue. Therefore, the answer is “no.”

**Example #2:** If you remember at least one time you had enough money or felt successful, the statement, “I _never_ have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure,” reveals itself as untrue. Therefore, the answer is “no.”

(Shortform note: Dale Carnegie (_How To Stop Worrying and Start Living_) provides advice on finding evidence to disprove your statement: Gather all the facts about your situation, not just those that confirm your thinking. He explains that it’s often tempting to only seek out and use information that validates your assumptions, but this prevents you from seeing the situation from all sides and leads to uninformed conclusions. On the other hand, gathering all the information allows you to consider the situation objectively and helps you face your thoughts constructively. To encourage objectivity, Carnegie suggests pretending you’re gathering facts for a friend or to argue a case in court.)

##### Question #2: How Do I Feel and Behave When I Think This Thought?

The purpose of the second question, “How do I feel and behave when I think this thought?” is to **list all of the consequences of thinking this thought**. This will help you become more conscious of how your thoughts affect your emotions and behaviors. Katie suggests that you consider how thinking this thought influences:

  * Your subsequent thoughts and feelings
  * How you speak to and behave toward others or react to your circumstances



**Example #1:** When you think, “My children never help with the chores because they don’t respect me,” you can’t help but think about additional ways your children make your life difficult. This makes you feel resentful and victimized. When you feel like this, your interactions with your children swing between emotional withdrawal and lashing out in anger.

**Example #2:** When you think, “I never have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure,” your thoughts focus on all of the things you want but can’t have, or on how other people seem to effortlessly get what they want. This makes you feel like your life’s cruel and unfair—and these feelings make you believe that you’re powerless to improve your situation. As a result, you don’t feel motivated enough to take constructive actions, such as creating a budget or opening a savings account, and you let your financial situation devolve.

(Shortform note: If acknowledging the consequences of resistant thoughts inspires self-criticism, remember that the goal of this step isn’t to judge or berate yourself for engaging in negative behaviors, but to increase awareness of how your thoughts influence you. To overcome any self-critical thoughts, focus on self-compassion during this step. For example, you might consciously forgive yourself for any behaviors that inspire feelings of shame or guilt. By shifting your focus from criticism to kindness, you’ll be better able to understand the consequences of your thoughts without falling into the trap of self-defeating thoughts.)

##### Question #3: How Does This Thought Benefit Me?

The purpose of the third question, “How does this thought benefit me?” is to **reveal that there is no benefit to thinking resistant thoughts**. Katie suggests that you consider whether thinking this thought inspires any positive feelings or behaviors that improve your life.

**Example #1:** The thought, “My children never help with the chores because they don’t respect me,” doesn’t inspire any positive feelings or behaviors that improve your life. Therefore, thinking this thought doesn’t benefit you.

**Example #2:** The thought, “I never have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure,” doesn’t inspire any positive feelings or behaviors that improve your life. Therefore, thinking this thought doesn’t benefit you.

> **Negative Thoughts Can Help You Approach Life More Positively**
> 
> Katie’s argument that resistant thoughts offer no benefit is based on the assumption that these thoughts _cannot_ improve your life. However, psychologists suggest that if you can view these types of thoughts objectively—as Katie’s four questions will help you do—negative thoughts can actually _help you_ approach life more positively.
> 
> According to research, you need negative thoughts and feelings because, without them, you wouldn’t be able to distinguish between your experiences and recognize what satisfies you. Additionally, psychologists claim that negative thoughts and feelings benefit you in five ways:
> 
>   * Motivating you to take action to improve your life
> 
>   * Keeping you alert to unwanted or dangerous situations
> 
>   * Helping you anticipate and prevent worst-case scenarios
> 
>   * Slowing down your decision-making, allowing you to make more conscious choices
> 
>   * Preventing you from wasting time and energy pursuing unattainable goals
> 
> 

> 
> Therefore, you can gain additional insights into your resistant thoughts by considering if they offer any of these benefits.

##### Question #4: How Would I Feel and Behave Without This Thought?

The purpose of the fourth question, “How would I feel and behave without this thought?” is to **imagine how you’d feel about your situation if this thought had never crossed your mind.** This will help you understand that it isn’t the situation that’s making you feel bad. Rather, only this _thought_ about the situation is making you feel bad. Katie suggests that you consider how you’d interpret your situation if you didn’t think this thought, and how this might change the way you feel and behave.

**Example #1:** Without the thought, “My children never help with the chores because they don’t respect me,” you wouldn’t resent them or focus on how they make your life difficult. Without these resistant thoughts clouding your judgment and emotions, you would find it easier to focus on what’s positive in your family life and enjoy being a parent to your children. And, each time you noticed that the chores hadn’t been done, you’d be able to ask them for help rationally and constructively.

**Example #2:** Without the thought, “I never have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure,” you would realize that what you have right now is enough to fulfill your needs. You might also notice that it is only your fears about not having enough money in the future that make you feel bad, and decide to train your focus on the present moment to prevent unnecessary anxiety about the future. As a result, you wouldn’t feel any negative emotions about your finances and would find it easier to appreciate what you do have.

> **Lateral Thinking Challenges the Influence of Cognitive Biases**
> 
> If you find it difficult to imagine how you’d feel and behave without your resistant thoughts, you may be under the influence of cognitive biases. Biases are the result of your brain’s attempt to make quick judgments based on your past experiences. While there are many different types of cognitive biases, each influencing you in different ways, they all **restrict your thoughts to what you know and have experienced** —limiting your ability to objectively assess alternative perspectives and feel differently.
> 
> Lateral thinking methods, such as mind mapping and using Six Thinking Hats, rely on your imagination and restrict the influence of cognitive biases. This is because they employ the creative side of your brain, an area where your biases don’t operate. Consequently, these methods make it easier to break free from resistant thoughts and envision other possibilities.

> **Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Challenge Your Opinions and Beliefs**
> 
> Like Katie, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) practitioners argue that the more you question the validity of your thoughts, the less likely you are to get caught up in resistant thoughts and negative emotions. However, the CBT method provides more specific questions to help you objectively examine your thoughts about a situation from multiple perspectives. Answering the following questions in addition to Katie’s four questions will give you a deeper understanding of your beliefs:
> 
> **Facts**
> 
>   * What evidence is there to support your thoughts about this?
> 
>   * What evidence disproves or contradicts your thoughts about this?
> 
>   * Are your opinions getting in the way of the facts?
> 
>   * Are there any facts that you’ve ignored or overlooked?
> 
> 

> 
> **Other explanations**
> 
>   * Can you think about this differently?
> 
>   * Is your mood impacting the way you’re thinking about this?
> 
>   * Have you ever felt differently about this?
> 
>   * Are you likely to change your opinion about this over time?
> 
> 

> 
> **Your feelings**
> 
>   * How does this thought make you feel good?
> 
>   * How does this thought make you feel bad?
> 
>   * How will you feel if you continue to hold onto this thought?
> 
> 


#### Step #3: Reframe Your Thoughts Until You Feel at Peace With the Situation

According to Katie, once you’ve answered the four questions, you’ll realize three things about your resistant thoughts:

  1. There isn’t any truth to them.
  2. They trigger negative feelings and behaviors that don’t serve you.
  3. There isn’t any good reason to continue thinking them.



Ultimately, these three realizations will help you see that it’s not the situation that’s upsetting you, but your thoughts _about_ the situation. Once you’ve grasped this concept, work on the third step toward achieving inner peace: **Reframe your thoughts until you can accept and feel at peace with your situation**.

According to Katie, you can reframe your thoughts from resistance to acceptance by exploring other interpretations of your situation. This will help you realize that**there’s no single way to think and feel about your experiences** —rather, you can always choose how to think and feel about what happens in your life.

She explains that the reason you feel emotional pain about your situation is that you’re choosing to think resistant thoughts about it. However, you can just as easily choose thoughts that inspire you to accept, and even love the situation exactly as it is—which, in turn, will encourage you to respond in ways that help you benefit from the situation.

> **Can Your Thoughts _Create_ Your Experiences?**
> 
> While many self-help authors mirror Katie’s view that your thoughts determine how you interpret, feel about, and respond to experiences, Norman Vincent Peale (_The Power of Positive Thinking_) takes this idea one step further. He claims that your thoughts aren’t only a response to your experiences, but are also the cause of your experiences. He explains that your thoughts during an experience determine how you react to it. This reaction shapes how subsequent experiences play out—in other words, _negative_ thoughts will multiply your negative experiences, while positive thoughts will produce positive experiences. Therefore, you should always remain conscious of how you choose to think.
> 
> Continuing with the unfinished chores and disrespectful children example, consider how your thoughts about the situation influence what happens next. When you resist the experience, you think that your children are trying to upset you—you feel wronged and react defensively or aggressively. The situation then turns to conflict and prevents you from finding a solution.
> 
> On the other hand, when you accept the experience for what it is—the chores haven’t been done—you’re able to acknowledge that your children might have other reasons for not getting them done. You don’t automatically assume that their behavior is a sign of disrespect and you find it easier to respond rationally. This way of thinking prevents tension and helps you work with your children to find a solution.

##### Explore Other Interpretations of Your Situation

Katie suggests two thought exercises that will open your mind to other perspectives about your situation and offer insights that shift your thoughts from resistance to acceptance. Play around with these exercises until you land on an interpretation that feels _intuitively_ right to you. She explains that you’ll know that you’ve picked the right interpretation when, instead of viewing the situation as wrong or unwanted, you’re able to accept it and respond to it constructively.

(Shortform note: According to Eckhart Tolle (_The Power of Now_), you’ll know you’ve picked the right interpretation when you’re able to focus on the present moment without getting lost in your internal monologue—the “mind chatter” that often gives rise to critical thoughts that impede your ability to feel inner peace and happiness. Choosing an interpretation that calms your internal monologue inevitably improves the way you think about yourself and your circumstances. As a result, you find it easier to accept your reality as it occurs instead of finding reasons to resist it.)

**1) State the opposite of your thoughts:** Explore if there’s any truth to the inverse of your current perspective. According to Katie, the more you acknowledge that the opposing perspective can also be true for you, the less hold your resistant thoughts will have over you.

  * **Example #1:** Change, “My children never help with the chores because they don’t respect me,” to, “My children always help with the chores because they respect me.”
  * **Example #2:** Change, “I never have enough money and this makes me feel like a failure,” to, “I always have enough money and this makes me feel like a success.”



(Shortform note: You might find it difficult to explore an opposing perspective. This is because your thoughts and your state of mind reinforce one another to create an internal feedback loop. In this loop,**your thoughts determine your state of mind** (thinking about your children makes you resentful) and **your state of mind determines your thoughts**(you feel resentful so you think about how your children make life difficult). However, research reveals that conscious reflection—whether through journaling, mindfulness practices, or Katie’s three-step process—helps you develop the awareness to disentangle yourself from this feedback loop. This makes it easier to objectively view and change your thoughts.)

**2) State your role in the situation:** Shift your perspective from _blaming_ external circumstances to _questioning_ what role your thoughts and behaviors have played in creating both the situation and your feelings about it. According to Katie, understanding your role in the situation will result in a profound change: Instead of needing the situation to be a specific way before you can accept it, you’ll feel empowered to change the way you think about it so that you can feel at peace, regardless of whether or not the situation changes.

  * **Example #1:** “My children never help with the chores because I don’t respect myself,” or **“** My children never help with the chores because I don’t respect them,” or, “I never help my children with the chores because I don’t respect them.”
  * **Example #2:** “I think I’m a failure and that’s why I never have enough money.”



> **Different Perspectives on Exploring Your Role in Difficult Situations**
> 
> While Katie argues that you should reflect on your role in situations so that you can understand and _accept_ your experiences, many self-help practitioners argue that you should focus on your role so that you can find proactive ways to _change_ your experiences. Three notable proponents of this theory include:
> 
>   * James Allen (_As A Man Thinketh_) argues that, in addition to exploring how your thoughts and behaviors contribute to difficult situations, you must understand why you think and behave the way you do. Without this understanding, you’re more likely to believe that you have no control over your thoughts, behaviors, and resulting experiences—which means you won’t feel motivated to change yourself or your circumstances.
> 
>   * The authors of _Crucial Conversations_ claim that blaming other people or circumstances is a method we use to intentionally ignore the role we play in creating difficult situations. It justifies our resistance by excusing us from any responsibility and, as a result, we don’t see a reason to change our thoughts and behaviors. On the other hand, when we tell ourselves _accurate stories_ and acknowledge our accountability, we feel inspired to engage in constructive thoughts and behaviors.
> 
>   * Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) explains that blaming external circumstances limits happiness because it blocks you from making changes that will improve your life. He suggests that you can overcome this limitation by asking yourself positive and empowering questions. For example, what fun things can you do to inspire your children to help with the chores?

> If you’re reflecting on your role in situations as a way to _change_ your experiences rather than _accept_ them, focus on specific, changeable behaviors. Focusing on modifiable behaviors directs you to specific actions you can take to improve both yourself and your circumstances. For example, acknowledging that you’re more inclined to get angry with your children when you’re tired and hungry indicates a way to improve your relationship with them—delay discussions about the chores until you’ve had a rest and nourished yourself.

> **Change Your Self-Image Before Attempting to Change Your Thoughts**
> 
> Katie seems to imply that you can change your thoughts and emotions about a situation by choosing to interpret it differently. However, be aware that this may not be as easy for you as it sounds: While you may attempt to change your thoughts when you’re aware of them, the majority of your thoughts take place beneath your awareness—in your subconscious mind.
> 
> In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz explains that your subconscious mind creates your self-image from your habitual thoughts and feelings. It then influences you to think and behave in ways that reflect this self-image and actively _discourages_ you from thinking or behaving in ways that are inconsistent with it. Maltz goes so far as to say that your subconscious mind sabotages your conscious attempts to change your habitual thoughts.
> 
> For example, if you habitually think that your children make your life difficult, you’ve trained your subconscious mind to include perpetual frustration as a part of your self-image. As a result, your subconscious mind influences you to _automatically_ think and act in ways that keep you focused on all the ways your children frustrate you. It might influence you to think distrustful thoughts about them or encourage you to act defensively. Additionally, it may sabotage any attempt you make to feel at ease with them—for example, influencing you to interpret innocent remarks and behaviors as signs of disrespect.
> 
> Maltz argues that you can’t rely on your thoughts to change your feelings unless you consciously change your self-image and retrain your subconscious mind. He suggests that you can achieve this by regularly visualizing yourself behaving in ways that align with what you want and who you want to be.
