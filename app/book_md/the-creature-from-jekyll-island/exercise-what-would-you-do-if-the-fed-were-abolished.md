## Exercise: What Would You Do if the Fed Were Abolished?

Imagine that the United States decided to implement Griffin’s plan for abolishing the Federal Reserve. In this exercise, you’ll have a chance to contemplate how that might affect you personally.

* * *

As the Fed pays off the national debt, there’s going to be far more dollars in circulation all at once, causing a sudden surge of inflation, or rather devaluation of the fiat US dollar. What do you think you would do to reduce your vulnerability to inflation or devaluation at that time?

Once the Fed closes down, no longer regulating banks or insuring deposits, some banks will likely fail, and their depositors will likely lose their savings. How would you manage this risk?

Now that you’ve had a chance to think through some of the issues involved in implementing Griffin’s plan, do you support or oppose this plan for abolishing the Fed? Why or why not?
