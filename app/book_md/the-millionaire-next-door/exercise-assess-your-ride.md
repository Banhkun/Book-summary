## Exercise: Assess Your Ride

As part of being frugal, many millionaires buy quality used cars that are several years old, rather than new cars or luxury vehicles that convey status. That way, they don’t pay as much for depreciation, and they don’t pay thousands of dollars simply for the pride or status of having a flashy vehicle. They tend to keep their vehicles for four more years.

* * *

What does a car mean to you? Do you judge yourself and others by what you or they drive? Why or why not?

Do you buy new or used vehicles? How often do you buy a car?

How do your car buying practices affect your ability to accumulate wealth?
