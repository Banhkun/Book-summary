## Chapter 2: Waste Not, Want Not

**The word that best describes many millionaires is “frugal,”** which means using your resources economically and not being wasteful.

However, frugality has a bad name in our consumption-oriented society, which celebrates lavish lifestyles. For instance, we often admire celebrities and millionaire athletes for their gaudy mansions and expensive tastes. But while they’re millionaires in terms of income, most highly paid athletes are UAWs.

For example, a ballplayer might make $5 million a year but only have a net worth of $1 million—he should actually be worth _$15 million or more_. He shows off his wealth instead of building it. His millionaire status is probably temporary.

If such an under-accumulator of wealth gets an increase in income, he spends it. UAWs opt for immediate gratification. They view life as a game show where winners enjoy quick cash and showy gifts such as large boats. (Game shows are about instant gratification—they don’t offer anything of long-term value like tuition money.)

In contrast, **_not_ spending—being frugal—is the foundation of wealth-building**.

### The Frugal Millionaire’s Lifestyle

The typical millionaire’s frugal lifestyle wouldn’t make a popular TV show: it could be described as nondescript middle class, which wouldn’t be interesting to most people. Many millionaires don’t stand out in their neighborhoods. Their watchwords are hard work, discipline, frugality, and smart investment.

In football terms, they play both great offense and great defense. They move the ball by generating income and by smart planning and budgeting, and they and their families hold the defensive line by controlling their spending. Both mindsets help them build wealth for the future.

**It’s important that everyone in the household have a frugal mindset—a family can’t accumulate wealth if anyone is a compulsive spender**. Wealth-building habits can’t coexist with wasteful habits.

### The Importance of Budgeting

Controlling spending and building wealth require budgeting and planning. **Under-accumulators allow their income to determine their budget**. If they want more, they use credit, thereby spending tomorrow’s money today.

In contrast, many millionaires budget their expenses. While you might think millionaires don’t _need_ to budget, the fact is,**they become wealthy and remain that way in large part by budgeting and controlling expenses.** It’s like jogging: most joggers don’t look like people who _need_ to jog—they’re physically fit because disciplining themselves to jog regularly is how they got fit and stay fit.

To become wealthy and stay wealthy requires the following financial fitness steps:

1) **Create and live by monthly and annual budgets.** More than half of all millionaires say they budget. They’re motivated by visualizing the long-term rewards of achieving financial independence and being able to retire.

2) **Know what your family spends annually for basic needs**(food, clothing, and shelter). Fully 62% of the millionaires surveyed knew their monthly expenses, compared to 35% of high-income non-millionaires. A majority of the non-millionaires had no idea how much their consumer-oriented lifestyles cost them.

Credit cards are often a factor contributing to overspending. Most wealthy households have only a few credit cards, such as MasterCard and Visa, and a card for a department store chain like Sears or JCPenney. Millionaire households in the survey were four times more likely to have a Sears card than a Brooks Brothers card; only 6% of millionaires have an American Express Platinum card. Some high-income under-accumulators have a dozen or more credit cards, especially of status retailers.

3) **Set specific daily, monthly, yearly, and life goals.** Most millionaires are goal-oriented and take a long-term view. Their goals are not spending and acquiring material possessions, but being able to retire, be financially secure, and enjoy life. People who are financially secure are happier than those in their age/income category who aren’t. Unlike those living paycheck to paycheck, they don’t worry about the next economic slump.

4) **Spend time planning your financial future.** The number of millionaires who spend time planning investments is more than double the number who don’t plan. Many of those who said they don’t plan are high-income under-accumulators. PAWs spend significant time planning and managing investments. They leverage their knowledge by investing in areas where they have expertise—for instance, an auctioneer who specializes in commercial real estate might invest in that area. They hire qualified financial advisors, but they also do their own research.

### The Short-Term Thinking of UAWs

**The goal of many high-income under-accumulators is to be “better off” than their parents**. This means having a larger home, driving luxury cars, acquiring all the status symbols, and sending the children to private schools.

Their focus is spending and appearing to be wealthy in the present, not accumulating wealth for the future. They work hard and spend what they earn to prove themselves and combat feelings of social inferiority, but they’re more stressed than happy.

Despite striving to be better off than their parents, these under-accumulators share their parents’ view of money: spend it when you have it. Their parents spent it on momentary pleasures such as unhealthy food, alcohol, and smoking. They believed that the purpose of earning money was to spend it—never to save or invest it. If they wanted more, they found a way to earn more.

UAWs (even those with high incomes) and their parents often believe they don’t have enough money to invest. Yet many people spend vast amounts of money over a lifetime on wasteful habits, such as smoking several packs of cigarettes a day.

**When you add up what seem like small daily expenses, they become huge expenses.**

Similarly, small amounts of money invested over time grow into significant financial assets.

Smokers would be better off kicking the habit and investing the cost of three packs a day in tobacco company stock. Investing the amount spent on a 40-year smoking habit would eventually create a portfolio worth millions.

If they changed their behavior, many high-income under-accumulators of wealth who never learned from their parents to be frugal and invest could become millionaires. Like kicking the smoking habit, they have to be serious about changing their spending habits. In addition, they need the assistance of a professional accountant or financial planner who can help them create a budget and follow it.

### Frugality and Taxes

One important way the wealthy benefit from spending less and investing more is that this lowers their taxable income. Indeed, a rule that millionaires live by is that to build wealth, you need to **minimize your taxable (realized) income and maximize your nontaxable income (assets that grow without generating taxable income).**

The typical millionaire in the survey had an annual realized income of less than 7% of his wealth, meaning that less than 7% of his wealth was taxable.

Paying income tax is the biggest expenditure for many households. **High-income spenders pay the most in taxes because they focus on increasing their earned (taxable) income to support a consumption-oriented lifestyle.** They can’t accumulate wealth because their taxable income is too high. In contrast, the typical millionaire may be cash poor due to investing 20% of her annual income in financial assets that appreciate without generating taxable income.

For example, at the time this book was written, a 51-year-old woman with an annual income of $220,000 paid $69,440 in federal income tax—18.8% of her total wealth of $370,000. Her net worth should have been much higher—$1,122,000—but she couldn’t accumulate wealth because most of her financial assets were equivalent to cash and taxable.

Yet there are prodigious accumulators worth $2-3 million, who have annual realized incomes of $80,000; they’re living on 6.7% of their wealth.

Remember that every dollar you spend is taxed. For example, you need $100,000 to buy a $68,000 boat, which is why few millionaires buy boats—they prefer to invest their money rather than allowing it to be taxed. They forgo spending to build wealth and ultimately achieve financial independence.

Along with minimizing taxable income, many millionaires avoid buying expensive homes. **A sensible rule for everyone is don’t assume a mortgage that’s more than twice your annual realized income.** Living in a less expensive home enables you to spend less of your income and invest more to build wealth and minimize taxes.
