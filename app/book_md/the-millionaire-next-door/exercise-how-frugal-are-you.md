## Exercise: How Frugal Are You?

Millionaires are typically very frugal: they live below their means, budget their expenses, know what theyâ€™re spending on basic needs, and minimize income taxes by investing 20% in assets that appreciate without generating taxable income.

How would you describe your lifestyle and spending habits?

How closely do they fit the definition of frugal (using your resources economically, not wasting them)?

What are some specific things you could do to live more frugally? (For instance, track and reduce your weekly spending on groceries.)

If you lived more frugally, what long term benefits can you envision as a result?
