## Exercise: Identify What You Can Offer

Use this exercise to identify an opportunity to generate goodwill by providing value without asking for anything in return.

* * *

Name a person you’d like to establish a relationship with and explain how that connection would benefit you or your business.

Write down, in as much detail as you can, what that person’s goals are. What are they trying to accomplish or achieve? How are they attempting to do it?

Look over your last answer and list at least three ways in which you could leverage your own knowledge, skills, or resources to help them accomplish their goal.

Choose one of the above and describe in detail how you’ll put it into action.
