## Chapter 5: Orthodoxy and Groupthink on Campus

If speech with which one disagrees is a form of violence, then it logically follows that a community would seek to suppress such “violence” in the name of community safety. After all, no community or group would tolerate open displays of _physical_ violence—so why should _speech_ violence be treated any differently?

In this chapter, we will examine the other main consequence of the three bad ideas—the development of rigid ideological orthodoxy and groupthink on campus. Specifically, we’ll explore:

  * The desire that groups tend to have for internal ideological cohesion and the impulse to suppress dissent—especially during periods of internal stress and perceived external threat
  * How this desire has increasingly found expression on America’s college campuses, amplified by the growing left-wing orthodoxy that has taken root among both professors and students
  * How ideological unity poisons academic freedom and leads to the establishment of orthodoxy and groupthink on campus



### The Quest for Ideological Purity

The French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who wrote during the 19th and early 20th centuries, argued that the natural human tendency toward tribalism and us-against-them thinking (a phenomenon we explored in Chapter 3) often expresses itself through the fostering of internal group cohesion and the suppression of dissent.

**This quest for ideological purity tends to be strongest during moments where the group feels itself under siege both from internal disunity and external threats.** According to Durkheim, participation in group rituals and public affirmations of shared belief are powerful tools for the achievement of internal cohesion.

Unfortunately, this can quickly lead to the establishment of group orthodoxy and persecution of those who are perceived to be dissenters. These episodes of persecution nearly always:

  * Arise seemingly out of nowhere
  * Persecute alleged offenders for the most trivial of offenses against the group or collective
  * Intimidate those who might be opposed to the persecution into silent acquiescence or even active participation, for fear of being targeted themselves



**One can see similar patterns of thinking among today's students on American college campuses, with their eagerness to root out and silence perceived ideological deviations.**

### The Need for Viewpoint Diversity

Although we’ve focused a lot on the attitudes of students, they are by no means the sole perpetrators of this groupthink mentality on campus. In many ways, they are merely responding to the growing uniformity of opinion among their professors.

While professors have always leaned left (especially in the humanities and social sciences), leftist academics have gained a dominant position within academia, far outnumbering conservative or right-leaning professors—often by margins of five-to-one.

**As opinion within academic circles has grown more uniform, it has become less tolerant of diverging viewpoints.** This lack of viewpoint diversity is antithetical to the scholarly and intellectually stimulating environment that is supposed to define university life.

It is certainly true that everyone, including university professors and researchers, believes that their opinions are correct. Because we believe this, we tend to engage in confirmation bias, seeking out evidence that confirms our beliefs, while ignoring evidence that contradicts our beliefs.

But in an academic setting featuring a healthy diversity of viewpoints, rigorous peer review of a professor’s writing and research holds this impulse in check—essentially, the faculty’s confirmation biases cancel each other out. In such a well-functioning marketplace of ideas, it is difficult for rigid orthodoxy and groupthink to take hold.

But the exploration and vetting of diverse ideas are impossible under the conditions of strict ideological uniformity that exist on today’s college campuses. **Scholars increasingly evaluate one another’s work not on its merits, but on the basis of whether or not it deviates from shared left-wing orthodoxy.** As we’ll see, this growing intolerance for ideological impurity creates an environment where professors are vulnerable to witch hunts—often led by their colleagues.

#### Rebecca Tuvel and Academic Witch Hunts

Recent years have seen **a disturbing willingness within academic journals and publications to censor views that contradict left-wing orthodoxy** , particularly when it comes to matters of race and class.

In 2017, the feminist philosophy journal _Hypatia_ published an article titled “In Defense of Transracialism,” by Rhodes College assistant professor Rebecca Tuvel. Tuvel argued that the growing acceptance of transgender people and the simultaneous condemnation of transracialism (the belief that people should have the freedom to choose their own race and be able to transition to another racial group) represented a contradiction.

Tuvel argued that one’s choice of gender identity and one’s choice of racial identity both raised similar moral and ethical concerns and were worthy of respect. Her article caused an uproar, as people from across academia penned an open letter to _Hypatia_ demanding that Tuvel’s article be retracted—a severe sanction usually reserved for instances of outright fraud or plagiarism.

These critics did not argue that Tuvel’s findings were factually incorrect or that they needed further study. They argued that simply publishing the piece was “transphobic” and amounted to an act of “violence” against transgender people and people of color.

The letter did not address the merits of Tuvel’s arguments; rather, it focused on her word choice in the article, lambasting her for using terms such as “transgenderism” and for “deadnaming” a famous trans woman (by referring to her pre-transition name).

Many of Tuvel’s colleagues sympathized with her plight but refused to publicly come to her defense for fear of angering the digital mob. The Tuvel affair was the epitome of a modern-day academic witch hunt—an unthinking mob using the persecution of an innocent to foster in-group cohesion and individually signal their ideological purity to one another.

#### Day of Absence at Evergreen State

**These intolerant attitudes have filtered down to the students themselves.** At Evergreen State College in 2017, a politically progressive biology professor named Bret Weinstein wrote an email on a faculty listserv questioning the wisdom and fairness of a planned “Day of Absence,” in which white students were asked by the organizers to stay away from campus.

Although he believed his email to be innocuous and sent in good faith, Weinstein soon saw it set off a firestorm of controversy at the college. Days after sending the email, a mob of students invaded Weinstein’s classroom, surrounded him, and refused to allow him to leave. Over the course of several days, students occupied various administrative buildings across campus, barricading university officials inside (including university president George Bridges). In the end, Weinstein and his wife (also a professor) were forced to leave the university and seek employment elsewhere.

**The incident represented a total capitulation to a violent mob by the leadership of an American college**. **No students were punished for their intimidation tactics and disruption of the learning process.**
