## Exercise: Question Your Assumptions

Discover how you can learn to accept new ideas through exposure to diversity and conflict.

* * *

Have you ever found yourself refusing to listen to an idea because you disagreed with it? Describe the situation in a few sentences.

Do you think this black-and-white thinking on your part prevented you from learning? Explain why or why not.

In the future, what steps can you take to open yourself up more to exploring new ideas, even those you dislike or which cause you offense?
