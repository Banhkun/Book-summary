## Chapters 12-13: Fostering Antifragility

In these final chapters, we’ll focus on ways that parents, universities, and young people themselves can break free from the harmful ideas and behaviors we’ve examined in this summary. Specifically, we’ll explore:

  * How parents can increase their kids’ sense of independence and encourage them to engage in more critical thinking
  * How universities can make a stronger commitment to academic freedom and welcome a greater diversity of viewpoints on campus



Ultimately, **these recommendations will prepare young people to be antifragile, autonomous, and take on the challenges of adult life**.

### Antifragile Kids

Earlier in this summary, we introduced the concept of antifragility—that kids do not suffer from experiencing mild adversity; on the contrary, it makes them stronger. Overcoming difficulty is an essential part of the passage from childhood to adulthood. This is why the excessive focus on safety and efforts by parents to minimize risk, however well-intentioned, actually do great emotional harm to young people.

Because they are deprived of the opportunity to make mistakes, kids do not learn how to properly evaluate risks, gain independence, and navigate interpersonal conflicts without relying on a third-party authority figure, like a parent (or, later in life, a university official).

#### Prepare for Independence

**Parents should give their children more opportunities to exercise their independence, even starting at an early age.** This can be as simple as allowing them to enjoy more free and unsupervised play. When they notice conflicts arising among children during play, they should resist the temptation to intervene or make them “play fair.”

Parents would also be wise to periodically ask their kids what new challenges they want to take on. Even small milestones like walking to school or friends’ houses on their own can be remarkably self-affirming for kids. This also teaches them that “stranger danger” is an overhyped myth and that, if trouble arises, they _should_ ask strangers for help.

Parents should pause, take a breath, and remember that the risk of abduction at the hands of strangers is practically zero and that crime in general is far lower than when _they_ were children.

#### Break Emotional Reasoning

**Parents also would do well to teach their kids not to rely on their emotions as their sole guide for interpreting reality.** Even teaching children the basic principles behind cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be beneficial.

To recap, CBT teaches people to break the vicious cycle of negative thinking by identifying and labeling untrue negative thoughts in order to foster more positive and realistic views of themselves. Parents can model this behavior by identifying and labeling their _own_ negative thoughts to their children and showing them they’re irrational.

Parents can then use this as a launching pad for deeper discussions about the relationships between feelings and reality. For example, children often have a remarkable ability to understand difficult ideas through the use of metaphors and allegories. A parent might explain that reality can exist independently of one’s feelings by pointing out that even if someone _feels_ that it’s snowing outside, they might be incorrect—it either _is_ or _isn’t_ snowing. One has to appreciate facts as well as feelings.

#### Embrace Nuance

Lastly, **parents should impress upon their children that no one is purely good or evil. All of us are complex beings with the capacity to do both good things and bad things** based upon our circumstances and our state of knowledge at a given time.

Black-and-white moral thinking can be highly damaging to a child’s emotional development. Even when children are wrong, parents should listen respectfully to their opinions and try to use reason to guide them toward more correct and accurate patterns of thought. This will teach a child that she is not a bad or immoral person simply because she is wrong about something or is in disagreement with someone.

This, in turn, will teach her to apply this logic to _others_ —that they are not bad simply for having different opinions. She will gain humility (because they will know that they, too, are capable of being wrong) and learn to give others the benefit of the doubt, instead of assuming the worst.

#### Encourage Antifragility in the Schools

Outside of the home, **parents should encourage elementary, middle, and high schools to adopt policies that boost antifragility.**

Teachers should stop assigning heavy workloads of homework, especially for younger children. They should instead be encouraged to use the time spent on homework on free play and exploration, where they can learn healthy interpersonal and independence skills from their peers.

Schools should also put greater emphasis on recess, with less adult supervision. While kids should always be kept safe, the definition of “safety” should be narrowed to mean only _physical_ safety. Even if some kids are being excluded or groups of kids aren’t playing “fair,” these are opportunities for kids to explore how to handle rejection and emotional discomfort on their own—which will build their long-term emotional fortitude.

School administrators should also strictly limit the use of devices on school property, as they have been shown to disrupt the learning process and (especially social-media apps) increase feelings of social isolation, which leads to anxiety and depression. As kids get older, educational institutions should be mindful of the fact that today’s youth grow up much slower than previous generations.

**Even if they are able to master college-level coursework, students often arrive on campus unprepared for the social and emotional responsibilities of independent living.** This is why there is a growing push to delay the admission of high school graduates into college.

Public figures like retired United States Army General Stanley McChrystal propose a “gap year” between high school and college, during which young adults can live and work away from their parents. This will teach them valuable independence and interpersonal skills, hopefully reducing their demands for safety and protection once they do enter college.

A national gap year program would have the added benefit of bringing together young people from diverse backgrounds, better preparing them for the diversity of opinions and experiences they will encounter, both in college and in the professional world after graduation.

### Antifragile Institutions

Universities themselves are antifragile institutions. An academic institution is strongest when it is home to a diverse range of viewpoints. Scholars with different ideas debate one another and use empirical evidence and research to advance the truth—benefitting the entire university community.

**The purpose of a university should be to discover and share truth, across a range of intellectual disciplines.** This is the sole standard upon which the quality of a university should be judged. If a university suppresses the truth because of concerns that certain kinds of knowledge are hurtful or politically inconvenient, then by definition it is not a good university.

Ideals like equality and social justice are noble, and fostering them may well be appropriate goals for other institutions. But not for universities. If a university places the promotion of social justice (however it defines the term) as its primary goal and reason for existence, then it is likely to suppress or censor ideas and findings that might conflict with that stated goal.

#### Academic Freedom

**Universities can make a more robust commitment to academic freedom by eliminating campus speech codes**. As we discussed in Chapter 10, speech codes are vague, unenforceable, and render the definitions of “offensive” or “unsafe” speech entirely subjective.

In the case of public universities, which are government institutions funded by taxpayer money, such speech codes present a genuine constitutional question under the First Amendment. In their pursuit of truth, universities must put free inquiry first—even if it leads to unpleasant conclusions.

University administrators and presidents should also be more willing to stand up to student outrage. As we’ve seen, university leadership has all too often given in to the demands of student protestors, often at the expense of the intellectual wellbeing of the broader academic community. While protestors certainly have the right to voice their opposition to a speaker’s ideas, they do not have the right to prohibit others from hearing a speech or lecture on campus.

#### Diversity of Opinion

**Universities should strive to welcome a diverse range of viewpoints on campus, among both faculty and students.** When a university becomes too uniform in its ideology, it ceases to be hospitable to the kind of rational inquiry that is supposed to define a campus community. Instead, it becomes a rigid and inflexible political faction committed to an orthodoxy.

**Universities should pursue diversity of _opinion_ just as they pursue racial or gender diversity. **Having a greater variety of opinions on campus will make it clear to students that classrooms are not intellectual “safe spaces,” and that adults engaged in serious study at a university do not need to be “protected” from viewpoints they dislike.

When conflicts do arise, professors should emphasize the use of _evidence_ to disprove one’s opponents, instead of resorting to the language of safety.
