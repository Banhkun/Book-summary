## 1-Page Summary

**In _The Coddling of the American Mind_ , Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt argue that three “Great Untruths,” or bad ideas have gained a strong foothold among young people, especially those on college campuses.**

  * You must strive to avoid bad experiences at all costs.
  * You must always trust your emotions over reason.
  * The world is a black-and-white battle between good people and bad people; there is no middle ground.



**These beliefs insulate students from ideas with which they disagree** , are deeply dangerous to free expression and are harmful to students’ emotional development. By succumbing to their own sense of fragility and wrapping themselves in the cloak of victimhood, young people today are developing cognitive patterns similar to those of people suffering from anxiety and depression.

**Ultimately, young people must develop the skills and fortitude to feel empowered**. Being exposed to controversial ideas and unpleasant experiences is a vital part of human development. The key is not to crumple and retreat into learned helplessness in the face of adversity; but rather, to overcome it and emerge better and stronger.

In this summary, we’ll explore:

  * The three bad ideas, now widely accepted among college students, that are stifling academic freedom and hampering the social and emotional development of young people
  * The reasons why young people believe themselves to be so fragile—and, as a result, why they make such strident demands that their universities shut down speech that they deem to be unacceptable
  * Some practical steps that parents, schools, and universities can take to teach young people to become more independent, critical thinkers



### Bad Idea #1: Avoid Adversity at All Costs

The first bad idea is that **exposure to adversity or discomfort is inherently damaging.** This is a falsehood—stressors and risks are necessary parts of human emotional development. And young people are no exception.

#### Safetyism and the Alleged Danger of Speech

The people and institutions that are most responsible for young people’s healthy development—parents, teachers, schools, universities—have actively shielded them from any form of adversity.

This is the ideology of safetyism—the idea that one’s freedom from emotional discomfort trumps all other moral concerns and trade-offs. In this formulation, “safety” increasingly means being sheltered from opinions that one doesn’t agree with.

#### The Social-Media Natives of Generation iGen

It is unsurprising that this idea of safety is prevalent among the members of Generation iGen, who can best be described as social-media natives. In the online worlds of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, one truly _can_ curate a world populated only by those who share one’s cultural, aesthetic, and political preferences. Unfortunately, they expect to be able to replicate this in the real world.

#### Defining Trauma Down

This language of safety and trauma is now applied to experiences and topics where it never would have been before. Increasingly, students conflate trauma with emotional discomfort. But emotional discomfort is simply not the same as trauma. At many colleges, students claim that mere _exposure_ to certain classroom materials is traumatic and threatens their emotional and psychological well-being.

This is inherently poisonous to the atmosphere of free discussion of ideas, which is supposed to be a hallmark of academia.

### Bad Idea #2: Always Trust Your Emotions

**The second bad idea is that you must always trust your emotions.**

Too often, emotional reasoning causes us to misperceive the world around us. For young people, emotional reasoning can cause them to feel intentional slights where there are none and strengthen the desire to shelter themselves from emotionally triggering experiences—even speech that they merely disagree with.

#### Negative-Feedback Loops

**Emotional reasoning can have negative consequences.** **It often leads to negative cognitive feedback loops.** Individuals who suffer from anxiety and depression often start from a place of low self-esteem. And because they feel so badly about themselves, they selectively seek out “proof” to confirm their negative self-beliefs. These “proofs,” in turn, further reinforce the original negative beliefs.

#### The Threat to Critical Thinking

Alarmingly, these patterns of negative thought are strikingly similar to the ways in which overprotected university students interpret speech or ideas with which they disagree. Not only is this disruptive in a classroom setting, **but it also inhibits the development of critical thinking—the skill that enables people to absorb new information and revise incorrect beliefs.**

#### Microaggression and Misperception

Another dangerous manifestation of emotional reasoning can be seen in the phenomenon of so-called “microaggressions.” **Microaggressions are minor, often inadvertent slights that members of minority groups are often exposed to in the course of daily life.** An excessive focus on these incidents can cause the recipient to misperceive _intentional_ slight where there was none.

#### De-Platforming

One more product of faulty emotional reasoning is the phenomenon of de-platforming. **De-platforming occurs when controversial guest lecturers, speakers, or debaters who are invited to a university campus to discuss issues are unable to speak due to protests by student activist groups.**

### Bad Idea #3: The World Is Black and White

**The third bad idea is that the world is defined by a black-and-white struggle between the forces of good and evil.** Psychological research shows that the human mind is hardwired to sympathize with members of our in-group and fear and distrust members of an out-group.

#### Common-Enemy Identity Politics

**Identity politics is a form of political mobilization based on some shared group characteristic, often race, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, or sexual orientation.**

**Common-_enemy_ identity politics uses the alleged _threat_ of a shared adversary to mobilize its supporters. **Usually, the enemy is cast as an oppressor and the mobilized group casts itself as a marginalized population struggling to remove its shackles.

This contrasts with common-_humanity_ identity politics, as practiced by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which grounds its appeal in a universalist message of justice and decency.

#### Call-Out Culture

**Call-out culture is the public shaming of “oppressors” on campus, often for the most trivial offenses**. Social media makes call-out culture much more pervasive and cruel, as it gives the online attackers a sense of anonymity that allows them to relax their moral inhibitions.

**Call-out culture has a chilling effect on free speech on campus, as students, faculty, and administrators are forced to resort to self-censorship** out of fear of being socially vilified for politically incorrect opinions.

### Bad Impact #1: The Suppression of Speech

These bad ideas have major consequences. Their first negative impact is that they have convinced students that violence and intimidation are acceptable—even necessary—responses to speech that they dislike.

One disturbing idea is that **certain forms of speech ought to be considered a form of violence.** The logic of this argument is that inflammatory speech can cause emotional distress. Emotional distress, in turn, can have harmful effects on one’s physical health. Therefore, since some forms of speech can lead to physical harm, such speech ought to be considered the moral equivalent of physical violence.

**By this logic, of course, almost _anything_ could be considered an act of violence, since anything is likely to be emotionally stressful to at least _someone_.** This becomes an open invitation for a listener to respond to nearly _any_ speech with which she disagrees with _actual_ violence.

In March 2017, an outbreak of violence occurred at Middlebury College in Vermont. There, controversial right-wing author Charles Murray was scheduled to speak. Murray, in his 1994 book _The Bell Curve_ , argued that social and economic inequality is the result of innate genetic differences that render blacks, Latinos, women, and the poor intellectually inferior to white men. **Students at Middlebury responded by rioting, destroying property, and even physically threatening Murray and members of the faculty.**

### Bad Impact #2: Orthodoxy and Groupthink on Campus

**The second negative impact of these ideas is that they have led to ideological orthodoxy and groupthink on college campuses—and the persecution of those who are perceived to be dissenters.**

As opinion within academic circles has grown more uniformly left-wing, it has become less tolerant of diverging viewpoints.**** Scholars increasingly evaluate one another’s work not on its merits, but on the basis of whether or not it deviates from shared left-wing orthodoxy.****

Recent years have seen **a disturbing willingness within academic journals and publications to censor views that contradict left-wing orthodoxy** , particularly when it comes to matters of race and class. One professor who merely questioned the fairness of a “Day of Absence” (during which white students were asked by activists not to come to campus for a day) was vilified, harassed, and attacked by students and even fellow faculty—and eventually forced to leave the campus.

### How Young People Became So Fragile

It’s important to understand _why_ young people have come to adopt these attitudes. In this section, we’ll explore political polarization, rising rates of depression and anxiety, the influence of social media, an inordinate concern for children’s safety on the part of parents, the bureaucratization of universities, and changing norms around social justice as possible root causes.

#### Political Polarization

On and off campus, the stark ideological differences between the left and right have led to "negative polarization”—political mobilization centered not on positive support for one’s preferred party, but hatred and fear of the other party.

Left-wing campus activism has invited a fierce reaction from the right, with**right-wing media like Fox News often cynically amplifying and highlighting high-profile incidents of left-wing campus activism**. The vicious cycle of action, reaction, and counter-reaction further divides the nation and makes it impossible to engage in any meaningful dialogue across the partisan divide.

#### Social Media and the Dawning Mental Health Crisis

**Recent years have seen a troubling rise in the number of teens and adolescents who report feeling anxious or depressed.** Suicides and self-harm are up since the dawn of the

2010s, especially for adolescent and teen girls, after remaining relatively steady for decades.

Scholars have noted that **social media and excess screentime is highly correlated with depression, anxiety, and self-harm among young people.**

If you are unpopular or feel that you are being excluded, social comparison sites like Facebook and Instagram provide minute-by-minute confirmation of your isolated social status by broadcasting the glamorous and fulfilling experiences that everyone _else_ is enjoying. Saturation in the world of social media has left today’s youth more depressed, anxious, and fearful than ever.

#### Safety Parenting

**Today’s parents limit the independent activities of their children to a far greater extent than previous generations of parents, depriving them of growth-enhancing opportunities to take risks and learn from mistakes**.

This prevents young people from learning how to realistically evaluate risks when they become adults. They then carry this attitude to college and expect to be protected from “violent” and “dangerous” speech and opinions.

#### Bureaucratization on Campus

Because higher education is such a big business, universities now require a large, professionalized bureaucracy of administrators to manage them and ensure steady revenue.

As a result, **colleges increasingly see students as _customers_ —valuable assets whose needs must be catered to**. Fearful of offending valuable customers, administrators have promulgated onerous campus “speech codes” that define what ideas and modes of expression are and are not acceptable on campus. **These codes are absurdly vague, arbitrarily enforced, and deeply damaging to free speech on campus.**

#### Evolving Norms of Social Justice

So many of these campus issues revolve around evolving notions of justice. iGen grew up during an era of immense social and political turmoil, particularly around questions of identity and racial and gender equity. As such, they are highly skeptical of traditional racial, gender, and class hierarchies.

**The trouble arises when people stop focusing on ensuring equal access to _opportunities_ and start focusing on the equality of material _outcomes_. **Such a shift in attitudes toward social justice began before iGen. An excessive fear of groups being overrepresented or underrepresented leads to the imposition of quotas, in which individuals are judged not on their merits, but on their membership in a particular group.

### Solutions: Fostering Antifragility

We’ll now focus on solutions that parents, teachers, professors, and administrators can employ to push back against the three bad ideas and their harmful consequences.

#### Solution #1: Childhood Independence

**Parents should give their children more opportunities to exercise their independence, starting at an early age.** This can be as simple as allowing them to enjoy more free and unsupervised play. When they notice conflicts arising among children during play, they should resist the temptation to intervene or make them “play fair.” Parents would also be wise to periodically ask their kids what new challenges they want to take on. Even small milestones like walking to school or friends’ houses on their own can be remarkably self-affirming for kids.

#### Solution #2: Break Emotional Reasoning

**Parents also would do well to teach their kids not to rely on their emotions as their sole guide for interpreting reality.** For example, a parent might explain that reality can exist independently of one’s feelings by pointing out that even if someone _feels_ that it’s snowing outside, they might be incorrect—it either _is_ or _isn’t_ snowing. One has to appreciate facts as well as feelings.

#### Solution #3: Embrace Nuance

**Parents should also impress upon their children that no one is purely good or evil. All of us are complex beings with the capacity to do both good things and bad things** based upon our circumstances and our state of knowledge at a given time. Even when children are wrong, parents should listen respectfully to their opinions and try to use reason to guide them toward more correct and accurate patterns of thought. This will teach a child that she is not a bad or immoral person simply because she is wrong about something or is in disagreement with someone.

#### Solution #4: De-Supervise the Schools

**Schools should put greater emphasis on recess, with less adult supervision**. While kids should always be kept safe, the definition of “safety” should be narrowed to mean only _physical_ safety. **School administrators should also strictly limit the use of devices on school property** , as they have been shown to disrupt the learning process and increase anxiety and depression.

#### Solution #5: Defend Academic Freedom

**Universities can make a more robust commitment to academic freedom by eliminating campus speech codes**. University administrators and presidents should also be more willing to stand up to student outrage. While protestors certainly have the right to voice their opposition to a speaker’s ideas, they do not have the right to prohibit others from hearing a speech or lecture on campus.

### The Pursuit of Wisdom

**Ultimately, higher education must be about the fostering of wisdom._True_** wisdom lies in exploring new ideas, confronting entrenched orthodoxies, and having the intellectual strength to reject wrongheaded ideas and accept new knowledge. This commitment to wisdom and truth is real social justice—and it’s what will yield the greatest good, both for students and the society to which they belong.
