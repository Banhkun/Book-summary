## Chapter 10: Fragile Universities

In the last few chapters, we’ve discussed how evolving social norms and parenting practices combine to make today’s college students more fragile _before_ they set foot on campus. In this chapter, we’ll look at how **the policies and practices of university administrators reinforce this culture of fragility on campus**.

In particular, we’ll look at:

  * How the increasing corporatization of American higher education has led universities to treat students like customers whose every need must be satisfied
  * How the rise of campus “speech codes” threatens free speech and reinforces students’ false beliefs in their innate fragility



### College as Big Business

While most American colleges and universities are still nonprofit organizations, they have nevertheless become enormously wealthy institutions. In just the 2015-2016 academic year, university revenues totaled a whopping $548 billion.

**Because higher education is such a big business, universities now require a large, professionalized bureaucracy of administrators to manage them.** Often, these administrators are tasked with financially safeguarding the university—successfully marketing it to prospective students, securing large gifts from alumni, and shielding the university from potentially ruinous lawsuits.

The administrators make their living from the university’s largesse, and so have a direct personal interest in ensuring its revenue-maximizing potential. The past few decades have seen the numbers of university administrators skyrocket, with their growth in numbers far outpacing that of professors. These administrators are now the real power players and decision-makers on matters of campus policy—not the professors.

#### Students as Customers

If American universities are revenue generators, then the source of that revenue is the students themselves. **Colleges increasingly see students as _customers_ —valuable assets whose needs must be catered to**, lest they (or, more realistically, their parents) leave and give their valuable tuition money to a competing institution.

Privileged students know that their families are the financial lifeblood of the university, and as such, have come to demand white-glove treatment from the adults who run the campuses. Colleges now resemble luxury resorts, where students dine on excellent food and enjoy first-class amenities in their classrooms and residence halls.

It is not surprising, therefore, that **students have developed a sense of entitlement regarding how they deserve to be treated—and what opinions and ideas are acceptable for them to be exposed to.** For many students, professors and administrators are simply customer service representatives.

### Speech Codes

The corporatization of university life, the interests of university administrators, and the growing fragility and entitlement of today’s students all combine to create an atmosphere on campus that is highly threatening to academic freedom.

Because colleges increasingly fear being sued by students who claim to have been offended by something a student or professor said to them or by something they may have been assigned in class, administrators have promulgated onerous campus “speech codes” that define what ideas and modes of expression are and are not acceptable.

**These codes are deeply damaging to free speech on campus and frequently lead to instances of overreaction to and overregulation of ideas.** One professor at Oakton Community College who sent an innocuous email to fellow faculty members urging them to honor the struggle of workers on May Day was issued a cease-and-desist letter by the college. His offense? Merely _referencing_ the violent 1886 Haymarket Square Riot in his email, which administrators believed constituted a veiled threat to the university president.

#### No Standards for “Offensive”

Speech codes also enshrine the kind of emotional reasoning we cautioned against in Chapter 2. Some codes include absurdly vague language, demanding that “no student shall offend anyone on university property.” “Offensive” is not defined by any objective standard, but is determined solely by the “victim.” If it bothers _someone_ , it’s offensive, regardless of intent.

This closely mirrors the phenomenon we observed in Chapter 2 in which the definition of concepts like “trauma” have been watered down and subjectified to such a degree as to deprive them of any practical meaning or application. Moreover, the overhyping of the concept of “microaggressions” enhances students’ beliefs in their own fragility and gives them a low bar for what constitutes bias and/or aggression.

### Teaching in Fear

While these speech codes may seem silly and nonsensical (and they are), one should not discount the ways in which they have profoundly reshaped academic life.

**Professors now teach in an atmosphere of intimidation** , in which using the wrong term or assigning a “problematic” work for students to analyze can lead to social sanction from fellow faculty; student boycotts of one’s class; and disciplinary action by the university, up to and including dismissal.

To avoid running afoul of this intolerant atmosphere or having a bias report filed against them by a student, professors tiptoe around topics that are likely to lead to such controversies. In law schools, for example, professors report being unable to teach topics like sexual assault law. This only serves to impoverish the students intellectually, while ultimately harming the survivors of sexual assaults themselves.

**All in all, university life has become defined by a disempowering victimhood culture.** This stands in stark contrast to earlier notions of a dignity culture, in which one had a strong enough sense of one’s self-worth to be able to shrug off minor insults. Today, students increasingly cherish and cultivate their status as powerless victims. This ultimately serves to make them morally dependent on the intervention of third-party authority figures such as parents and university administrators.

This unwillingness to solve one’s own problems or peacefully resolve disputes within one’s peer groups is damaging to human development. After students leave their coddled university lives, they will lack the tools to negotiate conflicts and overcome hurdles—and there won’t be any university president to complain to.
