## Exercise: Improve Your Bottleneck

Try to increase capacity at your bottleneck. This might not be a machine in an assembly line, but also your knowledge work or personal life.

* * *

How could you improve work at the bottleneck itself? (Remember: skip unnecessary steps; add supplements to increase capacity; increase time the bottleneck is active.)

How could you improve what the bottleneck works on? (Remember: focus the bottleneck only on critical parts needed today; allow parts to skip the bottleneck; add analytics to study bottleneck operations.)

How could you optimize the system for the bottleneck? (Remember: ensure excess inventory in front of the bottleneck to prevent idling; redistribute load to non-bottlenecks; outsource the bottleneck work.)
