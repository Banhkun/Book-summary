## Exercise: Identify Your Bottleneck

Find the bottleneck that’s decreasing your total throughput.

* * *

In what step do you have the greatest inventory piling up in front? Where is your largest backlog?

What you defined above is your bottleneck, and every other step is not a bottleneck. What are other steps you thought were important to optimize, but actually aren’t bottlenecks?

What is the cost of your bottleneck per hour? Remember, this is the loss in throughput of the entire system per hour.
