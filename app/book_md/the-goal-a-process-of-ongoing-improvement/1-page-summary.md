## 1-Page Summary

Productivity is defined as bringing you closer to your goal. Every action that brings you closer to your goal is productive. Every action that does not bring you closer is not productive, even if it seems so.

The Goal of every business is to make money. Likewise, activities that do not bring you closer to making money are not productive.

  * Beware of defining subgoals that do not really drive toward the Goal, like production efficiency, team size, money raised, etc. 



Organizations can be measured by 3 metrics: Throughput, Inventory, and Operational Expense.

  * Throughput: the rate at which the system generates money through sales
  * Inventory: all the money system has invested in purchasing things it intends to sell
  * Operational expense: all the money the system spends to turn inventory into throughput



Ideally, your activities improve all three at once.

  * Many companies focus primarily on decreasing operating expense, which can lead to unproductive behaviors that stifle throughput. Instead, switch your mindset to increasing throughput.



**The bottleneck of the system determines the throughput of the entire system.**

  * By definition, the throughput of the system cannot be greater than the capacity of the bottleneck. Where is the weakest link in the chain?
  * This means **the value of an hour lost at the bottleneck is equal to the value of the entire system**. 
    * Even if a bottleneck costs $5/hour to run, if the factory is producing $1000 of goods per hour, then an hour of the bottleneck idling is costing $1000/hour.
  * Constraints can be equipment, people, or policies.



Increase capacity at the bottleneck through a variety of interventions.

  * Prevent idling by **running the bottleneck all the time, ensuring inventory upstream of the bottleneck, and preventing back-ups at the bottleneck**.
  * Bypass parts past the bottleneck if it’s not strictly necessary.
  * Improve quality of upstream work to prevent bottleneck working on poor-quality work.
  * Add new producers (eg machines, people) at the bottleneck, even if they’re less efficient.
  * Outsource bottleneck capacity to outside the organization.
  * (If you’re a bottleneck as a human manager or a worker, and not a factory step, consider implementing analogues of each of the above)



The non-bottlenecks should be synchronized with the bottleneck, which means idling at non-bottlenecks is acceptable. If both the bottleneck and non-bottleneck go full steam ahead, the non-bottleneck will produce surplus inventory, which adds cost and causes traffic jams.

To coordinate this, use Drum-Buffer-Rope

  * Drum: pace non-bottlenecks production rates with bottleneck rates
  * Buffer: provide enough buffer inventory upstream of bottleneck to prevent idling
  * Rope: allow up to a threshold max surplus inventory, after which the non-bottleneck is idled
