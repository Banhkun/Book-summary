## Shortform Introduction

_The Goal_ is a classic management text, and on Jeff Bezos’s short-list of books recommended to new managers.

The Goal is written in the form of an allegory, where a manufacturing plant manager has to reduce a large backlog of orders and improve factory throughput. Its management lessons are interwoven with the manager’s epiphanies. Because we felt the lessons were more important than the narrative, we’ve focused on the teachings and theory, and we’ve summarized the narrative in a chapter at the end.

What can you apply the lessons in this book to? It’s an easy leap to apply _The Goal_ to manufacturing, operations, supply chain, and automation problems.

It takes a bit more thinking to apply it to knowledge work, larger projects, or your personal life, but the principles are generalizable. To really get the most out of this _The Goal_ book summary, think constantly about how you can apply it to your own situation - whether that’s closing sales clients, creating software products, managing a team, or writing books.

Take the advice of Ray Dalio in _Principles_ : view yourself top-down as a machine, digesting inputs and creating outputs. From this perspective, you’ll be capable of studying and optimizing yourself.
