## Part 6: Miscellaneous Notes

### Misleading Accounting Disguises Progress

Measurements like financial accounting should induce the organization to do what’s good for itself. But as you improve throughput, traditional accounting measures may make your situation look worse than it really is.

Examples:

  * Inventory is usually marked as assets, and reducing inventory will show up as a loss in assets.
  * Drum-buffer-rope will cause idle time at non-bottlenecks, thus decreasing local efficiencies.
  * Consuming surplus inventory (beyond that determined by drum-buffer-rope) will decrease local efficiencies.
  * Decreasing batch sizes increases setup time and overhead, thus increasing apparent cost-per-part. 



However, these are usually temporary adjustments. Remember, **what really matters is the total throughput of the system - increase that, and you’ll be able to make more sales**. Over time you’ll enjoy lower inventory costs and faster lead times, which improve topline sales. The financials will look healthier in the long-term.

### Management Tips

The manager’s job is to answer three questions: “what to change?” “what to change to?” “How to cause the change?”

Don’t delude yourself into believing the problem doesn’t exist. Management speak can disguise real problems and goals. Why do people use it?

  * It disguises bad news (“our margins are down, but we make up for it with improved operational efficiency, which will help us reach our cost opportunity.”)
  * It’s a shibboleth that conveys belonging to a group and signals expertise.



If you successfully improve the bottleneck and increase capacity beyond market demand, a natural reaction of managers is to downsize the capacity. This punishes the workers who just helped the company improve, and makes the organization resist future improvement. Instead, to make better use of the now-increased capacity, encourage more sales to use the improved performance.

### Distilling Facts into Principles

Collecting too much information without identifying the **underlying intrinsic order** leads to false patterns and bad decision making.

Before the periodic table, it was unclear how one should understand the chemical elements. By color? State of matter? Instead, Mendeleev organized the elements first by atomic weight, then by reactivity (eg sodium and potassium behave similarly when thrown in water). This even allowed prediction of elements that didn’t yet exist.

To find the underlying intrinsic order, **start from simpler If-Then principles**. Only then can you question, “if this is true, what can I predict to be true?” Then test these predictions and continue testing the hypothesis. (Shortform note: This section felt a bit shoehorned in by Goldratt as a pedagogical item.)
