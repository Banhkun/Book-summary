## Exercise: Name Your Just Cause

A Just Cause is a big-picture vision that provides a framework for your corporate strategies. A Just Cause outlines the reason you are in business beyond the provision of any one specific product or service; it is the vision your product or service exists to support.

* * *

Write down your company’s Just Cause. Think beyond your product or service—ask yourself what larger need your product or service answers (remember the example of the railroad companies, who should have seen themselves as _transportation providers_ rather than _sellers of train tickets_).

How do your company’s current operations support this Just Cause? How might these operations be adjusted to _better_ support it?
