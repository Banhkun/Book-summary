## Exercise: Align Your Just Cause to Your Actions

To truly lead with an infinite mindset, your Just Cause must be more than merely words; you must act on it. Otherwise, it’s nothing but a marketing slogan.

* * *

Think of a company—either one you’ve worked for or one you’re familiar with—that does things that don’t align with their stated mission. (For example, you might think of a national company that advertises excellent worker relations but is often in the press with labor problems, or a local restaurant that proclaims their commitment to customer service but employs surly waiters.)

How has this company experienced negative consequences of the misalignment of its actions with its stated beliefs? (Does it get bad reviews? Does it have high employee turnover?)

How would you advise that company to change if you were in charge? What steps would you take to align the organization’s actions with its Just Cause?
