## Exercise: Plan for an Existential Pivot

An _existential pivot_ is a purposeful, dramatic change that a person willingly makes in order to stay true to her Just Cause. It’s a move that pushes her out of her comfort zone and carries a risk of failure but is necessary in order for her to continue to play an infinite game.

* * *

Describe a fundamental change that you anticipate coming to your industry. It might be technological, political, or market-based. (Have fun with this, if needed: If there’s nothing you’re currently anticipating, imagine something that _might_ possibly happen, if something changes in the wider world.)

What might you do to prepare your company for this change? How might you adapt in order to stay true to your Just Cause and continue to provide a solution for the greater need you’ve identified, over and above your specific product or service?
