## Exercise: Identify Problems and Practice Looping

Dignan emphasizes the importance of enabling autonomy and flexibility as the foundation for making reforms in an organization. To guide more specific changes, Dignan recommends the process of looping—experimenting with new practices and assessing how well they work for your group. Looping begins with identifying areas that present a challenge or conflict.

* * *

Think about your role within an organization (your workplace, a nonprofit, or a community group), and write down one area that prevents you from doing your best work. This could be your relationship with a superior, your schedule, or a tedious bureaucratic requirement.

How is this problem area linked to individual autonomy or the group’s flexibility? For example, if long meetings hinder your work, this might be linked to your autonomy because you don’t have the authority to speak up about how the meeting isn’t relevant to you, or it could be linked to the group’s flexibility because there’s no system in place for changing meeting structures.

Now think of a small experiment that your organization, or a sub-group of it, could conduct to address the problem area you identified. Write a brief description of the new policy, structure, or process and a proposed timeline. For example, “Try an experiment for one month where we conduct meetings asynchronously.”

How would the experiment change your experience within the organization, and how might it impact other peoples’ experiences?
