## Exercise: Prepare for a Successful Progressive Overload Workout Program

Prepare for your progressive overload workout program to get maximum strength gains efficiently and effectively.

* * *

Reflect on your current lifestyle and schedule. Matthews recommends you train at least three times a week. What are some ways you can make time for these workout sessions?

Write down one potential obstacle that may make it hard for you to stick with your workout program. How might you find ways to overcome this obstacle? For example, if you donâ€™t live near a gym, you might consider buying some basic equipment.

Write down some pushing, pulling, and squatting exercises you plan on trying.

Now, decide on the date you want to start your workout program. What's one action you can take this week to start preparing for it? For example, you could find a workout buddy or set up your home gym.
