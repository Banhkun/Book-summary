## 1-Page Summary

According to Barbara Oakley, anyone can master any subject by applying good study techniques. You don’t have to be gifted or have natural abilities in a particular subject to excel at it. All you have to do is apply the study techniques that we’ll present in this guide.

Oakley attests to this based on personal experience. From childhood through her career in the US Army, she struggled with technical subjects. However, recognizing the benefits of technical competence, she set out to overcome her technophobia and eventually earned a doctorate in systems engineering.

In _Learning How to Learn_ , she teamed up with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski to dig into the neuroscience behind how you learn and relate it to practical study techniques. In this guide, we’ve extracted their key study tips and techniques to make them even more accessible and grouped the tips according to the neurological concepts that they’re based on.

The book was originally targeted at pre-teen students, but the authors’ study tips, and the neuroscience behind them, are applicable to students of any age. We’ve prepared this guide in a style suited to high school and college students.

(Shortform note: _Learning How to Learn_ is, in some ways, a follow-up to Oakley’s earlier book _A Mind for Numbers_. _Learning How to Learn_ covers a slightly narrower scope, but it goes into more detail about the neurological basis of learning. For example, in _A Mind for Numbers_ , Oakley discusses the concept of chunking and the make-up of habits, which she leaves out of _Learning How to Learn_. But in _A Mind for Numbers_ , she doesn’t discuss the growth of dendritic spines on neurons, which, as we’ll explain in this guide, is an important concept in _Learning How to Learn_.)

### Strengthen Your Learning by Strengthening Your Synapses

Oakley and Sejnowski suggest a number of learning strategies and tips that take advantage of the way information is stored in your brain.

As you think, brain cells called neurons make connections with each other, creating a neural pattern or pathway that represents the information in your brain. The connections between the neurons that make up this pathway are called _synapses_. The more synapses a certain idea produces in your brain, the better you’ll learn it, because it’s connected to more different neurons, giving your brain more neural pathways it can use to retrieve it. In this section, we’ll explore the authors’ tips for using the process of synapse formation to maximize your learning.

#### Embrace a Multisensory Learning Style

Oakley and Sejnowski’s first tip for improving your learning by building more connections is to embrace multisensory learning because the more senses you engage in learning something, the better you’ll learn it. Depending on your preferred learning style, you might learn something better if it's presented visually, rather than verbally, or vice versa. But **regardless of your learning style, you’ll learn it even better if you see it _and_ hear it than if you only receive it in one style.**

The reason for this, as Oakley and Sejnowski explain, is that connecting an idea to inputs from more senses creates more synaptic connections in more neural pathways in your brain. This makes it easier to learn and remember because there are more neural pathways your brain can use to retrieve the idea.

> **Connecting Your Brain**
> 
> In _The Whole Brain Child_ , neuroscientist Dan Siegel and parenting coach Tina Bryson extend the concept of multisensory learning in two ways:
> 
> First, they generalize “senses” to thoughts and perceptions that aren’t just sensory (like emotion and logic). Whenever applicable, try to “feel” what you’re learning about emotionally as well as tactilely. Try to “see” its logical makeup as well as its appearance. Incorporating these additional senses will create more synaptic connections, which will strengthen your learning even more.
> 
> Second, they emphasize the importance of making mental connections between different thoughts that are processed in different parts of the brain (like different senses, emotions, and analytical thoughts) as a way to improve your mental health _as a whole_ , not just to learn a given subject. The more your synapses connect different parts of your brain, the more easily you can access your whole brain and harness all its capabilities. This helps you control your emotions and relate to other people, in addition to helping you learn more easily.

#### Make Up Metaphors

Another tip Oakley and Sejnowski provide is that you can more easily **add things to your memory by relating them to things already in your memory through metaphors**. Again, this is because your thoughts are based on neural connections. Connecting a new chain of synapses to an existing one makes the new one easier to retrieve.

The authors emphasize a number of key techniques for making your metaphors as memorable as possible, which we’ll discuss in turn. First and foremost, they recommend you **create mental pictures to represent the concept you’re learning,_especially_ if the concept isn’t visual** to begin with. Pictures are easier to commit to memory than abstract facts like numbers and dates. So if you can link a new fact to a mental picture, you not only create more neural connections, but you connect it to something (namely the picture) that’s easy to retrieve from memory.

(Shortform note: We might infer that pictures are more memorable because they provide more neural connections, and they provide more connections because they take more neurons to store and process. According to John Medina, author of _Brain Rules_ , about 50% of all your brain’s neurons are devoted to processing visual information—a testament to the dominance of our sense of vision over our other senses.)

The authors also note that you can use acronyms or mnemonics to create metaphors, and you can make your metaphors even more memorable if you make them humorous. (Shortform note: Although there is extensive research demonstrating that funny ideas are more memorable, scientists have yet to explain _why_ humor is easier to remember.)

For example, if you’re trying to memorize the biological taxonomy, you could come up with the mnemonic sentence “King Phillip cleaned orange fungus off Jenny’s spectacles,” where King = kingdom, Phillip = phylum, cleaned = class, orange = order, Jenny = genus, spectacles = species. This connects the abstract taxonomy to a scene you can visualize. Then, to make it even more memorable, you add more sensory detail and humor: What does the fungus smell like? Why did Jenny have orange fungus on her spectacles? (There could be a comical backstory behind that.)

> **Use the Power of Metaphors Wisely**
> 
> Tony Robbins, author of _Awaken the Giant Within_ discusses how metaphors not only have the power to make ideas more memorable, but to shape your perception of the ideas themselves. He says that if you analyze the metaphors you (or others around you) use and change them to be more accurate or more positive, you can improve your understanding of the subject or your attitude toward it.
> 
> For example, scientists used to visualize atoms as microscopic solar systems, with electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. But this metaphor subconsciously constrained them to think of electrons traveling in circular orbits like planets, which turned out not to be the case; instead, electron orbits can take a variety of shapes, depending on the number of electrons in the atom and their energy level. To advance their understanding of atomic structure, scientists had to move away from the solar system metaphor—instead, they now visualize electron orbits more like standing waves.

#### Skim Books First

As another tip, when you read a book (or an article, a chapter, or any other reading assignment), Oakley and Sejnowski recommend that you **first skim through it, looking at headings and pictures to get a general sense of what it’s about before you read it in detail**. This helps you absorb the material better because, as we’ve discussed, it’s easier to embed something in your memory (like the details of the book) if you relate it to something that’s already there (the information you got from skimming).

(Shortform note: For this reason, most speed reading courses teach you to skim a book before you read it in detail. Even before scientists understood the neurological basis, 20th-century philosopher Mortimer Adler presented skimming as a way to understand the crux of a book within 15 minutes and better remember what you read in _How to Read a Book_.)

#### Diversify Your Studies

Oakley and Sejnowski’s final tip on how to take advantage of your brain’s information storage processes is to introduce variety into your studies. Just like taking a multisensory approach or making up metaphors, diversifying your studies connects what you’re learning to more neural pathways, which helps you learn it better by building more synapse connections. The authors explore three separate ways to introduce variety into your studies.

##### **Study in a Variety of Locations**

According to Oakley and Sejnowski, if you always study a certain subject in the same place, your brain may make neural connections between that subject and that place. These connections make it harder to recall what you studied when you’re in a different setting (for example, if you only ever study in your bedroom, you might struggle to recall the information at a testing center). **By studying a subject in a variety of environments, you ensure that your brain doesn’t associate the subject with any particular environment.** That way, you’ll be able to recall the information no matter where you are rather than only remembering it when you’re in a certain place.

> **Make Ideas Stand Out From Your Surroundings**
> 
> Oakley and Sejnowski don’t specify if there are particular settings that are more effective in enhancing memory, but other research addresses this issue. One psychological study showed that objects that seem out of place in a given setting are more likely to be remembered than objects that fit the setting.
> 
> To take advantage of this fact, try **studying something in a location** **where you wouldn’t normally encounter it** to strengthen your memory of it as much as possible**.** For example, if you normally study math in the library and wouldn’t normally think of using math out in the woods, try taking a hike with your math book and practicing your calculations in the great outdoors.

##### Interleave Your Study Problems

Another way to diversify your studies is by interleaving. Oakley and Sejnowski explain that “interleaving” means practicing an assortment of problems covering the full range of problem-solving techniques you’ve learned, instead of only practicing one technique at a time. For example, let’s say you’re learning arithmetic. You’ve already learned how to add and subtract, and now you’re studying multiplication. But when you study, you mix in some addition and subtraction problems to practice along with your multiplication problems.

The authors say the reason this helps is that **deciding what technique to use on a given problem is just as important (and sometimes more difficult) than applying the technique to solve the problem.** Mixing up your studies with interleaving gives you practice recognizing different kinds of problems that require different approaches. This gives you a better understanding of the context in which each solution method is applicable, which, in turn, helps you relate the different methods to each other. These additional connections in your mind make all the techniques more accessible in your memory.

(Shortform note: Other studies of the effectiveness of interleaving corroborate Oakley and Sejnowski’s advice, highlighting that interleaved study promotes better retention, especially in the long term. In one study, students who were assigned interleaved review problems scored better on tests than students whose review assignments did not include interleaving. Further, if the test was delayed for 30 days, average test scores dropped about 18 percentage points for students who did not practice interleaving, but only six percentage points for students who practiced interleaving.)

##### Study Something Different for a Change

Oakley and Sejnowski warn that once you become an expert in a certain field of study, it’s easy to get stuck in a rut, where you can’t come up with any new insights. To combat this, they recommend studying a completely different subject for a while. That way, **you’ll naturally relate the new concepts that you learn back to what you already know, giving you new insights.**

(Shortform note: Other authors, such as Ozan Varol, refer to the practice of combining or connecting dissimilar ideas to advance your learning as “combinatory play.” Many successful people make use of combinatory play. For example, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull set up a program called “Pixar University” that enables Pixar employees to take classes in subjects like sculpting or juggling that would normally be considered outside the scope of their work. Exploring new subjects leads to more creative insights that enhance their work.)

### Stimulate Learning by Stimulating Neuron Growth

We’ve discussed some techniques for connecting information to build stronger synapse chains in your brain. Oakley and Sejnowski also discuss how you can strengthen these synapse chains by stimulating growth in parts of your neurons.

To understand how these techniques improve your learning, you have to understand the anatomy of a neuron. The authors explain that every neuron has one arm called an “axon” and multiple arms called “dendrites.” The dendrites are covered with tiny dendritic spines. The axon of one neuron will transmit electrical signals to be picked up by the dendritic spines of other nearby neurons. The gap between the axon (sender) and the dendritic spines (receivers) that the signal jumps across is the synapse. The more spines there are on a dendrite of a receiving neuron and the closer they are to an axon sending a signal, the stronger the synapse. And, as we’ve said, stronger synapses make it easier to recall the information that they contain.

![learningtolearn_neuron1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/learningtolearn_neuron1.png)

> **Myelin Also Helps Synapse Strength**
> 
> In _Make it Stick_ , Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel note that synapse strength is enhanced by myelin, a substance that sometimes coats axons. Myelin acts like insulation on a wire, preventing signals from dissipating into their surroundings. This keeps the signal strong and ensures that it’s transmitted to the right dendritic receptors. So if you have more myelin on your neurons, your synapses will be stronger.
> 
> Roediger and McDaniel also report that the more you practice a skill, the thicker a myelin coating becomes, furthering Oakey and Sejnowski’s claims that you can take purposeful actions to strengthen your synapse connections.

#### Exercise Between Study Sessions

The authors’ first tip for promoting neuron growth is to exercise between study sessions. They assert that **interspersing exercise with your studies can make your studying more effective** because physical fitness promotes neural health. Specifically, exercise causes your body to produce a hormone called BDNF, which stimulates the growth of dendritic spines on neurons, strengthening your synapses.

(Shortform note: Kelly McGonigal elaborates on this concept in _The Joy of Movement_. She explains that BDNF is part of a class of chemicals called _myokines_ that your muscles produce during physical exercise. These myokines circulate through your bloodstream and stimulate various parts of your body, including your brain. She asserts that myokines not only increase your cognitive performance, but also alleviate both physical pain and emotional depression. As such, she shows how exercise can help you improve many areas of your life, not just your test scores.)

#### Test Yourself With Active Recall

Oakley and Sejnowski’s next tip is that **the most effective form of studying is _active recall._ **Active recall consists of deliberately reproducing or rephrasing ideas from memory,**** rather than passively rereading them from your notes or other sources. Active recall can take a variety of forms, depending on what you’re studying: If you’re memorizing facts, try to recite them or write them down from memory—don’t just reread them in your textbook or from your notes. If you’re learning a problem-solving technique, work through a problem with it—don’t just read an example solution. If you’re learning a hands-on skill, practice doing the work—don’t just watch someone else do it.

As Oakley and Sejnowski explain, the common theme here is that you’ll always learn more by actively practicing than by passively studying because **active recall initiates the growth of dendritic spines, which strengthens synaptic connections** in ways that passive learning doesn’t.

> **The Testing Effect**
> 
> In psychology, the principle that active recall is more effective than passive studying is known as the “testing effect” because it was initially studied using tests: The researcher would present the same material to two groups of students. One group would then take a test on the material, while the other group would not. Later, both groups would be tested on the material, and the group that took the first test would do better.
> 
> Recent studies have shown that the same holds true for other methods of active recall. For example, one study demonstrated the effectiveness of having students write down whatever they could remember after reading an assignment.

#### Practice Spaced Repetition

Another tip from Oakley and Sejnowski is to **study a little every day,** rather than cramming before a test or trying to do all your studying in one big session. They call this “spaced repetition,” and assert that spreading out your studies like this gives the synapse chains that represent what you’re learning time to grow and solidify in your mind.

(Shortform note: While other authors corroborate Oakley and Sejnowski’s point, some studies also show that you can take it too far. Studies show that there’s an optimal point for how much you split up your studying: You’ll learn better by studying in multiple sessions spread out over a period of time than in one big cram session, but if you split up your studying into _too many_ short sessions, this can also make your studying less effective.)

#### Get Enough Sleep

The authors’ final tip on how to encourage neuron growth is to get enough sleep. They say sleep is the key to making your studies effective because **sleep plays several important roles in learning and brain function** :

As we’ve discussed, active recall initiates growth of new dendritic spines, which strengthen synaptic connections, solidifying ideas in your brain. However, Oakley and Sejnowski note that while active recall _initiates_ this growth, dendritic spines only grow _when you sleep_. Additionally, while you sleep, unused dendritic spines get cleared away, allowing your brain to divert energy to strengthening the connections you use most. Thus, without adequate sleep, you won’t be able to advance in your learning, because you won’t be able to strengthen your synaptic connections.

> **Sleep Can Repair Information**
> 
> In _Why We Sleep_ , Matthew Walker provides additional insight on the importance of sleep for learning. He notes that sleep improves your brain’s long-term retention of important facts and allows it to eliminate trivial facts, as we’d expect from Oakley and Sejnowski’s description of sleep’s effect on dendritic spines.
> 
> Walker goes on to emphasize that your brain has a remarkable capability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information while you’re asleep. This allows your brain to distill information down to its essence and to repair damaged information. So if you sleep after studying, you’ll wake up with a better understanding of the concepts, and you’ll be able to fill in gaps that you couldn’t remember before.

##### Sleep Reorganizes Information to Help You Remember

According to Oakley and Sejnowski, sleep is also essential for organizing information in your memory. They explain that as you learn new things, new synapse chains initially form in the hippocampus, a part of your brain near the center of your head where new neuron growth is particularly active. Thus, your hippocampus acts as an initial staging area for information that you store in long-term memory. When you sleep, your brain copies the new synapse patterns from your hippocampus to your cerebral cortex, where they are consolidated and preserved for the long term. This makes room for more new patterns to be formed in the hippocampus.

(Shortform note: In _Moonwalking with Einstein_ , Joshua Foer cites studies that observed this process in rats, and adds a nuance to the principle. Specifically, the studies showed that the rats’ synapses fired in identical patterns while running a maze exercise and while sleeping after the maze exercise. We can infer that this activity represents the copying process that Oakley and Sejnowski describe. Foer asserts that this process _consolidates the information_ , rather than just moves it around. Therefore, not only does the information get preserved in long-term memory, but it also gets stored in a more compact, well-organized way.)

##### Sleep Cleanses Your Brain

Another reason sleep is crucial for learning, according to the authors, is that **it helps manage toxins that your neurons generate as a byproduct of normal thought processes.** These toxins build up in your brain when you’re awake, but when you sleep, your brain flushes them out. Without adequate sleep, the toxins can build up to levels that inhibit certain brain functions, making it harder for you to learn.

Oakley and Sejnowski also caution that chronic sleep deprivation, and its resulting toxin buildup, can have additional negative effects on your body such as increased risk of cancer and mental illness.

(Shortform note: In _Why We Sleep_ , Matthew Walker identifies some additional problems that neurotoxins can cause when you don’t get enough sleep. He asserts that sleep deprivation inhibits your ability to focus, increases your reaction time, impairs your ability to control your emotions, increases your tendency to take risks, makes you more susceptible to addictions, and increases your likelihood of contemplating suicide. To highlight the significance of these problems, he cites statistics on traffic accidents and medical mistakes attributed to the driver or physician being sleep deprived.)

### Manipulate Your Modes of Thinking to Maximize Your Learning

Oakley and Sejnowski also offer a number of tips for enhancing your learning that are based on your brain’s ability to alternate between different modes of thinking. They assert that your brain operates in two separate modes, each of which contributes to learning and problem solving in different ways. They call these two modes “focused thinking” and “diffuse thinking.”

The authors explain that **focused thinking** happens when you focus on something, such as a specific problem you’re trying to solve. In this mode, your brain activity gets concentrated in a particular network of neurons (_which_ network depends on what you’re focusing on). Focused thinking can process information in detail, but it limits the scope of your thoughts to ideas that are already connected to that particular network.

They then explain that **diffuse thinking** happens when you let your mind wander, not focusing on anything in particular. In this mode, your brain activity is delocalized—it’s not concentrated in any particular network of neurons. Diffuse thinking doesn’t process information in detail, but it can link ideas from diverse parts of your brain to generate creative solutions or help you see the big picture.

> **Additional Modes of Thinking**
> 
> Oakley and Sejnowski’s descriptions of diffuse and focused thinking correspond to what psychologist Edward de Bono calls “lateral” and “vertical” thinking, respectively (as Oakley herself notes in _A Mind for Numbers_). However, there is a subtle difference in how de Bono distinguishes between the two modes: He identifies lateral (diffuse) thinking as a mechanism for generating new possibilities, while vertical (focused) thinking is a mechanism for analyzing possibilities and selecting between them.
> 
> Thus, Oakley and Sejnowski’s emphasis on using diffuse mode to generate creative solutions is consistent with de Bono’s presentation. But to Oakley and Sejnowski, the difference is between focusing on something and letting your mind wander, while to de Bono, it’s the difference between creatively generating new possibilities and analytically eliminating possibilities.
> 
> Nevertheless, the authors all agree that you must use both modes to solve any difficult problem. De Bono arguably makes an even stronger case for this than Oakley and Sejnowski, because you have to use vertical (focused) thinking to select or implement a solution, and you have to use lateral (diffuse) thinking to generate the solution or list of possible solutions before you select one to implement.
> 
> Oakley and Sejnowski present focused and diffuse thinking as the only modes of thinking: If you’re not focused on something, then you’re thinking in diffuse mode. But de Bono later goes on to define six modes of thinking, or “thinking hats,” as he calls them:
> 
>   * “Blue hat” thinking: You’re thinking about the big picture, your overall objectives, or how something fits into achieving them.
> 
>   * “White hat” thinking: You’re taking in objective information.
> 
>   * “Red hat” thinking: You’re considering how you feel about something, emotionally.
> 
>   * “Black hat” thinking: You’re looking for problems and risks, or voicing criticism.
> 
>   * “Yellow hat” thinking: You’re looking for benefits or voicing positive feedback.
> 
>   * “Green hat” thinking: You’re thinking outside the box, looking for original, creative ideas.
> 
> 


#### Alternate Between Focus and Rest

The authors’ first tip related to modes of thought is that you should **alternate between periods of intense mental focus and mental rest breaks.** This improves your ability to solve problems because it leverages the handoff between your two modes of thinking.

Here’s how this looks in practice. First, focus on your studies until you get stuck or stop making progress. This focused thinking enables you to _understand_ _the problem_ (which requires processing detailed information). Then, take a break and let your mind wander. This allows your diffuse mode to _find the solution_ when focused thinking no longer makes progress because the solution lies outside the active network. Finally, use focused thinking again to _implement the solution_ , since that also requires more detailed processing.

> **Additional Diffuse Thinking Tactics**
> 
> Other authors agree that your brain can only focus for a certain amount of time before you’ll get stuck, and they discuss additional diffuse thinking tactics to help your brain rest so that you can start making progress again after you get stuck. Two specific tactics they recommend are positive constructive daydreaming (PCD) and psychological halloweenism:
> 
>   * To practice PCD, first shift your attention to something that takes very little focus, such as walking or folding laundry. Then, deliberately imagine a scene that evokes positive, playful feelings, such as a fond childhood memory, or an imaginary vacation. From this starting point, let your thoughts turn inward and just follow your mind wherever it wanders. Studies show that this type of daydreaming is more likely to generate creative solutions, possibly because it makes you less prone to slip into unproductive worry when you let your mind wander.
> 
>   * To practice psychological halloweenism, imagine that you are someone else trying to solve the same problem. By putting yourself in someone else’s shoes, you may be able to see the problem from a different angle and come up with a creative solution.
> 
> 


#### Do the Hardest Problems First

Oakley and Sejnowski’s second tip for maximizing different modes of thinking is to **tackle the most difficult problems or subjects first** when you’re taking a test, doing homework, or studying. They give two reasons for this:

First, you’ve got a better chance of solving a problem when you’re fresh than after your brain starts to get tired.

Second, starting with the hardest problems gives you more time to solve them, which gives you more opportunities to alternate between focused and diffuse thinking. If you’re pressed for time, you can work on a hard problem until you get stuck, then solve an easier problem or two before you come back to the hard one. According to Oakley and Sejnowski, this isn’t quite as effective for diffuse thinking as taking an actual break, but it still stimulates some diffuse thinking that can help you find the solution.

(Shortform note: Some experts disagree with Oakley and Sejnowski on this. For example, authors Judi Kesselman-Turkel and Franklynn Peterson recommend solving the easy problems first. They argue that starting with the easy problems stimulates your brain, much like doing warm-up stretches before intensive exercise prepares your body for the exertion. Some standardized testing agencies also advise you to do the easy problems first because the test is timed, and you can get more points by answering all the easy questions than by spending all your time on a few hard ones.)

### Make Efficient Use of Your Memory

Finally, let’s discuss some tips that are based on making the best use of your brain’s memory. Oakley and Sejnowski note that your brain has two different types of memory: working memory and long-term memory.

Your working memory resides in your prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain just behind your eyes). It holds whatever you’re actively thinking about at the moment, and tends to drop any neural connections that go unused for more than about ten seconds. On average, it can only hold about four ideas (or active chains of synapses) at once.

(Shortform note: Different studies have come up with different numbers for how many ideas your working memory can hold at once. In the 1950s, researchers thought working memory could hold about seven ideas, but by the early 2000s, studies indicated it could hold only about four. Today, there is still little agreement on a definite number—some studies indicate working memory can hold two or three ideas at the same time, while others suggest it might be as high as six.)

On the other hand, your long-term memory resides in your cerebral cortex (the outer part of your brain), although the synapse chains for long-term memories initially form in your hippocampus. It can hold an unlimited amount of information and ideas and store them indefinitely, but to think about any of them, you have to load them into working memory.

> **Types of Long-Term Memory**
> 
> Oakley and Sejnowski’s description of long-term memory correlates with other authors’ descriptions of a specific type of long-term memory called “declarative memory.”
> 
> In _Moonwalking with Einstein_ , Joshua Foer says your long-term memory is divided into “declarative” memory and “nondeclarative” memory. Declarative memories consist of facts and experiences that you can consciously recall. Foer says declarative memories are stored in synapse chains that form in your hippocampus. This matches Oakley and Sejnowski’s description.
> 
> Meanwhile, nondeclarative memory holds information that you access subconsciously. This includes motor skills (like riding a bike) and your basic sense of self. Foer says these memories are formed in other parts of the brain, such as the neocortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. This is something Oakley and Sejnowski don’t discuss.

#### Avoid Distractions

Oakley and Sejnowski’s first tip on how to efficiently use your brain’s two types of memory is to **eliminate distractions while you’re studying**. Distractions tie up some of the limited capacity of your working memory. Since you learn by connecting ideas in working memory, reducing the amount of working memory that you have available will slow down your learning.

Thus, the authors recommend that when studying, you might, for example, silence your cell phone, turn off the TV, find a quiet place to study, or set aside a certain time block so you can tell your friends not to disturb you during that time.

> **Types of Distractions and What to Do About Them**
> 
> In his book _Indistractable_ , Nir Eyal provides a systematic approach to eliminating distractions. First, he observes that distractions tend to come from either people or technology. Then, he identifies the four most common distractions of each type and offers advice on how to eliminate them.
> 
> Eyal says people-based distractions typically come in the form of in-person interruptions, email, chat/text, and meetings. He recommends managing them by reserving specific blocks of time in your day for dealing with these kinds of communications and keeping people informed of when you are and are not available.
> 
> Technology-based distractions typically come from your smartphone, desktop clutter, articles, and social media. Eyal recommends deleting apps that you don’t need, blocking or disabling most automatic notifications, and keeping anything that you don't need for what you’re currently working on out of sight instead of leaving it open on your desktop where it could distract you.

#### Avoid Multitasking

The other tip the authors provide based on types of memory is to **avoid multitasking.** When you work on multiple tasks in parallel, you are constantly shifting your focus from one to the other. Every time you switch from one task to the other, your brain has to clear your working memory and load different information into it. This takes mental energy, so the more you multitask, the more you wear yourself out mentally.

(Shortform note: Like Oakley and Sejnowski, Brian Tracy argues that multitasking reduces your productivity. Specifically, he claims that after being interrupted or shifting your focus, it takes about 17 minutes to fully refocus on the task at hand. Based on the neurological model that Oakey presents, we’d say this 17-minute period is the time it takes your working memory to reload all the synapse chains that you need.
