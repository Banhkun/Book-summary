## Exercise: Alternate Between Focused and Diffuse Thinking

Oakley and Sejnowski say that alternating between focused and diffuse thinking is important for stimulating creativity and problem-solving. In this exercise, youâ€™ll optimize your schedule to promote alternating between modes of thinking.

* * *

Of the things on your to-do list this week, which ones will require intensive focus? (For example, doing your taxes.)

Which tasks on your to-do list do _not_ require intensive focus? (For example, doing the laundry).

How can you optimize your schedule to alternate between focused-mode and diffuse-mode thinking this week? (For example, maybe you plan to do your federal income taxes first, then do your laundry, and then do your state taxes.)
