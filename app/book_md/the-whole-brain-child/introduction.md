## Introduction

When your child throws a tantrum or refuses to share a toy with her brother, your challenge, as a parent, is not only to manage the conflict, but also—ideally—to teach your child a valuable life lesson. You may try reasoning with her and explaining why it’s important to share, but your logic doesn’t get through to her. It may feel like the best you can do is to find a way to end the argument. However, **with some basic understanding of your child’s developing brain, you can approach challenging situations with the tools to turn them into teachable moments.**

Different regions of the brain manage different functions. For example, the right side of the brain is associated with creativity and big-picture thinking, while the left side of the brain is logic-oriented. Keeping a balance between complementary parts of the brain helps you navigate life with even-mindedness. In contrast, when one part of the brain dominates, you lose mental and emotional equilibrium. In children, this lack of integration leads to tantrums, irrational anxiety, and general misbehavior. **Through the whole-brain approach, you’ll learn to recognize when your child’s mind is off-balance, and how to guide her back to integration.**

In the process, your child will learn about her own mind and emotions, which leads to long-term benefits, including:

  * A stronger relationship and increased mutual understanding between you and your child
  * Increased self-awareness and emotional self-control in your child, which makes parenting easier overall 
  * A solid foundation for a lifetime of mental and emotional stability
  * A blueprint for healthy relationships
  * A legacy of mental and emotional tools that your child can teach to her children, who can teach their children, and so on



The book’s authors draw on their decades of experience as child and adolescent psychotherapists, as researchers and educators who teach parents and childcare professionals about children’s developing brains, and as parents. **The brain science is presented simply, and it’s coupled with practical applications for children of different ages, with a focus on infancy to early adolescence.**

The authors first explain the concept of integration—of maintaining balance between complementary regions of the brain—which is at the core of the whole-brain philosophy. With that foundation, they then explore:

  * How to integrate the left (logical) and right (creative) sides of the brain
  * How to integrate the “upstairs” (thoughtful and analytical) and “downstairs” (primitive and impulsive) parts of the brain
  * How to help your child process scary or painful memories
  * How to help your child reflect on their state of mind
  * How to help your child build healthy relationships



You’ll also gain insight into your own emotions, and you can apply many of the same strategies that you teach your child yourself. In fact, **when you model self-awareness and emotional processing yourself, it helps your child to adopt those habits more effectively.** Using the integration techniques will also help you to keep a cool head and calmly use these strategies in the midst of your child’s meltdown.
