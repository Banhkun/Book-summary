## Chapter 4: Integrating Implicit and Explicit Memories

Downstairs-brain and right-brain takeovers are usually triggered by something in the _present_ —but, sometimes, your child may have a strong and unexpected reaction to something because of something in the _past_. For example, if your child normally loves swimming, but she’s refusing to take swimming lessons, it’s possible that **a past experience is haunting your child and making her act irrationally without her realizing why.**

In order to explain this, first we’ll explore two _myths_ about memory, and the _truth_ about how memory actually works. Then, we’ll explain how subconscious memories affect your child’s behavior, and how you can help.

### How Memory Works

There are a few common myths about memory that hinder people’s ability to understand and manage their memories. Just like the other brain functions we’ve discussed, when you know how your brain stores and processes memories, you can prevent them from controlling you.

#### Myth #1: Your Memory Is an Organized Record of Your Experiences

The first myth is that your memory is like a filing cabinet that holds an organized record of all your life experiences. In reality, **memory is a network of associations you make among the thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations that comprise an experience.**

Every experience causes neurons (brain cells) to fire off electrical signals in response to particular smells, sights, tastes, sounds, sensations, emotions, or thoughts. For example, certain neurons fire because your child hears a whistle, others fire in response to the anxiety she feels because her swim instructor is forcing her to jump into the deep end. **All those neurons firing at the same time become linked in the brain, creating associations** —your swim instructor blowing the whistle for you to jump in the pool—**which you recall as a memory.**

The more often certain neurons fire together, the stronger the association becomes. Eventually, one sensation triggers your child to expect the second sensation, and she can’t hear a whistle without feeling anxious. In other words, **your child’s past experiences and the associations they’ve created directly impact how she perceives each present moment.**

#### Myth #2: Your Memory Is an Accurate Record

Have you ever been talking about a shared memory with a friend and found out that she remembers the event differently? Memories are not accurate records of events—in fact, every time you remember something, the act of recalling the memory alters it.

Just as your mood and thoughts _during the experience_ become encoded as part of the memory, your state of mind when you _recall_ the event becomes associated with the memory, as well. **Sometimes the mood and environment you’re in when you remember something can alter the memory significantly.**

### The Power of Implicit Memory

There are two types of memory:

  1. **An explicit memory is one that you deliberately recall** , which is typically what people are referring to when they talk about memories. 
  2. **An implicit memory is knowledge that you draw upon without even thinking about it.** For example, skills such as driving a car are _procedural_ implicit memories because you don’t have to think about what you’re doing every time you step on the gas or hit your turn signal. Implicit memories also include a process called _priming_ , in which a child’s earliest memories form the foundation for how she’ll view the world for the rest of her life—whether her parents are attentive or indifferent, their treatment will dictate her expectations in future relationships.



(Shortform note: A third type of implicit memory is called _classical conditioning_ , which is when an association forms between two stimuli and causes you to respond in a certain way. Physiologist Ivan Pavlov discovered classical conditioning in his famous dog-treat experiment. The integration strategies we’ll discuss will target this type of implicit memory.)

All of the individual sensations, thoughts, and emotions associated with a memory are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When you think or talk about an experience, you integrate all the pieces to form a complete picture of the memory in the context of your life story. However, if you don’t integrate the memory—because the experience was scary or painful—then the pieces float around your brain in a jumble.**** When you have unintegrated implicit memories, the associations among the sensations, thoughts, and emotions are still intact. **This means that a present experience can trigger an emotion,** **but you don’t know why.**

Unintegrated memories can create anxiety around everyday activities, injure your child’s self-confidence, and impede her ability to trust others. **As long as your child is unaware of the source of the fear, anxiety, or anger that her unintegrated memories are triggering, then she remains a victim of them.** This can cause sleep issues, phobias, and other physical, mental, and emotional problems.

### Helping Your Child Integrate Memories

**Teach your child to regain control of her emotions by becoming aware of the memory and how it’s affecting her, and by integrating the memory through telling the story of the experience.** When she integrates her memories, she fleshes out the big picture of her life experiences, and she can separate the emotions of her past experience from her current experience.

As a parent, help your child take control of her memory and her present experience using these steps:

  1. **Explain that your brain remembers things even when you don’t realize it** , and that these memories can make you feel a certain way because of something that happened in the past.
  2. **Suggest that this could be happening now, and that may be why your child is feeling the way she’s feeling.** Help her to tell the story of the sad, scary, or frustrating experience that’s impacting her now. As we talked about in Chapter 2, telling the story will help your child integrate her left and right brains, and it will lessen the memory’s emotional power over her.
  3. **Talk about all the ways her experience will be different this time around**. For example, if your child is nervous about swim lessons, point out that she already knows how to swim and she’ll have different instructors.
  4. **Ask her to think of all the positive memories she has associated with this activity** , so that she can focus on those instead of the negative memory.
  5. **Tell her that she can talk to her brain.** She can thank her brain for trying to warn and protect her, and then she can tell her brain all the reasons that this experience will be different. 
  6. **Help her to come up with a code word or phrase to remind her** brain of all this if she starts to get anxious again later. 



### Implicit Memory Strategy #1: Give Your Child a Memory Remote Control

When parts of the memory are scary or painful for your child to recollect, she may not want to revisit it. **In order to help your child get through the memory, give her an imaginary remote control that gives her the power to pause the story before it gets scary and fast-forward through the difficult portions.** This tactic gives your child some control and allows her to confront the memory at her own pace. After you’ve made it through the story once, suggest to your child that you rewind to the parts of the story that you skipped past the first time. If your child isn’t ready to revisit the difficult parts of the memory yet, don’t push it—but, eventually, it’s essential that she tells the entire story.

Your child will need to go through the story multiple times, whenever the emotions from that memory start creeping back in. Over time, the memory will lose its power over the present as it becomes integrated into your child’s personal narrative.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : At this age, your child may be more captivated by the storytelling and less interested in pausing or fast-forwarding. Your child may simply want you to repeat the story over and over again. Although this can be tedious for you, remember that it’s important for your child’s development.

**Ages 3-6** : Your preschool-aged child probably loves telling stories, so encourage her to do it as much as possible. Have your child tell stories about any experience she has, with a special focus on significant events that you want her to remember.

**Ages 6-12** : Your child may be more reluctant to revisit scary or painful memories, so it can help to explain to her why it’s so important to put the puzzle pieces of her memory together. Emphasize that the remote control gives her the power to control the story.

### Implicit Memory Strategy #2: Practice Remembering

Help your child have fewer unintegrated implicit memories in the first place by getting her to process experiences as they happen. **Encourage your child to develop a habit of remembering things by frequently asking her questions about her day, her experiences, and her thoughts and feelings.**

Instead of vague questions (such as, “How was your day?”), ask more specific questions (such as, “What were the best and hardest parts of your day?”) that require more focused remembering. If your child is reluctant to talk, you can:

  * **Make it a ritual.** For example, each night at dinner, have your child share the happiest part of her day, the hardest part, and one kind thing she did.
  * **Turn it into a game.** For example, ask your child to tell you two things that happened to her that day and one thing that didn’t, and then you have to guess which one isn’t true.
  * **Encourage your child to journal.** Simply recalling and expressing experiences and emotions—even without another person to respond—integrates those memories. Research shows that journaling also benefits the heart, immune system, and overall health. 
  * **Work together to create a memory book** , which can include photos, keepsakes, and captions. This works especially well to memorialize events, such as summer camp or a vacation, which you and your child will enjoy revisiting later. 
  * **Watch home videos and look at photos together** , and talk about the moments they captured. 



#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Keep questions simple. Ask your child about what happened that day. Help her recall certain details, and prompt her to fill in others.

**Ages 3-6** : Play memory games in which your child has to connect photos with certain memories. When it comes to significant events that you want to ensure your child remembers, take turns sharing memorable details.

**Ages 6-9** : Whether you’re at the dinner table, in the car, or getting ready for bedtime, make a habit of asking questions to encourage your child to recount details of her day and experiences.

**Ages 9-12** : Continue the habit of asking questions and showing interest when your child talks about her experiences. Create a scrapbook together, or encourage her to keep a journal.

### Parents Must Integrate Their Implicit Memories

The longer you live, the more memories you acquire, and the greater the potential for unintegrated implicit memories to influence your day-to-day life. It’s important for all adults to identify and integrate unprocessed memories, but the stakes are higher for parents, because:

  1. Children can sense their parents’ emotions. You may be smiling and playing with your child, and she can still pick up on your underlying stress or fear—even if you’re not consciously aware that you’re feeling that way. **It’s difficult for your child to feel happy or at ease when you’re upset.**
  2. **Implicit memories can trigger emotions that negatively affect how you interact with your child.** Your child may say or do something that triggers you to lash out, overreact, or withdraw. 



If you notice yourself reacting in a way that doesn’t suit the situation, reflect on your behavior. First, check in with yourself, as you would with your child: Are you overly tired, hungry, or upset about something else? Then, if those factors don’t entirely explain your feelings and behavior, consider whether an implicit memory is affecting you.

Ask yourself if this situation is reminding you of something in your past. Reflect upon your own childhood, your relationship with your parents, and other memories that may be pertinent. If you hit upon something, journal, think through the memory, or tell the story to someone. This process will free you from the memory so that you don’t bring that baggage into your relationship with your child.
