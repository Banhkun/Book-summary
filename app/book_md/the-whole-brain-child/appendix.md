## Appendix: Explaining the Whole-Brain Approach to Your Child

Giving your child a kid-friendly explanation of the brain science behind the strategies we’ve discussed will help her to understand what’s going on in her mind and why these strategies are helpful. Use the suggestions below to help your child grasp the concepts.

### Left and Right Brains

In order to illustrate the concepts of the left and right brains, explain that:

  1. **The brain has many different parts that do different jobs.** Sometimes different parts of the brain act on their own, but the brain works best when all the parts work together. 
  2. **The right side of the brain pays attention to your emotions**. When your emotions get really big, it feels like they’re taking over your whole brain and body, which can make you do and say things that you normally wouldn’t. This can feel like a big wave that’s crashing over you. 
  3. When you notice your emotions getting big, **the left side of your brain uses words to help you describe how you’re feeling.** When you get the two sides of your brain to team up like this, it helps you to calm down. This lets you surf the wave of emotion safely and calmly back to shore.



### Upstairs and Downstairs Brains

In order to illustrate the upstairs and downstairs brains, **use your hand to represent the brain** :

  1. **Make a fist and explain that this is the brain.**
  2. While holding up your fist, explain that there’s an upstairs brain, which makes decisions and leads you to do what’s right, even when you’re upset. 
  3. Lift your four fingers just enough to expose your thumb resting against the palm of your hand. **Explain that your thumb is part of the downstairs brain, which creates big feelings, like love and frustration.**
  4. Explain that there’s nothing wrong with being upset. **Bring your fingers back down over your thumb to create a fist, and show that your upstairs brain is hugging your downstairs brain** so that, when you’re upset, you can express how you're feeling and still make good decisions.
  5. Put your four fingers straight up, exposing your thumb against your palm. Explain that, sometimes, you may get so upset that you flip your lid. **When you flip your lid, your upstairs brain is no longer hugging your downstairs brain to keep it calm.**
  6. Suggest that, the next time your child gets really upset, she makes a brain with her hand and puts her fingers up to show that she’s flipped her lid. Then, she should slowly bring the fingers back down to hug her thumb, which will remind her to use her upstairs brain to calm down the downstairs brain. 



### Memory Integration

In order to help your child understand memory integration, explain that:

  1. **Your brain remembers events and experiences in pieces, like the pieces of a puzzle.** Each piece has a different part of the memory, including what you saw, what you heard, what you smelled, what you were thinking, and how you felt. 
  2. **When you tell the story of what happened, your brain puts the pieces together** to create the big picture. 
  3. It’s fun telling stories about happy times, but **it can be hard to talk about memories that are scary, sad, or confusing** , because you don’t want to remember what it felt like to be sad or afraid.
  4. Even if it’s hard to talk about, it’s important to still tell the stories of scary and sad memories. **If you don’t think or talk about the memory, then the puzzle pieces never get put together** , and they end up jumbled, floating around your head. 
  5. **When the puzzle pieces of your memory are all jumbled, thoughts or feelings from that memory can come back, and you don’t know why you’re feeling that way because you don’t have the full picture** of the memory in your head. For example, if a dog barked at you once and it scared you so much that you didn’t want to talk or think about it, the puzzle pieces floating around your head will have a dog, a loud bark, and fear. Then, when you see a different dog, you might feel afraid and not know why. If you put the pieces of your scary memory together, you’ll see that you felt afraid because _that_ dog barked at you, but that doesn’t mean that _other_ dogs will bark at you, so you don’t have to be afraid of all dogs. 



### Self-Integration

Self-integration can be difficult to grasp, so point to her experiences and use visual analogies (like the wheel of awareness) to illustrate this concept:

  1. **Ask her to think of a time when she felt stuck** on a particular feeling—for example, when she had a fight with her brother and felt angry for the rest of the afternoon. 
  2. **Explain to your child that there are many pieces of her that make her who she is, and that the part of her that was angry was just one piece.** At the same time, a different piece of her might have been feeling tired, and another piece might have been thinking about the soccer game she had that morning. 
  3. **Ask her to picture her mind as a bicycle wheel.** Explain that the rim of the wheel has all the things that she thinks about and feels at any given moment, such as her anger, her soccer game, and feeling tired. At the center is the hub, a calm place where she can see everything on the rim and choose what to focus on.
  4. **Tell her that when she’s stuck on one thing on the rim—** like being angry at her brother—**then she’s ignoring all the other parts of herself.** But she can learn to go back to the hub, where she has the power to choose to focus on a different part of herself and get unstuck from her anger. When she’s in her hub, she may still feel angry, but she won’t be stuck on that feeling. 
  5. **Let her know that you’ll help her get back to her hub when she gets stuck**(using the strategies we described), and soon she’ll learn to get there on her own. 



### Mindsight

Follow these steps to talk to your child about mindsight:

  1. **Explain that mindsight means seeing with your mind** , just like eyesight means seeing with your eyes.
  2. **Tell her that there are two parts of mindsight. The first part is looking inside your own mind** to notice how your body feels, what pictures you see in your head, what emotions you’re feeling, and what you’re thinking. 
  3. **The second part of mindsight is looking inside someone else’s mind.** Explain that sometimes, when you and a friend get in an argument, part of the problem is that you’re not thinking about why the other person is feeling or acting a certain way. But, when you see someone else’s perspective, it helps you both to be happier and to have a stronger friendship.
