## Chapter 6: Integrating Yourself With People Around You

In the last chapter, we explored the first aspect of mindsight: understanding your own mind. Now, let’s talk about the other aspect: understanding other people’s minds, or, simply, empathy. **Empathy involves reading nonverbal cues to recognize how others are feeling, and seeing other people’s perspectives.** Empathy also improves your child’s ability to communicate effectively and compromise, all of which helps her to connect with others.

Research shows that people experience a stronger sense of _personal_ meaning and deeper happiness through helping and connecting with _others_ , rather __ than solely taking care of their own concerns. In other words, your “me” greatly benefits from being part of a “we.” To this end, it’s important to help your child develop skills for interpersonal integration—maintaining a strong sense of self while integrating into a community, with consideration for other people’s needs, feelings, and perspectives. **As your child develops an increasingly integrated mind, she’ll be better able to connect with others and nurture healthy relationships without compromising her sense of self.**

### Humans Are Wired to Connect With Others

The human brain is designed to connect with others: It interprets cues from other people, and it helps you respond accordingly. Additionally, since every experience you have creates new neural connections, your interactions with other people literally help to shape your brain.

Mirror neurons are a major factor in this process. When you watch _someone else_ pick up a glass of water, your mirror neurons fire as if _you_ had taken a sip of water. **Your mirror neurons prepare you to reflect what you expect another person to do or feel.** When your mirror neurons help you to understand another person’s emotions, you not only reflect them back, but you also absorb them. For example, if you’re particularly stressed one day, you may notice that your child also becomes somewhat anxious. This all means that humans are wired with the capacity to empathize and connect with other people.

(Shortform note: At the time this book was written, some scientists suspected that mirror neurons were the building blocks of empathy. However, more recent research has weakened that theory.)

Although your child has the mental capacity for empathy, she needs your help to learn and practice it. In fact,**just like other skills, some children are naturally more or less adept at empathy than others, and they simply need more help developing it.** Give your child plenty of opportunities to interact and build friendships with other children—which will put them in situations that require empathy—and offer support when your child needs it.

#### Your Child’s Mental State Aids or Impedes Empathy

**When you’re trying to teach your child a lesson in empathy and connecting with others, be aware of whether your child has access to her upstairs brain, which controls empathy.** If her upstairs brain is online, she’s in a _receptive_ mental state. In this state, her social circuitry is switched on, which makes her physically, mentally, and emotionally more open to connecting with other people. By contrast, if your child’s downstairs brain is blocking the stairway to her upstairs brain, she’s in a _reactive_ state. It’s nearly impossible to be open and empathetic with other people when you’re in this state.

**If you pay attention to which state your child is in, it will help you to determine how to handle outbursts and misbehavior.** As we discussed in the upstairs-downstairs brain strategies, when your child’s downstairs brain has taken over and she’s in a reactive state, comfort and support her before you attempt to reason with her.

#### Model Healthy Relationships

One of the best ways to encourage empathy in your child is to make sure that the relationship you have with her is strong, loving, and joyful.**Your child’s early relationships will teach her how to navigate relationships for the rest of her life.** Specifically, she’ll learn:

  * How to communicate and listen effectively 
  * The importance of sharing and sacrificing for the benefit of another person 
  * The kind of emotional support she can expect from a relationship



From the time your child is a baby, she’s learning what to expect from other people through her interactions with you (as discussed in Chapter 4). If she feels loved and if her needs are met, then she’ll expect to find love and support in her relationships with others. However, if your child doesn’t feel cared for and is left to figure out how to soothe herself, the part of her brain that’s built for relationships can shut down because it’s not getting the human connection it needs.

### Interpersonal Integration Strategy #1: Have Fun as a Family

**Showing your child how fun and rewarding it is to be in a relationship with _you—_ her first and primary relationship—will encourage her to build healthy relationships with _other people_ , as well.** When you have fun with your child, she gets a burst of dopamine, a brain chemical that motivates her to repeat the experience; in this case, the dopamine makes her want to seek out strong, healthy bonds with others.

Additionally, encourage fun and healthy sibling relationships among your children. While it’s practically inevitable that siblings will fight, having fun together is the best predictor of a strong bond that will last into adulthood. As long as the fun outweighs the fighting, they’ll likely enjoy a close relationship as adults.

There are many ways to inject some fun into your daily family life, such as:

  * **Playing improv games**. For example, have one person say the first sentence of a story, then go around the circle as each person takes turns adding the next sentence. These kinds of games help children learn to be receptive and flexible to changes. 
  * Initiating impromptu fort-building, water balloon fights, and other **fun and unexpected activities**
  * Taking a **family bike ride**
  * Giving your children **a fun project to collaborate on** , such as making a gift for a grandparent



This is not to say that play should replace boundaries and discipline, because structure is also essential for your child’s development. However, you can **take a playful approach to parenting.** When your child is upset—as long as you acknowledge and validate how she’s feeling—responding in a silly way can help your child get unstuck from that rim point. For example, if you're giving your daughter a bath and she angrily insists that dad washes her hair, instead of getting frustrated and explaining that dad is busy, try being silly and pretending to be dad.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

Tailor this strategy to your child’s age and developmental maturity with these tips.

**Ages 0-3** : Play with your child. Get on the ground with her, follow her lead, join her in playing with her toys, and tickle her.

**Ages 3-6** : Encourage your child to have fun with her siblings and relatives. Also, try using silliness to avoid power struggles and meltdowns.

**Ages 6-9** : Whether it’s a spontaneous water fight or a weekly movie night, incorporate fun into daily life. Dance, play, be silly, and make a point of creating opportunities to have fun and make happy memories.

**Ages 9-12** : As your child approaches adolescence, she may want to spend more time with her friends and less with you. However, if you consistently have fun with your child and maintain a strong connection, she’ll value the time she spends with you and want to continue enjoying time together, even as a teenager. Interactive games, sports, gardening, cooking, and day- or weekend-long trips are some of the many ways to bond and create treasured memories.

### Interpersonal Integration Strategy #2: Practice Empathy Through Disagreements

Although unpleasant, **every disagreement your child has—** with you, with a sibling, or with a friend—**is an opportunity to teach her healthy and effective ways to manage conflict.** Resolving a disagreement requires multiple social skills that your child needs help developing.

#### Skill #1: S**eeing** A**nother** P**erson’s** P**erspective**

It’s difficult to stop and consider someone else’s perspective when you’re upset. Help your child practice this skill by **frequently asking questions about how someone else might feel and why someone may have reacted in a certain way.** Pose these questions after an interaction you or your child has, about strangers you observe, or about characters in a book. This will get your child in the habit of thinking about other people’s perspectives.

Then, when your child is in the midst of an argument, put these skills to work. First, stay calm and demonstrate empathy. **If your child comes to you complaining that her brother called her a name, resist the urge to dismiss and deny her grievance by asking how she provoked her brother or telling her to stay away from him.** Instead, connect emotionally with your child, and then help her consider her brother’s perspective, and ask her what might have made her brother so upset that he would lash out.

#### Skill #2: Interpreting Nonverbal Communication

Nonverbal communication—including posture, gestures, facial expression, and tone of voice—is a major aspect of communication. (Shortform note: In fact, experts say that nonverbal cues account for a far larger percentage of communication than merely the words that are spoken.) **The more your child practices reading nonverbal cues, the more empathy she’ll develop, and the better she’ll be able to connect with people.**

Help your child learn to read nonverbal cues by helping her to notice other people’s body language and explaining the emotions it reflects. For example, after your child wins her soccer game, point out that her friend on the losing team is looking at the ground and has her shoulders slumped, which probably means she’s feeling disappointed about the loss.

#### Skill #3: Making Amends

When your child has an argument, sometimes an apology isn’t enough to smooth things over. **Teach your child that there are times when she needs to do a follow-up action to make things right after a conflict, and help her to determine the appropriate action.** There are generally two kinds of responses she can take:

  1. **A direct response:** Fixing, rebuilding, or replacing something that was broken during the argument.
  2. **A relational response:** Taking another approach to show regret and mend the relationship, such as writing a letter of apology, doing something kind for the other person, or drawing a picture to give to the other person. 



When you prompt your child to decide which kind of response is needed and how to carry that out, she gets to practice empathy and attuning to another person’s feelings. First, she has to imagine the other person’s perspective enough to imagine why he’s upset. Then she has to put herself in his shoes to determine what might make him feel better.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : At this age, your child’s ability to share and empathize is limited. Nonetheless, when she gets into a conflict with another child, help her to identify her emotions, guide her toward recognizing the other child’s emotions, help her come up with a resolution, and then shift her focus to another activity.

**Ages 3-6** : At this age, your child is better able to practice taking turns, sharing, apologizing, and forgiving. Talk with her about the give-and-take required in relationships, explain how important it is to be considerate of other people (even when she’s upset), and lead by example.

**Ages 6-9** : Be more explicit with your child about the three skills we discussed, and help her to practice them. After you explain the importance of considering other people’s perspectives, go to a public place together to observe people and speculate what they might be feeling. When you teach her about nonverbal communication, challenge her to think of as many examples as you can, such as shrugging your shoulders or raising your eyebrows. When you talk about making amends when an apology isn’t enough, brainstorm a recent incident and something your child can still do to make things right.

**Ages 9-12** : As your child gets older and more mature, continue talking about and helping her to practice these skills. Explain that conflicts are opportunities to problem-solve and to strengthen the relationship.

### Tips for Parents for Strong Connections With Their Children

Research shows that if you consistently respond to your child with empathy, she will thrive physically, emotionally, socially, and academically. The strategies we’ve discussed all help you connect with your child. However, **one of the biggest factors determining the strength of your relationship with _your child_ is how you’ve made sense of your relationship with _your parents_.**

Your childhood experiences create the foundation for your life narrative, which is the story you create to make sense of who you are, how you feel about the past, why your parents (and other significant people) behaved a certain way, and how all of those factors shaped you. Just as implicit memories that haven’t been integrated can affect your present behavior without you realizing it, an unexamined childhood and lack of coherent narrative can have the same effect (in fact, implicit memories can play a role in this).

For example, if your father’s parents were cold and unsupportive, then he would’ve had to learn how to comfort himself as a child. Consequently, it’s likely that he took a similar approach to parenting you, telling you to suppress your feelings when you were sad or upset. **If you don’t reflect on the wounds that produced your parents’ behavior and how their behavior affected you—** through therapy, journaling, or talking with a friend or spouse—**then you’re likely to repeat the pattern with your own child.**

However, if you examine your experiences and create a coherent life narrative, then you can determine how you want to raise your children. Rather than repeating the pattern or blindly doing the opposite, learn from your own childhood experiences and be deliberate about your approach to parenting.
