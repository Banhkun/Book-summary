## Exercise: Apply Yogananda’s Insights to Your Life

Yogananda’s mission was to bring people of all heritages and faiths together through kriya yoga. Now that you’ve read about his life and some of his most important teachings, reflect on how you might apply those lessons to your life.

* * *

What similarities do you see between your beliefs (religious or otherwise) and what Yogananda taught? (Remember: Alongside his beliefs about God and spirituality, Yogananda had great respect for worldly pursuits like art and industry, and he placed great value on community.)

What major differences do you see between Yogananda’s teachings and your beliefs?

How might yoga benefit you? For example, might yogic meditations deepen your belief in God? Alternatively, perhaps you’d find physical and mental health benefits in strengthening your body and reducing stress.

The Eightfold Path of Yoga includes eight practices: Yama (behaviors to avoid, such as lying and stealing); Niyama (good deeds, such as discipline and devotion); Asana (posture); Pranayama (energy control through breathing techniques); Pratyahara (inward focus); Dharana (concentration); Dhyana (meditation); and Samadhi (expanded consciousness). Which of those eight practices could you apply to your own life? (For instance, practicing Asana may help you build your physical strength and spend longer meditating so you can experience the mental health benefits of meditation.)
