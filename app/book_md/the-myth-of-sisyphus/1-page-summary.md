## 1-Page Summary

In his definitive philosophical essay _The Myth of Sisyphus_ , Albert Camus argues that human existence is fundamentally absurd, since the human drive for purpose and meaning is at odds with the reality that death is inevitable and humanity is cosmically insignificant. Despite this absurdity and the anguish that many people feel when confronted with it, Camus believes that **life is still worth living and that going through life with full knowledge of the absurd is the only way to live honestly.**

(Shortform note: Camus studied philosophy in the 1930s, and _The Myth of Sisyphus_ is built on the philosophical theories of existentialism, metaphysics, and phenomenology. Some scholars have suggested that the Nazi occupation of France from 1940-44, which began shortly after Camus moved to Paris, was also a major influence on the text. Biographer Robert Zaretsky claims that Camus was reacting to a world defined by violence, nihilism, and meaninglessness, but that _The Myth of Sisyphus_ nevertheless argues that life is worth the struggle. Camus’s decision to join the French Resistance in 1943 can be seen as his expression of this argument.)

Camus takes Sisyphus—a Greek mythological figure who was condemned to spend an eternity rolling a boulder up a hill—as the quintessential symbol of life’s absurdity. Sisyphus is dedicated to a futile, meaningless task, but Camus believes that he is happy just to be alive. Life is worth any suffering, and living honestly requires embracing the absurd: living even knowing that life is just a series of experiences that will inevitably end, with no guarantee of an afterlife or deeper meaning. Some people avoid acknowledging these aspects through religious belief or reject life entirely through suicide, but Camus argues that these attempts to flee the absurd are motivated by fear and are ultimately less fulfilling than living an absurd life.

> **Camus’s Exploration of the Absurd**
> 
> Camus provides another symbol for the absurd in his novella _The Stranger_ , published earlier in the same year as _The Myth of Sisyphus_ and described by Camus as being part of the same thematic “cycle.” The protagonist, Meursault, spends much of the book in prison awaiting execution by guillotine. Though he’s terrified of death, he continues to take pleasure in his daily existence, claiming that even if he had been condemned to spend his life trapped in a hollow tree trunk, “little by little I would have gotten used to it.” Like Sisyphus, Meursault finds life satisfying and worth living for its own sake, even when it’s mostly defined by pain and there’s nothing he can do to escape his punishment.
> 
> In philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre’s analysis, the way the novels were written and the timing of their release seems to suggest that they build on each other, with _The Stranger_ evoking the _sense_ of the absurd and _The Myth of Sisyphus_ exploring the _concept_ of it.

This guide splits Camus’s argument into three parts: **Defining the Absurd** , which describes Camus’s theory of existence; **Negative Responses to the Absurd** , which covers Camus’s critiques of other existentialist writers and his argument against suicide; and finally, **Living an Absurd Life** , in which Camus explains how to live with the knowledge of the absurd and provides examples of absurdist characters in literature. We’ll also discuss existentialism as a larger movement, alternatives to absurdism, Camus’s influence on existentialist theater and literature, and how _The Stranger_ provides further examples of absurdist thinking.

### Defining the Absurd

Camus begins his argument with the claim that both the universe and death are unknowable. Theories of existence—such as the belief that God provides life and an afterlife, that there’s a cosmic purpose to human existence that we may realize through our actions, or that death is the end of consciousness and life has no inherent meaning—are just theories, unprovable within the limits of human experience. Despite this, Camus argues that humans have an innate need to believe that our lives have purpose and that there’s continued existence after death, to the point that our inability to definitively answer these questions torments us.**This contradiction between our needs and our reality is what Camus calls the absurd.**

> **Existentialism**
> 
> Camus’s theory of absurdism is built on the foundation of existentialism, a philosophical field of inquiry concerned with defining life’s meaning and purpose, as well as how people may live “authentically.” Various existentialist thinkers embraced Christian doctrine (life exists at the will of God and to fulfill his divine plan), nihilism (life has no meaning and existence is random), and variations on utilitarianism or hedonism (life has no inherent meaning, but can be made meaningful by the pursuit of happiness for yourself and others). Absurdism differs from these approaches in that it’s less concerned with answering existential questions than with how people respond to those questions and their own inability to answer them.
> 
> Though Camus is generally regarded as an existentialist thinker, he rejected the label, which was coined during his lifetime to describe the Marxist philosopher (and one-time friend) Jean-Paul Sartre and applied to other philosophers only retroactively. Besides those Camus cites directly, scholars often refer to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer as major influences on _The Myth of Sisyphus_.

**Many people become aware of the absurd nature of their existence during their lives.** Camus describes this as the sense of dread, terror, and frustration people may feel once they realize that someday they’ll die and be forgotten by others—if not immediately, then on the massive timescale of the universe. Faced with the inevitability of this oblivion, people wake up to the ridiculousness of their everyday routines and become alienated from their old belief systems. Everything in their lives—relationships, personal or career achievements, religion, and so on—suddenly seems irrelevant in the face of the absurd.

> **Absurd Realization Versus the Existential Crisis**
> 
> What Camus is describing is commonly referred to in psychology as the existential or “midlife” crisis, in which a person—particularly someone at a transitional life stage, such as teenager-to-young-adult or adult-to-elderly—begins to feel that their life or personal identity lacks meaning, coherency, or any sense of accomplishment. These crises can lead to severe depression or impulsive, self-destructive behavior, such as ending romantic relationships, switching careers, becoming addicted to stress-relieving substances, and so on.
> 
> Additionally, many psychologists believe that existential crises don’t occur at random, as Camus describes, but are generally triggered by a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce—the collapse of something that previously gave life meaning. Some scholars have also suggested that the existential crisis isn’t a universal phenomenon, but a culturally specific one seen primarily in Europe and the United States.

According to Camus, **there are three possible responses to being confronted with the absurd.** The first is to deny it by seeking philosophical or religious justifications for living that promise either an afterlife or a sense of purpose; Camus considers this philosophical rejection to be self-delusion. The second response is to commit suicide, escaping the suffering of an absurd existence by rejecting life itself. **The third response, which is the only one Camus supports, is to commit to living an absurd life.** This means continuing to live even with the pain of knowing that life is finite and possibly meaningless. Camus describes this as both living without hope and living in a state of permanent rebellion.

(Shortform note: In his book _Everything Is F*cked_ , self-help blogger Mark Manson also encourages people to live without hope, arguing that unhappiness comes less from the circumstances of our lives than from our constantly comparing ourselves with others and striving for change that may not be possible. Camus similarly encourages us to accept and deal with our imperfect reality, rather than trying and ultimately failing to escape the absurd.)

### Negative Responses to the Absurd

Recognizing the absurd is frightening and upsetting, and Camus argues that both negative responses to it—philosophical rejection and suicide—attempt to escape these emotions by providing answers for what is unknowable and breaking down the contradictory relationship at the absurd’s heart. Philosophical rejection denies the premise that life is finite and possibly meaningless, while suicide denies the premise that the human desire for eternity and meaning is innate. Camus believes that **both responses are a form of self-delusion that fail to offer a convincing alternative—logically or emotionally—to the truth of the absurd.**

#### Philosophical Rejection

When giving examples of thinkers who recognized the absurd only to run from it, Camus points to two existentialists he admires, novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Both men ultimately turned to Christianity to satisfy their need for meaning and emotional catharsis, and Camus argues that in doing so, they compromised their rationality.

Dostoyevsky’s fiction frequently deals with amoral characters and pointless suffering, and Camus draws attention to one particular character, Kirilov, who commits suicide after declaring that there’s no God and a life without God isn’t worth living. However, many of Dostoyevsky’s novels end with his protagonists being redeemed by faith, finding that their mental and physical suffering is alleviated once they accept Christian forgiveness and the promise of life after death. In his nonfiction work _Diary of a Writer_ , Dostoyevsky argues that humanity’s need for God in order to be happy demonstrates that faith is essential to existence, and thus God must exist. **Camus dismisses this as circular logic.**

> **Christian Redemption**
> 
> Redemption by faith is central to Dostoyevsky’s two most popular novels: In _Crime and Punishment_ , murderer Raskolnikov is tormented by guilt until a Christian friend convinces him to accept a crucifix and turn himself in; and in _The Brothers Karamazov_ , Dmitri accepts 20 years in prison as his punishment for a life of violence, gambling, and lust. Dostoyevsky was a devout Russian Orthodox Christian who spent several years in prison, and many scholars have seen autobiographical elements in his fiction.
> 
> This type of narrative, in which a sinner is “saved” and absolved of their sins by accepting Christianity, has a centuries-long history that survives into the modern day; for example, in Evangelical “born again” conversions. Camus may have intended to parody this narrative in _The Stranger_ ; when provided the opportunity to confess to a prison chaplain, Meursault declares that he “didn’t know what a sin was” and “had only a little time left [before his execution] and… didn't want to waste it on God.”

Kierkegaard similarly treats Christianity as the answer to life’s suffering and argues that it requires a leap of faith, in which people abandon their rationality in order to embrace the personal, emotional truth of God. Without making this leap, people are doomed to the anxiety and angst (in Kierkegaard’s words) brought on by recognition of the absurd. **Camus claims that this argument tries to diminish the absurd’s power by equating irrationality with God.** Kierkegaard’s framing suggests that while God is unknowable, he is also benevolent, meaning that mortality and death shouldn’t be feared even if they can’t be understood.

(Shortform note: Kierkegaard’s description of Christianity as inherently paradoxical and requiring a leap of faith to fully accept has been contested by some later Christian scholars such as C.S. Lewis and John Warwick Montgomery, who argue that belief in God can be logically inferred and isn’t just a matter of “blind” belief.)

Camus speaks more positively about the work of existentialist philosophers like Martin Heidegger and Friedrich Nietzsche, whom he believes accurately describe aspects of the absurd without proposing “solutions” for it. While Heidegger describes the pain of living in a world where death is inevitable, Nietzsche describes the pleasure that comes from living even in a world with no obvious purpose or meaning. However, Camus argues that **both descriptions are merely starting points in the development of an absurd philosophy,** since they don’t address the question of how to live an absurd life.

> **Humanist Rejection**
> 
> Additional examples of philosophical rejection may be found in secular humanism or utilitarianism, which suggest that life’s meaning is not inherent but created by human action. This may mean improving life as much as possible for the greatest number of people, or working toward the betterment of humanity more generally. Heidegger and Nietzsche both describe humans as being uniquely able to rise above the limits of their existence to affect change on the world around them (these arguments were quickly politicized, inadvertently in Nietzsche’s case).
> 
> Camus doesn’t specifically address humanism, and as a philosophy, it shares some similarities with his own argument for living an absurd life, since both propose focusing on earthly existence over the hope of an afterlife or belief in a higher power. However, he would likely argue that humanism’s attempts to provide meaning ultimately fail, since they don’t alleviate the absurd—whatever happiness we find on Earth is temporary, and the shortness of human lives makes affecting truly permanent change impossible.

#### Suicide

Camus notes that suicide is a much less common response to the absurd than philosophical rejection. He argues that this isn’t because there’s no rational argument to be made for suicide, but because most people value their lives too highly to give them up, even in the face of life’s meaninglessness. The desire to live is itself absurd, since everyone will eventually die no matter what they do, but it’s also an undeniably powerful motivator—people will make almost any sacrifice, even denouncing their own deeply held beliefs, in order to continue living.

(Shortform note: Examples of the power of this drive to live can be seen in the phenomenon of hysterical strength—when life-threatening circumstances cause people to display exceptional strength. Examples can also be seen in the ineffectiveness of torture or brainwashing in actually extracting information or changing people’s minds. Researchers generally conclude that people will say or do nearly anything to avoid pain and death, regardless of whether it’s true or aligns with their morals.)

Camus observes that while many philosophers have considered the question of whether life is worth living, and some even defended suicide as a valid answer, almost none followed their logic to the point of death. Though suicides can be ideologically motivated, as in the case of political or protest suicides, most are emotionally motivated—the person is overwhelmed by feelings of despair or hopelessness, which can have any number of causes. For his part, **Camus considers whether suicide is an appropriate reaction to the absurd, but ultimately concludes that it isn’t,** as it’s another attempt to escape the absurd rather than cope with it.

(Shortform note: Examples of political suicides can be seen in the self-immolation protests surrounding the Vietnam War—Thích Quảng Đức died by suicide in 1963 to protest the persecution of Vietnamese Buddhists by the South Korean government, and in 1965, several American anti-war protesters did the same in front of US government buildings. Interestingly, some mental health advocates argue that even those who die by suicide for primarily emotional reasons don’t truly want to die. When a person desperately needs change in their life but sees no way to achieve it, suicide becomes the only way out.)

### Living an Absurd Life

Though Camus dismisses attempts to define the meaning of life, particularly religious ones, he also believes that **life is the only thing that matters, as it’s the means by which you experience consciousness, pleasure, and growth.** Life may be given by a benevolent God, or it may lack any deeper meaning; either way, you should attempt to get as much out of it as you can before your inevitable death. Camus describes this as an eternal struggle for freedom, with every person rebelling against the unknowability of the universe. Though this rebellion will fail, he argues that it makes you stronger, more intelligent, and more appreciative of your experiences.

(Shortform note: Camus would expand on the connection between rebellion and self-improvement in _The Rebel_ (1951), which argues that creating a perfect civilization is impossible, but revolting against injustice is still a noble goal that betters the individual and the society they live in. However, Camus was less supportive of rebellion in the real world—he was a pacifist opposed to any form of revolutionary violence and was critical of the Algerian Revolution (1954-1962), which overthrew the French colonial government and triggered the mass exodus of the European pied-noir population to which he belonged.)

**Getting the most out of life means living in the present and seeking out as many fulfilling experiences as possible.** This doesn’t require you to constantly pursue new, exotic, or extreme experiences, but to take an interest in the world around you at all times and to make choices without being concerned with artificial limitations on behavior, such as morality or social stigmas. Camus argues that you should “feel” your life as intensely as if you’d been condemned to death the next day, and this one was the last you’d ever have—especially since, in a sense, everyone _is_ condemned to death.

(Shortform note: It’s unclear how seriously we should take Camus’s advice to ignore morality. While Meursault is certainly amoral—he feels no remorse for the murder he commits seemingly at random—Camus had deeply held moral convictions, which are made obvious in his other nonfiction work. As a journalist, he reported on the exploitation of native Algerians by the French government, and in his _Letters to a German Friend_ , he condemned the occupying Nazi force for their cruelty and violence, writing that even if “this world has no ultimate meaning,” humans still have an obligation to fight for “justice.”)

#### Sisyphus as the Absurd Man

**Camus describes the Greek mythological figure of Sisyphus as the perfect example of an absurd figure;** for crimes he committed in life, the gods condemned Sisyphus to spend eternity in the underworld pushing a massive boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again as soon as he reached the top. His commitment to this futile task, repeated over and over, represents everyday life, as people strive for meaning or for an escape from death that they can never achieve. Sisyphus himself represents the drive to live, since he was known for his defiance of death—different versions of the myth have him tricking or trapping Hades, the God of the Dead, in order to escape temporarily back to the surface—which still couldn’t save him from it.

(Shortform note: There are many different versions of the Sisyphus myth, though most include his punishment of rolling the boulder and his attempts to “cheat death.” Descriptions of his crimes are less consistent, though most accounts agree that he offended Zeus, king of all the gods. Either Sisyphus violated xenia or guest-relations by killing visitors to his court (he was the founder of Ephyra, or modern-day Corinth in Greece), or he reported on Zeus’s abduction and rape of the nymph Aegina to her father, Asopus. Scholars generally interpret the Sisyphus myth as demonstrating the futility of resisting the gods, and the word “Sisyphean” evolved to describe unending or senseless labor.)

**Though Sisyphus is generally invoked as an example of divine punishment or torture, Camus believes that Sisyphus is happy despite his fate.** He’s alive—in the sense that he still has a consciousness, even though he no longer has access to the world of the living—and he has a task to commit himself to, even if that task can never be completed. He continues to experience the world and to draw pleasure and strength from it. Camus argues that, like Sisyphus, a person committed to the absurd must dedicate themselves to being fully present for every second of life. Life’s value doesn’t come from the promise of eternity, or from any external source, but is self-evident.

(Shortform note: The advice to “live in the present” can be found in a number of different philosophical, religious, psychological, and self-help movements. Generally, the goal is to encourage people to reduce their stress and unhappiness by focusing on what's right in front of them, rather than a past they can’t change or a future they can’t control. While followers of these movements are often asked to let go of things like painful memories or career plans, Camus asks his readers to let go of the belief that they can avoid or even understand death.)

#### Additional Examples

Camus ends the essay by providing further examples of absurd figures in fiction and the arts, particularly in the work of novelist Franz Kafka. Kafka’s protagonists struggle to survive in hostile worlds with authoritarian, incomprehensible rules, whether this means Josef of _The Trial_ being sentenced to execution for an unknown crime or K. of _The Castle_ spending years trying and failing to gain entrance to the titular seat of government. Despite their frustration and suffering, Kafka’s characters cling to life, going to work and building relationships with the untrustworthy figures around them, even as their expulsion from the world (via exile or death) seems inevitable.

(Shortform note: Some scholars of Kafka interpret his work more politically than Camus does, arguing that the hostility of the world in his fiction is not truly random or absurd, but the result of specific, violent political forces like fascism, capitalism, and antisemitism. Kafka was a Jewish socialist living during a period of increased antisemitism and authoritarianism in central Europe, and while none of his protagonists are explicitly stated to be Jewish, themes of persecution run through much of his work.)

Speaking generally, **Camus describes artists of every type as absurd, and he describes creative work as an inherently absurd venture;** dedicating your life to making something that is, like yourself, temporary and doomed to be forgotten. He draws particular attention to stage actors, who take on entire other identities for a few hours at a time, but have no physical record of their performances. Though art is a way of rebelling against and coping with the absurd—reflecting one’s reality back at others for a chance at self-expression and commiseration—it can’t grant true immortality to its artist, or alleviate the struggle of living an absurd life.

(Shortform note: Absurdism became an art movement in its own right after World War II, beginning with some of Camus’s own plays like _Caligula and The Misunderstanding_. Theater critic Martin Esslin described “the theater of the absurd” as tragicomic, fourth-wall-breaking productions focusing on the ridiculousness of human attempts at communication or progress in an irrational and hostile world. Examples include Samuel Beckett’s _Waiting for Godot_ , Eugène Ionesco’s _The Bald Soprano_ , and Tom Stoppard’s _Rosencrantz& Guildenstern Are Dead_. The postwar fiction of satirists like Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller has also been called “absurdist.”)
