## Exercise: Confront the Absurd

Camus argues that everyone will recognize the absurd at some point in their lives, but that most people respond to this with philosophical rejection, as living an absurd life seems too painful to cope with.

* * *

Have you ever experienced what Camus describes as the absurd? How did it make you feel, and how did you respond to it?

Camus argues that any attempt to concretely define the meaning of life is a form of self-delusion. Do you agree? Why or why not?

What does living an absurd life mean to you? How would you go about living it yourself—are there any changes you’d make to your behavior or lifestyle (for example, would you stay in your current career)?
