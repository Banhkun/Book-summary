## 1-Page Summary

In _The Bezos Blueprint_ , Carmine Gallo explains how to improve your communication by internalizing the principles that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos uses in his writing and speaking. Gallo argues that Bezos built Amazon into a juggernaut primarily through his superior communication skills—skills you can learn and improve with practice. Gallo says that if you follow Bezos’s communication “blueprint,” you’ll set yourself apart from your competition, pitch your ideas more effectively, and inspire others to follow your lead.

Gallo is a writer, speaker, and former broadcaster who specializes in business communication and leadership. He’s the author of _Talk Like TED_ , which discusses how to use TED Talks as a model to improve your public speaking. In this book, he analyzes decades’ worth of Bezos’s shareholder letters, speeches, emails, and other communications to derive a set of principles that anyone can use to become a more effective communicator. The book may be of particular interest to organizational leaders, entrepreneurs, and marketers, but Gallo says its message is crucial for anyone who works in business.

In this guide, we’ve organized Gallo’s ideas into four main principles:

  1. Keep it simple
  2. Get to the point
  3. Tell stories
  4. Repeat and refine your message



We’ll explain each principle, illustrate it with examples from Bezos’s communications, and explore how you can implement it in your own writing and speaking. Along the way, we’ll expand on these principles by comparing them to advice from other business and communication experts.

### Principle #1: Keep It Simple

The first and most important principle Gallo discusses is _simplicity_. Simplicity is clarity: if you want your audience to understand and act on your message, keep it simple. **Being simple doesn’t mean dumbing down your ideas—it means minimizing the work your reader or listener has to do to understand you**. In this section, we’ll discuss several strategies for keeping your expression simple, even (especially) when your ideas are complex.

#### Consider Your Audience

To make your message as simple as possible, Gallo recommends keeping your audience in mind. Picture someone who’s smart, but not as informed or interested in your topic as you are. What do they need to know, and what’s the easiest way to explain it to them? Gallo says that asking these questions will keep you from including a lot of detail and complexity that will ultimately dilute your point and confuse your audience. Remember that your reader or listener doesn’t need to know everything _you_ know.

(Shortform note: When considering your audience, it’s also helpful to think about your purpose: What exactly are you trying to accomplish with this communication? In _Thank You For Arguing_ , rhetoric professor Jay Heinrichs explains that knowing your purpose will help you craft the kind of appeal most likely to persuade your audience. If you need to win your audience over to your side, show them that you’re trustworthy and knowledgeable. If you need to change their minds, use logic and evidence to appeal to their rationality. If you need to spur them into doing something, use emotional appeals to convince them of the need for action.)

How simple should your message be? Gallo suggests that you **express your ideas simply enough that the average high school student could understand them**. Gallo notes that Bezos’s communications are remarkably simple, even when discussing complex technology, services, and financial data. He explains that when he analyzed Bezos’s shareholder letters with a formula that determines a recommended reading grade level, the letters scored as appropriate for grades 8-10. Note that “readability” in this context has nothing to do with the _content_ of a written piece—it’s a measure of elements like _word length_ and _sentence complexity_ that determine how hard the piece is to read.

(Shortform note: Gallo’s advice to write simply about complex topics is corroborated by the fact that most news publications write at a high school level—including sources like _The New York Times_ , _The Wall Street Journal_ , and the BBC.com. This is true even though these outlets address complicated issues in their content, proving that expert writers who make their living conveying information to adults typically follow this recommendation.)

#### How to Write Simply

So how exactly do you express your ideas simply? Gallo offers a number of tips he derived from studying Bezos’s letters. As we discuss these tips, we’ll illustrate each with a famous Bezos quotation that shows the principle in action.

##### Use Short Sentences and Simple Vocabulary

Gallo advises that you **use short sentences and simple words most of the time**. Gallo argues that the more complex, important, or stressful the subject matter, the more important it is to write plainly. He specifically recommends choosing words of Anglo-Saxon origin rather than those of Latin or Greek origin—for example, a Latinate word might _facilitate_ your efforts to sound smart, but an Anglo-Saxon word will _help_ your audience understand you. Note how plain Bezos’s language is even while connecting Amazon’s mission to its stock value: “In short, what’s good for customers is good for shareholders.”

(Shortform note: In _The Elements of Style_ , William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White give similar advice but clarify that good word choice isn’t just about choosing shorter, blunter words—it’s about developing a good ear for language so that you can tell which word is best for the situation. Above all, they recommend being precise but not pretentious. For instance, if we rewrote the above line as, “To summarize, that which accrues values to customers is likewise beneficial to shareholders,” we’d show off our vocabulary at the cost of clarity, reader comprehension, and overall impact.)

##### Write Actively

Gallo also recommends writing actively whenever possible. **Begin sentences with clear subjects and vivid verbs** —this keeps the “action” moving and keeps your audience engaged. For example, even when constructing more complex sentences, Bezos tends to start with a clear action: “We love to be pioneers, it’s in the DNA of the company, and it’s a good thing, too, because we’ll need that pioneering spirit to succeed.”

(Shortform note: In his essay “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell says you can strengthen your verb choices by choosing single words over complex (and less direct) phrases. For example, instead of saying that an initiative “proved to be ineffective,” simply say it “failed.” Similarly, Strunk and White advise choosing verbs that are precise enough not to require adverbs. For instance, instead of saying that someone “read the document closely,” say that they “scrutinized the document.” To illustrate the importance of good verb choice, imagine how much less clear the above Bezos quotation would be if we replaced “love” with a more complex and less precise verb phrase such as, “We have shown a strong affinity for being pioneers”.)

Likewise, **favor active voice over passive voice**. In active voice, the subject _performs_ the action of the verb, as in this simple Bezos statement: “Customers love Prime.” In passive voice, the subject _receives_ the action of the verb, as in this rewritten version: “Prime is loved by customers.” Active voice is generally clearer, more concise, and more assertive.

(Shortform note: Note that in addition to being wordier and less natural sounding, the passive voice version also shifts your attention from “customers” to “Prime” as the main topic of the sentence. Most of the time, you’ll want to stick to active voice to keep emphasis on the actor (as Bezos does with “customers,” who, as we’ll see, are typically the core of his message). But in a few cases, passive voice is the clearer option. For example, if the recipient of the action is your main topic and the actor is comparatively unimportant, a passive construction might serve best: “The Internet was created in the 1980s, and by the 2000s, it had changed the world.”)

##### Avoid Qualifiers and Hedge Words

Gallo points out that an easy way to keep sentences shorter and more direct is to avoid qualifiers and hedge words—they add fluff and feel indecisive. By contrast, Bezos wasn’t afraid to be concise to the point of bluntness in the slogan, “Get big fast.”

> **Use Qualifiers Carefully**
> 
> Gallo is correct that qualifiers often function as filler. For example, the above Bezos quotation gains nothing (and loses all its power) if we rewrite it as, “In general, it’s often a good idea to get fairly big relatively fast.”
> 
> However, qualifiers are appropriate when you need to be precise about the scope of your claims. Consider the following statements:
> 
>   * “Many business leaders are poor communicators.”
> 
>   * “Some business leaders are poor communicators.”
> 
>   * “Business leaders are poor communicators.”
> 
> 

> 
> In these examples, the qualifiers “many” and “some” aren’t fluff nor are they indecisive. They determine the meaning of the sentences, and without them, we’re left with an unjustifiably sweeping claim.
> 
> To prune your writing while retaining accuracy, find each qualifier, then ask yourself whether the sentence would mean the same thing without it. If so, cut it. If not, keep it. In our rewrite of, “Get big fast,” none of the extra words add clarity or change the meaning—they only pad out Bezos’s original, streamlined statement, so they should be cut.

##### Pay Attention to Sentence Structure

Finally, though he favors shorter, simpler sentences, Gallo notes that effective writers **vary sentence length and structure**. Readers and listeners tune you out if every sentence has the same rhythm. Gallo notes that Bezos frequently varies his sentence length, as in this passage with sentence lengths of 11, 3, 12, and 17 words: “Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others.”

(Shortform note: In addition to varying sentence length, as Gallo discusses, note how Bezos also alters the flow of his sentences using devices such as introductory phrases, embedded clauses, and rhetorical questions. These choices make the passage more engaging than if every sentence used an identical structure. Similarly, in _On Writing Well_ , William Zinsser recommends that you also vary your paragraph length to keep your audience interested and control the pace of the piece. Long paragraphs give you room to explore detailed ideas but can fatigue audiences. Short paragraphs convey urgency or simplicity but can feel choppy. As with sentences, an artful variety is best.)

When writing longer, more complex sentences, keep them simple and reader-friendly by**using parallel structure** —that is, by using the same grammatical form to express multiple ideas. For example, when Bezos wrote, “The keys to success are patience, persistence, and obsessive attention to detail,” he made each item in the list grammatically consistent. Contrast that with this rewrite, which loses its clarity and impact by changing the grammatical form for each list item: “The keys to success are patience, to be persistent, and obsessively attending to detail.”

(Shortform note: Parallel structure isn’t just a matter of stylistic preference—language science suggests that parallel structure reduces the work your audience has to do to understand your words and makes it easier for them to grasp complex ideas. Researchers believe that’s because the human brain is built to look for parallel structures when processing language. In fact, studies have found that you more easily understand a sentence when it’s structurally similar to the preceding sentence—or when clauses within it are structurally similar to each other, as with Bezos’s example above.)

### Principle #2: Get to the Point

As noted earlier, one of the reasons you should communicate simply is to reduce the work your audience needs to do to understand you. Another way to reduce the work for your audience is to get to the point as quickly as possible. Gallo explains that all Amazon communications **state the most important takeaway up front**. Your audience’s time is precious—and in this section, we’ll show you how to respect it by telling them right away what you have to say and why it matters to them.

(Shortform note: In _The Pyramid Principle_ , Barbara Minto adds that if you don’t start with your main point, you force readers to reach conclusions on their own as they read, which overburdens them and leads to potential misinterpretation. Like Gallo, she recommends stating your conclusion first, then walking readers through your reasoning. Minto says this approach doesn’t come naturally to most writers because the typical writing process leads you to your main point last: You write out your ideas, consider the relationships between them, then add a conclusion to summarize the point you’ve made.)

#### What’s Your Point?

Obviously, to follow this advice, you first need to figure out what your takeaway _is_. If your audience gleans one thing from your communication, what should that be? Make it as clear and simple as possible. **Make sure it’s obvious why it matters to the listener**. To do so, Gallo says, imagine an impatient listener asking, “Why should I care?” Then, answer this question three times, boiling down the answer each time until you’ve found the bottom line.

For example, to the customer’s question of, “Why should I care about Amazon Prime’s shipping?” you might answer:

  * Prime provides superior fulfillment services by combining an innovative approach to logistics with sophisticated demand forecasting. (This is too detailed and technical—what does it actually mean?)
  * Prime predicts your purchases and gets items ready to ship and deliver efficiently. (This is better but still doesn’t get to the point—what’s the bottom line for the audience?)
  * Prime gets you your stuff faster. (This grabs the audience’s attention by conveying what really matters to them.)



> **More Ways to Get to the Point**
> 
> Saying why it matters is challenging: If you know enough about the topic to be speaking or writing about it, it’s probably already obvious to _you_ why the topic matters—but it won’t be so obvious to an audience who’s just learning this information. Here are several suggestions that might help you follow Gallo’s suggestion to boil your message down to the bottom line:
> 
> **Give the bigger picture:** Specialized or technical discussions can easily overwhelm readers and listeners with details like product specs and technical principles. Someone just learning about Prime doesn’t need to know _how_ it does what it does, they need to know _what_ it does and _why_ it’s useful to them.
> 
> **Show how your idea disrupts the status quo:** “Amazon focuses on the customer” might not seem like a particularly interesting insight, but if you note that, “While most 90s internet companies focused on the technology, Amazon focused on the customer,” it’ll be more obvious to your audience how this customer focus sets Amazon apart.
> 
> **Solve a practical problem:** You might impress your audience by pointing out that there are millions of titles available on Kindle. But you’re more likely to make them care if you instead explain that whatever your taste in books, Kindle lets you find something you’ll like and start reading it immediately.

#### Start With the Press Release

Once you’ve figured out what your main takeaway is, Gallo advises that you **develop and explain the idea as though you were writing a press release for it**. Start by stating the main idea and briefly explaining why it matters. Then describe the idea in more detail, explain what problem it addresses, and how it solves that problem. End by sharing hypothetical testimonials from your intended customers or partners. This last step forces you to think more closely about how your idea benefits its target audience.

Gallo explains that at Amazon, proposals for new products, services, and other ideas take this mock press release form. This approach forces presenters to focus on the ultimate vision and make it compelling. Instead of pitching a project with research and data, starting with the press release forces you to think about your ultimate takeaway point and why it matters to the average person. Once that vision is clear, you can work backward to figure out what you need to do to get there.

Gallo identifies two benefits to this approach:

  * **It forces you to think through and refine your ideas**. You’ll have to be absolutely clear about what your finished idea will look like, how it’ll work, and who’ll care about it. Sloppy or incomplete thought will be obvious.
  * Because a press release aims at selling the new idea to the general public, it’ll make your pitch as simple and compelling as possible—which **raises your chances of convincing executives, investors, or partners to get on board**.



> **Don’t Stifle Innovation by Aiming For a Press Release Too Early**
> 
> While starting with the press release can be a powerful tool because it forces you to think about your end goal early on, some experts warn that focusing on an end goal _too_ early can stifle innovation.
> 
> For example, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues in _Antifragile_ that most of the world’s greatest inventions have come from tinkering—experimentation without a specific outcome in mind—and many discoveries have come from mistakes and happy accidents. However, Taleb says, many investors (especially government investors) only fund research aimed at specific, predefined goals. This practice eliminates tinkering and, Taleb says, greatly reduces the chances of progress.
> 
> That’s not to say that mock press releases inherently quash innovation. Instead, Taleb’s insight suggests the importance of giving your innovators the time and resources to tinker without an end goal or a big picture in mind. Once they have an idea they’re ready to pitch, then they can apply the press release strategy to refine the idea and articulate its benefits so as to best position it to investors and others.

### Principle #3: Tell Stories

One way to simplify complex ideas and explain why they matter is to tell a story about them. According to Gallo, Bezos is a natural storyteller with an intuitive grasp of how to use narrative to get an idea across to his audience. In this section, we’ll explore Bezos’s narrative techniques and explain how to **use storytelling to make complex ideas relatable**.

(Shortform note: Storytelling is a powerful way to communicate in part because the human brain is designed to connect ideas using the same cause-and-effect logic that powers stories. In _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , Daniel Kahneman points out that the brain makes causal connections automatically—in fact, we make these connections even when they aren’t warranted, leading to mistakes in what’s known as the narrative fallacy.)

#### Make Complex Ideas Concrete

Complex ideas are often abstract, and abstract ideas are hard to understand. Therefore, one of your goals in communicating simply about complex things is to **make the abstract concrete**. According to Gallo, Bezos demonstrates several ways to do so.

##### Use Metaphors

Gallo says that Bezos excels at **condensing complex ideas into vivid metaphors**. For instance, after reading _The Mythical Man-Month_ , Bezos wanted to share one of its basic insights: The larger the team, the more time and effort it takes for team members to communicate with each other and actually get their work done. Instead of explaining the theory or the mathematical formula that describes this phenomenon, Bezos crafted a simple metaphor: “We try to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas.”

> **Bezos’s Two-Pizza Metaphor Worked on Multiple Levels**
> 
> Frederick Brooks wrote _The Mythical Man-Month_ as a guide for teams working on complex projects, and the mathematical formula in the book that Bezos referenced found that when more people are involved in a project, opportunities for miscommunication multiply exponentially. This was the problem Bezos was trying to prevent with his two-pizza rule.
> 
> But Bezos’s metaphor was more than just a way to simplify the rule: It also conveyed an emotion. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins points out that when crafting metaphors, you should pay attention not just to the literal meaning you’re trying to express, but also to the layers of additional meaning the metaphor implies. For example, Bezos’s “two-pizza teams” gives a rough guideline as to the ideal maximum size of a team, but it also conjures up images of a friendly, casual work environment and long hours spent on hard but fulfilling work. Different metaphors—say, “passenger van teams”—might describe a similar team size but lack the implications that made two-pizza teams so apt for Bezos’s purposes.)

##### Use Data Sparingly, and Illustrate It

Gallo warns that it’s especially important to find meaningful ways to explain data. Start by narrowing down which data you highlight: Too much data quickly confuses audiences, so focus only on the most important fact or two. Then, help your audience understand the data by **placing it in context and giving them a concrete reference** such as a physical comparison that makes it easier to imagine what a number really means. For example, Bezos once described Amazon’s book selection by saying that it “would now occupy 6 football fields.”

Not only does this comparison ground Amazon’s book inventory in the real world, but it also opens the door for you to tell a _story_ about the number—a story, perhaps, about why Amazon’s superior selection is good news for customers.

(Shortform note: Some experts warn that while it’s important that you interpret numbers for your audience, you should take care not to _misinterpret_ the information you’re presenting. In _How to Lie With Statistics_ , Darrell Huff explains that just because your data is accurate doesn’t mean it’s directly related to what you’re claiming to prove. For example, if you wanted to convince your audience that Amazon’s stock price is about to rise, citing its large book inventory might impress (and mislead) your audience, but it wouldn’t prove the point.)

#### Make Your Message Into a Narrative

Another way to engage your audience through storytelling is to structure your message as a narrative. According to Gallo, many of Bezos’s communications **follow a three-act narrative structure**.

(Shortform note: The three-act structure (which Syd Field popularized in his book _Screenplay_) is one of several options for structuring your story. Some models are more complex, like the five-part Freytag’s Pyramid, which divides narratives into setup, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Others are simpler, like Aristotle’s two-part model of complication and resolution. But what all these models have in common—and what you need to make your message into a narrative—is a deliberately crafted story arc.)

The three-act structure is made up of the following parts:

**Act 1) Setup:** The storyteller sets the scene, introduces the key characters, and establishes the world. At some point, an **inciting incident** kicks the main character into action by giving her a problem to solve or a goal to achieve. For example, Gallo says, when Bezos tells the story of Amazon, he begins by talking about his parents and grandparents, who taught him the lessons he’d use later in life (setup). He then describes the moment when he had the idea for a massive online bookstore (inciting incident).

**Act 2) Challenges:** The main character encounters obstacles and setbacks on the way to her goal. These challenges force the main character to grow and change. For example, after launching Amazon, Bezos faced challenges ranging from the need to mail packages himself to the dot-com collapse that tanked the company’s stock price and put its future in doubt.

**Act 3) Resolution:** The main character overcomes the obstacles and achieves her goal. In the process, she improves herself and the world, as when, Bezos says, Amazon overcame its obstacles and became one of the world’s top companies by continuing to put customers first (resolution).

> **Sell Your Ideas Using Stories**
> 
> In _Building a StoryBrand_ , Donald Miller provides a more detailed seven-part story outline that he designed as a sales device. But his outline isn’t just for selling products—you can also use it to sell ideas or to motivate, influence, or persuade. Here’s how:
> 
>   * Show the audience that they want something they don’t yet have (Gallo’s Act 1: Setup.
> 
>   * Point out an obstacle standing between the audience and the thing they want (this and the next four steps are elaborations on Gallo’s Act 2: Challenges).
> 
>   * Frame yourself as a mentor who can guide them past the obstacle.
> 
>   * Explain how you (or your idea or product) can solve the audience’s problem.
> 
>   * Tell the audience what next step they should take.
> 
>   * Point out the risks of _not_ acting.
> 
>   * Preview the happy ending the audience can expect if they take the action you recommend (Gallo’s Act 3: Resolution).
> 
> 

> 
> Note that in Miller’s approach, the audience is the hero of the story and you’re merely a helper. This makes the audience the center of attention, forcing you to explain why your message matters to them and how it will make a positive difference in their lives. This may not always be the best approach, especially when you’re not directly selling something. For instance, the story Gallo mentions above makes Bezos and Amazon the heroes—a choice potentially designed to generate goodwill given that the story in question was the core of Bezos’s testimony before a US Congress antitrust committee.

##### Abandon Powerpoint

To reap the benefits of narrative communication during presentations and meetings, Gallo suggests that you avoid using Powerpoint. He explains that Bezos banned Powerpoint presentations—collections of slides filled with bullet points, fragmented sentences, and isolated pieces of data—at Amazon, insisting that anyone presenting information at a meeting do so instead with short memos structured like narratives. Gallo explains that the typical slide is too detailed, too complex, and too hard to read, which **allows presenters to get away with weak connections, poor organization, and insufficient explanations of the key ideas**. It also causes listeners to disengage and not pay proper attention.

By contrast, turning your ideas into a story (instead of a slideshow) forces you to think about what’s important, why, and how best to convey the implications of your ideas. It also helps listeners to pay better attention and more effectively absorb your messages.

(Shortform note: Although Bezos might oppose slides, Gallo himself points out that they can have their uses. In _Talk Like TED_ , he suggests Powerpoint slides as a way to strengthen your presentation by engaging your audience’s senses (in this case, sight). If you do opt for a slideshow, experts recommend that you keep your slides simple and concise, incorporate images and visual aids, and keep the focus on yourself and the story you’re telling. By keeping the focus on yourself and your message, you’ll avoid the pitfalls Gallo warns about—you’ll be sure to make strong connections and explanations, and you’ll better engage your audience.)

### Principle #4: Repeat and Refine Your Message

Although keeping it simple, getting to the point, and communicating in stories will take you a long way, Gallo writes that to master communication, you must continue to work at it. This involves repeating your purpose—to the point of obsession—and practicing your skills. In this section, we’ll discuss how to find and promote your purpose and how to hone your communication skills so that you can better pursue that purpose.

#### The Importance of Purpose

Gallo argues that good leaders have a clear purpose that informs everything they do. For Bezos, he says, that purpose is serving customers. As we’ve seen, this purpose infuses Bezos’s communication—not only does he constantly _talk about_ his customers, his communication principles are designed to make his ideas as clear as possible to a general audience.

> **_Why_ and _How_ Your Organization Does _What_ It Does**
> 
> In _Start With Why_ , Simon Sinek agrees that your _why_ (his term for what Gallo calls _purpose_) is the most important part of your organization. In fact, he goes even further by arguing that _what_ your organization does is actually the least important thing about it. Sinek describes an organization as three concentric circles:
> 
>   * The innermost circle is your purpose or mission—your _why_. This is the core of your organization and the reason for its existence. As Gallo points out, for Amazon, the _why_ is the customer.
> 
>   * The next circle is _how_ your organization pursues its mission. For example, Amazon follows its mission of serving the customer by providing a superior retail experience that saves customers time and money.
> 
>   * The outermost circle is _what_ your organization does. For Amazon, the _what_ includes offering a huge inventory, finding ways to streamline online and in-person retail, and developing original technologies and media that people will enjoy.
> 
> 


##### Find Your Purpose

Gallo argues that your purpose is whatever drives you—he describes it as something that you can’t help working on and thinking about. He also suggests that a purpose should provide some kind of benefit to the world. He argues that you don’t have to go looking for your purpose, but that it will find you in time.

(Shortform note: While Gallo suggests that your purpose will find you on its own by emerging from your natural passions, Sinek argues that many people might not find their purpose unless they take active steps to uncover it. In _Find Your Why_ , he suggests that you start by thinking of a set of stories that define who you are. Then, share those stories with a partner and have them take notes on the main themes and recurring concepts—these will form the core of your purpose statement. According to Sinek, only once you’ve done this work to discover your purpose and put it into words can you take steps to live and work in accordance with your purpose.)

##### Repeat Your Purpose

Once you know your purpose, take the time to state it in a way that’s as short, simple, understandable, and relatable as possible. Gallo describes your purpose as a _mantra_ —it should be easy to repeat and easy to remember. He gives Amazon’s purpose statement as an example: Their mission is to be “Earth’s most customer-centric company.”

(Shortform note: Whereas Gallo recommends condensing your purpose or mission statement as much as possible, in _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey offers a different perspective. Covey sees a mission statement as a form of personal expression and argues that it can be several sentences or even several pages depending on the individual. He also argues that your purpose should go beyond your business by unifying your personal, professional, family, and community roles. Amazon’s four-word statement falls far short of this outline, and yet a reader might still infer its goals of, at the very least, professional and community roles, in its desire to place customers at the center of its vision.)

Gallo recommends repeating your purpose relentlessly throughout all of your communication and points out that Bezos mentions customers almost obsessively. He suggests using language to frame and highlight your purpose—for example, you could say something like “The one thing you need to know about our organization is…”

(Shortform note: Using words and phrases to guide the reader through your text and emphasize important passages is known as signposting, and it’s a useful technique beyond just communicating your purpose. Signposting calls attention to the logical connections and hierarchies that organize your ideas and thereby aids in communicating complex information simply and clearly.

One of your goals in repeating your purpose is to instill it throughout your organization. Members of your organization should internalize it and act in accordance with it at all times. Likewise, the wider world should come to associate your organization with your purpose.

(Shortform note: In addition to repeating your purpose, there are a few other steps you can take to infuse your purpose throughout your organization. For example, in _The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive_ , Patrick Lencioni argues that businesses should base hirings, firings, and performance reviews on how well candidates and employees align with the company’s purpose and values.)

#### Keep Growing Your Skills

Although Gallo suggests that Bezos is a naturally gifted communicator, he also points out that Bezos didn’t start off as skilled as he is now—instead, he honed his skills through years of experience and practice. For example, Gallo compares Bezos’s earlier shareholder letters to his later ones and finds that the later work is simpler and clearer. Similarly, he analyzes three Bezos speeches ranging from 1998 to 2019 to show how Bezos polished his message (from rambling to concise) and his delivery (from fumbling to confident) over the years.

Gallo argues that anyone can similarly improve their communication skills, and he suggests several ways you can learn from Bezos’s behaviors to improve your own communication, for both writing and public speaking.

(Shortform note: It’s easy to think that some people (like Bezos) are just naturally good at writing and speaking while other people aren’t. However, in _Mindset_ , Carol S. Dweck warns that this belief, which she calls a _fixed mindset_ , can limit your growth by causing you to give up instead of putting in the hard work needed to hone your craft—after all, why work hard when you believe you can’t improve? On the other hand, if you have a _growth mindset_ , you’ll view your natural abilities as a starting point and seek ways to get better—such as by emulating people more advanced than you as Gallo recommends. Bezos’s evolving shareholder letters and speeches indicate he has a growth mindset, which has paved the way for his continued improvement.)

##### Read Widely

Gallo argues that the fastest way to become a better writer is to read as much as you can. He notes that reading widely will help you not only to become a better writer but also a better leader, and he lists several reasons behind this.

**Reading allows you to experience different situations and perspectives** , and to see how other people (real or fictional) have dealt with problems you might also face.

(Shortform note: Neuroscience research corroborates this benefit in a surprisingly literal way: Studies have shown that words with strong scent associations activate the parts of your brain that process smell. So in a sense, when you read a story, you _actually_ experience whatever you’re reading about.

**Reading equips you with facts and stories** that might inform or illustrate your ideas later.

(Shortform note: In _Talk Like TED_ , Gallo points out that what you learn from your reading can improve your public speaking, too: Listeners want to hear something new, and the more widely you read, the more likely you are to come across an interesting anecdote that’s not widely known.

**Reading shows you different ways to organize and express thoughts** —critical skills for crafting a compelling narrative.

(Shortform note: Similarly, reading can improve your persuasive and critical thinking skills by teaching you to dissect the rhetoric that other people use to make their cases.)

Gallo recommends that to get the most out of your reading, you should take notes and discuss your reading with others.

(Shortform note: Gallo’s advice essentially recommends that you go beyond passively consuming a text and instead actively interact with its messages. Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren have similar advice in _How to Read a Book_ , where they propose that to gain a full understanding of a subject, you use a process of “syntopical,” or comparative reading. This involves compiling a bibliography on a topic, reading the most relevant passages in each book, taking notes that rephrase each author’s arguments in a common set of terms, and getting a sense of how each author answers the major questions about the topic—thereby _interacting_ with the text as Gallo advises.)

##### Practice Your Presentations

Likewise, Gallo offers several pieces of advice for improving your presentation skills:

  * **Learn your natural strengths and emphasize them**. Do you have a good sense of humor? A strong, dynamic voice? An ability to express ideas clearly and simply? A gift for compelling metaphors and comparisons? Make the most of whatever natural gifts you have.
  * **Craft a gripping message** that’s simple, gets to the point, and tells a story. The better your message, the less you have to rely on your natural skills to make your presentation compelling.
  * **Present regularly, and rehearse your presentations** to get more comfortable and refine your delivery.
  * **Record yourself on video** to get a sense of your strengths and weaknesses from the audience’s perspective. Watching the recording will help you catch issues like too many filler words (“um,” “like,” “y’know”) and hard-to-read slides. 



(Shortform note: Fear of public speaking is incredibly common, and if you want to become a better presenter, odds are you’ll have to deal with that fear. Experts recommend that you tackle the fear proactively by getting comfortable with your emotions, learning how to release excess anxiety, and visualizing what it will be like to stand in front of an audience. Gallo’s recommendations that you lean into your natural strengths, craft a compelling message, and rehearse can be seen, then, not only as methods to improve your skills but also as ways to _reassure yourself_ of your skills and thus allay your fears—which, in turn, will improve your skills.)
