## Exercise: Be Present in the Moment

A core idea of _The Way of Zen_ is that we live in an illusion of the world, rather than perceiving the world as it actually is. One way that we do that is by dwelling on the past or the future, instead of living in the present moment.

* * *

Think of a recent time when you were so distracted by something that happened in the past or something that you anticipated in the future that you weren’t tuned in to the present. (Maybe you were so focused on worrying about work that you almost missed your subway stop, or maybe you were replaying an uncomfortable conversation instead of listening when your partner described their day.) Describe what was going on in the moment and what you missed while you were distracted.

Next, remember what you were distracted by, and why it felt so urgent at the time. Write it down here.

Finally, think about how, if you found yourself in the same situation again, you would refocus your attention on the present moment. (Continuing the examples above, maybe you would direct your attention to the view through the train windows, of all the stations you pass through, to redirect your attention to the present. Or perhaps you would tune in to the tone and timbre of your partner’s voice to gently bring your focus back to the conversation.)
