## Exercise: Create an Overview of Your Business Model

Create an overview of your business model by defining the customer group you’ll target, identifying their problems, and determining how you’ll solve these problems.

* * *

Think of one product or service you intend to offer and briefly describe it. (For example, you intend to offer comfortable orthopedic shoes.)

Write down at least one customer group that will want your product or service. (For example, you might target middle-aged adults with conditions like plantar fasciitis, who seek effective solutions to alleviate foot pain.)

Consider the customer group you chose. Write down at least one problem they face when using existing products or services. (For example, this customer group often has to put up with unattractive footwear options for the sake of pain relief.)

Think of some simple ways to address the customer problem(s) you’ve identified. Write down at least one way to integrate a solution into your product or service. (For example, you could emphasize ergonomic design and style, thus ensuring both optimal comfort and a fashionable appearance.)
