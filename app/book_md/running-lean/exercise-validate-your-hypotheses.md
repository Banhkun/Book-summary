## Exercise: Validate Your Hypotheses

According to Maurya, testing the hypotheses that underpin your business model is key to building a successful business. In this exercise, we’ll walk you through the process of designing customer interviews, creating prototypes, and conducting pilot tests.

* * *

Write down the nine key hypotheses underlying your business model: customer groups, customer problems, value offer, possible solutions, touchpoints, profit sources, expenses, key performance indicators, and competitive edge.

What questions will you ask potential customers to validate your customer groups and their problems? (For example, for your orthopedic shoe business model, you might ask customers if they experience consistent foot pain or discomfort while wearing regular shoes, or if they’re actively seeking footwear options that combine comfort with style.)

What features will you include in the prototypes of your offer to validate your solution and price point? (For example, you might incorporate advanced cushioning technology for enhanced comfort, or use premium materials that provide support without sacrificing style.)

Briefly describe how you intend to gather feedback and measure user responses during your pilot tests. (For example, you might conduct surveys to gauge overall satisfaction and comfort level, or monitor online reviews and social media conversations for user feedback.)
