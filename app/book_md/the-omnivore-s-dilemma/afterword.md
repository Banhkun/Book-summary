## Afterword: The Omnivore’s Dilemma Now

Ten years after publication of _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_ , determining where our food comes from is still a daunting question, but some aspects of our food systems are changing in ways that are helping us to understand what we are eating and make better choices.

Since The Omnivore’s Dilemma was published in 2006, additional writers and books have stirred the public’s curiosity about where their food comes from. They include _Fast Food Nation_ , Eric Schlosser and _Food Politics_ , Marion Nestle.

**The public’s attitude toward food and farming shows signs of shifting**. Food safety problems have drawn attention, including mad cow disease and E. coli contamination in hamburger. Also, food-related health problems have grown, especially obesity and Type II diabetes.

Significant changes have taken place in food and farming since 2006.

  * The number of **farmers’ markets increased** 180 percent.
  * **Soda sales declined** 14 percent between 2004 and 2014.
  * The food industry began removing high-fructose corn syrup and other harmful ingredients from products.
  * **Sales of organic foods have more than doubled**. Products like grass-fed beef and pasture raised eggs are more common in supermarkets.
  * **Meat processors are promising to improve the welfare and diet of animals** and use fewer antibiotics (results remain to be seen).



We are beginning to value transparency and simplicity when it comes to food. Support is growing for the idea of a national food policy that would ensure everyone has access to healthy food, and that government farm policies no longer undermine our health and environment.

Nonetheless, **commodity corn still dominates food production** : The amount of farmland devoted to corn has grown by 12 million acres since 2006.

  * Government subsidy and farm support programs still heavily favor corn and soybeans.
  * Big Food still controls the levers of government



But there’s reason for cautious optimism — industrial policies and practices increasingly are being challenged by food activists and better-informed consumers determined to reform the system.
