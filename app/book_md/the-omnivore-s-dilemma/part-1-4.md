## Part 1-4: Corn Processing

### The Mill

If the corn flowing from midwestern elevators doesn’t end up feeding cattle, it likely goes to a “wet” mill, which is the first stage for processing it into numerous food products. (They’re called wet mills to distinguish them from traditional mills that just grind corn into dry meal.)

**We eat less than a bushel of corn per person per year in its original form. Yet we each consume a ton of corn annually** , mostly through ingredients in processed products, such as breakfast cereals, condiments, or snacks.

“Wet” mills turn corn into components that companies like General Mills, McDonalds, and Coca-Cola use in processed foods. The wet milling process reduces corn to simple molecules, mostly sugars, forming corn syrup, the first domestic substitute for cane sugar. It was further refined into high-fructose corn syrup in the 1970s, which is now the predominant processed product made from corn and is the main ingredient in soda.

The mill takes apart the corn kernel:

  * The skin is processed into vitamins and nutrition supplements.
  * The germ is crushed into oil.
  * The endosperm contains complex carbohydrates, which become sugar, starch, acids, and alcohols. They fill the ingredient lists of processed foods. Examples are citric acid, maltodextrin and xanthan gum. 



Wet milling, like other industrial food processes, is energy-intensive, requiring fossil fuel.

### Processing Foods

Processing food to preserve it is an age-old preoccupation. We first learned to salt, dry, cure, and pickle food; then to can, freeze, and vacuum-pack it. These advances freed people from the constraints of location and season, as well as from times of scarcity and plenty.

At the end of World War II, we went beyond preserving, to trying to improve on nature, using technology to create new products and marketing to sell their qualities and convenience. For instance:

  * Butter became something better: margarine.
  * Fruit juice evolved into fruit drinks.
  * Cheese became spreadable.



Corn became a key component of processed foods. In fact, **it’s hard to find a processed food not made with corn or soybeans today.**

Food companies are always developing new processed foods, and redesigning current foods to enhance flavor, texture, and packaging. For instance, the Belle Institute, which is the R&D lab for General Mills, is always trying to come up with novel breakfast cereals because the cereals group generates higher profits for GM than any other.

Breakfast cereal exemplifies processed food: It’s a few cents’ worth of corn (corn meal, corn starch, and corn sweetener) morphed into $4 worth of processed food. Vitamins and minerals are added, plus other ingredients for color and taste. Then it’s packaged and branded as having added value.

One advantage processors have is that they can often substitute ingredients without affecting appearance or taste. So if the price of an ingredient like hydrogenated fat from corn goes up, they replace it with fat derived from soy. That’s why labels say: “Contains one or more of the following: corn, soybeans or sunflower oil.”

**Processors keep coming up with new ways to package and sell the corn glut.** Engineering processed food from corn is supply-driven — no one clamored for synthetic cheese, but consumers bought it once it was invented and marketed.

### Increasing Profits

However, no matter how many new products processors make from corn, humans can eat only so much food (about 1,500 pounds a year) regardless of how cheap it gets. This is referred to as inelastic demand, or the “fixed stomach.”

The challenge for food companies is to keep profits from falling when demand is maxed out. Their profits are growing at about 1 percent a year (the same as the rate of population growth), which is too little by Wall Street standards.

**Food companies have to figure out how to get people to spend more for the same amount of food and/or get them to eat more.** Part of the answer is to further process or complicate foods to add value.

Further processing a product adds to shelf life, allowing the company to market it globally. It also allows a company to capture more of the money a consumer spends on food. Here’s how that works:

  * Of a dollar spent on eggs, 40 cents goes back to the farmer; of a dollar spent on corn sweetener only 4 cents goes to the farmer. Processing companies get the rest.
  * When Tyson devised the chicken nugget in 1983, chicken became a high value-added product, and most of the money Americans spent on chicken moved from the farmer’s pocket to the processor’s.



Processors need to sell more than a product itself: They also sell convenience, novelty, and supposed health benefits.

However, a value-added product made from a cheap commodity can itself become a commodity, so a processor has to keep doing more.

  * For example, when flour made from wheat became a commodity, the company (General Mills) processed it further, creating bleached, and later, enriched flour. (They sold an image of purity and healthfulness).
  * However, even enriched white flour became a commodity, so General Mills invented cake mixes and sweetened breakfast cereals (selling convenience and sweeteners). The company is now selling health benefits: Its cereals are marketed as heart-healthy (so-called nutraceutical) foods.



Food companies are even trying to add value to whole foods like apples because the price of agricultural commodities keeps declining as more are produced. Also, they seek to differentiate whole foods, like apples or chicken, from another company’s.

  * For example, TreeTop is marketing a low-moisture apple infused with red wine extract as having cancer-fighting flavonoid phenols and dietary fiber. In the same way, breakfast cereals have long been fortified with added vitamins and minerals.
  * Turning a whole food into a brand-named processed product is a classic food company strategy.



#### Future Foods

In the next era of food processing, designers will aim to produce processed foods that are better than the whole foods they’re based on. **We’ll be told we’re better off eating foods specifically designed for us** , rather than eating risky foods from nature whose quality and characteristics vary.

The food industry is also overcoming the problem of the fixed stomach by creating fake fats, sugars, and starches that pass through the human digestive system without turning into calories. These are marketed as a benefit to diabetics — you can eat more without gaining weight, becoming the ultimate industrial food consumer.
