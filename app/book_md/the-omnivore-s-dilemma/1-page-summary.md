## 1-Page Summary

_The Omnivore’s Dilemma_ by Michael Pollan explores the question of where our food comes from, and how the growth, processing, marketing, and distribution of food affects our health, animal welfare, and the environment.

This book, published in 2006, was the first of several influential books critical of the **post-World War II industrialization of food production by our government and big business**. As explained in an Afterword added in 2016, the book helped to raise awareness of healthier alternatives and boost an incipient “food movement” that has continued to change what we eat and how it’s produced.

**The Omnivore’s Dilemma refers to the age-old human dilemma of deciding what to eat**. Because we’re omnivores, and biologically designed to eat plants, animals and fungi, we have wide-ranging options compared to “specialized eaters” like koala bears or monarch butterflies that can eat only one thing. In the early days of human evolution, deciding what to eat was a dilemma because some options could sicken or kill us. As a species we learned what to eat through various tools such as memory, recognition, taste, culture, and tradition.

**Around the end of World War II, our food system began to change radically**. Today we’re again confused and anxious about our food choices due to ignorance about where our food comes from — plus an array of new health concerns. We’re confronting a modern-day Omnivore’s Dilemma about what we should eat.

### Why is Food So Complicated?

**One hundred years ago, we knew where our food came from — typically a small farm** growing a diversity of crops and animals and selling its products locally. This was a traditional, pastoral food chain connected with the land and functioning in accordance with nature.

Nowadays **it’s been replaced with an industrialized food chain** or system built on factory-based rules of efficiency, mass production, mechanization, and distribution. Consumers no longer know for sure where their food comes from, beyond the huge supermarkets where they bought it.

Most people accepted this until **we began experiencing a multitude of problems** : an increase in food contamination scares, environmental issues, and health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. This helped spur the growth of an organic movement promoting sustainable, pesticide-free, locally grown food.

Adding to our food uncertainty are diet fads, marketing gimmicks, ever-changing dietary guidelines, research, and media reports. **Because the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, we haven’t developed a national food tradition** and culture like other countries to help guide our eating habits. So the Omnivore’s Dilemma confronts us again.

To answer the question of what we should eat, Pollan explores four food chains or systems of growing, processing, and distributing food: Industrial, Industrial Organic, True Organic, and Hunter-Gatherer. He created a meal from each food chain, after tracing each to its origins, starting with the one that dominates our food choices today — the Industrial food chain.

### Industrial Food Chain

**The industrial food chain starts with corn** , grown on massive industrial farms in the Midwest. The farms are monocultures, meaning they only grow one thing — corn. Thanks to U.S. farm policies driven by the interests of big business, along with the continuing development of higher yield varieties of corn, farmers produce ever greater quantities of corn and we have a constant oversupply. This continually drives down prices for farmers.

The industrialization of food production has several ramifications. The industrial food chain depends on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which lead to pollution and health problems. Because industrial farming is highly mechanized, it doesn’t require many people to grow and harvest corn. Towns in the Midwest are dwindling in population because of farm job losses and bankruptcies.

For the rest of the country,**corn is a key ingredient in much of we eat**. **Out of 45,000 items in a typical supermarket, a quarter are derived from corn**. It’s a component of beer, soda, coffee whitener, spreadable cheese, microwaveable dinners, cake mixes, condiments, and hot dogs. Most processed foods contain an array of hard-to-pronounce ingredients derived from corn.

**A chicken nugget is entirely dependent on corn** : Modified corn starch holds it together, citric acid made from corn keeps it fresh, and lecithin gives it its golden color. In the produce section, there’s even corn in the wax that makes cucumbers shiny. The sweetner **high-fructose corn syrup is the most popular corn derivative** and main ingredient in soda. It’s contributing to an epidemic of obesity and diabetes.

**Corn overproduction has also given rise to the factory animal farm system**. With the abundance of corn for feed it became cheaper and more efficient to fatten animals in huge feedlots or closed buildings, than to raise them on grass on smaller diversified farms. (Cows are ruminants designed to eat grass — and corn makes them sick. But factory farms address this problem with drugs). Corn is the foundation of meat and dairy production:

  * Corn feeds beef cattle.
  * It also feeds chickens, pigs, turkeys, lambs, catfish, tilapia, and even salmon, a carnivore being bred to eat corn.
  * Cows are tied to milking machines and troughs of corn.



**Holding thousands of animals in close confinement leads to health problems** requiring the use of antibiotics and other drugs that get into our food. It’s cruel to the animals because the system thwarts their natural behavior. Also, the toxic waste that is produced creates serious pollution problems.

Further, t**he industrial corn food chain depends on non-renewable fossil fuels** that contribute to climate change, from petrochemical fertilizers to fuel for farm machinery, processing facilities, and long-distance shipping.

### Industrial Organic Food Chain

An alternative to the Industrial food chain is the industrial organic food chain. This is**a hybrid food chain** combining elements of both the industrial system and organic system.

The demand for organic products exploded when supermarkets such as Walmart and Whole Foods started selling them. To supply these huge companies, organic farms grew, consolidated, and began relying on traditional fossil fuel-based distribution systems.**They still produce food naturally, without using synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and antibiotics.**

But while the food produced by Big Organic operations is generally healthier than food based on industrial corn, **it increasingly uses synthetic ingredients** to extend shelf life. Thanks to broad government standards written by big agribusinesses, these products can still be labeled as organic.

Large amounts of energy produced by fossil fuels are needed to wash, process, refrigerate, and transport large quantities of organic produce. As a result, this system (like the industrial system) isn’t environmentally sustainable.

### True Organic Food Chain

**The true organic food chain is the simplest and works _with_ nature rather than against it.** It’s exemplified by Polyface Farm in Virginia.

The farm run by Joel Salatin encompasses 100 acres of pasture abutting 450 acres of woodland. It raises chickens (broilers and eggs), cows, pigs, turkeys, and rabbits, and it grows tomatoes, sweet corn, and berries.

**The foundation of the organic food chain is grass** , in the way corn is the basis of the industrial food chain that starts on an Iowa megafarm.

Animals and crops are rotated through the various pastures and benefit in a complementary way. Pastures are grazed twice by beef cattle, followed by hens that eat bugs and parasites in the manure and spread the manure around (acting as a sanitation crew). Chickens also add their own fertilizer. The soil is built up and the grass remains lush, diverse, and nutrient-rich. **The farming practices are sustainable** because they give back to nature what they take.

Salatin sells his products through a farm store, farmers markets, direct sales to restaurants, and through an urban buyers club. He interacts directly with his customers, educating them and answering their questions about how the food is produced. It’s more expensive than supermarket fare, but it reflects his true costs (unlike that of subsidized corn), and its production **doesn’t add to health or environmental costs**.

### Hunter-Gatherer Food Chain

In contrast to the modern food chains operating today, t**he author also set out to create a meal entirely from foraged ingredients** : those he had hunted, grown, and gathered himself. While this isn’t a viable food chain today, Pollan wanted to take conscious responsibility for killing the animals he ate, and to prepare and eat a meal with full awareness of everything it involved.

Before he went hunting, however, Pollan explored the practice and ethics of killing and eating animals, from humans’ earliest days as hunter-gatherers. He concluded that **humans are biologically designed to be predators and meat eaters** , and that eating meat is an ethical choice when it benefits nature (for example, raising food animals in pastures improves the soil.)

However, **humans and animals share certain traits, especially the desire to avoid suffering.** This means **we have a moral obligation to treat (and kill) animals humanely**. Factory farms are cruel to animals in treating them as nothing more than protein-producing machines. These industrial practices must be revealed for what they are and reformed.

Pollan hunted and killed a wild boar in Northern California, foraged for mushrooms, and harvested yeast, vegetables, and fruits from his neighborhood. Although the meal took quite a while to assemble and prepare, benefits included:

  * It connected its eaters to nature and culture.
  * He didn’t buy anything, although he knew the cost firsthand.
  * It didn’t diminish nature.
