## Part 4-2: The Ethics of Eating Animals

Americans are confused when it comes to how we treat animals. **We vacillate between sentiment and cruelty**. We treat dogs as family members, yet consign pigs, which are just as intelligent as dogs, to suffer on factory farms.

We handle our confusion and doubts about eating animals by distancing ourselves from how animals are raised and processed for food.

  * We buy meat neatly packaged, from the grocery store.
  * We don’t have direct contact with the animals we eat.



**Most people would rather not know what it takes to get meat on their dinner plates.** The meat industry understands that the more people know about the slaughter of animals for food, the less meat they’re likely to eat. So the industry keeps its practices under wraps and behind factory walls, and the public doesn’t ask many questions.

In the past, our**** cultural traditions and rituals involving the slaughter of animals resolved any moral dilemmas**** around killing and eating them, thus allowing people to eat meat without agonizing about it. We mostly lack such traditions today.

Today most people remain deliberately ignorant of how we process animals for food, and they continue eating meat. As an alternative, a relative few become vegetarians.

But **there are signs of a broader backlash against eating animals:**

  * Hunting is falling out of favor, perhaps because of the idea of anyone taking pleasure from killing an animal is resisted.
  * Vegetarianism is gaining in popularity.
  * The animal rights movement is becoming more mainstream.
  * Medical research has raised questions about the healthfulness of eating meat.
  * Science is undercutting our claims of uniqueness as a species — we’re not the only species using tool-making, and language.
  * More people believe we have a moral responsibility toward animals.



### Arguments for Eating Animals

One argument for eating animals is that **we have the right to use animals for our own ends because they are less intelligent than humans**. Yet we believe all humans are morally equal although some are less intelligent than others. We don’t discriminate against people on the basis of differing characteristics or interests.

Another argument for eating animals is that **animals eat other animals** too. But it would be problematic to base our moral code on the laws of nature, where murder and rape take place too. Also, unlike humans, **animals must kill to survive**.

If humans differ from animals morally speaking, they also have interests in common with animals, especially the interest of avoiding pain. **The question is whether animals suffer** , not whether they can talk or reason the way we do. They do suffer, and the suffering they experience at our hands (greater today than at any time in history) is a problem.

Our choice to inflict a lifetime of suffering on animals so we can eat meat (which we don’t actually need for survival) creates an ethical conflict. To resolve it, we typically either ignore and deny how we treat animals, or we stop eating them.

While he debated these questions, Pollan became a temporary vegetarian. But he found that to be problematic too, because:

  * Vegetarianism requires others to accommodate our dietary preferences.
  * It alienated him from valued traditions around eating meat, for instance holiday meals.
  * **We’re biologically designed to be able to eat meat**(via our teeth, jaws, and digestive system).
  * **Not eating meat suppresses our inheritance as hunter-gatherers** , as well as our own animal side. The human desire to eat meat is built into our genes.



### Animal Suffering vs. Happiness

Whether our interest in eating animals trumps their interest in living hinges on the question of suffering.

One philosopher argues there’s a difference between pain, which animals experience, and suffering, which require a self-consciousness, which few animals possess. Suffering is pain accompanied by feelings such as self-pity and dread. But **the consensus among scientists is that higher animals are wired much as we are.**

However CAFOs treat animals as machines incapable of pain. This requires denial of their nature. For example, in response to the stress created when their instincts are blocked, the confined animals resort to cannibalism, self-mutilation, and other stress behaviors. CAFOs in turn treat stress as an economic problem, and clip beaks and dock tails in response, which creates further pain and stress for the animals. **A CAFO defines animal life as protein production.**

Yet animals on other kinds of farms live differently; animals at Polyface Farm live according to their instincts.

A good life for a domestic animal actually requires association with humans**** who feed, protect, and care for them, and advance their interests (and ours) through breeding. Domestic animals evolved in conjunction with humans because they were more likely to thrive as a species that way than in the wild.

**Killing some animals can benefit a species**. Eliminating weak individuals, as wolves do, strengthens a species by improving the gene pool. Predation is natural and has been good for many species, whether the predators are other animals or humans. Also, killing invasive species helps native species.

**Animal rights advocates look only at what’s good for individual animals** , and therefore oppose killing them. But **they fail to consider the entire species’ interest in survival and in the health of its habitat**. Saving individuals has less impact long term than saving an endangered species or restoring habitat.

**The human idea of individual rights isn’t applicable to nature**.

### Human Impact

Accepting an animal rights ideology requires denying our human impact on nature.

**Even a vegan’s interests conflict with those of animals**. Farm equipment harvesting grain kills mice, woodchucks and fawns; pesticides, windmills, tall buildings, and cars kill songbirds or animals.

**Killing animals is probably unavoidable no matter what we choose to eat**. Replacing rangeland with grain would displace and kill animals. If the goal is to avoid killing animals we should probably eat only the largest possible animal that can live on the least cultivated land: grass-fed beef.

**If our concern is the health of nature, then eating animals is an ethical thing to do** because:

  * You can’t have sustainable agriculture without animals to improve the grass and soil.
  * Vegetarianism would make us completely dependent on the industrial food chain.



**It’s not the principle of eating animals that’s the problem — it’s the practice**. People who care about animals should work to ensure a swift and painless death, so that they don’t suffer. They should **work for animal welfare rather than animal rights.**

A wild animal that’s been cleanly shot has suffered far less than has the pig raised on a factory farm.

### Reforming Factory Farms

The factory farm industry is a relatively new idea and is specific to America. **No other country has so thoroughly industrialized the process of raising and slaughtering food animals**. Efficiency is the priority, with cruelty a side-effect.

Here’s how it works. At the National Beef Plant in Liberal, Kansas, animals are led up a steep ramp and through a blue door.

  * They go into a chute single file.
  * The ramp tilts until the animal’s feet are off the ground and it’s carried along on a conveyor belt. A stunner positioned on a catwalk fires a bolt into the cow’s forehead.
  * Feet are hooked to an overhead trolley and the animal is conveyed to a bleeding area where its throat is cut. (If the animal doesn’t immediately die, the conveyor is stopped and the animal is shot again.)



The extent to which the animals may suffer is hidden from the public eye. By contrast, Salatin’s open-air process for slaughtering chickens lets customers see and decide for themselves if they want to. Even if customers don’t want to see the operation, maintaining transparency helps ensure the chickens are killed humanely.

**A third option besides denial or giving up meat is being informed about what goes on and influencing the process.** If people could see what happens in big slaughterhouses, maybe they would choose smaller ones. If the walls of our meat industry were transparent, we would likely change how we do things.

Meat would get more expensive if efficiency were given up to treat animals humanely — and maybe we’d eat animals with the consciousness and respect they deserve.
