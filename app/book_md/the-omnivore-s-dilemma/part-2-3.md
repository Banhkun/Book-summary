## Part 2-3: Consuming Big Organic Food

### Marketing Big Organic Food

While traditional organic farmers sell their food directly to local customers and answer their questions first hand, Big Organic-supplied supermarkets like Whole Foods take a different approach to customer communication.

**Products sold at Whole Foods carry labels with pastoral descriptions intended to make you feel good about buying the food**. For instance, the labeling on the “range-fed” steak describes it as coming from a steer “living in beautiful places.”

Such descriptive labels are showing up more frequently in supermarkets, but Whole Foods goes the farthest. Milk is described as coming from cows enjoying lives “free from unnecessary fear and distress.” An organic chicken identified as “Rosie” comes from Petaluma Poultry, which claims its “farming methods strive to create harmonious relationships in nature…”

**Supermarket “stories” invite shoppers to fill in most of the details and imagine they’re participating in a pastoral tradition** of farms like those described in stories for children. **But Whole Foods depends on industrial methods** to get the volume and variety of foods its consumers expect. It uses the grocery industry’s standard regional distribution system encompassing warehouses and huge farms.

Two big corporate organic growers in California — Earthbound Farms and Grimmway Farms — dominate the U.S. market for organic produce. Earthbound grows 80 percent of the organic lettuce sold in the U.S.

When you trace some Whole Food items backward, you find:

  * **Organic milk comes from factory farms** , where cows never eat grass. It is ultra-pasteurized so it can be hauled long distances.
  * **Organic beef comes from feedlots** referred to as organic, but which resemble industrial feedlots.
  * An organic microwaveable meal contains a wide array of ingredients, including synthetic additives.
  * Petaluma Poultry, which produces Rosie the organic chicken, features a shed of 20,000 chickens that have access to a grass strip for only two weeks before slaughter. Few of them use it because they’ve been kept indoors until that point and have fixed habits.



Whole Foods’ labels, brochures, and certification systems may appear to be informative. But **the effusive descriptions can be misleading and make it hard to decide among competing products**.

### The Big Organic Meal

Pollan created a Big Organic meal using Ingredients from Whole Foods, including:

  * Organic chicken (Rosie) with vegetables
  * Steamed asparagus for Argentina
  * Spring mix salad from California
  * For dessert, organic ice cream topped with organic blackberries from Mexico



The meal for three cost $34. Except for the asparagus, which was tasteless, the food tasted better and probably was healthier than conventionally produced food due to lacking chemical residues.

Research suggests organic food items like those in the meal also may be more nutritious. **Organically grown fruits and vegetables have higher levels of several nutrients** , including vitamin C and recently discovered polyphenols (antioxidant, antimicrobial elements).

At the same time, **organic doesn’t automatically mean a food is healthy** , especially if it’s heavily processed. But in general, large and small organic are both better for your health and the environment. They use no pesticides, there’s no nitrogen runoff, no hormones getting into groundwater, no antibiotics, no soils damages, and no government subsidies.

But when scaled up, **Big Organic has downsides** :

  * Employees and animals experience factory farm conditions
  * Fossil fuel is consumed in processing and moving products long distances, and providing refrigeration during transport.
  * **Big Organic is no more sustainable than industrial agriculture.**
