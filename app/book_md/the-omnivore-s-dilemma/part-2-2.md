## Part 2-2: The Industrial Organic Farm

**Big Organic farms look a lot like industrial farms** , with vast acreage devoted to a single crop (a monoculture) such as broccoli, lettuce, or corn. In California, some of the biggest organic operations are actually owned and run by conventional megafarms.

Big Organic proponents argue that the scale of a farm has no bearing on its adherence to organic principles. Big farms are necessary because organic production can’t be a significant alternative to the industrial food chain unless it’s practiced on a large scale.

Greenways Organic is a 2,000-acre organic produce operation incorporated into a 24,000-acre conventional farm. It practices both conventional and organic farming.

On the conventional side it uses chemical fertilizer; in the organic operation it uses organic compost (horse and chicken manure). The conventional farm uses chemical herbicides; the organic farm tills to control weeds. However, the heavy tilling needed to meet large-scale production demands is hard on the soil. It also requires “inputs” of compost, fish emulsion, or nitrate.

**The organic ideal calls for a sustainable system modeled on nature that requires not only no synthetic chemicals but no purchased inputs of any kind, and that returns as much to the soil as it removes.**

This kind of farm is too small for Big Organic to work with. It’s more cost-efficient to buy from one 1,000-acre farm than from 10 hundred-acre farms. For a big company like Whole Foods, economies of scale, specialization, and mechanization are more important than values of diversity and interconnection**.**

Two giant growers sell most of the fresh organic produce from California. One of them, Earthbound Farm, came up with the idea of selling washed, bagged salad mixes. This undercut the popularity of iceberg lettuce. They pioneered the use of washing and packing machines, and of filling salad bags with inert gases to extend shelf life.

Sales exploded with orders from Costco, Walmart, so the company had to scale up. It partnered with conventional farms, which helped convert more acreage to organic.

However its **production and delivery methods deviate from organic principles**. While Earthbound’s produce is grown organically, it goes into a conventional supply chain once it’s picked. Also, it takes a lot of energy to wash, package, and chill bagged lettuce, as well as to transport it.

Smaller organic farmers think this process should not be called organic. They are moving beyond the government’s definition of organic, to focus on quality, labor standards, local distribution, and true sustainability.
