## Part 3: Building a Creative Workplace

As Pixar solidified itself as a premier animation studio, Catmull discovered the things that made his company stand out from the rest. **In this section, you will learn the core concepts that you can use to develop a successful creative organization.** These keys include promoting candor in the workplace, overcoming fear, and embracing failure.

### Chapter 6: Promoting Candor

**Candor is a willingness to be forthright about issues, concerns, and ideas.** In a creative environment, candor allows teams to get straightforward feedback to improve their final product. This helps employees see flaws they may have been blind to and get suggestions to move forward.

**To ensure that employees feel comfortable sharing their opinions, develop a judgment-free environment that allows employees to speak up.** At Pixar, Catmull developed this environment using a process he called Braintrust Meetings. Every few months, Pixar team members who aren’t directly involved in a particular project gather to watch material from the project. Afterward, they talk with the project’s director and head creatives about issues and potential routes forward. These meetings rely on everyone sharing their opinions openly and willingly.

#### Navigating Fear and Insecurity

**Ensuring candor isn’t easy.** People often let their fears and insecurities get in the way of open feedback. As a leader, Catmull believed his responsibility was to ensure people feel comfortable enough to share their thoughts. For example, new members attending Braintrust Meetings often feel insecure about sharing their opinion because they’re new to the group and don’t want to step on any toes.

**To navigate this, you have to remind employees of the following:**

  * **Open dialogue is critical to the creative process.** Without open feedback, flaws and issues can’t be addressed as they arise and can lead to serious problems down the road. 
  * **Feedback won’t lead to retaliation.** Many employees (especially lower-level employees or new team members) fear their critiques and suggestions will lead to resentment from colleagues. To ensure candor, you have to constantly remind employees that they won’t be punished for their openness, even if their opinion is contentious or unpopular. 
  * **Discussion is more effective than written feedback.** Written notes make the process of critique more comfortable as you don’t have to contend with the immediate emotions of the other person. However, written notes can often be misconstrued and don’t give the person receiving the feedback a chance to ask for clarification. Delivering notes in-person lets you control the tone and allows the other person to ask follow-up questions.



#### Building an Effective Feedback Session

**To develop an effective feedback session, build an environment of mutual respect and comfortability.** To achieve this, consider the following tips:

  * **Involve passionate people from a variety of departments.** If they care about the project, they won’t hold back when pointing out issues and will likely bring more solutions to the table.
  * **Promote the use of “good notes,”** which expose a flaw without attacking the person, being insulting, or making a demand. This creates an environment of collaboration that allows your team to work together as they seek out potential solutions to issues. For example, if you’re giving feedback on a presentation, a “bad note” would be, “Why was that so repetitive? Are you just in love with your voice?” A “ good note” would be, “The presentation’s a little repetitive, so let’s talk about some ways that we can streamline the content.”
  * **Don’t abuse your higher position or make demands of your creative teams.** Instead, offer suggestions on ways to move forward and allow the head of a project to find the best way to implement feedback. In Pixar’s case, Catmull created this rule because he believed that studio demands only hurt a project. When given demands, creatives often make choices for the sake of pleasing the studio instead of making the best film possible. 



**Though these feedback sessions are a powerful tool to create candor, they won’t automatically fix all of the issues in your organization.** Here are some things to consider about the complexities of implementing feedback sessions:

  * **Trust and comfort take time to develop.** Initial feedback sessions may be uncomfortable or ineffective as people hold back or struggle to give “good notes.” This will become easier over time, but it can’t be rushed. 
  * **If you’re working with outside teams or collaborators, they may not understand the nature of your feedback sessions.** Because of this, you may be stuck giving feedback to someone who doesn’t want to take your notes or simply doesn’t possess the skills necessary to implement feedback. To navigate this, show patience and remind the person or team that your feedback is only meant to help improve the project.
  * **People and relationships change over time.** While the makeup of a feedback group may be effective at first, relationships change over time. To accommodate this, be aware of the ever-changing dynamics of your organization and adjust the makeup of your core feedback group 



> **Pixar’s Notes Day**
> 
> **** In addition to Braintrust Meetings, Pixar uses another forum for the discussion of feedback through _“Notes Day.”_ On Notes Day, Pixar shuts down regular operations and runs a variety of discussion forums based on topics submitted by employees. These topics range from highly technical concerns such as rendering techniques to common issues such as dealing with entitled people. While Braintrust Meetings help the company dissect the issues of a film, this method of feedback keeps Pixar up-to-date on issues outside of those specifically related to a project. **Pixar leaders use this information to find problems they may not have noticed and crowdsource solutions to issues.**

### Chapter 7: Embracing Failure

**Failure is essential to a creative workplace.** Without it, new ideas can’t be discovered or fostered because innovation requires risk. If you don’t take risks, your final product will likely be unoriginal. However, just because failure is a necessary component of creativity doesn’t make it an easy concept to embrace.

#### Separating Fear From Failure

Often, people define failure as a “necessary evil.” While this is well-intentioned, it actually perpetuates the stigma of failing. **Failure _isn’t_ evil. It’s an inevitable result of highly innovative work. **When you and your team fail, it may not be pleasant, but it gives you valuable information as you continue to explore new ideas and concepts.

**When you remove fear, you normalize failure.** At Pixar, this normalization has become so prevalent that directors actually worry when they’re not experiencing any failures or issues. For example, Catmull once praised the team of _Toy Story 3_ for not having a lot of issues during their production process. The team was offended because they believed Catmull had implied they hadn’t taken enough risks.

To determine if your company has a negative view of failure,**consider what happens when a mistake is found:**

  * Do people come together to solve the problem, or do they go to their separate corners and say nothing? If people come together and take responsibility, then fear of failure isn’t at the core of people’s decision-making process.
  * Do people take responsibility as a group, or do they search for a scapegoat? If people search for a scapegoat or refuse to contribute to solutions, then fear of failure is probably at the core of people’s decision-making process.



**As a leader, one of the best ways you can take the stigma out of failure is to admit your own failures.** Instead of ignoring your mistakes, explain what you learned and how you moved forward. This will make your employees more comfortable embracing and learning from their own failures.

When money is involved, it’s often hard to accept failure because of the amount of resources it can cost. **To circumvent this, create low-stakes environments where teams can explore new ideas without the fear of costing the company significant amounts of money.** This could be a think-tank or R&D department that focuses on investing time in new concepts.

#### Taking the Pressure off Managers

Middle managers often fear failure because they’re under pressure to stay within deadlines and budgets. To keep up with demands from upper management, middle managers often resort to micromanaging their teams and severely limiting the risks that they’re able to take. However, the purpose of a manager isn’t to restrict risk-taking. **It’s to create an environment in which employees can fail and recover.**

**Getting managers to embrace the potential of failure requires that you build trust.** You have to trust your managers to deal with problems as they arise and avoid the urge to jump in the first sign of failure. Likewise, managers have to trust their employees to take risks and do the jobs that they were hired to do. Lastly, employees have to trust that their manager won’t punish them if they fail. Instead, managers have to be patient and willing to help employees.

**This trust is developed through transparency and candidness.** When you keep secrets from your employees, you send the message that you have something to hide, and that you can’t trust your employees. In contrast, transparency shows your team that you have no hidden agenda, and you trust them with valuable information.

#### Pushing Forward Despite Fear

**As a leader, one of the worst things you can do for your team is stagnate.** Out of fear, some leaders spend so much time planning ways to avoid failure that they ultimately don’t make any progress towards their end goal. This leads to decreased productivity and morale as employees lose faith in their leadership. Also, over-planning often leads to attachment, making leaders willing to adjust and adapt as issues arise.

**Make decisions and take risks as a leader.** When you make decisions, it allows your team to feel like they’re actually working towards a final destination. Even if these decisions don’t pan out in the end, it gives your organization momentum. This isn’t to say that planning isn’t important. Have a roadmap in place as you work through a project, but you can’t allow that roadmap to dictate every decision that you make or keep you pushing ahead on a project.

For example, the original concept for _Monsters, Inc._ started as a film about a 30-year-old man who was dealing with “monsters” that represented his childhood fears. The filmmakers moved ahead with the idea but discovered a more effective story within the world of “monsters.” The final product was ultimately a very different film about a group of monsters scaring children to generate electricity. However, the film wouldn’t exist at all if they hadn’t taken the time to experiment with the original concept.

#### Knowing When to Let Go

**While failure is necessary for creative success, consistent failure can destroy a project or organization.** If a team doesn’t seem to be learning from their mistakes, you will eventually have to pull the plug on a project or remove the people who aren’t growing. If this happens, take the time to analyze why this project or person failed to learn from their mistakes. This will give you insight when it comes time to start a new project or hire a new team member.

For example, Pixar had a string of troubled projects in the early 2010s. Catmull and his team had to pull the plug on a long-developing project and new directors seemed to be struggling to learn from their mistakes. Pixar’s leadership team got together to discuss why their projects weren’t working as well as they had been in the past. The leadership team realized their teams were struggling because their new directors didn’t have mentors to ensure their success. Leaders developed a mentorship program to guide their new directors and projects.

### Chapter 8: Protecting New Ideas

When searching for a new concept to work with, it's easy to look for flaws that can lead you to dismiss a project. While critique and feedback are essential to growth, **the best way to find a new project is to look for what makes it exciting instead of what makes it problematic.** It can be risky to endorse an unproven idea, but often, those are the projects that produce the best results.

As a leader in a creative organization, **it's your job to protect and nurture these concepts until they grow into full-fledged creations.** Think of a new idea as a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. Before its transformation, a caterpillar is vulnerable and slow. It needs time inside of its protective cocoon to develop into a butterfly. When you oversee creative projects, create that cocoon to allow new concepts to grow into something greater. This doesn’t mean isolating the project from feedback or input, but give it the room to fail and struggle in order for it to develop.

#### Embracing the Mess

**The creative process isn’t clear-cut and straightforward.** It requires trial and error to be successful. Because this process can be time-consuming and expensive, you may try to cut out the messier parts of your process to speed up development and ensure lower costs.

**However, be careful about the amount of streamlining you do.** Trying to avoid the creative “messes” by cutting time out of development and overcommitting to choices early on prevents your team from finding potential errors and developing stronger ideas. While the need to efficiently create new works can create a level of motivation for you and your team, it often leads to unfinished projects or poorly developed concepts.

#### Finding Balance

**In a creative company, you have to balance the wants and needs of each department.** Each department in your organization has a different interest. For instance, your marketing team wants to create a product that sells, your management team wants to create a product that’s easy to make, and your creative team wants to make a product that’s wholly original. There isn’t one clear-cut way to ensure balance in your organization.

However, there’s one rule-of-thumb: **Don’t let one team or person get everything they want.** Because departments’ “wants” often conflict with one another, they act as a counterbalance with other teams. If one team gets everything that they want, it throws the company out of balance. For example, if you're leading a film studio, giving the creative team everything they want may lead to a bloated and over-budget film that’s too niche to sell. On the other hand, giving the marketing team everything they want may lead to an unoriginal and predictable film that appeals to the lowest common denominator.

**Balance is not stagnant.** It changes all of the time and requires constant attention. Even if a project achieves perfect equilibrium for a moment, the balance will likely begin to shift as team members make more decisions. Be aware of the shifting dynamics between decisions and make choices accordingly.

#### Letting a Project Fly

While protection is important in the early phases of a new project, the concept will eventually have to stand on its own. **Once you’ve taken the time to develop and foster a project, hand it off to other people to ensure that it’s worth continuing to invest in.** At that point, it will either fly or fall. If it flies, you can continue to work with the project or concept. If it falls, you’ll have to swallow your pride and let go of it for the good of your organization.
