## Part 2: Pixar’s Early Years

**At the beginning of its life as an independent company, Pixar struggled financially and was torn between its identity as a computer company selling products and an animation studio producing films.** Jobs had never marketed high-tech machines like the Pixar Imaging Computer, and neither Catmull nor his colleagues had ever run a company before. Catmull tried to better his managerial skills by reading books but found most of them to be shallow and useless.

### Chapter 3: The Early Structure of Pixar

In the beginning of its time as an organization, Pixar was just as focused on selling the Pixar Imaging Computer as it was on creating animated films. In an attempt to run the product division effectively, Catmull sought advice from his friends in Silicon Valley. **Unfortunately, this advice turned out to be ineffective and, sometimes, actively hurt the company, and Catmull learned there are no simple answers to complex problems.**

For example, when considering how he should price the Pixar Imaging Computer, he turned to the presidents of Sun and Silicon Graphics. They suggested that he start with a high number, arguing that it was easier to bring the price down than to raise it. However, when Catmull took their advice and asked for $122,000 per unit, they failed to move products. Even when they lowered the price, Pixar was stuck with the stigma of being “overpriced.”

#### The Japanese Manufacturing Model

As Catmull struggled with Pixar’s early growing pains, he turned to an unlikely source for inspiration: **the Japanese manufacturing industry.** Following WWII, the Japanese manufacturing industry was struggling as a result of a shattered economy. In contrast, American manufacturing was booming. For efficiency, assembly lines were used to create products, stopping only when management deemed it necessary. However, while this kept things moving, it caused a lot of problems with quality assurance and required a team of inspectors to watch for faulty products.

To boost their productivity, Japanese companies started adopting the American system with one key adjustment: **The line could be stopped by any employee at any time.** This created an environment where problems were addressed at the source rather than after the fact.

Before long, Japanese manufacturing productivity _skyrocketed_ , surpassing many American companies.**** Catmull appreciated this model because it encouraged innovation and open communication. **When building Pixar, he allowed all of his employees to address issues at any time, even if it meant pausing a project.** It gave his employees a sense of ownership over the process and helped build effective practices.

#### Abandoning Computer Sales

**Despite Catmull’s best efforts, Pixar was still in the red.** Though they had a fair amount of success as an animation studio (their early films earned them two Academy Award nominations and one win), they only managed to sell 300 computers. The sales didn’t cover the cost of building and developing the hardware.

**With this in mind, Catmull decided to stop selling hardware.** The team was much more passionate about filmmaking, and removing the costs of creating hardware would save them significant amounts of money. The problem, however, was that they now had no source of significant income. The short films they were making may have garnered awards and praise, but they didn’t bring in box office money.

**Between 1987-1991, tensions between Catmull and Jobs intensified.** Jobs was frustrated with Catmull’s inability to produce a profit, and Catmull was tired of Jobs's demanding and pretentious attitude. Jobs, having sunk tens of millions into Pixar, tried to sell the animation studio _three_ times.**** Generous offers came from Microsoft, Alias, and Silicon Graphics, but Jobs never took the sale. Catmull believes this was because the offers made Jobs see the value of Pixar. For example, if Microsoft was willing to offer $90 million, Pixar must have significant value.

### Chapter 4: _Toy Story_ and the Rise of Pixar

**Fortunately, Pixar’s shorts had gotten the attention of major studios including the biggest name in animated films: Disney.** After back-and-forth negotiations, Pixar agreed to a three-picture deal with Disney and started work on their first feature film: _Toy Story_.

_Toy Story_ was Lasseter’s brainchild. He assembled a team of creators and got to work on the film. Though there were some obstacles during the production process, the team created a stellar film that exceeded expectations. **_Toy Story_ smashed box office records and helped Pixar’s IPO raise almost $140 million for the company (the largest IPO of 1995). **Pixar was on the rise and now had the funds to ensure its continued success.

Following the monumental success of _Toy Story_ , many on the Pixar team expressed pride in having created such an acclaimed and important piece of cinema. Catmull, however, didn’t share in this excitement. Though he was immensely happy with _Toy Story_ and its reception, he had a new obstacle on his mind: _maintaining momentum_. _Toy Story_ set the bar extremely high, and Catmull wanted Pixar to continue to meet and exceed expectations.

#### Unseen Production Issues

Catmull realized he had missed some serious issues as Pixar began its next project: _A Bug’s Life._ Having put together a successful team for _Toy Story_ , Catmull asked his creative teams and production managers from that project to return for _A Bug’s Life_. However, many of the production managers were hesitant about returning for another project. **Unbeknownst to Catmull, the production managers had been treated poorly by the creatives.**

In this context, creatives are people who work directly with the animation and filmmaking process (animators, directors, modelers, and so on). Production managers, on the other hand, are the people responsible for keeping a film on-time and on-budget. On _Toy Story_ , many of the creatives believed that the production department constantly overstepped and tried to micromanage the process. This led to open resentment that created a rift between the creative and production departments.

Catmull was shocked at this revelation**. He had maintained an open-door policy throughout the entire process of _Toy Story_ , but no one had ever brought any issues to him.** Members of his production team admitted that this was because they were used to being brought on for a single film, then moving on to a different project with a new company— a common practice in the entertainment industry. Because of this, the production managers figured that they’d just finish out the _Toy Story_ process and be on their way. However, because Catmull was asking them to return and work with the same creatives who treated them poorly, the production team felt the need to voice their concerns.

When Catmull spoke with creatives about the relationship, they shared their perspective. **To ensure that things were going through “proper channels,” production managers had required creatives to go through management to speak to one another.** For example, an animator couldn’t just ask a modeler a question. They’d have to go through management first. The creative teams quickly became frustrated at this micromanagement and felt that the rules were getting in the way of the artistic process.

When addressing these issues, Catmull discovered two important principles:

  1. **It’s not enough to have an open-door policy.** While an open-door policy is important for open communication, you cannot expect people to always be comfortable enough to come to you with issues. Instead, you have to constantly be on the lookout for issues and address them as they arise. 
  2. **Micromanagement only slows down the process and builds resentment.** While an organizational structure is important, you can’t restrict the way people approach their work. This is especially true in creative environments. Every artist has a different way of working, and the best way to get high-quality work is to allow them to create in their own way. While nudges to remain on-budget and on-time are important, don’t define their process. They’ve likely developed their way of working over years of training and experience, and they know what works best for them. 



Catmull removed the mandates that required creatives to go through management to speak with other creatives and encouraged open communication instead. While he insisted that managers needed to be brought into the loop eventually, he understood the importance of quickly exchanging ideas and information in the creative process. Catmull’s changes worked. **By the time _A Bug’s Life_ wrapped up post-production, the relationship between the creative and production teams was a positive one. **

### Chapter 5: Discovering Pixar’s Principles

As Pixar started its journey, Catmull had to determine what the company’s guiding principles would be. Following the success of _Toy Story_ , Catmull and his team adopted two principles they believed would lead to success: **“Story is King” and “Trust the Process.”**

* * *

**But while these mottos were inspirational, Catmull soon discovered they fell apart when put to the test.** This realization came following a near-disaster with one of Pixar’s films: _Toy Story 2._

#### The _Toy Story 2_ Fiasco

Disney originally wanted _Toy Story 2_ to be a direct-to-video sequel. At the time, this typically meant the film would be given less attention, time, and money, leading to a lower-quality product. Catmull didn’t feel comfortable creating a mediocre film, so **he asked Disney to make it a full theatrical release.** To his surprise, they agreed.

While Catmull was thrilled to approach _Toy Story 2_ as a full-fledged theatrical release, he now faced a predicament. Pixar was still working on _A Bug’s Life_ , and, suddenly, their workload had doubled overnight. Also, most of the team who had worked on the original _Toy Story_ were involved with the _A Bug’s Life_ production process and couldn’t also work on _Toy Story 2_.

**However, confident in the principles and past success of his organization, Catmull was sure that he’d be able to put together a team to work on _Toy Story 2_. **The concept had been developed by Lasseter, and the characters and world were already established by the first film. Catmull brought on two skilled animators (and first-time directors) to lead the project. Given the fact that they had a solid concept for the film, Catmull thought _Toy Story 2_ would be an easy win for the studio if the team just remembered that “story is king” and to “trust the process.”

**He was wrong.** The directors weren’t equipped for the job and expressed no confidence in their work. They continually asked for more time with Lasseter to work through problems, but he was too busy with _A Bug’s Life_ to give them much attention. Catmull thought if he just “trusted the possess,” any issues would eventually work themselves out.

After _A Bug’s Life_ premiered in 1998, Lasseter finally had the time to look at the team’s work. At this point, the _Toy Story 2_ team had been working for about a year, and Lasseter expected the film to be in a decent place. However, after watching their reels, Lasseter told Catmull they had a problem. **The process wasn’t working, and Pixar was facing potential disaster.**

#### Changing Course

While Disney was fine with the state of the _Toy Story 2_ because it was “only a sequel,” **Catmull wasn’t willing to sacrifice the reputation of Pixar with a low-quality film.** He released the directors of _Toy Story 2_ from the project and put Lasseter in charge. He felt guilty for putting the new directors into a situation they weren’t prepared for, but he knew that letting them go was the only way to get the film back on track.

He brought back a lot of the team from the original _Toy Story_ to work on fixing this project. This group was known as the Braintrust (a term which Pixar would later adopt for film review meetings), and they were known for their ability to share feedback and critique one another without defensiveness or ego getting in the way.**With only nine months to complete the film (a fraction of the time most films of this nature need to be successfully produced), the team scrapped most of the existing film and started from scratch.**

Over the next nine months, the team worked frantically to develop the project. The employees of Pixar were exhausted and overworked, but they were dedicated to making the project work. Fortunately for Pixar, their hard work paid off. **_Toy Story 2_ was met with critical and commercial acclaim and made over $500 million at the box office.** The film did so well, in fact, that many claimed it was even better than the first film. While Catmull was proud of the success of the film, he recognized that the way it was developed wasn’t sustainable.

#### Pixar’s Guiding Principles

After _Toy Story 2_ , Catmull realized that Pixar’s original mottos were comforting but ineffective:

  1. **“Story is King.”** While it’s a powerful phrase, it’s ultimately hollow. Everyone knows that an engaging story is the key to an effective film, but it doesn’t provide any guidance to help find that story. 
  2. “**Trust the Process.”** While it’s comforting to rely on a process when things get rough, “trusting the process” can quickly become “rely on the process to fix all problems instead of addressing them.” Catmull knew that things were going south on _Toy Story 2_ early on, but he didn’t do anything about it because he was “trusting the process.” 



Instead of these concepts, Catmull developed a new focus for the company: **Find and support the right people to create amazing films.** To Catmull, quality wasn’t just a _goal_ of the company. It was the _core_ of the company. Though _Toy Story 2_ was a rough process, it cemented this ideal in Pixar’s DNA. They could have easily created a quick direct-to-video sequel as Disney had proposed, but they refused to settle.

Catmull’s core error with _Toy Story 2_ was that he relied on the wrong things to ensure quality. Moving forward, Catmull shifted the way he ran Pixar and used the following principles to guide the direction of the company:

  1. **When a mediocre team works on a great idea, the project will fail. However, when a great team works on a mediocre idea, they will either fix the idea or come up with a better one.** For example, the directors of _Toy Story 2_ were both expert animators but mediocre directors. Though they were given an excellent concept, they failed to deliver because they lacked the proper skills to elevate the product.
  2. **A singular idea isn’t enough to create a great product.** It requires a multitude of great ideas from a team of competent people. For example, the iPhone was not the result of one idea. It was, instead, the result of multiple ideas surrounding hardware, software, user interface, and other features.
  3. **Quality requires healthy employees.** Following _Toy Story 2_ , many of Pixar’s employees were exhausted, injured, or sick. While Catmull admired the passion of his employees, he knew that overworked employees couldn’t produce quality work and were more likely to leave. He began to push for team members to have a life outside of work and ensured that employees were taken care of physically and mentally. 
  4. **Excellence has to be constantly earned.** Catmull made the mistake of assuming that his company’s process was excellent because of the success of _Toy Story_. However, _Toy Story_ succeeded because of the people working on the project, not a company-wide “process.” Catmull vowed to no longer rely on his company’s past success as an indicator of future success.
