## Part 5: Sustaining a Creative Workplace

**People’s perspective on the world often distorts what’s right in front of them.** In regards to creativity, this limited perspective often leads to _inflexibility_. People become convinced their perspective is the correct perspective, and they ignore new information that contradicts their view. When you get together a team of dozens or hundreds of people, this inflexibility can stall a creative process.

### Chapter 11: Eight Tools to Expand Your Team’s Worldview

**To ensure that your team doesn’t fall into this inflexibility, create opportunities for them to expand their worldview and interact with people who have different perspectives.** The following are eight tools you can use to help your team maintain their creative spark and challenge their own perspectives:

#### Tool #1: Hold Frequent Feedback Meetings

**When going through the development process, frequent feedback sessions allow your team members to get different perspectives on their work.** This prevents your employees from becoming overly committed to their work and enables them to solve problems collaboratively. Frequent feedback also allows your team to fix potential problems early on instead of after they’ve put dozens or hundreds of hours into a project.

For example, at Pixar, Catmull created a process called “Dailies.” At Dailies, artists and creatives on a project get together at the beginning of the day to present their work for feedback. It allows artists to receive feedback from the entire team throughout the creative process. These changes may range from the size of a stick in the background to an entire character model. Because everyone has a voice and candidness is promoted, Dailies allow artists to look at their work from a different perspective and make adjustments to create a stronger product.

#### Tool #2: Promote Research

**Research is essential to creation.** Learning more about the subject of your creative project will help you produce a more realistic product. For example, if you want to create a film about living with a dog, you would need to understand what it’s like to have a pet. If you’ve done no research into the topic or haven’t had any experiences with a pet, your film probably won’t be accurate.

**Note: Research is best when it’s first-hand.** While you can take inspiration from previous creative projects, if you rely solely on the creations of others, your work will likely come across as derivative and unoriginal. The line between inspiration and theft is thin, and you’ll benefit from creating your own work based on personal research. (Shortform note: Think about the way _Playmobil: The Movie_ tried to capitalize on the success of _The Lego Movie_.)

At Pixar, this first-hand research experience is a high priority. For example, for _Ratatouille_(a film about a Parisian rat who wants to become a chef), Pixar sent a team to Paris to eat in Michelin-star restaurants, interview chefs, and visit kitchens. Less enjoyably, they also explored Paris’ sewer system to see where the rats resided. Using this research, the team could create a detailed world for their film. While most viewers may not notice many of these intricacies, the details work together to create a relatable environment.

#### Tool #3: Create Clear Boundaries

**Though it may seem counterintuitive, creating boundaries for your teams can actually promote creativity in addition to efficiency.** It forces them to approach challenges in a unique way and focus on the most important elements of the project. In many situations, creative solutions can actually produce stronger results than the initial plan.

As an example of the creative benefits, the team working on the original _Halloween_ film had to create Michael Myers’ mask on a tight budget. Unable to afford a custom piece, the art director, Burt Wheeler, had to come up with a creative and cheap solution. Ultimately, he found an odd-looking Captain Kirk mask, spray painted it, and modified the eye holes so the actor could see. The result of this creative obstacle: one of the most iconic looks in horror movie history. (Shortform note: This example was pulled from this article.)

To improve efficiency, Pixar had to set boundaries because artists were spending too much time investing in things that had no bearing on the story. A Pixar producer came up with a system that limited the amount of time spent on any given aspect of a film. For _The Incredibles,_ Walker posted images of each of the characters in the film. Next to them, he velcroed popsicle sticks to the wall, each representing a “person-week” (the amount of work one animator could complete in a week). If someone wanted to spend more time working on a particular character, they’d have to remove a popsicle stick from another character. This forced the team to focus their time on the most necessary components of the film.

**Note: Setting boundaries doesn’t suggest that detailed work is unimportant.** Rather, it deals with the realities of deadlines and budget. Of course, you want to create the best product possible. However, with any creative project that has deadlines and monetary restrictions, you have to set priorities for the good of the project as a whole.

#### Tool #4: Combine Art With Technology

**While it's tempting to stick to methods that you already know, using new technology can allow your team to create new works in an original and more effective way.** For example, where artists once had to use a pencil and paper to create sketches, tablets now allow them to create digital art that they can easily share and modify. This use of technology speeds up their process and gives them more creative freedom.

**Technology can inspire creativity.** As technology continues to improve, artists can develop projects in a wholly original way. For example, Pixar used new computer technologies to create films unlike anything anyone had ever seen before.

In a smaller-scale example, Pixar’s director, Brad Bird, wanted a way to sketch over top of digital models to help him give clearer feedback. For instance, if a character’s expression wasn’t reading, Bird wanted to be able to sketch something over the model that reflected the emotional state he was trying to evoke. The software team managed to develop a program that allowed Bird to deliver feedback in this way. The new technology streamlined the feedback process and gave animators and modelers a clearer vision of what changes their director was requesting.

#### Tool #5: Create an Experimental Space

**Experimental projects give you a space to take risks without the pressure of making a profit.** They allow your organization to explore new ideas, find better ways of working, and give employees with potential more experience. Think of these environments as a creative company’s R&D department. The nature and costs of these spaces vary from company to company, but the benefits of exploring new concepts in a safe space can yield industry-shaking results.

For example, Pixar likes to experiment by creating short films. While these projects have become a beloved and iconic part of Pixar’s releases (they show one before every feature film), these shorts aren’t meant to turn a profit. Instead, they benefit the company in the following ways:

  * **Team members gain experience.** Because the teams working on short films are smaller than those working on feature-length films, everyone involved in the project has to be involved in multiple phases of production. This gives them a wider range of experience that helps them when they work on larger projects.
  * **The shorts help Pixar work through obstacles.** Though most technological advancements happen on feature films, some breakthroughs were made by giving short films clear objectives. For instance, _Geri’s Game_ , which ran before _A Bug’s Life_ , was created with the goal of discovering a better way to animate human characters. 
  * **If a short project fails, Pixar can move on.** This allows them to put potential directors and artists in charge without risking a box office bomb. For instance, Catmull was once interested in a children’s book author who wanted to direct a feature film for Pixar. As a test, they had him helm one of their short films. The production didn’t go smoothly, and the final product was meandering and lacked an emotional spine. Because of this result, Catmull decided not to move forward on a feature led by this individual. 



#### Tool #6: Put Aside Your Preconceived Notions

The human brain likes to simplify our surroundings so that they’re easier to process. **However, this simplification leads people to jump to conclusions that aren’t entirely accurate.** For example, when asked to draw the human face, many people struggle to get the correct proportions. This is because the brain emphasizes the “important” parts of the face such as the eyes and ignores the “unimportant” parts such as the forehead.

**In a creative organization, seeing something for what it is rather than what you want it to be is essential.** This level of objectivity allows you to notice errors more quickly and pay attention to details you may not have previously noticed. This creates depth within your projects and ensures you're producing a fully realized product.

For example, when an artist learns to pay attention to the details of an object, they have to let go of any preconceived notions they may have about the subject. Rather than just painting a lake the color blue, they become attuned to the small flecks of green, yellow, and white that reflect off of the top of a river. This attention to detail allows them to create a more fully realized version of their surroundings.

#### Tool #7: Use Postmortems

**Postmortems are meetings that occur after a project is completed in which you discuss the process as a whole.** This allows you and your team to speak out about what’s working and what’s not. These postmortems should occur relatively quickly following the end of a project while the process is still fresh in everyone’s mind.

**There are four important reasons to hold postmortems:**

  * **Reflect on what you’ve learned.** In the middle of a project, it’s often hard to process the lessons that you’re learning because you’re focused on navigating obstacles and finishing the project. Postmortems give you a chance to reflect from an outside perspective. 
  * **Inform the people who weren’t in the room.** Sometimes, decisions have to be made quickly and without much explanation. Postmortems give you a chance to explain why decisions were made and why they were important.
  * **Let go of resentment.** Often, individuals or teams can be upset with one another because of issues that occurred during the process. If left unresolved, these issues can fester and explode during future projects. Postmortems give you a chance to voice your frustrations and hash out issues before moving to the next project. 
  * **Ask questions for future projects.** Looking to the past allows you to better prepare for the future. Postmortems give you a chance to be proactive and figure out trouble areas before moving into a new project.



**When developing your postmortems, consider the following tips:**

  * **Vary the way you run the meeting from project to project.** If you use the same format and ask the same questions at every postmortem, people will begin to preempt your questions. Because of this, they may game the system, and the information won’t be as valuable. To vary your approach, you can narrow the focus of the meeting or have different groups compare processes with one another.
  * **Help people be comfortable delivering criticism.** At the end of a project, the last thing most people want to do is talk about issues or problems. To alleviate this, find ways to make your team more comfortable giving candid feedback. One way is to have them make a list of five positive things and five negative things. The balance of positive and negative makes people feel more comfortable talking about problems.
  * **Use data you’ve obtained throughout the process.** While a lot of factors in a creative process aren’t quantifiable, you can find many things that are. These things include the amount of time certain departments took to produce, the amount of times things had to be changed, and estimated costs vs. actual costs. Use this information to drive discussion and formulate questions. Note: while data is important, it isn’t everything. Don’t fall into the trap of using data to dictate _all_ of your decisions. There are a number of factors that play into the numbers, and it's easy to find false patterns if you seek them out. 



#### Tool #8: Build Learning Opportunities and Team-Bonding Experiences

**Learning opportunities keep your team members open to new experiences and allow them to bond with one another.** These opportunities don’t have to have to be specific to your industry. In fact, it's sometimes better if they _aren’t**.**_ Tackling subjects they’ve never worked on before keeps team members in the mindset of a student, willing to learn and explore new ideas.

This also helps members of your organization bond in a way that they can’t during a typical work day. Being a student puts everyone on the same playing field, regardless of hierarchical level. Therefore, the intern may feel more comfortable speaking with an executive if they’re both working toward learning a new subject.

At Pixar, Catmull developed a program called Pixar University to create these opportunities. The classes range from ballet to computer programming. Catmull believes that this educational outlet helps his team members embrace what’s known in Japanese Zen as “the Beginner’s Mind.” “The Beginner’s Mind” removes the constraints of what you already know and allows you to focus on learning something new. When you’re a beginner, you have nothing to lose and are usually less afraid of failure. When this mindset is embraced by creative people, they’re better equipped to step into the unknown and explore new concepts.

### Chapter 12: Using Mental Models and Mindfulness

In order to grow as a creative organization, you have to be willing to take risks and dive the unknown. This, however, is easier said than done. Trying to build something out of nothing requires mental fortitude and comfort with uncertainty.

**One of the best ways to keep calm in the face of uncertainty is to form a mental model that keeps you focused on your objectives and confident in your decision-making.** A mental model is a visualized scenario that represents a process. For example, you may compare your work on a project to climbing a mountain or running a race.****

#### Mental Models for Creative Teams

**At the beginning of a project, creative teams don’t know where their project is going to take them.** While they may have a plan, the creative process isn’t linear and often veers off in different directions. While the venture into the unknown is necessary, it’s also terrifying.

A natural impulse may be to take control of the situation and try to dictate a specific direction to avoid failing. However, if you begin to overthink every choice that you’re making, you risk stifling the creative process and creating unoriginal work. Instead, you have to become comfortable pushing into the unknown and building a project based upon your discoveries. **The more avenues that you explore, the more fleshed out your final project will be.**

To help you through your creative project, visualize your process as a journey. **As you form your scenario, consider the following factors:**

  * **Know what tools you have at your disposal.** You have resources and team members on your side. In your visualization, relate specific tools in your imagined scenario to the resources at your disposal. For example, if you’re visualizing your journey as driving through a long tunnel, you may relate the headlights on your car to your management team because your managers keep you focused on the road ahead.
  * **Recognize the external factors outside of your control.** There will be external things that you will have to navigate as you go through your journey. In your visualization, relate specific factors in your imagined scenario to the uncontrollable obstacles you may encounter in real life. For example, if you’re visualizing your journey as flying a plane, you may relate turbulence to fights between departments.
  * **Give yourself a goal, even if your final destination isn’t known.** Having a goal helps motivate you to continue moving forward. Even if your final destination isn’t definite, you need something to strive for. For example, if you’re visualizing your journey as an archeological dig, you may relate your search for bones or artifacts to finding new ideas and concepts. Even though you don’t necessarily know specifically _where_ to dig, you know that you have to keep on digging.



For example, Pixar director Andrew Stanton believes in the philosophy of “failing fast and failing often.” To him, this means that it’s better to make quick decisions to figure out what works and what doesn’t. To visualize this, he imagines himself captaining a ship on the open sea. He can’t see his final destination, but he knows that he has to keep the ship sailing ahead in hope of finding land. Though he may momentarily navigate his crew in the wrong direction, keeping the ship moving keeps the crew confident that their leader is actively trying to get them to shore. He can’t control the wind or the waves, but he can adjust the course when external factors impact the movement of the ship.

#### Mental Models for Management Teams

Creative teams aren’t the only ones who can use mental models to their advantage. **Management teams have the challenge of balancing different departments, deadlines, and budgetary constraints.** Through visualization, they can develop a mental model that helps them balance a variety of factors.

To help you maintain focus as a manager, develop a mental model that emphasizes the different areas you need to balance. **As you form your scenario, consider the following factors:**

  * **Define the ways each department relates to other departments.** Each department and team has a different set of needs and requirements. In your mental model, be sure to clearly define these needs and the ways that they impact other areas of the process. For example, if you’re visualizing your job as a two-sided scale, you may relate the weights on either side of the scale to resources. Give one team too much weight, and the scale falls out of balance.
  * **Discover ways to interact with varying personalities.** As a manager, you’ll have to interact with different types of people. While you don’t want to be fake, it’s often beneficial to know the best way to approach conversations with different departments. In your mental model, find a way to represent differing perspectives and your ability to move between them. For example, if you’re visualizing your job as traveling through a multi-floored building, you may relate each floor of the building to a different department. Each floor gives teams a different perspective on the world around them, and it’s your job to navigate these different perspectives to keep the entire building operational.
  * **Find a way to keep your project on track.** While each department may have different short-term objectives, you must ensure that each team is contributing to the bigger picture. Some teams may become so focused on their own work that they begin to lose sight of their role in the organization. Define the overall objective of the company and make sure your mental model reflects your need to keep people on task. For example, if you’re visualizing your job as a shepherd tending to sheep, you may relate each of the sheep to a different department. Each sheep has an independent brain, but it’s your job to keep them moving towards the ultimate destination. 



For example, Pixar producer Lindsey Collins visualizes herself as a chameleon. She’s able to adapt to any situation based upon the needs of her environment. While she can’t control her environment, she can adjust the way she approaches a situation to ensure her survival. This mental model helps her when she’s dealing with strong personalities in high-pressure situations. Rather than forcing her environment to change, she adapts to the things she can’t control.

> **Mindfulness and Meditation**
> 
> **People often struggle to stay in the present.** They spend a lot of time either reflecting on the past or planning for the future. While both of these concepts have benefits when used in moderation, focusing on either of them for too long causes you to ignore what’s right in front of you.
> 
> **To combat this, find a mindfulness practice that works for you.** These practices can range from attending a regular yoga class to practicing meditation on your own. For instance, Catmull regularly attends silent meditation retreats to keep him grounded in the moment instead of tied up in the past or future.
