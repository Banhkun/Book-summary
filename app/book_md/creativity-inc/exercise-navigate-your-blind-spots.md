## Exercise: Navigate Your Blind Spots

Your blind spots may contain problems that could have potentially disastrous consequences. To ensure the safety of your organization, take the time to find the problem areas that are currently hidden from your view.

* * *

Think of a time where a team member seemed to agree with everything you said. Did their support seem genuine or could you detect signs they were just telling you what they thought you wanted to hear? Describe the situation.

Think of your current workplace. Are candid feedback and open communication promoted? Why or why not? (For instance, do you believe a lower-level employee would feel comfortable giving feedback to the CEO?)

What ways could you promote candidness to ensure that your employees give their honest observations?

Think of a recent problem you had on a project. How could you have used perspectives from different departments to develop an effective solution?
