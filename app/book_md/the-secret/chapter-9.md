## Chapter 9: Wealth and the Law of Attraction

By now you understand the power of the Creative Process, and how they apply to your body and health. The same principles apply to money and creating wealth in your life.

### Focus on Money

**To attract money, you must focus on money.** To bring money to you, you must create a new thought message of wealth.

When you focus on a lack of money or the consequences of not having enough, you are blocking all the money waiting for you with your thoughts.**If your thoughts are on not having enough, you will never have enough.**

  * The Law of Attraction will bring back those pictures of not having enough as experiences.
  * For example, when you have bills stacking up and don’t know where the money to pay them will come from, focusing on those bills will only attract more bills.
  * Even though it’s hard, focusing on abundance, despite the bills, will send out the proper signal. Say, “These bills will be paid. Life is abundant, and something will come through.” Then believe it and feel the relief of it coming true.



**You can’t attract money if you feel bad about money.** It makes sense that when you do not have enough money, money becomes a stressor. Your thoughts around it become negative.

  * **Those negative feelings about money are stopping more from coming to you.**



If you can start to **feel good about money and showing gratitude for what you have** , you can create a new frequency. You must change your thoughts from lack-of-money to more-than-enough-money. Start to say and believe that you have more than enough. Feel it and show gratitude.

Remember the childhood game of make believe? **Use your imagination to see and believe that you already have more than enough money.** Imagine what you would buy with that money. All the things you will do. Imagine yourself spending, and feel the joy of it.

  * If you’ve ever thought, “I can’t afford it,” change those thoughts to, “I can afford that. I can buy anything I want.” Say it again and again, and believe it. 
  * When you see something you want, say, “I can afford that. I can buy that.” Better yet, look for things you want, and repeat those phrases.
    * If you want to buy a Porsche, find the one you want, no matter how outlandish, and repeat, “I can buy that Porsche. I can afford it.”
    * As you say the words, you will become convinced of the truth of those words. That expectation will translate into new pictures the Law of Attraction will mirror back to you. 



There is abundance in the world, and your responsibility is not regarding the _how_ of money coming to you. All you have to do is ask, believe you are receiving, and feel joyful about having received.

#### Making Money the Old Fashioned Way

If you believe the only way money will come to you is by struggling, release that thought immediately.

  * If you believe money only comes through struggle, you are emitting that frequency. The Law of Attraction must, by its nature, make that picture your experience. You will get a struggle.
  * Instead, **think thoughts about how easy it is to attain money and how often money comes to you**.****



By merely existing, you are deserving of prosperity. The keys to attaining prosperity are your thoughts and feelings. You’ve had the keys all along, and now you know how to use them.

### The Power of Giving

**When you give, you are acknowledging that you have more than enough to share.** This powerful action sets you on the frequency of having plenty of money, and you will continue to have plenty.

If you don’t believe you have enough to give, you now know why you don’t have enough to give. When thoughts of not enough enter your mind, start giving. Giving is an act of love and abundance, and love feels good. Giving from a full heart is one of the best feelings in the world. The Law of Attraction will use that signal to send even more to your life.

**As you exhibit faith in the ability to give, the Law of Attraction must provide you more to give.**

Financial sacrifice is not the same as giving. Sacrificing stems from a thought of giving _despite your lack_. The underlying thought is one of there not being enough. Your good deed for another creates a bad frequency for you. Sacrifice will lead to resentment. Your thoughts of being without will be compounded as you feel you are losing more.

The actions of giving and sacrificing are the same. The thoughts are different. **Turn your thoughts about sacrificing into thoughts of sharing your abundance with another.** Those thoughts will signal the Law of Attraction with the right frequency.
