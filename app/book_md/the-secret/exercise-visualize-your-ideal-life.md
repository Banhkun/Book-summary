## Exercise: Visualize Your Ideal Life

Since visualization is more than just a static picture, you can think of the act of visualizing as making a moving picture of your life.

* * *

Think of something you want really badly. Create a picture of that thing in your life. What does it look like, in detail?

Go beyond images, and think about the sensations in your visualization. What do you feel, using your five physical senses? How do you feel internally?

Now “act as if” you already have this thing in your life. What can you do today to make room to receive what you want?
