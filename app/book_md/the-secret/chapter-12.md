## Chapter 12: Pulling It All Together for a Better Future

The more you practice the Law of Attraction and experience it bringing things to you, the greater your faith will be. **The stronger faith you have, the greater the magnet you’ll become.** As you start to change your thoughts, you start to change your life.

Using the principles of _The Secret_ is like driving a car at night on a dark highway. The headlights will only show you so much of what is in front of you. But you believe that someone made the road. You trust that you can keep driving and keep finding road to drive on. You trust that you will have enough road to make it to your destination. This is the same trust you need to have with the Law of Attraction.

If you use your thoughts to create but the outcome isn’t what you wanted, you’re not stuck with it. Change the thought to create a new frequency. Get a new result. **As long as you exist, you have the ability to think your life into existence.**

  * As we learned earlier, the future version of you already exists. 
  * **Any delay you experience in creating your new life is not an issue with the Law of Attraction.** It is an issue with your thoughts. 
  * A delay in believing, knowing, and feeling you have received what you’ve asked for will delay your having received it. 



The Law of Attraction can be considered the law of supply. With this law, there is an infinite supply available for you to attract. Remember, the things that come to you and the things you desire are not due to anything on the outside.

  * No one has made the decision to give or not give you something. 
  * **If you believe others are in control, you have no choice but to see life through the lens of lack**. 
  * If you believe life is physical and finite, you will experience life as one of limitations, rather than abundance.



You are the creator of your own life. Anything that comes from the outside originated inside you. If you believe in abundance, you can ask for whatever you want.

**Manifesting five dollars is no easier than manifesting five hundred dollars or five thousand dollars.** The only difference is your ability to believe. You likely believe that attaining five dollars is not hard because it’s not a lot of money. If you can believe the same thing about five million dollars, you will start to believe it is not hard to attain, as well.

**To learn how to harness the Law of Attraction, start small.** Do a test run. Ask for something small and simple. Something you have no trouble believing can be yours. When you receive that small thing, move on to something a little bigger. Once you experience receiving something small, you will be able to believe in receiving anything.

**As you learn to expect good things and abundance, you will begin to create a life that includes good things and abundance.**

### Time Is on Your Side

You can use the Law of Attraction to create your whole life in advance. **Just as you learned to set expectations for your day, set the same expectations for your life.**

  * When you are leaving for a vacation and think, “This trip is going to be awesome,” you are setting the frequency for an awesome vacation. The universe will conspire to bring you people, circumstances, and events that make your vacation awesome. 
    * If you think, “This vacation cost a fortune. It better not be a disaster,” you’re thinking of all the ways it could be a disaster instead of how it will be great. How do you think that trip is going to go?
  * If you think, “I’ll never become what I want,” you won’t.
  * If you always feel like there is never enough time, realize that by always thinking and feeling that way, you have made sure there will never be enough time.



**Time is an illusion.** Believing you don’t have enough time, whether in the future or today, creates the consequences of rushing and carelessness.

Rushing stems from fear: fear of being late or disruptive or thought irresponsible. When you rush, you are focused on those fears. The universe will bring more into your life that makes you need to rush. Your thoughts center around fear of the “or else” at stake if you don’t get done what you want. You start to do things quickly, instead of intentionally.

When you are rushing, simply stop and adjust your frequency. **If you are chasing time, pull yourself off that frequency by saying, “I have all the time in the world,” because you do.**

**Make it a habit to create every aspect of your life by intentionally setting your thoughts on what you are able to do.** Know that you have plenty of time to accomplish your goals, and you will.

### The Choice is Yours

You have the knowledge of _The Secret_ now. Whether you choose to use it is up to you and right for you. Even if you don’t use it, you can’t go wrong changing your thoughts to positive ones. **At the very least, a life of positive thoughts is more enjoyable than a life of negativity.**

  * Focus on love and joy. 
  * If you aren’t sure what brings you joy, try asking, “What is my joy?”
  * Your only job in life is to be happy and feel happy and do it RIGHT NOW!!!



If you choose to use the principles of _The Secret_ , forget who you thought you were. You now know who you really are. You are the master of the universe. **The more you believe in your power and use it, the more you will bring into your life.**

After a while, you won’t have to think about it. You will just be a powerful magnet full of joy and love. You will just be the perfect version of you because you believe you are the perfection you want to be.
