## Exercise: Think Positive About Relationships

Think about relationships with positivity, and you’ll get positive relationships in return.

* * *

What are three things your partner did recently that made you feel happy? If you don’t currently have a partner, what are three things your ideal partner would do to make you happy?

What do those things say about your partner?

Think of a negative thought you have about your partner or your current love life. What is it? Now try to convert that into a positive statement, instead, of something you _want_. What is it?
