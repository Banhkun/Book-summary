## Exercise: Use the Creative Process to Get What You Want

Now that you can be, have, or do anything you want, without exception, it’s time to get clear on what that is.

* * *

What could you ask for that would make your immediate life better? Be specific.

Take a minute to believe that your thoughts have power and that what you’ve asked for will be yours. Don’t worry about the how, just believe. What thoughts come through your head?

Now prepare to receive. What does it feel like when you’ve gotten what you’ve asked for? Describe the sensations vividly.
