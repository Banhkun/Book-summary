## Shortform Introduction

Throughout this summary, you may come to understand the logic of _The Secret_ as something akin to “Think good thoughts, get good things.” Yet, there is more nuance to the principles and how to approach them.

Critics of _The Secret_ likely see the concept as “wishful thinking.” For example, one might say, “Well, I wished for a Ferrari, but I still drive a Buick” or “I can wish I had a million dollars all day, but it doesn’t change the fact that I don’t.”

One reason for this criticism is that much of _The Secret_ revolves around the idea of faith. The ability to believe in your power to change the universe is a hard concept for some to buy into. Also, the tone Rhonda Byrne uses throughout the text feels more like a pep talk than concrete guidance, and so the principles might feel implausible. For instance, the idea that positive thinking can cure you of disease probably feels unrealistic. (To be faithful to the book, we use a similar level of enthusiasm in our summary, and we retain its core ideas.)

If you’re skeptical, we recommend not dismissing this book as saying that you can literally wish _anything_ into existence. Rather, see this as **a basis to change your approach to getting what you want out of life**. For example, merely thinking positive thoughts about heart disease will likely not cure you. But focusing on these positive thoughts can uplift your approach to how you live. They can motivate you to take more positive actions surrounding your health, rather than indulging your fears or negative perspectives.

If you’re skeptical of the book, try to approach it pragmatically in a way you can accept. Throughout this summary, we’ve taken the original book, which can be meandering and confusing, and reconstructed it in a way that represents a process. By understanding the steps, tools, and logic of _The Secret_ , you will start to see how you can practically implement them.

You don’t have to believe every word of _The Secret_ to benefit. Creating a more positive life through positive thoughts has little downside. If you can allow the principles to help reduce psychological stress, at the very least, you will have benefitted.
