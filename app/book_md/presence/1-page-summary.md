## 1-Page Summary

Have you ever felt anxious about a new social situation, an interview, a performance, or another environment where you lack confidence? Perhaps you’ve tried giving yourself a pep talk beforehand or tried to push through the feelings of self-doubt, but you still didn’t quite feel like you put your best self forward.

In _Presence_ (2016), social psychology researcher Amy Cuddy explains how to navigate these stressful situations by embodying **“presence”—a self-assured confidence that’s not arrogant but allows you to comfortably express your true self**. By improving your presence, Cuddy says you can increase your likelihood of succeeding and reduce stress before, during, and after high-pressure moments. All of this can be done by making small changes to your body language and leveraging the body-mind connection to change the way you feel about _yourself_ rather than worrying about what others perceive.

Cuddy’s interest in the psychology behind presence started during her college years when she suffered a traumatic brain injury that diminished both her cognitive functions and her self-confidence as she tried to return to her normal life. In the years since, she earned a Ph.D. from Princeton University, taught at Harvard University, and gave a viral TED talk about the power of body language that launched her career as a keynote speaker and best-selling author.

(Shortform note: Cuddy’s trajectory is similar in some ways to that of neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, who suffered a stroke and later incorporated her insights from the experience into her research, memoir (_My Stroke of Insight_), and popular TED talk on how we can achieve inner peace by increasing our awareness of how the brain works and how to access different parts of it. However, Taylor was _already_ a neuroscience researcher when the stroke derailed her career for several years.)

In this guide, we’ll explain Cuddy’s concept of presence (and what happens when you _don’t_ have presence), the many ways it can benefit you, and the small steps you can take to acquire it. We’ll also explain how research on this topic has evolved since the book was published and include tips from other experts on how to navigate stressful experiences.

### What Is Presence?

According to Cuddy, “presence” is having faith in your abilities and feeling comfortable in your own skin, which naturally leads to**an easy, confident mindset** **where you don’t overthink what you’re doing or get distracted by what might go wrong**. She adds that when you embody presence, you exhibit agency over your self-expression (what Cuddy calls “personal power”). For example, if you have presence while giving a presentation, you can communicate clearly and confidently engage with the audience through your body language and speech.

(Shortform note: Cuddy’s definition of presence overlaps significantly with most people’s conception of confidence—feeling secure in your abilities—but it also seems to incorporate aspects of _stage presence_. Good stage presence goes beyond confidence because it also includes engaging your audience through your body language and movement as well as getting the audience to feel personally connected to your performance—themes that Cuddy describes in her advice for increasing your presence. Notably, her concept of having presence isn’t the same as _being present_ , which means staying wholly focused on the here-and-now.)

Cuddy explains that when you _don’t_ have presence and instead feel anxious about a situation, you tend to project your negative feelings onto other people. For example, you think, “I’m not smart enough or talented enough to get this job” and then you assume that other people perceive you that way, too.

This kind of self-doubt can spiral—you adopt a protective posture by hunching, for example, which gives off a negative, closed-off impression to others. You might start to panic, which inhibits clear thinking and lowers your performance despite your preparation. Or, if you overcompensate for your lack of confidence, others may perceive you as insincere or manipulative. Odds are, Cuddy argues, **if you’re trying too hard to manage your persona, it's likely to reinforce your initial anxiety** and leave you fixating on how you could have done better.

> **Avoiding Doom Spirals and Consequences of Overthinking**
> 
> In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz says that these self-doubt spirals are a result of using your imagination deconstructively, meaning you imagine bad things happening until they become automatic negative thoughts and feelings in difficult situations.
> 
> To avoid these runaway negative thought cycles, and the hunched, closed-off body language that follows, Maltz says you can reprogram your mental self-image by visualizing yourself being successful until you’ve created a strong positive impression of yourself in your subconscious. Based on Cuddy’s analysis, this would then help you avoid overmanaging your image in the moment by focusing on _preparation_ for the scenario and reducing your self-consciousness during the activity.
> 
> Psychologists also point out that while everyone overthinks and ruminates on negativity occasionally, it can contribute to the development of mental illness when taken to the extreme. Outside of the high-pressure contexts Cuddy refers to, it can also lead to interpersonal conflicts (particularly if you assume the worst in people), insomnia, and difficulty making decisions.

### How Will Presence Benefit You?

In addition to avoiding stress and negative-thought spirals under pressure, Cuddy asserts that presence has numerous benefits: It encourages you to be proactive and take on challenges, improves your ability to build trust and connect with others, enables you to think clearly and creatively, and increases your resilience even when things don’t go your way.

**Each time you experience one of these benefits of presence, the behavior is self-reinforcing.** With each small win, you’ll feel less anxious the next time you’re in a similar situation. Eventually, you’ll find that being fully present and putting your best self forward comes effortlessly.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that you might become the confident, present person you’re emulating because practicing a behavior repeatedly makes the behavior more natural over time, even if it’s effortful at first or if you don’t get the “small win.” In _Switch_ , Chip and Dan Heath explain that this is partly because you’ll start to attach your identity to that behavior and will be motivated to act in alignment with who you believe you are. For example, if you do a public speaking event regularly, you’ll start to think of “public speaker” as a part of who you are, which will naturally make you more confident.)

#### Presence Makes You More Proactive and Optimistic

One major benefit of presence is that it **makes you more proactive and excited to take on challenges**. This opens up new opportunities that you might have otherwise avoided due to a fear of failure. (Shortform note: Some experts suggest that the willingness to take action and take on challenges might also be more conducive to innovation. In _Daring Greatly_ , Brené Brown says that the fear of failure tends to make you disengage and avoid risk, yet creativity and learning require vulnerability. She adds that disengagement as a result of fear will ultimately damage how you feel about yourself and demotivate you—much like Cuddy describes the self-reinforcing nature of presence.)

When you have this enthusiastic mindset, **you’re also able to reframe your nervousness as excitement** , which improves your performance. For example, say you’re about to begin a competition, and you notice your heart rate increases and you have butterflies in your stomach. Presence—reinforced by your body language—allows you to acknowledge the feeling and frame it in a positive way (“I can’t wait to put my hard work to the test!”), rather than feeling like you might choke under pressure.

(Shortform note: One way to reframe anxiety and manage your nerves is to think about the situation in terms of what you can influence versus control. For example, you can influence how you interpret the embodied experience of nervousness either by shifting your body language as Cuddy suggests, or by writing down your negative thoughts and then rewriting them with a positive spin. Psychologist Andrea Marsden also recommends asking yourself if your fear is productive and if there’s anything you can do about it. For example, you won’t be able to control weather conditions or attendance at an event. She says to acknowledge and accept what’s out of your control and focus on the positive thinking that _can_ influence your experience.)

#### Presence Builds Trust

In addition to making you proactive and optimistic, having presence and **being able to show people the truest, most confident version of yourself enables you to gain the trust of others quickly**. This ability to connect with people is beneficial in countless scenarios including professional settings (such as business pitches, interviews, and speeches) or simply meeting new friends. As a bonus to feeling less self-conscious and stressed, having presence increases your chances of being successful in situations where you want to build trust. By demonstrating that you’re open, friendly, and sincere through your body language, you tend to make people mirror that behavior, encouraging them to exhibit those traits toward _you_ in return.

(Shortform note: While presence is a good way to increase your chances of building trust and connecting with others at the onset of a relationship, it may not be sufficient—particularly in the long term. In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano lists several actionables that will help you build trust over time in a professional context. For example, he says to always follow through on your commitments and take responsibility for your mistakes. In interpersonal relationships, building trust requires many behaviors such as honesty, open conversation, and consistency.)

#### Presence Enhances Thinking and Creativity

The next benefit of presence is that **feeling at ease in a difficult situation enhances your cognitive functions**. This means that you’re better able to think clearly, easily access all of the knowledge and skills you already have, and come up with creative solutions and ideas on the fly. On the other hand, when you’re worried about how you’re perceived or how well you’re doing at a given task, your anxiety hinders your performance in these areas and makes you more susceptible to external pressures.

For example, if you’re in a work meeting and you’re feeling like you don’t really deserve to be there, you’re more likely to agree with whatever other people are saying rather than processing information and expressing your sincere and original thoughts.

> **What’s the Best State of Mind for Optimal Performance?**
> 
> Some experts disagree on whether a state of ease is ideal for optimal performance. In _Relentless_ , for example, Tim Grover says that you perform better under intense pressure because it forces you to rise to the challenge. In contrast to Cuddy’s assertion that you should avoid feelings of self-doubt in these scenarios by fostering presence, Grover writes that you can manage the stress and fear by exposing yourself to those scenarios constantly, giving you plenty of practice at it.
> 
> On the other hand, psychologists assert that people respond differently to pressure, so everyone will have their own optimal level of pressure beyond which it will start to have a negative effect on their performance.
> 
> One distinction between good and bad pressure may be that it’s helpful to acknowledge that you’re in a difficult, high-stakes situation as long as you don’t become distracted by what other people think of you. In other words, it’s good to feel at ease about your _abilities_ and not necessarily the overall task.

#### Presence Increases Resilience

Lastly, presence fosters inner resilience so that even if you fail to dazzle everyone at a cocktail party or don’t get the job you interviewed for, you’ll still feel content knowing that you did your best. And when you experience setbacks, presence makes you more likely to maintain the risk-taking, proactive attitude we described earlier. In other words, even when you don’t get the outcome you hoped for, **presence protects you from letting your fear and self-doubt control and define you**. Instead, you’ll feel ready to try again with the knowledge that you’re capable and worthy of success.

(Shortform note: Another way to boost the inner resilience that presence provides is by practicing what some experts call “failing fast.” According to Katty Kay and Claire Shipman’s _The Confidence Code, _this means trying out lots of ideas knowing that most of them will likely fail, which may be most applicable in professional endeavors. Fast failing helps you overcome fear and self-doubt because trying new ideas in quick succession combats perfectionism and indecision, helps you avoid ruminating on things that didn’t go well, and provides opportunities to practice self-compassion if you don’t succeed.)

### How to Increase Your Presence

Now that we’ve defined presence and described its many benefits, we’ll explore practical steps to achieve presence through incremental changes that are easy to implement in your day-to-day life. A key to presence is good self-esteem and clarity about your identity, and Cuddy says that one way to achieve this is by affirming your strengths and what’s most important to you by writing down or reflecting on these elements before you enter a challenging situation. The reminder of your priorities and strengths will reduce your fear of being rejected and put you at ease because you’re reassured by _your_ positive opinion rather than speculating about what others may think.

(Shortform note: Cuddy’s concept of achieving presence by affirming your strengths and priorities is similar to other authors’ advice for cultivating confidence. For example, in _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard says that to be confident you must have a clear self image so that you can then decisively pursue that vision. He says you can acquire this trait—what he calls “congruence”—by defining your values and setting intentions before you begin an endeavor. Burchard’s other two attributes of confidence include interpersonal connection (which presence also encourages), and competence (which Cuddy doesn’t include as a prerequisite for presence).)

The other major component of Cuddy’s advice hinges on the link between your mind and body and the idea that **you can improve your mindset by changing your body language**. She explains that the body-mind link is two-way: For example, when you feel embarrassed, your face flushes red—a physical response to the emotion. But when you change your posture to exude confidence—by relaxing your shoulders, for instance—your emotions also take cues _from_ your body, and you start to genuinely feel more at ease.

(Shortform note: Because of this two-way connection, many wellness experts recommend the reverse of Cuddy’s advice: Improve your _physical health_ by changing your mindset. For example in _Ikigai_ , Héctor García and Francesc Miralles recommend managing your stress to prevent conditions such as premature aging and high blood pressure. Their advice for achieving mental resilience is to embrace two principles from Japanese culture: wabi-sabi—finding beauty in imperfection) and ichi-go ichi-e—recognizing that the current moment is fleeting.)

In this section, we’ll break down the best ways to use body language to your advantage before a nerve-wracking situation, how to carry yourself _during_ a challenging situation to enhance your presence, and how you can build presence in the long term through small changes to your body language.

#### _Before_ the Challenging Scenario: Power Pose

Cuddy’s advice to calm the mind and increase self-assurance before a difficult performance or experience is to find a place to **“power pose,” or adopt a physical stance that increases the feeling of presence** (or simply the feeling of being “powerful” as researchers often refer to it). For example, raise your arms up in a v-shape, place your legs shoulder-width apart, or put your hands on your hips. You can also put your own spin on power poses and create your own—the important part is that they make you expand your body outward and foster a feeling of power:

![presence-powerpose.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/presence-powerpose.png)

(Shortform note: Since Cuddy’s 2012 TED talk on power posing, the phrase “power pose”—coined in her 2010 research article—has integrated into popular culture. It has an entry in the Cambridge Dictionary, and some people speculated that Cuddy’s TED talk inspired politicians in the UK to strike power poses at high-profile events. Power posing also continues to be frequently listed on advice websites as a way to boost your confidence.)

The simple act of making yourself bigger—or even louder—is an expression of power recognized throughout the world and among both animals and humans. By extending your limbs, lifting your head, and raising your voice, you can **bypass the negative thoughts fueling your anxiety and essentially trick your brain into feeling confident**.

(Shortform note: In _12 Rules for Life_ , Jordan Peterson explains that it’s beneficial for animals to jockey for higher positioning on a social hierarchy through displays of dominance because it helps distribute scarce resources while avoiding combative conflict. For example, if two animals both want to hunt for food in the same area, they can make themselves look big, size each other up, and decide who’s most likely to win a fight. If one of them then backs down, they can both avoid injury or death. Peterson says that humans still have the biologically ingrained tendency to monitor signals of dominance (such as physical stature) to figure out social positioning, which may explain why power poses trigger confidence.)

Cuddy’s research on this topic found that power posing for a few minutes not only led to perceived feelings of greater confidence and agency in the subjects but also physically changed their hormone levels in a beneficial way. First, it elevated testosterone levels—the so-called “dominance hormone” that is both caused by and causes more assertive behavior. Second, it reduced cortisol levels, a hormone produced as a bodily stress response. Together, high levels of testosterone and low levels of cortisol are associated with more powerful people—they tend to be associated with successful leaders, for example.

And what if you’re physically unable to power pose? Cuddy adds that even if you can’t find a comfortable place to power pose before your big presentation or if you’re physically unable to do it, you can still benefit from power posing _mentally_. Research has demonstrated that simply **visualizing yourself in a power pose can have the same effects as the physical exercise**. (Shortform note: Although most studies have focused on physical power posing, rather than visualization of power poses, some research suggests that visualization techniques enhance performance and self-confidence for athletes—results that may be applicable to the many high-pressure contexts that Cuddy describes.)

> **Controversy Over Power Posing Research**
> 
> Amid ongoing debates about the effects of power posing among researchers, **social psychologists continue to refine the studies on this phenomenon** to determine how high-power or low-power poses impact our behavior, mindset, and physiology. Here, we’ll describe how some of the controversy surrounding Cuddy’s work has unfolded.
> 
> Cuddy’s research on the effects of power posing initially received widespread acclaim—she was featured on major media outlets such as CNN, Oprah, and TED. However, over the next several years, some researchers criticized the results of her original 2010 power posing study, arguing that Cuddy and her colleagues may have selectively reported data and pointing out that subsequent studies by other researchers failed to replicate the results. In 2016, the main author on the initial study, Dana Carney, stated that she no longer supported the conclusion from the study due to her updated analysis of the evidence.
> 
> This evidence includes studies that found **no statistically significant _hormonal_ effect of power posing**. In a 2017 interview, Cuddy stated that she’s currently undecided on whether the hormonal effects are significant, since there are wide variations in the methodologies researchers use to assess and analyze these metrics. For example, some researchers use blood samples to measure hormone levels while others use saliva samples, which can lead to discrepancies in the analyses.
> 
> However, Cuddy maintains that **power posing at least increases _feelings_ of power in individuals**, which can increase their performance. A 2018 study by Cuddy reviewing 55 studies on power posing, and a 2022 study reviewing 88 studies on power posing both support the finding that high-power poses significantly enhance people’s mood, attitude, and self-esteem. The effects of power posing may also be greater when comparing a high-power posture to a low-power posture as opposed to comparing the power pose to a neutral posture.
> 
> In addition to the debate over her research, some of the criticism Cuddy received was targeted more at Cuddy as a person. For example, some critics railed against the amount of money she made from her book and speaking events. Some argue that this kind of backlash may have stemmed from people’s resentment toward successful, ambitious women and her popularity outside of the academic sphere.

#### _During_ the Challenging Scenario: Adopt Open and Friendly Body Language

Although the power pose technique helps put you in a positive mindset before a high-pressure scenario, adopting overtly powerful body language _while_ interacting with others is likely to be off-putting to them because it comes across as domineering. Therefore, in stressful situations, Cuddy recommends **adopting open and friendly body language that communicates your self-assuredness without making people feel uncomfortable or defensive**.

(Shortform note: Some elements of body language can also be interpreted differently depending on the context, making it important to “read the room,” so to speak. For example, standing with your hands on your hips could be interpreted as aggressive in one scenario, or it could be perceived as a sign that you’re enthusiastic and ready to go.)

Research shows that people perceive friendliness and trustworthiness before they assess your competence, so the right body language is more important for making a good first impression than showing how knowledgeable or talented you are.

To demonstrate open and friendly body language, stand up straight with your head up and shoulders back and relax your muscles. Cuddy also recommends making slow, deliberate movements when communicating. For example, if you’re on a stage, walk around slowly and use the whole space (which is also more dynamic and interesting for the audience to watch). Take your time and pause both your movements and speech when it feels right. Smiling when appropriate will make you feel better and also communicate kindness toward the other people present.

> **The Importance of Nailing a First Impression**
> 
> Similar to Cuddy, many authors emphasize the importance of a positive first impression. For example, in _How to Talk to Anyone_ , communication expert Leil Lowndes asserts that people rely on body language to instinctively form an opinion on someone before they even begin speaking. In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , public speaker Peter D. Andrei adds that people’s initial impression of you will influence their _long-term_ perception of you because of a bias known as the halo effect: the tendency of people to generalize their opinion of someone based on one observed quality.
> 
> To optimize a first impression, Lowndes and body language experts Allan and Barbara Pease (_The Definitive Book of Body Language_) recommend additional open body language cues such as raising your eyebrows slightly to show that you’re happy to engage in conversation, keeping your arms loosely at your sides with your wrists and palms upward, and turning your body completely toward your listener.

##### Body Language to Avoid

In addition to these tips, Cuddy provides some body language to _avoid_ , including excessive eye contact, very strong handshakes, and exaggerated, rapid, or loud movements. If you’re seated, remember not to splay your limbs all over the place like you would if you were power-posing before the event. Research shows that these behaviors tend to make people resent you because they’ll think you’re either trying to exert control over them or are being manipulative to get the results you want.

(Shortform note: It’s also important to note that while this advice is based on American culture, people’s preferences for body language vary widely by culture, so it may be necessary to account for other factors when modeling appropriate body language. For example, one source asserts that people from Asian cultures prefer more personal space than Americans, while people from Latin and Middle Eastern cultures require less personal space. Body language cues such as eye contact and handshakes may also vary depending on the relationship or gender of the people involved and can differ based on an individual’s personality.)

Cuddy writes that people tend to notice when your apparent stress and nervousness don’t match your body language—a phenomenon called “asynchrony”—which also makes you seem insincere and untrustworthy.

(Shortform note: Here, Cuddy suggests that if you use overly confident or aggressive body language to compensate for your nervousness, people will pick up on the fact that it’s not genuine or perceive it as “pseudo-confidence”. However, she doesn’t explain why people wouldn’t register asynchrony when you’re feeling nervous and you use some of the relaxed and open body language cues that we described earlier in the section. This may be why it’s important to boost your confidence with power poses _before_ the activity so that relaxed posture comes more naturally.)

On the other end of the spectrum, tense and closed-off body language (what Cuddy refers to as “powerless posture”) to avoid includes folding your arms and legs inward, tightening your throat muscles (which raises the pitch of your voice), speaking too fast, and keeping your upper arms glued to your sides while only your lower arms move (Cuddy calls this “penguin arms”). These behaviors betray nervousness, which may make people skeptical of what you’re communicating. In other words, if you don’t have confidence in what you’re saying, neither will other people.

(Shortform note: In a sales context, some experts recommend using _other people’s_ closed-off body language as a signal that a prospective buyer is feeling skeptical or unreceptive to what you’re saying. In _The Psychology of Selling_ , Brian Tracy writes that if a prospective customer is crossing their arms, for example, they may be feeling closed-minded. He also says that you can subtly nudge their mood by giving them something to hold or giving them an activity that will force them to uncross their arms.)

#### Increase Presence in the Long Term Through Small Changes

Cuddy says that in addition to modifying your body language before and during difficult situations, you can **enhance your natural feelings of presence in those moments by making powerful postures habitual in your daily life** —and conversely, reducing the time you spend in postures that reinforce anxiety and negative self-views. Being intentional about small adjustments to your posture can build over time into drastic improvements in your confidence and ability to express yourself.

(Shortform note: Many experts apply this same philosophy of accumulating small wins to work toward bigger change over the long term in other contexts. For example, in _Essentialism _Greg McKeown describes this as a strategy that enables companies to celebrate progress, motivate employees, and create momentum when working toward a major goal. In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed refers to this method as a way to tackle large societal problems such as a poor economy.)

##### Check and Adjust Your Posture

One way to improve your presence long-term is to **create reminders for yourself to check your posture** and ensure that you’re not slouching or making yourself small. Reminders can be visual notes, alerts on your phone, or prompts from friends to adopt a relaxed and open posture, as we described earlier in the section. Cuddy says that the more time you spend intentionally exhibiting this kind of body language, the calmer and more confident you’ll feel on a daily basis.

(Shortform note: Although reminders may be a good start to increase your awareness of your posture, there are also other strategies you might consider for targeting the root causes of hunched posture. For example, a physical therapist could help you determine if your poor posture is a result of injury, a genetically inherited condition, or even the shoes you wear, which can shift your body out of its natural alignment.)

A major challenge of maintaining open body language is that when you spend much of your time looking at small screens—such as a smartphone or laptop— this naturally causes you to hunch your shoulders and tilt your head downward (a position Cuddy refers to as “iPosture”). One clinician observes that more people are developing dowager’s humps (a permanent curve in the upper back from slouching), and Cuddy’s research suggests that caved-in posture from looking at devices makes people less assertive and less proactive compared to when they have more open, confident posture.

(Shortform note: Research supports the idea that looking at mobile devices can contribute to poor posture and upper body strain. However, since musculoskeletal problems can arise from a wide range of conditions, it may be important to consider other factors that may be contributing to poor posture and subsequent changes in disposition. For example, these can include heavy lifting, doing any kind of repetitive motion, staying in the same position for long periods, overuse of certain muscles, or genetics that cause a higher risk for conditions such as arthritis.)

Cuddy’s tip for counteracting the closed-off body language that some devices encourage is to **arrange your commonly used spaces to facilitate looking up and stretching out**. For example, you might mount your TV high on the wall or use high shelves that you have to reach up to access.

(Shortform note: If you work on a computer for several hours at a time for your job, caved-in posture can cause chronic neck, back, and wrist pain in addition to negatively impacting your confidence. Some health experts recommend avoiding these physical stressors by making ergonomic adjustments to your office setup that are similar to Cuddy’s advice for rearranging your spaces. For instance, make sure that your chair supports your spine, position your armrests, keyboard, and computer mouse so that your shoulders are always relaxed, and keep your monitor or laptop at eye level between 20-40 inches away from you. Another habit that can help with these problems is getting up to move around at regular intervals. )

##### Practice Yoga and Controlled Breathing

Cuddy’s next advice for incrementally improving your presence is to practice yoga or another physical activity that involves stretching and controlled breathing. Research shows that this habit is particularly beneficial for people suffering from post-traumatic stress (PTS), who may experience debilitating anxiety, fear, self-doubt, and other feelings of powerlessness on a regular basis. Cuddy says that yoga enhances your presence—in addition to providing a myriad of other health benefits—because **it activates the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)**.

The PNS is essentially the opposite of the fight-or-flight response that arises when you feel threatened. When the PNS is activated, your heart rate slows and your mind and body enter a state of relaxation. According to many studies, doing yoga trains your body to resist automatic stress responses and can lead to long-lasting improvements in your self-esteem and mental well-being. And if you’re not interested in yoga specifically, taking slow, deep breaths, chanting, and meditating all have similar benefits.

(Shortform note: Activating the PNS through yoga and other relaxing activities is not only helpful for increasing your presence but also vital to your physical health. Activation of the PNS is the body’s way of entering a state where it can focus on digestion, healing, and physical rejuvenation. Some experts assert that hectic lifestyles—like being busy all the time—reduce the activity of the PNS and increase our stress response controlled by the _sympathetic nervous system_ (SNS). When the SNS is overactive, this imbalance can result in insomnia, digestive problems, and chronic inflammation. This stress response may also explain why people with PTSD have a higher risk of physical health problems in addition to mental health symptoms.)
