## 1-Page Summary

You wake up, gulp down your coffee while speed-reading the news, and half-listen to a podcast during your rushed morning commute. You spend your workday juggling tasks before finally returning home and sinking into the couch, your brain fried and your heart pounding.

If any aspects of this scene describe your typical day, you know what it’s like to rush through life. In _The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry, _pastor and author John Mark Comer explores our cultural obsession with rushing and examines how it harms our relationships, health, and spirituality. He argues that **you can escape this culture of rushing by following the lifestyle of Jesus.**

John Mark Comer is the author of six books on Christianity and the co-host of several podcasts about spirituality. He’s also the founding pastor at Portland’s Bridgetown Church, which helps its congregants model their lifestyles after Jesus’s. Comer says that prior to publishing _The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry_ in 2019, he was a burned-out and overbooked pastor of a megachurch, struggling to juggle his responsibilities as a pastor, father, and husband. In this book, he shares the practices, mindsets, and biblical wisdom that helped him slow down, strengthen his relationships, recover his health, and reconnect with God and Jesus. While _Hurry_ is written primarily for Christian readers, Comer’s insights on slowing down your life may be relevant to non-Christian readers as well.

We’ll begin this guide by exploring Comer’s insights on what it means to rush through life, why we rush, and how doing so harms us and others. Then we’ll share four ways to live a slower, more fulfilling life by following Jesus’s lifestyle. Along the way, we’ll compare Comer’s ideas to those of other scholars and offer additional steps you can take to stop hurrying.

### The Issue: We Rush Through Life

#### What It Means to Rush Through Life

According to Comer, **busyness can be either negative or positive.** He draws a distinction between what we’ll call a _lively_ lifestyle (positive busyness) and a _rushed_ lifestyle (negative busyness):

  * **When your life is _lively_ , it brims with _meaningful experiences_**. Comer presents four criteria that characterize meaningful experiences: They 1) nurture your spirituality, 2) deepen your relationships, 3) support your health, and 4) cultivate your sense of purpose.
  * **When your life is _rushed_ , it’s packed with _meaningless experiences_** —time-consuming tasks that distract you from meaningful experiences. 



(Shortform note: Busyness may have additional benefits beyond those Comer explores: Specifically, busyness may improve cognition and increase self-control. One study found that busy people tend to score higher on cognitive tasks, such as tasks related to memory, compared to people who are less busy. Another study found that reminding people about their busy lifestyle increases the likelihood that they’ll make decisions that benefit them in the long run, such as decisions related to exercise and saving for retirement. This suggests that busy people tend to delay gratification in favor of making healthy choices.)

##### Shortform Example: A Rushed Day vs. a Lively Day

To further illustrate the difference between a rushed lifestyle and a lively one, let’s compare a rushed weekday with a lively weekday.

If you’re rushing, you may begin your day by playing a fast-paced game on your phone before breakfast. At work, you spend your half-hour lunch break eating while catching up on emails. After returning home from work, you quickly heat up dinner for your family and eat together while watching TV. Then, right before bed, you respond to more emails.

By contrast, if your day is lively, you may start your day **nurturing your spirituality** by praying before breakfast. Then, at work, you **support your health** by taking a break from work during your half-hour lunch. After returning home, you cook dinner with your family and further **deepen your relationships** by talking with them throughout dinner. Finally, before bed, you **cultivate your sense of purpose** by spending time songwriting.

> **Additional Advice on Identifying Meaningful Experiences**
> 
> Comer doesn’t explore in depth how to tell whether an experience meets the four criteria of meaningful experiences, which may make it hard to evaluate to what extent your life is lively versus rushed. Let’s explore other experts’ perspectives on these criteria.
> 
> **What it looks like to nurture your spirituality:** Nurturing spirituality may look different for different people. Some Christian thinkers say the best way to nurture your spirituality is to regularly attend church, explaining that gathering weekly with other worshippers inspires you and holds you accountable for making time for God. However, others say Church attendance isn’t required for nurturing Christian spirituality. For instance, in _How to Be a Christian Without Going to Church, _pastor Kelly Bean insists that you can nurture your spirituality in other ways, such as gathering regularly with fellow worshippers online or offline to discuss God’s word and organize service projects. However, these two perspectives share the belief that nurturing your spirituality means regularly spending time with God.
> 
> **What deep relationships look like:** Simply spending time with loved ones may not be enough to maintain deep relationships. Psychiatrist Amir Levine and psychologist Rachel Heller argue in _Attached_ that different people have different “attachment styles,” or ways of meeting their relationship needs. For instance, _avoidant attachers_ may appreciate long periods of alone time, whereas _anxious attachers_ may wish to spend quality time with you every day. If you’re aware of your loved ones' attachment styles and tailor your interactions with them accordingly, your relationships are likely to be deep and meaningful.
> 
> **What it looks like to support your health:** Many medical experts believe that your physical and mental health are closely linked, so supporting your overall health requires attending to _both_ your physical and mental well-being. You can support your mental and physical health through habits such as eating a healthy diet, exercising, getting enough sleep, and avoiding unhealthy behaviors like smoking.
> 
> **How to tell if experiences cultivate your sense of purpose:** In _Wanting, _Luke Burgis says that an experience is likely to be meaningful, and therefore to contribute to your sense of purpose, if you answer “yes” to these three questions about it:
> 
>   * **Will it improve others’ lives?** For example, you may derive a sense of purpose from becoming an art therapist who helps people heal through creativity.
> 
>   * **Will it provide long-term satisfaction?** For instance, a degree in philosophy may equip you with lenses to approach the rest of your life with curiosity.
> 
>   * **When you’re on your deathbed, will you be glad you pursued that experience?** People close to death often regret having chased meaningless experiences over meaningful ones that would have contributed to their sense of purpose.
> 
> 


#### Why We Rush

Why do we live rushed lifestyles? Comer says that **our culture values speed, and this value compels us to rush.** Our culture surrounds us with messages that it’s better to be fast than slow. We internalize these messages and arrange our lives to match the speed of the world around us.

For instance, consider the popularity of apps designed to help you maximize your efficiency and productivity at work. These apps send the message that productivity and efficiency are better than working at a relaxed pace. When you download and use them, you reinforce this value and speed up the pace of your life.

> **How Widespread Is the Tendency to Rush?**
> 
> Comer says that _everyone_ is surrounded by messages that speed is better, internalizes these messages, and designs their lives to prioritize speed. However, Comer doesn’t explore counterexamples that suggest the pace of life and its associated values _aren’t_ universal.
> 
> Although a fast-paced lifestyle may be prevalent in some places, some people have historically valued a slow pace of life and continue to do so. For instance, barakah culture is an Islamic lifestyle that values slowing down and simplifying your life, allowing you to focus on worshiping Allah and connecting with those around you.
> 
> Furthermore, some people are resisting the obsession with rushing that Comer discusses. In his book _In Praise of Slowness_ , Carl Honoré calls this worldwide effort to slow down life the “Slow Movement” and explores examples throughout the world. For instance:
> 
>   * The Society for the Deceleration of Time, whose members hail from across Europe, publishes essays on the merits of being slow, engages in performative art that celebrates slowness, and holds conferences to discuss ways to slow down life.
> 
>   * In the late 1980s, Italian culinary writer Carlo Petrini founded the International Slow Food Movement, a group that encourages the leisurely eating of slow-grown foods. Today, the movement has more than 78,000 members.
> 
> 


Comer identifies a belief that contributes to maintaining the pervasive culture of speed: **the delusion that we can do everything we want.** Comer calls this a delusion because, in reality, we don’t have enough time to do it all. For instance, you may believe you can be an effective worker, a loving family member, a talented athlete, a hilarious TikToker, and a supportive friend—but in trying, you’ll sacrifice your sleep and health, making it impossible to meet all these goals.

> **Our Delusions About Time**
> 
> Another delusion may contribute to perpetuating this culture of speed: the delusion that we can fully control _how_ we use our time. In _Four Thousand Weeks, _Oliver Burkeman explores why we have this delusion and why it’s false.
> 
> Burkeman says that the Industrial Revolution’s focus on maximizing productivity has led us to believe that time is a resource we must use well by being ultra-productive. He adds that time-saving technologies (like dishwashers) make us _think_ we can save time in other areas of our lives, such as our commute to work.
> 
> But Burkeman says that we have less control over how we use our time than we think. First, our automatic habits get in the way: For instance, we tend to work on minor tasks to distract ourselves from important tasks. Second, it’s hard to prevent _other_ people from dictating how we use our time. Any time we’re efficient in our work, people expect us to be even more efficient in the future. This reduces our autonomy over our time.

#### The Four Perils of Rushing

Comer argues that**** over time, rushing has the opposite effect of meaningful experiences: **Rushing _degrades_ your relationships, spirituality, health, and sense of purpose.** Let’s explore each of these perils.

##### Peril 1: Weak Relationships

According to Comer, **it’s impossible to maintain strong, loving relationships when you live a rushed lifestyle.** Here, we’ll highlight two ways that rushing harms your relationships.

First,**rushing makes you stressed, and this stress makes you less patient and gentle around your loved ones.** Over time, this behavior strains your relationships. For example, imagine your partner tries to strike up a conversation while you’re rushing to leave for work and you snap at them for interrupting you. To avoid being snapped at again, they strike up fewer conversations with you. As a result, over time, the two of you talk less and thus grow distant.

(Shortform note: Some psychological research supports Comer’s claim that stress harms your relationships and provides additional reasons for this effect. First, a stressful, rushed lifestyle leaves you less time for leisure activities, which are important times to bond with loved ones. Additionally, stress makes you anxious and hypervigilant, leading you to see problems in your relationship that aren’t actually there. For instance, after noticing your partner likes to spend their evenings engrossed in playing video games, you might jump to the false conclusion that they don’t want to spend time with you.)

Second,**** when you’re rushing, you’re preoccupied with being efficient and productive, which leaves you **less emotionally available to others.** For example, during dinner, you may be so busy making a mental to-do list for tomorrow that you fail to notice that one of your family members is uncharacteristically quiet. Therefore, you miss the opportunity to ask them if they’re OK and offer emotional support.

(Shortform note: A rushed lifestyle might cause another problem that can weaken your relationships: a lack of emotional vulnerability, or the ability to share your feelings with others. When you’re rushing, you’re less likely to take time to open up about your feelings to others. This leaves your loved ones guessing about how you’re feeling and how they can best support your needs and desires, which in turn could breed tension and dissatisfaction. Additionally, your lack of vulnerability could weaken your bond with others—they may feel less close to you when they’re unaware of how you’re feeling.)

##### Peril 2: Disconnection From God

According to Comer, **rushing also harms another relationship: your connection with God.** Meaningless activities snatch your attention away from spiritual practice. Your prayers start getting shorter, you begin skipping church, and your nightstand Bible starts to collect dust.

(Shortform note: Feeling disconnected from God due to a rushed lifestyle may lead to an additional negative consequence: less resilience. Some studies reveal that spiritual people often benefit from _spiritual coping—that is, their connection to God helps them deal with adversity_. These people report that God’s presence in their lives provides them with the strength to endure challenges, including physical illness.)

##### Peril 3: Poor Health

Comer says that in addition to weakening your relationships, **rushing degrades your mental and physical health.**

**Mental health:** As previously noted, a rushed lifestyle is stressful. If unaddressed, this stress can harm your long-term mental health. For example, imagine your child is having a tough time in school. You love them deeply, but you feel too busy to provide them with the close support they need. Every time you think about your child, feelings of worry and guilt arise. You believe that you’ve failed as a parent, which lowers your self-esteem. If you fail to manage your worries and recover your self-esteem, you may start experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression.

**Physical health:** According to Comer, a rushed lifestyle also harms your physical health. When you’re rushing, you make less time for quality sleep, exercise, and healthy eating. Failing to meet these basic needs also increases your chances of getting sick.

(Shortform note: Mental health and physical health are closely linked. Research shows that chronic psychological stress, such as that caused by rushing, can also be bad for your heart. While Comer’s solutions are largely spiritual, health experts tend to recommend other stress management strategies, such as exercise, rest, and “scheduling the worry”: assigning stressful tasks to predetermined periods in the day.)

##### Peril 4: A Lack of Purpose

Finally, Comer says that **when you’re rushing, you lose your sense of purpose in life.** Meaningful experiences give your life purpose, but you can’t fully engage in such experiences if you’re preoccupied with meaningless tasks. For example, perhaps it’s one of your long-term goals to publish a science fiction trilogy. However, your rushed lifestyle leaves you exhausted in the evening and on weekends, so you engage in meaningless distractions instead of writing.

(Shortform note: Even if you don’t live a rushed lifestyle, finding your purpose can be challenging. In _Ikigai_ , Héctor García and Francesc Miralles provide guidance on finding your life purpose by exploring the Japanese concept of ikigai. According to ikigai, your life purpose falls at the intersection of what you love, what the world needs, what you’re good at, and what you can be paid for.)

### The Remedy: Follow Jesus’s Lifestyle

Now that we’ve explored the perils of rushing and why we rush, let’s turn to Comer’s solution. He argues that **you can prioritize meaningful experiences and commit to a life free of rushing by following the lifestyle of Jesus.** According to the Bible’s four gospels—which amount to Jesus’s biography—Jesus had a lively lifestyle, not a rushed one.

(Shortform note: Scholars debate whether the gospels are an accurate biography of Jesus. For instance, in _Zealot_ , Reza Aslan __ argues the gospels may not be trustworthy because they were written years after most of the events they detail. Aslan says that according to other historical records and accounts of Jesus’s life, Jesus was likely more of a radical revolutionary than the gospels depict him to be. By contrast, in _The Case for Christ_ , Lee Strobel __ shares Comer’s view that the gospels are biographies of Jesus. Citing research by Craig Blomberg, Strobel says that three of the four gospels _do_ count as trustworthy eyewitness accounts because they were written toward the end of Jesus’s life, as well as suggesting that the gospels may have been written earlier than the scholarly consensus says.)

We’ll begin this section by looking closely at a particular passage of the Bible, one in which Jesus calls upon his believers to follow his lifestyle. Then we’ll present Comer’s insights on how to model your lifestyle after Jesus’s.

#### Jesus’s Call to Follow His Lifestyle

Comer emphasizes a particular passage from the Bible, Matthew 11:28-30, that sheds light on Jesus’s hope that his followers adopt his lifestyle: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

Let’s explore Comer’s interpretation of two specific lines from this passage.

**Matthew 11:28: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”** Comer says that here, Jesus acknowledges that life’s burdens wear people out spiritually, mentally, and physically. He invites them to experience rest from these burdens.

(Shortform note: Theologian Albert Barnes offers two alternative interpretations for Matthew 11:28. First, Jesus may have been saying these lines to Jewish people who were burdened by strict religious traditions. According to this interpretation, Jesus is specifically inviting them to free themselves from the burden of following these strict traditions. Second, Jesus may have also been speaking specifically to sinners who were burdened by the guilt of their sins. According to this interpretation, his promise to give them rest is a promise for forgiveness and salvation.)

**Matthew 11:30: “For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”** A yoke is a beam that rests across the shoulders of a pair of oxen, enabling them to pull weight. Comer argues that Jesus is saying that he’s figured out a method—symbolized by the yoke—to make life more bearable. You can achieve this same result by mimicking his method.

(Shortform note: Another writer offers a slightly different interpretation of this line: that Jesus is contrasting the heavy yoke of strict religious traditions, as described above, with his easier way of practicing religion. This writer explains that the Pharisees and Sadducees (members of Jewish sects) enforced over 600 religious laws—laws that Jesus felt were too burdensome. In Matthew 22:40, Jesus instead offers only _two_ laws to follow: 1) Love God, and 2) love people.)

According to these passages, Jesus urged his followers to mimic his lifestyle—but what _was_ his lifestyle, specifically? In the remainder of this guide, we’ll highlight three habits that allowed Jesus to live a meaningful lifestyle free of rushing, and we’ll explore how you can mimic his lifestyle even in modern times.

#### Habit 1: Slow Your Daily Tempo

First, according to Comer, **you can mimic Jesus’s lifestyle by slowing the tempo of your daily life.** We’ll begin this section by describing the pace of Jesus’s lifestyle; then, we’ll explore why and how you might model the pace of your life after his.

##### Jesus’s Daily Tempo

The idea that Jesus’s life was slow-paced and free of rushing may surprise you. Comer says that most people think of Jesus as someone who rushed from town to town, healing the sick and preaching to as many people as he could. However, Comer explains that this portrayal is inaccurate:**Jesus never _rushed_ in his endeavors. **For instance, he took his time visiting and healing the sick.

(Shortform note: Why do we have this idea that Jesus’s lifestyle was rushed? One writer says that the way the Bible is written may give this impression. Verses like Mark 1:21-45 are packed with summaries of everything Jesus was up to, from healing the sick to speaking to crowds, and these verses often use words like “immediately” that convey a sense of rushing.)

##### Why You Should Slow Your Daily Tempo

How will it benefit you to follow Jesus’s example and slow the tempo of your daily life? Comer explains that **slowing the pace of your daily life increases your _patience_**. If you eliminate the pressure of speed, you’ll no longer feel impatient when events in everyday life take a while. Comer insists that increased patience will improve your health, relationships, and spirituality. Let’s further explore each of these benefits.

**First, patience helps you feel more relaxed.** When you move at a slower pace, you’re less stressed, and this is good for your mental health.

(Shortform note: Exercise may be a way to accomplish this same goal. In addition to boosting your physical health, exercise can relax you and support your mental health. Physical movement stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals that make you feel relaxed and optimistic—two emotions that also boost your mental well-being.)

Second, **when you’re more patient, you treat others better. This improves your relationships.** For instance, you won’t snap at your server if they take a while to bring out your food at a restaurant, and you won’t get angry at your child when they take a while to complete their chores.

(Shortform note: Learning to be more patient may be particularly important if you’re a caregiver for one or more seniors. Older people sometimes resist caregiving because it involves accepting that they’re less independent than they used to be, and managing this resistance requires patience. In addition to following Comer’s advice, you can have patience when caring for seniors by 1) offering help rather than making demands, and 2) taking care of _yourself_ so you can remain calm and gentle (which keeps your relationship positive) if the senior you’re helping resists some of your efforts.)

**Third, patience provides you with opportunities for spiritual contemplation.** While you’re waiting patiently—such as standing in a long line at the post office—you’ll have the opportunity to pray to God. This will improve your relationship with him.

(Shortform note: In addition to increasing the _quantity_ of your spiritual contemplation by following Comer’s advice, you may be able to improve the _quality_ by being patient with yourself _._ In _The Book of Joy_ , the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu describe the ability to pray as a muscle that you need to build. Deep prayer and meditation don’t come naturally to most—these types of contemplation take time, effort, and patience.)

> **Patience May Also Boost Happiness and Productivity**
> 
> In _Four Thousand Weeks, _Burkeman shares Comer’s assertion that it’s worthwhile and possible to gradually increase your patience for slow-paced moments in life, and he adds that increasing your patience in everyday life specifically improves your happiness and your productivity.
> 
> First, Burkeman explains that when you no longer expect yourself to be speedy—in other words, when you treat yourself with patience—you free yourself from others’ expectations of you. This freedom boosts your happiness.
> 
> Second, he explains that people who are patient avoid rushing through tasks, and in doing so, they avoid burnout. Burnout halts productivity; by avoiding it, you can stay productive.

##### How to Live a Slow-Paced, Patient Lifestyle

How can you experience the benefits of a slow-paced, patient lifestyle? **Comer recommends _gamifying_ patience: making a joyful game out of slowing down.** He says that gamification will motivate you to slow down your life.

(Shortform note: Some research supports Comer’s claim that gamification boosts motivation; for instance, one study found that gamification in classrooms improves motivation and learning.)

For example, Comer suggests that you make a game of reducing your phone use.__ Phone addictions make you rush because phones pack your day with meaningless activities (such as fast-paced games and checking social media alerts). Therefore,**reducing your phone use through gamification can slow you down and make your life more meaningful.** Comer says you can do so by creating phone-related rules and challenging yourself to follow those rules.

(Shortform note: While Comer discusses how reducing your phone use can slow down your life, he doesn’t explore in depth the connection between phone use and patience _._ Some research suggests that frequent smartphone use is linked to impatience and impulsive behavior. However, this research looks at correlation rather than causation—in other words, it doesn’t explore whether impatience and impulsivity cause frequent smartphone use or whether smartphone overuse causes impatience and impulsivity.)

Comer suggests that **you make a game of only engaging with technology during specific, scheduled times.** Consider scheduling one time of day when you can check social media and another time when you can check your email. That way, you won’t waste too much time on either action. Comer says you can make this a game by setting ambitious rules and challenging yourself to stick to them—for example, setting the rule that you can only check social media from 5 to 6 p.m.

(Shortform note: Comer’s advice on limiting your technology use may be easier to follow with the help of apps that personalize the process of restricting your phone use. For instance, the app Offtime creates different modes on your phone, such as a “work mode” and a “family mode.” Each mode allows access to only _some_ phone functions at certain times, which may make it easier to use your phone time wisely—for instance, not checking social media when it’s your email-checking time.)

#### Habit 2: Honor the Sabbath

In addition to slowing the overall pace of your everyday life, Comer says you should **slow down for a _full day_ every week—the Sabbath. **This day provides an opportunity to take a break from your usual, rushed routine (such as work and chores) so you can engage in slow-paced, meaningful, and spiritual experiences.

(Shortform note: Across several cultures and religions, people devote at least one day of the week to intentionally slowing down and engaging in meaningful, spiritual activities. For example, many Jewish people observe Shabbat, a stretch of time (usually from Friday to Saturday evening) spent enjoying a special meal and engaging in prayer and blessings. Some who observe Shabbat also refrain from work and chores, such as shopping, on these days.)

We’ll begin this section by exploring why Jesus honored the Sabbath, as you may be inspired by his example. Then, we’ll discuss how _you_ can best honor the Sabbath.

##### How Jesus Honored the Sabbath

The Gospels reveal that Jesus regularly honored the Sabbath.**** According to Comer, Jesus did so for multiple reasons. First,**he did so to obey God’s commandment.** One of God’s Ten Commandments is “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy” (Exodus 20:8). By “keeping it holy,” God meant taking a break from your typical routine to spend the day worshiping him.

(Shortform note: In _The Purpose Driven Life, _pastor Rick Warren says that _obeying God goes hand-in-hand with trusting God_ : It’s easier to obey God’s commandments if you trust that he knows what’s best for you and has a plan for you. In this case, trusting that God believes it’s good for you to break from your typical routine will help you honor the Sabbath day.)

Second, **Jesus honored the Sabbath to experience enjoyment.** When the Pharisees critiqued Jesus and his followers for how they spent their Sabbath, Jesus replied, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). Comer interprets this line to mean that God created the Sabbath as a gift for us to enjoy.

(Shortform note: Comer doesn’t explore the full context for this line—why did the Pharisees critique the way Jesus and his followers spent their Sabbath? According to one Christian author, the Pharisees were known for enforcing strict rules for how to spend the Sabbath. They objected to how Jesus and his followers spent one particular Sabbath: walking through fields and gathering grain to enjoy eating. Prior to saying “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath,” Jesus reminded the Pharisees of the time when David ate and shared bread that only high priests were permitted to eat. Then Jesus told the Pharisees that David’s choice wasn’t unlawful because he was taking care of himself and others. Thus, Jesus implied that he resisted worship focused on _rules_ , instead preferring worship focused on enjoyment and self-care.

Third, **Jesus honored the Sabbath to continue a tradition of resisting oppression.** The Old Testament explains this connection between honoring the Sabbath and fighting oppression: Moses delivers the Ten Commandments to an audience of slaves who escaped Egypt, and the commandment about the Sabbath reads: “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day” (Deuteronomy 5:15). According to Comer’s interpretation of this passage, this commandment frames rest as a form of resistance against oppression.

> **Resting as a Form of Resistance Against Racial Oppression**
> 
> In _Rest Is Resistance, _poet and activist Tricia Hersey echoes this idea that resting is a strategy for resisting oppression, and she explores how this message is particularly relevant to people of color.
> 
> First, Hersey explains that people of color are especially in need of rest. She explains that white supremacy and capitalism exploit people of color as a means to increase production, both historically (such as through chattel slavery) and today—for example, consider how people of color are overrepresented in low-wage jobs. This exploitation leaves people of color exhausted spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally.
> 
> Hersey frames rest as a way to resist this exploitation. She explains that while she was in seminary school, she learned that her body is a “deep reflection of God” and that she must treat her body well by resting properly. She says that people of color can treat their bodies well and resist the systems that exploit them by demanding rest. This might mean, for example, carving out time for regular naps or saying “no” when asked to take on too many responsibilities.

##### How to Honor the Sabbath

How can you honor the Sabbath, as Jesus did? Comer says you should make it the most enjoyable day of the week, one you consistently look forward to. **By making the Sabbath enjoyable, you’ll _want_ to observe it, and it’ll feel easier to observe. **For example, spend your Sabbath praying to God, tending your garden, listening to your favorite Christian rock album, or enjoying a slow-paced meal with members of your parish.

> **How Easy and Fun Should It Be to Follow Jesus?**
> 
> Comer offers strategies that make it easier and more fun to follow Jesus’s habits, such as using gamification to slow your daily tempo and ensuring the Sabbath is an enjoyable day.
> 
> Comer’s emphasis on fun and ease contrasts with the approach of some other Christian pastors. For instance, in _The Cost of Discipleship, _pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer says that Christians should follow Jesus by voluntarily adopting _difficult_ lifestyles. He explains that Christ’s life was characterized by suffering, and therefore the best way to follow him is to mimic his suffering. For instance, Bonhoeffer recommends that Christians voluntarily fast and commit to a life of poverty.
> 
> While this suffering is meant to be difficult, Bonhoeffer says that it improves your life. First, suffering makes you more virtuous. By denying yourself pleasures (such as food), you’ll improve your capacity for resisting the temptation to sin. Second, suffering makes you less worried. By living a life of poverty, for instance, you’ll free yourself from the fear of loss. If you lack material possessions, you don’t have to worry that a disaster (such as war or a house fire) could destroy what you hold dear.
> 
> Despite these differences, Comer’s and Bonhoeffer’s approaches also overlap. For instance, both pastors emphasize the importance of developing a personal relationship with God through prayer.

#### Habit 3: Protect Your Lively Lifestyle

So far, we’ve discussed how to live a less rushed, more meaningful lifestyle by following Jesus’s daily tempo and honoring the Sabbath as he did. But how can you _maintain_ these habits as new obligations and opportunities threaten to make your days more rushed or encroach on your spiritual practice?

Comer insists that you must **protect your lively lifestyle by** **regularly turning down opportunities** that you don’t have the time or the capacity for. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that really matter—your health, relationships, connection to God, and life purpose.

For inspiration on turning down opportunities, look to Jesus. According to Comer, **Jesus set boundaries to prevent additional obligations from making his lifestyle rushed.** For instance, he refused several invitations to preach when those opportunities conflicted with his scheduled prayer time.

(Shortform note: By refusing invitations to preach so he could pray, Jesus opted to commit to one spiritual activity _fully_ , instead of packing his schedule with multiple spiritual activities. This example of boundary-setting may be particularly useful for Christians and church leaders who tend to overcommit to spiritual endeavors. In _An Unhurried Life_ , pastor Alan Fadling explains that Christians today tend to see their ability to pack their schedules with worship-related activities as a testament to their faithfulness. Fadling advises Christians to remember that God _appreciates_ the devotion behind their many worship-related activities, but _prefers_ it when they’re engaged in a slower, more intentional connection with him—as Jesus did.)

> **Tips for Turning Down Opportunities**
> 
> It can be challenging to turn down opportunities, especially ones that sound fun and meaningful. In _Essentialism, _Greg McKeown offers several tips for saying “no” to new opportunities:
> 
> **Consider opportunity costs.** It’s easier to say “no” when you identify what you’d miss out on by saying “yes.” For instance, say your friend invites you to take a surfing class with them—but each session would require a two-hour commute to and from the beach. Think about what you could do instead of driving, like attending church or playing with your kids.
> 
> **Separate people from their requests.** When someone asks you to do something for or with them, you may worry that saying “no” will make them feel rejected. Remember that the person making the request is more than their request—you can say “no” _and_ maintain your close connection to them. For instance, tell your friend, “I can’t commit to the class because the commute is too long, but let’s still plan to get together weekly somewhere closer to home.”
