## Exercise: Explore Linguistic Prejudice

Examine how language can be used to stigmatize or marginalize those who are different.

* * *

Provide an example of a rule of something you were taught was “improper” English. Based on what you’ve read about how rules of English were often created, do you think this rule is based on clear reasoning? Explain why or why not.

Have you ever been stigmatized or marginalized because of the way you speak or write? If so, please describe what happened.

How do you think marginalized groups can protect their languages and dialects from those who demand that they assimilate themselves into the broader culture?
