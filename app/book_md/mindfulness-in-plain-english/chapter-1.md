## Chapter 1: Meditation: Why Bother?

**Many of us find life continuously unsatisfying.** We can distract the nagging feeling for a time, but it inevitably comes back. We must have more. Things must be better. We get stuck in “if only” wishful thinking mode - “if only I had X, all my problems will be solved.”

There is no satisfying this impulse. You will never have enough. You equilibrate so quickly to your environment that nothing is ever satisfying enough. The only winning move is not to play.

Popular media invokes the emotions of jealousy, suffering, stress, and anger. People who are at peace with themselves do not feel these feelings.

The culprit of dissatisfaction lies in categorization of experiences as good, bad, and neutral.

  * For good experiences, we hope to freeze time at that moment and keep it from escaping. When that fails, we keep chasing this high. But even in these moments, we feel the tension that no matter what, this moment will end.
  * For bad experiences, we reject those experiences. We run from pieces of ourselves instead of confronting and acknowledging them.
  * For neutral experiences (which comprise the majority of life), we see it as drudgery and ignore it.



When we endlessly chase pleasure, flee from pain, and ignore most of our experience, **is it any wonder life tastes flat**?

### Satisfaction through Mindfulness

Is there another way to live? **You can control your mind to step outside the endless cycle of desire and aversion. You can learn not to stop wanting what you currently crave, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.**

Consider another frame of mind - we crave things, not for the goals themselves, but as a means to an end. We eat food so that we satiate hunger and satisfy the drive. We earn money so that we can relieve our problems and end tension.

To begin, you must see yourself as who you are without illusion or judgment. Then you see your place in society among other humans, and see the collection as a single unit.

**Meditation is the path to this level of understanding and mental peace**. It purifies the mind of “psychic irritants,” bringing you to a new state of tranquility and awareness. It makes you deeply aware of your own thoughts and actions.

  * It’s like cultivating new land. Clear the trees, pull out the stumps. Then till the soil, fertilize, and sow your seed.



Through meditation, you learn compassion and ethics from within, not without.

  * Many people obey the law because they fear the penalties. See what happens in the stress of war and economic collapse - people will revert to savagery.
  * With meditation, you discover your true values, which are stable and resist influence by the outside world.
