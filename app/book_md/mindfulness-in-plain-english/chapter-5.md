## Chapter 5: Starting Your Practice

Next, _Mindfulness in Plain English_ introduces the starting steps to practicing meditation:

Determine how long you are going to meditate. Beginners can start at 10-20 minutes. But do not worry about attaining any particular goal within a particular time period - this will just be distracting and counterproductive.

Sit in a comfortable pose. Do not change the position again until the time you determined at the beginning. Shifting positions will avoid giving you a deep level of concentration.

Sit motionlessly and close your eyes.

Your mind is like a cup of muddy water. Keep it still, and the mud will settle down and the water will be seen clearly.

The mind must focus on a mental object that is present at every moment. The book recommends starting with focusing on your breath.

Take 3 deep breaths. Then breathe normally and effortlessly, **focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils where the air is flowing through**.

  * Simply notice the feeling of breath going in and out. You may notice mindfully that there is a brief pause between inhaling and exhaling - but don’t obsess over this.



**Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything.** Simply notice the incoming and outgoing breath, and notice as the breath lengthens as you relax.

When your mind wanders, bring it back. The book suggests counting in a variety of ways, basically to distract your mind back to breathing:

  * Count 1 when inhaling, 2 when exhaling. Repeat to 10 then repeat.
  * Count 1 to 10 quickly when inhaling, and again when exhaling.
  * Count 1 to 5 when inhaling, 1 to 6 when exhaling, and so on up to 10, then repeat.
  * Count 1 at the top of your inhalation, then exhale. Then count 2 for the next breath. Go up to 10, then back down to 1.
  * After inhaling and exhaling, count 1. Do this up to 5, then back down to 1.
  * **Once your mind is focused on the breath, give up counting**.



(Shortform note: Don’t beat yourself up over getting distracted. Don’t fixate on the goal of achieving some desired end state. Don’t feel like a failure for not meeting mindfulness. Instead, think of meditation as the exercise of bringing your mind back to concentration. Every distraction is a chance to practice this and get better.)

Over time, your breathing will become shallower and more subtle. This is an indicator of concentration.

  * You will develop a new more subtle “sign” - which appears differently to different people (a star, a long string, a cobweb, the moon, a flower). Over time, master this so that whenever you want the sign, it should be available.
  * You will find great calm here free of psychic irritants. No agitation, greed, lust, hatred. These are beautiful, clear states of mind.



The mind must keep up with what is happening at every moment, so do not try to stop the mind at any one moment. This is **momentary concentration**.

When you feel in a state of concentration, the mind can then move to other sounds, memories, or emotions, one at a time. As they fade away, let your mind return to the breath.

Analogy: As we breathe in and out, we experience a small degree of calmness, as the relief of tension from suffocating. The calmness does not last as long as we wish, causing annoyance. We desire permanence in an impermanent situation, which causes unhappiness. However, if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness, and we experience only the moment of breath, our mind becomes peaceful and calm. We don’t want a different state, and we don’t beoman its transience - we simply enjoy it for what it is in the moment.
