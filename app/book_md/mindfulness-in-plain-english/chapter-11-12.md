## Chapter 11-12: Dealing with Distractions

It’s easier to concentrate in areas without distractions, hence why Buddhist monks go to meditation halls free of the other gender, noise, and daily concerns like food.

Example distractions are sounds, sensations, emotions, fantasy. Emotions include desire, aversion, self-condemnation, agitation, doubt.

For all distractions that arise, the general approach is to observe it mindfully without getting engaged. **Watch the distraction form and dissipate. Notice its intensity and how it affects the body. Notice how long it lasts.** Don’t help or hinder the thought. The distraction will naturally dissipate.

The ideal you’re going for is to **experience each mental state fully, adding nothing to it nor missing a part of it**. Example: with pain, there is a pure, flowing sensation. You don’t reject it, attach words to it, or think about it. You don’t picture a colored diagram of the leg with lightning bolts shooting at where it hurts. Instead, you simply become aware of it and watch it come and go.

Thoughts are often verbalized as “I have a pain in my leg.” You add the “I” to the experience, identifying with the pain. Leave “I” out of it - then pain is not painful, it’s simply a surging energy flow.

Don’t force the distraction away. Switch your attention to it briefly. It will eventually go away. “Fight with them and they gain strength. Watch them with detachment and they wither.”

**Ponder these things _wordlessly_. **While at first you’ll need to ask your questions in words, soon you will do it by second nature and then return to the breath. It’s a nonconceptual process.

**Do not condemn yourself** for having distractions that detract from mindfulness. Mindfulness requires a target of focus, and distractions are a secondary object of attention taking you away from breathing. **Distractions are an exercise to get through, much like a hurdle in a race. They are the very object of practice.**

Trickiest of all is positive mental states - happiness, peace, compassion. Depriving yourself of this makes you feel like a traitor to humanity. But treat them like any other mental state - don’t become attached. Observe them for what they are, and watch them come and go.

If multiple sensations arise at once, then focus on the strongest one, let it fade away, then return to your breathing.

### Tactics for Dealing with Distractions

Sometimes you won’t be able to merely observe the distraction and ponder them without thoughts. In these cases, there are more techniques:

  * Gauge the time that’s passed since you got distracted. This makes you pull out of the thought and become mindful of it.
    * The accuracy of the time estimate isn’t important - it’s the mindfulness that is.
  * If you feel agitated, take a few deep breaths and apply force to your attention. This helps clear the mind.
    * Think “in…out” as you breathe
  * Count numbers with your breaths, as described in chapter 5.
  * Oppose unskillful thoughts with skillful thoughts
    * An unskillful thought is for instance based in greed, hatred, resentment. These are unskillful in that they are easy for everyone to have and build into obsessions.
    * Skillful thoughts are connected with generosity, compassion, and wisdom. **It is _difficult_ for most people to feel these throughout the day**.
    * Skillful thoughts are antidotes to the poison of unskillful thoughts. If you resent Charlie and want to punch his face, try directing a stream of love and friendliness toward Charlie.
  * **Develop a disgust for your unhealthy emotions**
    * Take a good look at the emotional response you are trying to get rid of. Look at what it’s doing to your life, your happiness, your relationships. See how it makes you appear to others. 
    * You should have a disgust for it, much as you would to a decaying carcass around your neck. Feel real loathing for the negative emotion.
  * Recall your purpose. “I’m not just sitting here to waste my time. I’m here to focus my mind on the breath.”



### Improvements Over Time

As you begin, you’ll notice yourself getting caught in a thought pattern for unknown minutes before you snap back into mindfulness. This is an unconscious mental state taking over your brain.

As you practice, you will become better at detecting when the subconscious thought arises - as the author describes it, you learn to “extend your awareness down into the boiling darkness where thought and sensation begin.”

**Ideally, you become aware of the thinking sensation _exactly_ as it arises. **If you catch it too late, you miss the beginning.

Over time, you will observe your thoughts and mental states as separate things. You will decouple your automatic reaction from a sensation.

  * For example, if you’re normally annoyed by a dog barking, you’ll conceptualize the sensation, picturing the dog barking, wondering how far away it is, picturing the irresponsible owner and fantasizing about doing bad things to him. 
  * You will learn to separate the sound of the dog from your emotional reaction. Be mindful of the hearing - everything else is just added chatter. Over time, the emotion will dissipate.
