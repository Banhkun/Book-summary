## Chapter 16: Benefits of Meditation

What tend to be the benefits of meditation?

Selflessness - many psychic irritants are centered around the ego: “I feel pain. I want more. She’s better than me.” There is a clear partition between you and the world. Through meditation, you necessarily let go of the ego as you observe your feelings come and go. You see greed, resentment, anger for what they are and what they do to you and others. **Eventually you internalize the damage of negative emotions, and you avoid it unconsciously, much like a child who is burned by a fire avoids fire.**

Everything looks bright and special again when you actually observe the present. You enjoy each passing moment by being aware of it. Everything seems to be in constant transformation. There is joy in this change. You accept pain, old age, and death as part of reality.

**You become aware of when you are mindful and when you are not.** You’ll notice when you become mired in emotional thought, twisting reality with your mental color instead of merely observing it.

You see the source of your frustrations - your inability to get what you want, your fear of losing what you have, and your eternal dissatisfaction with what you have. Your concerns are actually superficial when you are mindful of them. **You realize that your emotions are always momentary states, and you learn to let them go.**

When you look behind your impulses and automatic emotional reactions, you see that they are just a collection of processes that have been caused and conditioned by previous processes. Your cravings become extinguished, and you are much more at peace.
