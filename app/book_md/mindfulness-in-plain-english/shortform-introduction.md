## Shortform Introduction

If you haven’t ever tried meditating, parts of this summary will sound hokey, too ethereal and wishy-washy. “Loving friendliness? Nonconceptual awareness? Hogwash!” You can redefine these terms in your own words in a way that’s satisfying to you.

You might be resistant to trying meditation, thinking it’s too contrived or it’ll “make you lose your edge.” If you’re perfectly content with how you react to life, have great emotional control, and are strongly fulfilled, then you might not benefit much from mindfulness. But if not and you’re not sure how to improve it - why not try it out?

Meditation requires regular practice to achieve lasting benefits. You can’t meditate a few times and expect to achieve complete equanimity. Use the suggestions in this book summary to start a regular practice.
