## 1-Page Summary

Have you ever spent a long time worrying about a problem only to end up feeling stressed and no closer to a solution? In _Stop Overthinking_ , Nick Trenton explains that you were probably _overthinking_ the problem: reflecting on it so much that it made you feel bad. Trenton argues that **you can disrupt overthinking by adopting stress management skills and replacing your negative thought habits with a positive mental framework.** He offers a variety of stress-busting techniques that will help you stay grounded in the present moment and live a productive life driven by action and control rather than endless worrying.

Nick Trenton has a Master’s degree in Behavioral Psychology and specializes in emotional well-being. _Stop Overthinking_ is the first book of his series “The Path to Calm,” which includes other books such as _Transform Your Self-Talk _and _Calm Your Emotions_.

In this guide, we’ll discuss what overthinking is, why it affects some people more than others, and how it’s connected to stress and anxiety. Next, we’ll explore ways you can manage stress before, during, and after it happens with various research-based techniques. Finally, we’ll learn how you can reshape your negative thinking habits into positive ones. Throughout the guide, we’ll compare Trenton’s strategies with those of other experts and offer additional actionable insights to overcome your negative thought patterns.

### What Is Overthinking?

According to Trenton, **overthinking is what happens when** **you think about something so much that it becomes harmful to your health.** For example, you just decided between two apartments and signed a lease. Right after, you start wondering whether you made the right choice and spend so much time thinking about it that you feel stressed and anxious all week.

(Shortform note: One common and harmful form of overthinking is indecision. Psychologists refer to overthinking decisions as _analysis paralysis_ —when you spend so much time weighing your options that you put off decision-making longer than necessary. When you overthink every decision, you can feel overwhelmed and experience more anxiety. To combat analysis paralysis, some psychologists suggest you practice making small decisions quickly.)

You might think that your thoughts are helpful—that you’re working to solve the issue—but Trenton says that’s rarely the case. When you think about the same thing over and over again, your thoughts cease to add value or provide any solutions to the problem—they only create stress. In fact, whatever problem you’re grappling with usually isn’t the true cause of the anxiety you’re feeling. Rather, it’s your overthinking habit that _creates_ anxiety.

For example, in a job interview, you might have responded to a question in a way you didn’t intend to and then spent hours worrying about that moment. In this case, your worry doesn’t change how you responded to the question. What’s more, your response to the interview question may not have even been problematic: It’s just your swirling thoughts and worries _about_ the response that create a problem and give you anxiety.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman elaborates on why your anxious thoughts only cause more anxiety. He explains that when you worry, you’re trying to find solutions to problems _before_ they even occur. As a result, overthinking becomes a problem itself as these worries tend to spiral out of proportion and don’t help you solve the problem that you’re worrying about in the first place. This is because, unlike when you’re creatively brainstorming solutions, you’re in a negative state of mind while worrying, which limits your ability to approach the problem from new angles or generate any useful solutions.)

#### Causes of Overthinking

Why do some people overthink more than others? Trenton explains that anxiety and overthinking are intertwined. **When you’re prone to anxiety, you’re more likely to overthink.** Two main factors affect your level of anxiety: your genetics and your environment.

Although there isn’t one specific gene that causes anxiety, researchers have found that multiple genes can _predispose_ you to it. People with these genes tend to have more overactive brains—when they’re not doing anything that requires mental focus, their thoughts are more prone to anxious wandering.

Environmentally, triggers in both your immediate surroundings and the broader world can increase your anxiety and overthinking tendencies. These might be things like smells or crowds. On a deeper level, researchers have also linked anxiety to past traumatic events, such as experiencing neglect during childhood.

> **How Anxiety Perpetuates: Family Cycles and Anxiety as a Habit**
> 
> Trenton contends that a mixture of genetics and environment influence your likelihood to develop anxiety, with some psychologists believing that anxiety is about 30% genetic. Anxiety can cycle through families because anxious parents unconsciously raise their children in anxious environments. For example, a parent who takes away their child’s bicycle after a minor fall or refuses to let them go to sleepovers may increase anxious tendencies in their children by modeling to them that the world is a scary place.
> 
> However, according to some psychologists, becoming aware of these behaviors is the first step to disrupting the cycle of anxiety that can run in families.
> 
> In _Unwinding Anxiety_ , Dr. Judson Brewer provides more insights into why environments can cause anxiety. He explains that anxiety is a habit—an endless loop that causes behaviors that only make you more anxious, such as overthinking. Anxiety occurs when you feel fearful of something, yet you lack the information or ability to relieve that fear. This causes you to associate particular aspects of your environment with your anxious feelings, which only increases the scope of your anxiety. For example, you might start associating something in your environment (such as crowded places) with feelings of anxiety, which could lead you to grow anxious about going outside in general.

#### Consequences of Overthinking

According to Trenton, **the stress of overthinking can cause real harm to your mental, physical, and social health**. Stress is your body’s reaction to an external pressure, such as an upcoming presentation at work. Anxiety is the feeling you experience when you encounter this stressful thing. While a healthy dose of stress is beneficial for growth, your body isn’t meant to handle long periods of stress. Also known as chronic stress, this prolonged strain on your mind and body wears down your ability to cope with and overcome challenges.

  1. **Mental** : Excessive worrying takes a toll on your self-confidence, your mood, and your ability to concentrate on other things.
  2. **Physical** : If you’re in a state of constant worry, you might experience headaches, exhaustion, or a rapid heart rate.
  3. **Social** : Overthinking can hinder your ability to form and maintain healthy relationships, disrupt productivity, or even fuel negative habits like self-isolation.



> **Why Chronic Stress Takes a Toll**
> 
> In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , Robert Sapolsky explains the evolutionary reason why chronic stress is harmful. He argues that our bodies are programmed to respond intensely to immediate stressors such as predators. In the modern world, however, we encounter a different type of stress far more often—sustained stressors like financial or job concerns, which our bodies aren’t equipped to handle.
> 
> Because our stress responses are so intense, prolonged stress can take a heavy toll on our physical and mental health—Sapolsky explains the science behind why. When your stress response is triggered, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in to prepare your body to react to the threat, releasing a host of neurotransmitters and diverting blood flow. When long-term stressors activate this fight-or-flight mode too often, it can disrupt many bodily systems such as your cardiovascular system, metabolism, immune system, and brain function.
> 
> Sapolsky describes additional physical effects that chronic stress can have—it can stunt growth or make people age faster, as well as damage digestive and immune systems. In terms of mental health, depression and anxiety involve the body’s inability to deal properly with stress. Chronic stress can worsen anxiety, as people with these disorders have more hyperactive stress responses. Similarly, excessive stress can cause neurochemical changes in your brain that result in depression.
> 
> Other experts further explain that chronic stress drains your mental energy, which affects how you interact with others. When stress depletes your mental resources, you might find yourself less communicative, more impatient, and prone to irritability.

### Stop Overthinking By Practicing Better Stress Management

Trenton outlines two approaches to manage overthinking: coping more effectively with stress in your daily life and overhauling your mindset to become more resilient to overthinking in the long term. We'll first look at dealing with stress.

**You can manage your tendency to overthink by developing healthier approaches to stress.** While you can’t alter your genetics or your environment, you _can_ change how you respond __ to challenging situations. Trenton offers various strategies to keep your anxiety in check before, during, and after you encounter something stressful.

(Shortform note: In _The Upside of Stress_ , Kelly McGonigal recommends you _embrace stress rather than try to avoid it_. She argues that stress comes naturally when you pursue ambitions and personal growth. When you avoid things that stress you out, you’ll only create new problems. For example, if you ignore a work project until the last minute, you’ll only feel more stressed trying to complete it and also struggle to perform well in your job. Rather, McGonigal suggests developing a better stress mindset by remembering your strengths and past successes, connecting with others, and being vulnerable about your struggles.)

#### Before: Manage Your Time to Prevent Stress

Trenton explains that uncertainty can make you feel anxious. When you don’t have a plan for how to complete your daily or weekly tasks, you’re bound to feel higher levels of stress. He suggests you **reduce your stress by identifying your top priorities, setting SMART goals, and being deliberate about how you spend your time.**

##### **Identify Top Priorities**

Trenton argues that when you’re consciously aware of what you value in life, you can more easily let go of commitments that don’t fulfill you and instead make time for your priorities, which will reduce your stress. For example, you might determine that you value developing your small business plan, improving your health, and spending time with your kids. When you’re consciously aware of these priorities, it will be easier for you to reduce the time spent on other tasks.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Project_ , Gretchen Rubin elaborates that many people’s ideas of fun are based on other people’s perception of fun rather than on what they __ actually enjoy. When identifying your priorities, Rubin suggests you reflect on whether your current activities are truly enjoyable _to you_ by thinking back to what you enjoyed doing as a child and pursuing more of those activities. This method of finding what you truly enjoy can help identify meaningful hobbies or even life aspirations.)

##### **Set SMART Goals**

Eliminate the stress of meeting vague goals by creating ones that are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based. For example, if your goal is to start a side business selling pet portraits, your expression of your SMART goal could be: “I want to sell ten pet portraits in the next month by spending two hours a day painting (specific, measurable, and time-based). I have the necessary supplies, painting experience, and interested followers (attainable), and this goal will help me improve my art skills and finances (relevant).”

When your goals are clear and focused, you’ll know exactly how to accomplish them and eliminate distractions.

(Shortform note: Others acknowledge that setting SMART goals can help you express your goals but caution that they can also cause you to set goals that are too low. They explain that people can get so focused on making a goal attainable that they limit themselves, and they argue that difficult goals are key to high performance. When using the SMART goals formula, double-check to make sure that your goal still stretches your limits and encourages high effort.)

##### **Be Deliberate About How You Spend Your Time**

Trenton also advises that you remove the stress of uncertainty by making deliberate choices about when you will accomplish each task. When you make these decisions up front, you’ll know exactly how to spend your time, leaving you less room to overthink.

(Shortform note: Other experts corroborate Trenton’s emphasis on taking control of your time, adding that you should take control of other aspects of your life, too. According to Charles Duhigg in _Smarter, Faster, Better_ , the more in control you feel, the more motivated you become to tackle challenges and pursue your goals. He suggests making more deliberate choices to generate a sense of control because this makes you feel more confident, which in turn boosts your motivation. A deliberate choice could be as small as deciding what you’ll eat for lunch ahead of time.)

To be deliberate in managing your time, Trenton suggests you do two things: 1) sort your tasks into categories of importance and urgency and 2) schedule your time around your priorities.

**1) For each new task, first determine if it’s important or urgent**. Important tasks move you toward your goals, whereas urgent ones have consequences for not completing them promptly. Then, address important _and_ urgent __ tasks immediately, schedule important __ but _not urgent_ tasks for another time, and delegate tasks that are urgent __ but _not important_. Finally, discard tasks that are neither so that you can focus on your priorities.

(Shortform note: When determining how to best schedule your time in the future, it can be helpful to understand how you _currently_ spend your time. In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey suggests you create an attention management matrix to get a clear picture of what kind of tasks you spend your time doing. He recommends you sort your tasks into four categories: unnecessary, distracting, necessary, or meaningful. Bailey points out that people often spend the most time on unnecessary or distracting tasks, which means they perform tasks that capture their attention but aren’t necessarily important.)

**2) Block out specific chunks of time for each task throughout your day.** Figure out when you’re most productive and plan to do your most important or difficult tasks then. Afterward, fill in the rest of your day with lower-priority work. This method prevents the urge to multitask and allows you to engage in more focused deep work.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport agrees with Trenton on the importance of devoting time to important or difficult tasks—allowing you to engage in what he calls “deep work.” Newport differentiates deep work from shallow work, which are tasks that don’t require much thinking yet feel like they’re productive. On the other hand, deep work is important, difficult, and fulfilling. He states that distractions such as open floor plans and easy access to technologies make it hard to engage in deep work. In addition to Trenton’s suggestion of scheduling time for deep work, Newport recommends you have a designated workspace where you _only_ perform deep work.)

#### During: Empower Yourself to Handle Stress

Although good time management habits can help prevent stress in your life, you won’t be able to avoid it entirely. When stress does happen, **you can take a constructive approach to it and calm yourself through grounding practices.**

##### Constructive Approaches to Stress

Instead of letting your anxious thoughts take over, try practicing four stress approaches to regain a sense of control:

**Avoid the situation.** Cut out unnecessary people or situations that cause you stress. For instance, if driving on the highway in heavy traffic makes you feel uncomfortable, try taking a local route or using public transportation.

**Change the situation.** When you can’t avoid a stressful situation, consider what you can change to reduce the stress. For example, if you’re struggling to concentrate on your work because of a construction project outside your building, purchase noise-canceling headphones. Also, people around you often aren’t aware of what’s bothering you about a situation. To change it, you often must speak out and express your needs and limitations. For example, if a friend needs to rant but you have a project due at the end of the day, respectfully communicate that you can’t hear them out right now.

**Make peace with the situation.** Sometimes, there’s nothing you can do to make a stressful situation better. Instead of worrying endlessly, acknowledge your feelings and make peace with the situation. For example, if your relative is in the hospital and you’re worried about their condition, acknowledge and accept that you feel concerned and understand there’s nothing you can do to alter the situation right now.

**Adapt to the situation.** Ease the stress of a challenging situation by changing your expectations. For example, if you’re frustrated because a project didn’t turn out the way you envisioned, reduce your stress by practicing forgiveness toward yourself and identifying what you learned from the experience.

> **A Step-By-Step Approach to Managing Immediate Stress**
> 
> In _The Chimp Paradox_ , Steve Peters explains that your stress response gets triggered faster than your rational mind can process the situation, which can make it difficult to cope with a stressful situation calmly and productively. He provides a step-by-step guide on how to calm your stress response in the moment so that you can better approach the situation. This guide includes some aspects of Trenton’s above approaches.
> 
>   * First, acknowledge your feelings. As Trenton advises, accepting rather than suppressing your emotions is an important part of most stress management approaches.
> 
>   * Next, consciously commit to changing your reaction to something else. Similar to Trenton’s advice of changing your expectations to adapt to a stressful situation, deliberately deciding on another reaction helps you take control and ease the stress of the situation.
> 
>   * Then, pause before you react. Like Trenton’s advice of avoiding stressors, Peters recommends you try to remove yourself from the situation.
> 
>   * Look at the situation from a long-term perspective. This might be a helpful way to make peace with a stressful situation as Trenton recommends.
> 
>   * Think about what actions you can take to solve the issue. Like the technique Trenton suggested, look for ways to change the situation.
> 
>   * Finally, Peters advises you try to exit the situation on a positive note, such as smiling to yourself or someone you were interacting with.

##### Grounding Practices for Stress

You’ve learned the four approaches to managing stress, but what if you still feel anxiety bubbling up? Trenton suggests you **distract yourself from racing thoughts by engaging your five senses.** This keeps your brain occupied and grounded in the present moment so that you don’t drift into overthinking. To ground yourself with your five senses:

  1. Look at _five_ things in your surroundings. For example, look at the sky and observe the texture of the clouds or how fast they’re drifting.
  2. Touch _four_ things around you. Run your fingers across your desk or stroke your pet.
  3. Listen for _three_ sounds. Pay attention to the sound of your breath or the hum of your air conditioner.
  4. Try to detect _two_ smells. Observe the scent of your coffee or your clothes.
  5. Tune into _one_ thing you can taste. You might notice the lingering taste of your breakfast.



(Shortform note: This method that Trenton proposes, also known as the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, is a common grounding technique to combat panic and disrupt your fight-or-flight response. In addition to using your five senses when practicing this technique, you can also consider focusing on one positive thing about yourself, like a good deed that you’re proud of. This technique has benefits beyond relieving anxiety—it improves your quality of life by encouraging a habit of appreciating the present moment.)

#### After: Reflect on Your Thoughts and Feelings to Cope With Stress

Trenton also advises that after a stressful event, **you can prepare yourself to better manage future stress by acknowledging and reflecting upon your stressful experiences.** Ignoring your stress won’t make it go away. However, if you instead work through it constructively, you’ll gain more awareness about your emotions and what triggers your anxiety so that you can better approach similar situations in the future.

(Shortform note: In _The Upside of Stress_ , Kelly McGonigal echoes the importance of acknowledging your stressful experiences, adding that you should be honest and realistic about your stress. Rather than force a positive outlook on every stressful situation, recognize your feelings but choose to focus on the positive side. One way you can do this is by considering how the situation might benefit you in the future.)

Trenton’s recommendations for reflecting on stress draw from the practice of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This is a form of psychological treatment based on the theory that changing your thoughts can improve how you see the world and yourself. To reflect upon your thoughts and cope with stress, Trenton recommends you journal about your anxious thoughts and explore your feelings about it with curiosity.

(Shortform note: In _Cognitive Behavior Therapy_ , Judith S. Beck elaborates that the main goal of CBT is to change your dysfunctional behavior (like overthinking, in this case) by changing your belief systems. The main question that CBT practitioners encourage patients to ask themselves is: “What was just going through my mind?” Asking this question allows patients to become more aware of their automatic thoughts and learn to recognize the negative biases behind them, which ultimately allows them to shift these beliefs into more positive ones.)

##### Journal About the Stressful Event

To manage stress, Trenton suggests you **work through it by writing in a journal.** When you ignore your anxious thoughts and feelings, you’ll struggle to understand what causes them. However, by writing them down in a journal, you can productively process your emotions, understand what triggers them, and glean insights on how you can better cope with stress in the future.

(Shortform note: In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , Robert Sapolsky provides additional reasons why you should understand triggers in order to manage future stressors. He explains that when you’re able to predict a stressful encounter, you’ll be better prepared to cope with it and less affected by it. At the same time, knowing when a stressful event will occur allows you to relax when you’re _not_ expecting something stressful. Trenton’s advice of journaling your anxious thoughts helps you identify patterns to better predict and cope with future stress. Sapolsky provides similar strategies to make your life more predictable: make schedules, prepare budgets, and plan ahead for your activities.)

Trenton recommends a research-backed approach to journaling about your stress: Start by recounting the stressful situation and describing the thoughts and feelings you had in that moment. Consider using a rating scale for your stress levels and try to notice any patterns of what’s most frequently causing you stress. Then, shift your focus to extracting something positive from the situation.

For example, if you argued with your partner about who will drive the kids to school after a miscommunication, you might record feeling frustrated that your partner didn’t express their time conflict beforehand and rate your stress as 7/10. Then, try to transition your focus to something good, such as being grateful that neither of you raised your voice in front of the kids.

(Shortform note: This journaling approach that Trenton recommends is called _positive affect journaling_ , which is a type of expressive writing that focuses on noticing the positive aspects of your life and past experiences. One study suggests that positive affect journaling can be more effective than simply recording distressing experiences. It found there are numerous health benefits that include a decrease in symptoms of depression and anxiety and an increase in resilience.)

##### Be Curious About the Stressful Event

Another way to process stressful events is to **be open-minded and curious about your response** to them. Instead of judging your thoughts and emotions, simply observe them. When you focus on being curious, you’re less likely to get caught up in feeling bad about yourself and how you reacted, which improves your ability to cope with stress.

(Shortform note: In _Unwinding Anxiety_ , Judson Brewer provides strategies on how you can be more curious about your thoughts: encourage curiosity by paying attention to your breathing or even widening your eyes. These strategies disrupt your anxious thoughts and allow you to observe them from a more neutral standpoint. Another technique he recommends is saying “hmm” to yourself when you’re feeling stressed to trigger yourself into being curious rather than frustrated.)

To be curious rather than judgmental about your thoughts and emotions, Trenton argues you must first separate your personal identity from your problems—such as your tendency to overthink. **Rather than trying to fix _yourself_ , think about it as finding solutions to external problems that you’re just _experiencing_.** When you distance yourself from your problems, you gain a sense of control and open yourself to new perspectives that can help you solve them.

(Shortform note: In _Chatter_ , Ethan Kross agrees with Trenton on the importance of detaching yourself from your problems and recommends you avoid using the first-person “I” pronoun in your thoughts. He explains that other pronouns such as “you,” “he,” “she,” or “they” don’t trigger your threat response as much and that people tend to experience fewer negative emotions when using these pronouns.)

Trenton suggests you use mantras and visualization to detach from your thoughts and emotions. A mantra is a statement you can repeat as a reminder to, for instance, distance yourself from your problems—“This problem doesn’t define me.” Visualization allows you to practice putting distance between yourself and your problems through your imagination. For example, imagine putting your stressful thoughts in a bottle and sending them out to sea.

(Shortform note: Trenton doesn’t explicitly define what a mantra is. Traditionally, a mantra is a calming sound or word spoken in Sanskrit that is used to focus during meditations. In a more modern sense, however, a mantra is a positive statement that focuses your intentions and supports self-esteem. Visualization is a form of meditation that can also be useful beyond helping you gain distance from your negative thoughts and problems. Imagining peaceful images can have other mental health benefits such as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and it even has the potential to relieve physical pain or discomfort.)

You can even distance yourself from your anxious thoughts by personifying them or by seeing the humor in a situation. When you personify your thoughts, you give them a form outside of yourself, which allows you to analyze them with curiosity. One way Trenton suggests you do this is by imagining your anxious thoughts as a chatty friend trying to tell you a story. You can also personify your thoughts by giving them a silly name. For example, if you’re feeling guilty about a past mistake you made at work, give that moment a name like, “The Old Work Chronicle _._ ”

Finding humor allows you to distance yourself by creating a new perspective on the situation that puts you in control. For example, if you’re embarrassed because a teacher called on you during class and you didn’t have the answer, picture what you must have looked like at that moment—perhaps like a character from your favorite cartoon caught in headlights.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris offers additional insights on how you can gain distance from your anxious thoughts, a process which he refers to as _defusion_. To separate yourself from your thoughts and emotions, he advises you to recognize them as only a story—nothing more than words and images—instead of as fact. By doing this, you diminish the control of your negative thoughts. Like Trenton, he also advises you to give your thoughts another voice, such as imagining a cartoon character saying them.)

### Conquer Overthinking With a New Mindset

Now that you’ve learned strategies to effectively cope with stress, let’s discuss how you can**conquer your habit of overthinking in the long term by transforming your negative thought patterns into a positive and resilient mindset**.

Trenton explains that, in many cases,**** your overthinking habit is perpetuated by negative thought patterns.**** These are unsupportive ways of thinking that hold you back rather than strengthen and empower you. Positive beliefs, on the other hand, encourage you to advocate for yourself in spite of your flaws and motivate you to move past obstacles. To manage your tendency to overthink in the long term, you must identify your negative thoughts, challenge them, and replace them with positive beliefs.

(Shortform note: According to Tony Robbins in _Awaken the Giant Within_ , negative beliefs can be especially harmful when they’re global rather than specific. When a belief is global, you think something is _always_ true, like that you’re awkward in every social situation. This can lead to learned helplessness, or the belief that nothing you do will change anything, which holds you back and perpetuates your negative thinking. To combat this, Robbins advises you to build powerful references that support your positive beliefs. You can do this by consuming media like books or podcasts that allow you to learn about other people’s experiences or reflect on your past positive experiences.)

#### Step 1: Identify Your Triggers and Negative Thinking Habits

The first step to adopting a positive mindset is to **identify what triggers you to overthink.** This could include anything from other people, your environment, or a specific word someone said. For example, you might spiral into doubt whenever someone says “never mind” after you ask them to repeat something.

(Shortform note: Specific people and words are personal triggers that you might develop over the course of your life. However, researchers have determined other common triggers for anxiety, such as drinking caffeine or skipping meals. To better understand your triggers, they suggest you consider consulting with a therapist, writing in a journal, or using apps to track your anxiety.)

In addition to specific triggers, you should also**identify broader _cognitive distortions_ , which are inaccurate and negative beliefs you might have about yourself and the world**. These often drive anxiety and overthinking. For example, you might have a habit of taking everything personally, such as assuming you’ve done something wrong if your friend forgets to text you back.

(Shortform note: Closely tied to Trenton’s discussion of cognitive distortions and negative beliefs is the concept of self-talk, which Ethan Kross defines in _Chatter_ as the thoughts you hear as words inside your mind. Like cognitive distortions, negative self-talk is critical and holds you back in life rather than providing support and encouragement. Trenton suggests identifying specific cognitive distortions so that you can eventually disprove and replace them. However, Kross says you can’t rid yourself of negative self-talk completely. Rather, you can learn to quiet it by seeking support from others and increasing your sense of control in life.)

To identify your triggers and cognitive distortions, Trenton suggests making a table with columns where you describe the stressful situation, how you behaved, and how you felt. For example, you might write that you had texted a friend about something you’re proud of and they never responded. Then, describe your behavior as a result of the situation: You might have neglected your chores and checked your phone every few minutes. Lastly, reflect on your feelings: Perhaps you felt anxious or unwanted as a friend.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield offers different categories of negative thoughts that may help you in applying Trenton’s advice of identifying your cognitive distortions using a table. Common types of negative thoughts include: believing someone thinks negatively about you, fixating on the worst possible outcome, giving yourself a negative label such as “incompetent,” making the situation about you, and viewing things in extremes.)

#### Step 2: Challenge Your Negative Thinking Habits

To challenge your negative thought patterns, **reconsider the moment through a positive lens and gather evidence to support or disprove your belief.** Ask yourself whether there’s any proof for your interpretation of the situation, then write down alternative possibilities in another column of your table. To continue the above example, you might record that you later learned your friend was studying for an exam when you texted them and that you have no evidence that they’re unhappy with you.

(Shortform note: In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz echoes Trenton’s suggestion to reframe your memories through a positive lens, elaborating that regularly thinking negative thoughts can lead you to make false assumptions that don't reflect the reality of a situation. Instead, he argues that you should focus only on the facts of a situation rather than how you feel about it. To reinterpret situations more rationally, Maltz suggests you practice pausing before reacting to stressful situations and forgiving yourself for your past mistakes.)

Trenton also suggests you challenge negative thought habits by **experimenting with doing the opposite of what you’re feeling.** While it’s important to validate your feelings, you shouldn’t let them take control of your thoughts and actions. For example, if your anxiety makes you reluctant to go to lunch with your colleagues, try to go through with it. This way, you might find evidence that they enjoy your company, which challenges your anxiety-driven beliefs.

(Shortform note: Trenton’s suggestion of doing the opposite of what your emotions tell you to do is a technique known as _opposite action_ in dialectical behavioral therapy. This is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on regulating your emotions. Psychologists add that for this method to be successful, you must fully commit to the opposite action and believe that it will be successful.)

#### Step 3: Develop Positive Beliefs

Lastly, **replace your inaccurate, negative beliefs with positive ones to become more resilient to stress and curb your overthinking.** By reframing how you view yourself and the world, positive beliefs strengthen your sense of control and improve your ability to manage stressful challenges productively and effectively.

(Shortform note: Once you’ve replaced your negative beliefs with positive ones, Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) suggests you reinforce your new positive beliefs with rewards so that you aren’t tempted to revert back to your old negative thinking habits. For example, when you overcome a negative belief with a positive one, give yourself a small reward, such as your favorite snack. When you strengthen your positive beliefs, you’ll find it easier to think of them more automatically and consistently.)

Trenton suggests you focus on three things to develop a positive mindset:

**1) Be in the present moment** : Focusing on the present promotes a positive worldview because it allows you to find solutions to your problems without stressing about concerns you have no control over. Instead of ruminating on periods of time you have no control over (the past and the future), you direct your attention to the resources you have now.

(Shortform note: Focusing on the present not only helps you curb overthinking but improves your overall happiness in life. In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle argues that you can only connect with your true self by being in the present. When you’re connected with your true self, you’re able to silence negative thoughts, which Tolle refers to as your ego, and achieve inner peace and happiness. He suggests one method to focus on the present: Practice being fully immersed in an activity such as walking.)

**2) Let go of what you can’t control** : Anxiety and overthinking happen when you fixate on things outside of your control. Trenton suggests you focus on what you _do_ have control over. For example, once you’ve signed a lease for an apartment, rather than worry that you’ve chosen the wrong one, focus on ways to increase your happiness with the one you decided on. Research nearby restaurants or parks and make a plan for a smooth moving experience.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Trenton on the importance of focusing on what you can control. One way you can do this is by practicing gratitude, which allows you to focus on what you _have_ rather than on what you _don’t_ have. In _The Power_ , Rhonda Byrne argues that practicing gratitude allows you not only to take control of your thoughts but to recognize the control you have to find something to be grateful for in every situation. She advises you to build a habit of appreciating things by intentionally identifying what you love in your daily life and surroundings, such as things you see in nature and the people in your life.)

**3) Identify your needs** : Rather than worrying about and optimizing every little thing in your life, concentrate on meeting your _needs_ and not your _wants_. Focusing solely on what you need helps you achieve a more positive mindset by allowing you to let go of unnecessary things that would otherwise drain your time and energy.

(Shortform note: Trenton argues that you should focus on your needs rather than your wants. In _101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think_ , Brianna Wiest adds that you should also concentrate on meeting _your_ needs rather than doing what _other_ people expect from you. Like Trenton’s suggestion of letting go of unnecessary concerns, Wiest suggests you stop chasing external validation, such as approval from your friend group and, instead, learn to be more mindful of your own feelings to discover your true needs.)
