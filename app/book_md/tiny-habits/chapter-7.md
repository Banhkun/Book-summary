## Chapter 7: Conclusion

By designing Tiny Habits and allowing them to take root in our lives, we’re committing to a view of behavior change that’s **based on curiosity rather than obligation, non-judgment rather than self-criticism, and celebration rather than emotional pressure**.

In Fogg’s approach to behavior change, a habit is a bit like a piece of computer code: If it doesn’t work the first time (and it probably won’t!), go back, debug the program, and try again. Keep going until you iron out the problems and have something that functions smoothly and reliably.

Introducing Tiny Habits into your life will not only make you more efficient and leave you more time to do the things you love—it’ll also make you a more joyful and resilient person.

And if you’re helping other people to change, even better. Helping other people is a powerful source of Shine.

To conclude, let’s circle back to the Fogg Behavior Maxims. Here they are again:

**Behavior Maxim #1:_Help people do something they already want to do._**

**Behavior Maxim #2:_Help people feel successful._**

This is the core of the Tiny Habits approach. If you’re focusing on building up things that you and others already want to do, and if you’re cultivating a feeling of success in yourself and others, you’re already most of the way there.

> **Example: Helping Nurses with Burnout**
> 
> Several years ago, a large research hospital hired Fogg to work with their nursing staff. The hospital’s stated aspiration was to help the nurses build resilience through new habits, but it quickly became clear that the real problem was burnout. The more Fogg interacted with the nurses, the more he learned about the stresses they were dealing with in the workplace and their constantly sky-high levels of fatigue. Fogg and his co-coach, Linda, asked the nurses about their routines and taught them how to create new habits using the Behavior Design steps. They discovered a number of counterproductive habits, all springing from an unhealthy work culture at the hospital. The nurses hardly ever took breaks of any kind, and they often didn’t drink any water in their entire 12-hour shift because they didn’t want to lose time taking bathroom breaks. Often the extreme fatigue rendered them unable to interact properly with their families when they got home.
> 
> The two Tiny Habits coaches helped the nurses think of a list of Anchors and a list of positive new habits (take a deep breath, smile at someone nearby, take a sip of water, ask for help, say “thank you”). They mixed and matched these lists into complete Tiny Habit recipes. Here are some examples:
> 
>   * After I park my car, I will take three deep breaths.
> 
>   * After I walk in the door, I will think, Today I’m helping people to heal.
> 
>   * After I see each patient, I will make eye contact and smile.
> 
> 

> 
> The nurses celebrated alone, as they’d been taught, but quickly started celebrating each other’s successes as well. Someone who drank water got a round of applause. Another person who sat down to rest got a high five.
> 
> The nurses had filled out a questionnaire before the Tiny Habits seminar series, and they repeated it three months later. There were statistically significant improvements in the nurses’ stress reduction habits, their self-reported stress management, their ability to build resilience, and their ability to recognize positive events at work. The Tiny Habits method for group change, based on individual nurses implementing their own self-care recipes, is clearly effective even—or especially—for people under stress.
