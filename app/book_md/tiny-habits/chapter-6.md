## Chapter 6: Changing With Others

Up until now, you’ve been focusing on yourself in making changes. This isn’t a coincidence—it’s best to experiment on yourself first and get a feeling for the Behavior Change process before complicating things by adding other people. But in this chapter, you’ll see how to apply the insights you’ve gained in previous chapters to helping other people change, both individually and within groups.

Even individual changes can have far-reaching effects on others. Think back to Juni, from Chapter 5, who was able to encourage her son’s singing because she beat her sugar habit, and Jill, from Chapter 4, who created a harmonious family environment for her daughter by wiping the kitchen counter. These women created habits for themselves that had a direct positive effect on other people.

#### The People in Our Lives: Help or Hindrance?

The people around us can be incredible resources. When you’re going through the Behavior Design steps, it can help to enlist someone else to help you generate ideas.

But not all of the people around us want us to change. **Look out for enablers, who consciously or unconsciously sabotage your new habit.** These might be the husband who undercuts his wife’s weight-loss plan by waving pizza under her nose as a “joke” or the mother who tells her adolescent son that his interest in meditation is “just a phase.”

**Unhelpful habits can emerge as a part of group dynamics.** Examples of this are families in which all members are glued to their phones during family dinner, overly critical or lax work environments, and gossipy friendship groups.

The good news is that **one person _can_ spark a group change**—if the change process is designed well.

### General Advice for Behavior Change in Groups

  * Start small. Before tackling behavior change in a big company, try it in your family. Before you try it in your family, try it on yourself.
  * Start with Fogg Maxim #1: “Help people do something they already want to do.” Get clear on the group’s aspirations.
  * Understand that all groups are unique and there’s no cure-all prescription. Group changes need to be tailored, just as individual ones do.



### The Ringleader and the Ninja

As a behavior change leader, you can take on one of two roles.

**The Ringleader** is a clearly recognizable leadership role. As a Ringleader, you openly explain and guide the Behavior Design process. Perhaps you’re a manager at a company; perhaps you’re a family member who reads this book and decides to introduce some Tiny Habits at home. As a Ringleader, you explain Behavior Design principles systematically and build your group’s enthusiasm and knowledge around behavior change.

**The Ninja** is an undercover role. Perhaps you’re a work team member and don’t want to step on the manager’s toes by overtly championing change; perhaps you have adolescent children who you know will resist any kind of “system” you suggest. As a Ninja, you smuggle Behavior Design principles and methods into group discussions.

The Ringleader and the Ninja follow the same steps but use different techniques.

As you already know, the steps of the Behavior Design process are as follows:

_Select_

1\. Pinpoint your exact aspiration or outcome

2\. Brainstorm possible behavioral solutions

3\. Identify the Golden Behaviors

_Design_

4\. Find the tiny version

5\. Choose your prompt

_Practice_

6\. Celebrate

7\. Repeat, refine, and upgrade

#### 1\. **Pinpoint the aspiration or outcome**

As the **Ringleader** , you can suggest an aspiration and ask for feedback from the group. For example: “As a family, our aspiration is X. Is that a clear statement of what we want to achieve?”

As the **Ninja** , you pinpoint the issue more subtly: “Just so I’m clear, we’re aiming for X, right?”

#### **2\. Brainstorm possible behavioral solutions**

As the **Ringleader** , you can overtly use the Behavior Design tools “Swarm of Behaviors” and “Magic Wanding” (imagining you have a magic wand and listing wildly fantastical behavioral solutions). You could run a verbal brainstorming process (this works well with groups of up to twenty people) or do this electronically or on paper (best for groups of over twenty people).

As the **Ninja** , you can implement Magic Wanding indirectly by asking questions such as “What would be the ideal solution here?” and “What’s something crazy that might work?”

#### **3\. Identify the Golden Behaviors**

As the **Ringleader** , you can overtly engage everyone in Focus Mapping using behaviors written on index cards. One approach is as follows.

  * One by one, ask all group members to assign a card to a place on the vertical axis (Impact) of the Focus Map. 
  * When all cards have been laid out, group members continue taking turns, rearranging one card at a time without getting bogged down in explanations as to why they’re doing it. 
  * This process continues until the group reaches consensus. After that, repeat it for the horizontal axis (Feasibility). (Note: This process seems long, but in practice, the added structure reduces a potentially drawn-out and contentious process to around thirty minutes.)
  * After Focus Mapping, publicly identify the Golden Behaviors in the top right-hand quadrant and then decide as a group on which ones you would like to implement.



As the **Ninja** , you can slide Focus Mapping principles into a regular discussion. You can ask the group, for example, “Which of these options would be the most effective, if we could get people to do it?” (Impact axis) and “Which of these options is the most realistic?” (Feasibility axis).

#### **4\. Find the tiny version**

As the **Ringleader** , you can directly suggest and elicit suggestions for easy versions of a new behavior. You can also troubleshoot directly by asking the discovery question, “What is making this behavior difficult?” Let’s say, for example, that you’re a project manager, and you want to find out more about the hurdles your team is encountering in their work. You’ve asked your team to email you individually every day about the biggest hurdle they’re currently facing, but you’re not getting many responses. You ask the team specifically about each Ability Chain link in turn (time, money, mental effort, physical effort, place in existing routines) and learn that many team members simply don’t know how to identify and talk about roadblocks. Based on this, you implement a team-wide professional development workshop based on project hurdles, clearing the way for the desired behavior to take root.

As the **Ninja** , you can ask sneaky discovery questions. For example, if your teenager is struggling to get her homework done, ask her, “What is making this difficult for you?” Then suggest some possibilities based on her weakest Ability Chain link. Another effective tactic for a Ninja is to subtly redesign the environment to make a desired behavior easier.

#### 5\. **Choose the prompt**

As the **Ringleader** , you can ask each group member to think about an individual Anchor that will work for them. It’s a good idea to come up with options as a group and then have group members pick their Anchors individually. You can also help each group member to formulate their own Tiny Habit recipe based on the Anchor: for example, “After I put my afternoon coffee on the desk, I will open my project hurdle notes and write a brief email about today’s hurdles. Then I will take a sip of coffee and smile.”

As the **Ninja** , you can help people to think individually about the best prompt for them. One way to do this is to look at group members who are currently succeeding at the behavior and ask them more about their approach, and about their prompt in particular. Then you can suggest that the less successful team members adopt the same prompt.

#### 6\. Celebrate

Celebration isn’t needed for one-time behaviors. For ongoing behaviors, both Ringleader and Ninja can encourage celebrations as follows.

As the **Ringleader** , your role in celebration is very important. If you think back to your own personal mini-celebrations, some of these are probably related to praise or recognition from an authority figure (a parent, a teacher, a boss). **You have the same psychological importance to your employees.** There are three ways that you can promote Shine as a Ringleader:

  * Explicitly discuss the connection between emotions and habits with your group, emphasizing that feeling good is the best way to change. Help group members to find their own effective personal celebrations.
  * Praise and celebrate successful group members yourself. A leader that can bring about feelings of Shine is extremely valuable. Reflect on the positive feedback you give. Is it lavish enough to evoke Shine and immediate enough to reinforce the desired behavior?
  * Encourage an environment in which group members celebrate each other. 



As the **Ninja** , you can spark Shine in other group members through praise and celebration. You don’t need to be an authority figure to have an important effect.

**Both Ringleaders and Ninjas should try to tailor their praise to the recipient.** As individuals, we respond differently to different types of praise. Some of your group members may respond best to praise based on their personal best (“This is your best sales performance ever!”), while others will feel more Shine following comparisons with others (“You made more sales than anyone else this week!”). Experiment to figure out which types of praise work best for your team members and then draw on this knowledge when giving feedback.

#### 7\. Repeat, refine, and upgrade

As the **Ringleader** , make sure you frame the first time you progress through the Behavior Change steps as the start of a process. This sets up the rest of your group to expect iteration, experimentation, and adjustment rather than a one-time “silver bullet” solution. **Avoid making value judgments and discourage any value judgments from team members.** Explain that if the first try doesn’t work, this isn’t a reflection on the character or self-discipline of the group but an evaluation of the design itself.

As the **Ninja** , you can raise the above points in a more democratic way, working behind the scenes to discourage judgment and encourage experimentation.

### The Feedback Power Zone

The Feedback Power Zone is **the area of greatest impact for any feedback**. For any feedback recipient, this is the overlapping territory between an area that’s very important to them and an area that they’re insecure about.

You can think of this as a Venn diagram, with one circle for important domains and another for domains of insecurity. The overlap between the circles is the Feedback Power Zone.

**Both positive and negative feedback have amplified effects in this zone.** Imagine that your daughter has just had a baby. The baby is crying and she’s trying to comfort it. This is obviously both something that’s important to her and something that’s new and uncertain. Consider the following two pieces of feedback:

  * “You’re doing great! I did exactly the same thing with you when you were that age and you calmed right down.”
  * “Here, hand her over. I know how to make this little one relax.”



The first of these is likely to inspire intense Shine, while the second has the potential to cause serious emotional damage.

**When you know that a particular behavior falls within someone’s Feedback Power Zone, take the opportunity to give feedback** —you may have more power than you realize.

When in doubt, don’t overthink this. Get into the habit of saying something that’s both honest and positive whenever you see someone in their Feedback Power Zone.

### Dolphins, Turtles, Clams, and Crabs: Dealing With Heterogeneous Groups

Each individual in a group has their own personal Action Line for any particular behavior based on their distinctive configuration of motivation and ability. For any particular behavior, we can identify four subgroups based on these motivation/ability combinations.

  * **Dolphins** have high ability and high motivation. 
  * **Turtles** have low ability and high motivation.
  * **Crabs** have high ability and low motivation.
  * **Clams** have low ability and low motivation.



We can plot this in relation to the Action Line as follows.

![tinyhabits-crabsclams.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/tinyhabits-crabsclams.png)

Motivation is difficult to change. Therefore, to encourage a group behavior, **focus on the Dolphins and Turtles**. This can be a revelation for managers or group leaders who’ve been trying to target all four groups at once.

For example, imagine you’re trying to organize a walking challenge at work. You’ve sent out an email (the prompt), but have received few responses. What do you do?

  * You don’t need to worry about the Dolphins—they’ve already replied to the prompt and are preparing enthusiastically for the challenge.
  * Focus on the Turtles. How can you make the behavior easier for them? 
  * Leave the Crabs and the Clams for now. Maybe their motivation levels will increase when they see their colleagues preparing, or maybe they’ll be more motivated to participate in an alternative group event, such as a food drive.



### The Queen B Solution

This is a high-level solution for situations in which it’s not possible to go back and revisit your Swarm of Bs: the behavior itself can’t be changed. The only option is to manipulate motivation.

Consider the walking challenge. If it’s very important to include the Crabs and Clams, **think of some different ways you could increase their motivation**. Can you offer an incentive, such as free sports gear, free movie tickets, or the chance to network with high-ranked managers? Can you link the challenge to a donation to a charity that’s important to your group members?

### Troubleshooting Behaviors in Other People

When trying to change other people’s behavior, our tendency is to focus on motivation first.

Flip this. **Use the following sequence to troubleshoot behaviors in others.**

  1. Check the prompt. Ask them: Do you have an adequate reminder?
  2. If the behavior doesn’t change, check ability. Ask them: What’s making this difficult for you?
  3. If the behavior still doesn’t change, consider motivation. Explain why the behavior is important. Consider introducing rewards or punishments (if appropriate).

For example, your employees consistently arrive late to a meeting.

  4. Check the prompt: Do they have an appropriately timed reminder? If not, set up automatic reminders, or remind them yourself.

  5. Check ability: What is making it difficult for them to arrive on time? Do they have another meeting scheduled immediately beforehand? If so, shift the meeting to a different timeslot.
  6. Check motivation: Is there something unappealing about the meeting itself? Consider tailored ways to increase motivation.



### Changing the World, Step by Step

The principles discussed in this book can be an entry point into complex, large-scale problems.

Our own small changes ripple out to affect others in positive ways. Positive behaviors implemented by groups can have truly far-reaching effects. Tiny Habits is about creating our future one tiny step at a time.

Through Tiny Habits, we can skillfully intervene in the vicious cycles that characterize many of the world’s thorniest problems.

> **Example: Rachel and Managing ADHD**
> 
> You met Amy (of the Post-it note Tiny Habit) in Chapter 3. Amy acted as Ringleader in designing changes for her daughter Rachel. Rachel, in fourth grade at the time, had been diagnosed with ADHD and was beginning to fall behind in school. Rachel was very intelligent, but she had difficulties with time management and getting herself to concentrate.
> 
> Amy decided to use Tiny Habits to try and get Rachel back on track. First, she talked to Rachel about her aspirations. While Rachel didn’t care about getting good grades or pleasing the teacher, she did care when Amy said that she might have to repeat fourth grade. Amy put the outcome “Keeping up with my friends at school” in a circle, and together they brainstormed a Swarm of Behaviors. They created some Tiny Habit recipes to integrate homework into Rachel’s afternoon routine, being sure to celebrate immediately with trampoline jumping, stickers, and exuberant dances each time Rachel completed the habit. One especially effective time management habit was as follows: _After I hang up my backpack, I will see what homework I have and write down an estimate of how much time it will take._ Over time and through discussions with Amy, Rachel became more accurate at estimating her homework time, and this Tiny Habit became something she executed by herself.
> 
> The skills that Rachel gained using this habit as a starting point led to her coming out of special education into mainstream classes, eventually taking advanced placement classes and graduating with honors.

> **Example: Mike, Chris, and the Coffee Filter**
> 
> Mike acted as a Ninja for his 21-year-old son Chris. Chris had been a smart kid, but at 21 he was still living with his parents, and he couldn’t get on top of basic life skills like paying his bills and tidying up. He didn’t make an effort to get on with Mike, his mother Carla (Mike’s wife), or his little brother. The friction between Chris and the other family members made for a tense atmosphere at home and began to affect the relationship between Mike and Carla.
> 
> Mike attended one of Fogg’s Behavior Change Boot Camps for work purposes, but he soon realized that he could apply the techniques to help Chris. Starting with Chris’s failure to clean the coffee filter after use, which was a constant problem between them, Mike switched his focus from trying to motivate Chris to working with the Ability and Prompt dimensions. He broke down the process of cleaning the coffee filter into three parts: taking out the filter, rinsing it, and putting it back.
> 
> First, Mike asked Chris to take the filter out and leave it on the counter. Chris did this and Mike thanked him sincerely. After a few weeks, he asked Chris to start rinsing the filter after he had taken it out. The next time Mike went into the kitchen, he didn’t see the filter on the bench and thought Chris must have reverted to his old habits. Then he looked inside the coffee maker and saw that Chris had completed the third step, putting back the filter, without being asked.
> 
> The progress here and the good feelings it evoked helped Chris to develop more Tiny Habits. This vastly improved the family dynamic, and the approach helped Chris to start getting on top of some of his other problems.
