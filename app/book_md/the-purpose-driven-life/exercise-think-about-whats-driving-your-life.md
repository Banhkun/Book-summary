## Exercise: Think About What’s Driving Your Life

If your life feels as if it lacks meaning or direction, it could be that you’re being driven by the wrong motivations.

* * *

What are some indicators that tell you that your life isn’t being driven by the right motivators? (For example, “I always feel tense, as if there’s something I _should_ be doing, but I don’t know what it is.”)

What do you think is the main motivator driving your life? (For example, “I think that I’m driven by approval-seeking and pressure to be the best at work—I always feel that I should be doing _more_ somehow, to stand out or get recognition.”)

How do you think living a purpose driven life will help you feel meaning? (For example, “Instead of needing to feel good at everything or please everyone, I can finally focus in _one_ direction—pleasing God and doing what I’m made to do. I’ll stop feeling tense about unimportant things I ‘should’ do.”)
