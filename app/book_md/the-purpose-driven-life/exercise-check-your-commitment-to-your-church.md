## Exercise: Check Your Commitment to Your Church

You build meaningful relationships with the members of your spiritual family when you’re a _member_ of your church, not a _spectator_.

* * *

Would you consider yourself a member or spectator at your church? Explain why. (For example, you consider yourself a spectator because you regularly go to church and attend the after-service coffee hour, but you don’t interact with your church during the week,)

What can you do to become more involved with your church? (For example, you might volunteer to teach Sunday school or serve as an usher during services.)

How can you encourage someone else to become more involved in your church? (For example, you introduce yourself to newcomers and make a point to invite them to events.)
