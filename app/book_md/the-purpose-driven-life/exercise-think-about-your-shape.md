## Exercise: Think About Your SHAPE

The best ministry uses your abilities and spiritual gifts in a way that aligns with your heart and personality and is supported by your experiences.

* * *

List your abilities and gifts, remembering that no ability is insignificant. (For example, you might be good at cooking, public speaking, letter-writing, and sewing.)

Think about your heart—what activities make you feel fulfilled, or make you completely lose track of time? (For example, any day that you spend on yard work feels like a “good day,” or you lose track of time when you’re trying new baking techniques.)

Describe your personality, within the context of work you might do for and with others. (For example, you might describe yourself as someone who’s extroverted and doesn’t like structure, but likes working as part of a team.)

What unique experiences do you think have taught you valuable lessons to teach others? (For example, you had a very good boss who taught you how to effectively manage teams, or you had a painful experience that prepared you to help others dealing with grief.)
