## 1-Page Summary

At some point, you’ve likely asked yourself about the meaning of your life and what you were put on earth to do. **The answer from a Christian perspective is at once simple and complex: God created you to fulfill the purposes he’s planned for you.**

(Shortform note: Pastor Rick Warren wrote _The Purpose Driven Life_ as a 42-day Bible study journey to help you find your purposes and learn how to fulfill them. In this summary, we’ve grouped the elements of the journey into six weekly themes to add clarity and reduce repetition.)

### Six Reasons to Live for God’s Purposes (Week 1)

There are six reasons to accept God’s purposes for your life and work to fulfill them.

**Reason 1: It’s not about you.** Many people guess at the meaning of their lives and speculate that they’re meant to fulfill their own purposes. However, the Bible reveals that your life’s meaning isn’t actually about _you_. Everything in your life—your significance, identity, and purpose—traces back to God. Your life isn’t about fulfilling _your_ purposes, but _his._

**Reason 2: You’re here for a reason.** God planned your life and designed you perfectly to fulfill his purposes. _Every aspect of your life_ —including your physical features, personality, parents, and so on—is a gift. You can’t repay God for all he’s given you, but you can express your gratitude by putting God and his purposes at the center of your life.

**Reason 3: Being driven by purpose creates peace.** Everyone’s driven by different motivations— _external_ factors like problems or pressure, _emotional_ factors like anxiety or fear, or _moral_ factors like values and beliefs. The wrong motivations, such as guilt or materialism, destroy the possibility of peace in your life because you’ll always feel anxious, unsure, or “not enough.” On the other hand, being driven by God’s purposes creates peace, in several ways:

  * Your life is simplified—all you _must_ do in life is fulfill your clearly defined purposes. 
  * Rather than being spread among too many goals or ideas, your energy becomes solely purpose-focused—making you more effective in what you do.
  * Clear purposes add motivation and hope to your everyday work because it feels like you’re working _for_ something. 



**Reason 4: There is life beyond this.** The Bible explains that after this life, God’s children who have served him can look forward to a life in eternity. Purpose driven living ensures that you’ll receive the promise of this eternal life. ****

**Reason 5: Life is a test and a responsibility.** Accepting God’s purpose allows you to reframe the way you see your life.

  * God will give you conflicts, changes, and success to challenge your faith, your character, your love, and so on. Knowing that your struggles are _tests_ gives them meaning. 
  * Everything you have—including your talents, the natural world, your relationships, and so on—are gifts _entrusted_ to you by God, and you’re expected to take care of them. This knowledge lends a profound sense of duty to your life.



**Reason 6: Everything is by and for God.** Everything in the universe was made by God to demonstrate his glory—that is, his essence, presence, power, and love.__ There’s no possible way for us to _enhance_ God’s glory—it’s the most powerful, complete thing in the universe. Instead, we express our gratitude for all that God has given us by _showing_ his glory.

**You show his glory each time you fulfill one of the five purposes he assigned you: worship, unselfish fellowship, spiritual maturity, your ministry, and your mission.**

### Purpose #1: Worship (Week 2)

Your first purpose is _worship_ —bringing pleasure to God.**** Worship doesn’t only happen when you’re in church.**It’s a _lifestyle_ that centers on making God happy. **

#### What Makes True Worship?

Before thinking about ways that you might worship God, ensure that the acts you engage in are _true_ worship. True worship has four elements:

**1) Accuracy:** Be sure you’re not worshipping an image of God that you came up with yourself—in that case, you’re worshipping your own imagination or opinion. Instead, worship whom you _know God to be_ by the truths outlined in Scripture. For example, “I think of God as someone who’d be understanding about _some_ sins,” is false worship. On the other hand, “I worship God, who is just,” is true worship.

**2) Authenticity:** Worship that’s emotionless or insincere doesn’t please God. He wants you to express your worship with passion and authenticity. Many people think they _should_ engage in traditional worship, but this leads to many believers just going through the motions. Instead, show your love for God in a way that feels good to you—the Bible suggests varied forms of worship including song, dance, confession, playing instruments, and shouting.

**3) Thoughtfulness:** Engage your mind meaningfully with your worship by looking for new and interesting ways to praise God such as:

  * Reading different translations of the Bible, or finding synonyms for overused words. 
  * Being _specific_ with your praises, instead of generalizing your thanks. For example, “I thank you for the interesting conversation I had with my neighbor today.” 



**4) Presence** : As long as you’re living on earth, your spirit and body can only be in one place at once. God wants you to plan around and show up physically for worship instead of sticking to your own schedule and using an easy cop-out such as, “I’ll be there in spirit!”

#### Five Everyday Acts of Worship

There are five acts of worship that—when practiced genuinely—make God happy.

##### Act #1: Love Him Absolutely

**God’s greatest desire is for you to love him in the same way that he loves you.** You should think of him as your closest, most loyal friend—you’re in regular contact, know all about one another, and trust him completely.

  * To deepen your friendship with God, include him in everything you do by having ongoing conversations with him in your mind and meditating on his Word as you go about your day. When talking to him, commit to total honesty—voicing your displeasure with him when it arises. 



##### Act #2 and Act #3: Trust and Obey Him Completely

**God wants you to trust and obey him _completely._** This can be difficult, as you may think that you know what’s best for you, but remember that God has known you since before your birth. He knows best and feels happiest when you demonstrate your absolute faith in him. You know your trust and obedience are complete when:

  * You do _exactly_ what’s asked of you. You don’t neglect any part of God’s instruction, and you do it precisely in the manner he wants. 
  * You trust and obey _without hesitation._ You don’t question God or deliberate about what to do—you act first and then reflect. Often, you’ll find that there was no way to understand God’s instructions until you did as he asked.



##### Act #4: Thank Him Regularly

Regularly express your gratitude with authenticity and accuracy—throughout your day, thank God for _who_ _he is_ and thank him for specific gifts or opportunities he’s granted you. For example, you might express gratitude for specific miracles described in the Bible, or start your morning by telling him a list of the small joys of your life you’re grateful for.

##### Act #5: Use Your Abilities Earnestly

Every time God sees his creations doing what he designed them to do, he feels pleasure. _Everything_ you do can be an act of worship, as long as you’re doing it with an attitude of praise. For example, going for a jog can be an act of worship if you remind yourself, “I’m grateful that God gave me the ability to use my body in this way.”

### Purpose #2: Unselfish Fellowship (Week 3)

**The second purpose of your life is unselfishly loving fellow members of God’s family.** God created us to be part of a spiritual family that dedicates itself to loving and honoring him—as a believer, you’re not only his child but a sibling to all other past, present, and future believers. **In loving your spiritual family, you’ll learn the essential skill of _unselfish loving_. **Unselfish loving __ means loving others, even when it’s difficult to do so—such as when they’re being rude, it’s inconvenient for you, or they need too much from you.

#### Get to Know Your Spiritual Family

**Being a member of your church is important because your church will serve as your support system through the hard work of fulfilling your purposes.** Take the step beyond _attending_ church and start to get _involved_ in it by getting to know the other members, showing love to them, and finding your role within your spiritual family.

##### The Vital Experiences of Fellowship

When you become involved with your spiritual family, you _experience life with them.**Experiencing life together—the good and the bad—is called fellowship.**_ Fellowship is best practiced as a small group within your church, because everyone has the chance to speak up, be heard, and meaningfully support one another. In these small groups, you can experience _genuine fellowship_ , which grants you four vital experiences that enhance your spiritual growth and understanding of unselfish love.

  1. **Mutuality:** In a fellowship committed to mutuality, members take care of one another, reciprocate what they receive, and take on equal responsibilities. They can fully depend on one another to have their needs—physical, emotional, and spiritual—met. 
  2. **Authenticity:** In an authentic fellowship, you’re free to be fully honest about your failures, confess your weaknesses, ask for help, and discuss your doubts. The more you open up about your life, the more other group members are willing to open up about theirs. This creates a fellowship of holistic support, where _all_ struggles are addressed. 
  3. **Sympathy:** A sympathetic fellowship responds to members’ suffering by entering into their pain _with_ them to help carry the burden and validate their emotions. This _fellowship of suffering_ is the deepest level of fellowship you can offer someone, because turning toward someone’s pain, not away, is a profound act of unselfish love. 
  4. **Forgiveness:** Genuine fellowship forgives and moves on quickly.**** Sometimes you’ll hurt the people in your fellowship or you’ll be hurt by them, but a genuine fellowship will never use your mistakes against you. 



#### Build and Maintain a Healthy Fellowship Community

It takes a lot of work to build a healthy, loving fellowship, but God reveals how to do so through his Word—there are five elements that every healthy fellowship community needs:

  1. **Honesty:** Members tell hard truths and speak to one another _directly_ but lovingly, as they would a member of their family.**** This type of honesty allows group members to work through issues instead of hiding them or diminishing them—actions that can create underlying frustration or hurt in the group, eventually causing it to crumble. 
  2. **Humility:** Humility is essential in a fellowship group because it opens you up to asking for help, and helps you relate to others’ experiences instead of looking down on them. 
  3. **Courtesy:** Being courteous of others means being considerate of their feelings, respectful of their differences, and exercising patience. This is especially important with members you find “difficult.” When you try to _better understand_ these people with patience, you may find there’s a reason for their “difficulty” like insecurity or trauma. It’s easier to show unselfish love toward people once you _really_ get to know them. 
  4. **Trust:** Your group not only has a duty to deal with any issues that a member brings up but also to understand that these issues are shared in confidence—no one outside your group should find out about them. 
  5. **Regularity:** Deep, meaningful relationships happen between people who meet frequently. Your meetings shouldn’t be organized around _convenience_ —this makes it all too easy for urgent, unimportant matters to get in the way. 



### Purpose #3: Spiritual Maturity (Week 4)

The third purpose of your life is to become more like Jesus by taking on his values and character. **This spiritually mature character is _already in you_ but hasn't been shaped yet.**

#### God’s Character Development Tools

God uses four tools to help shape your spiritually mature character.

##### Tool #1: His Word

God’s Word should take high priority in your life, as it contains the truths that guide you in fulfilling your purposes. There are three activities that help you internalize and live by his Word:

  * **Accept the authority of his Word.** God’s word is an unfailingly reliable standard.**** When making decisions or examining your behavior, always ask yourself: “What does the Bible tell me to do?” Whatever God’s Word instructs, you must do with full faith in his authority.
  * **Fill your mind with his Word.** Living by God’s Word becomes easier when it’s always ready to use in your mind. To do this, read the Bible regularly, memorize Scripture, and engage with the text by writing down your questions and observations. 
  * **Apply the lessons of his Word.** Each time you read and study God’s Word, think about the lesson in it. Then, create a practical plan to use the lesson in your life. For example, if you read the story of the Good Samaritan, you might make a plan to help someone you don’t know within the next week. 



##### Tool #2: People

God wants you to grow _with_ others, for two reasons.

  1. Other people serve as a support system: They encourage you to make the right choices, help you understand God’s Word in new ways, and share ideas for implementing his lessons in your life. 
  2. Other people are imperfect: When others irritate you or challenge your patience, you face a test of character—will you choose to act like Jesus? Every time you respond with patience and unselfish love in these moments, your character becomes more Christlike. 



##### Tool #3: Circumstances

If you always lived in your comfort zone, you would never learn about enduring pain, taking on seemingly insurmountable challenges, or stretching the limits of your faith. **God puts difficult circumstances in your way because they strengthen your character,_but only if you respond as Jesus would_** —that is, you remember that God is acting in your best interest, you give thanks for the opportunity to grow, and you keep pushing through your circumstances instead of giving up or turning away from God.

##### Tool #4: Temptation

God will put you in situations where you’ll want to act in _direct opposition_ to the qualities Jesus possessed, such as love, patience, faithfulness, and self-control. When you make the choice to stick to Jesus-like qualities in these situations, you strengthen your character. **The _choice_ in these situations is crucial, because your character is like a muscle—it needs resistance to develop and strengthen. **

  * For example, you don’t develop your integrity while taking an exam in a supervised setting, as there’s no opportunity for you to cheat. You _do_ develop your integrity when you’re trusted to take an unsupervised exam and have the opportunity to check your answers against your textbook but choose not to cheat. 



### Purpose #4: Your Ministry (Week 5)

**God wants you to _serve others_ —this is called ministry, the fourth purpose for your life. **The way God planned for you to serve others is _uniquely yours._

#### Discover Your Unique SHAPE

Start figuring out the ministry you were made for by examining your SHAPE:

  * **_S_ piritual gifts: **Your spiritual gifts are capabilities that are gifted to you by God __ when you become a believer. Your spiritual gifts are not for your personal enjoyment—they are given to you to be used in your ministry. 
  * **_H_ eart: **Your heart includes everything you truly care about and what motivates or inspires you—dreams, goals, sources of joy, and so on. God gave you these particular interests to drive you toward the place you’ll best serve. You know that you’re doing something from your heart if you’re _enthusiastic_ about it and are _effective_ in it. 
  * **_A_ bilities:** Abilities are things you’re naturally good at. They differ from spiritual gifts in that you’re born with them, and they were given to you for your _personal enjoyment_. God gives _everyone_ abilities—if you think that you don’t have any, examine yourself more closely. No ability is insignificant. The Bible lists many different skills as “abilities,” including teaching, art, baking, farming, and making music. 
  * **_P_ ersonality: **The type of service that best suits you depends heavily on what kind of person you are—there’s not a “wrong” or “right” way to serve, but there _is_ the possibility of a service-personality mismatch. While you’re figuring out your ministry, you might _observe_ the work of others, but be careful not to _replicate_ their work, as it’s suited to their personality.
  * **_E_ xperiences:** God introduced all sorts of experiences into your life to shape who you’ve become and help you serve others, such as your experiences growing up within your family, different job experiences, and painful experiences. Your painful experiences are generally the most helpful to your service, because they teach you empathy and make you more effective in helping others through suffering or pain.



##### Put Your SHAPE Together

**The _best_ ministry uses your whole SHAPE—you use your abilities and spiritual gifts in a way that aligns with your heart and personality, and is supported by your experiences.** Ask yourself what abilities align best with who you are, what you love to do, and what you know.

#### Develop Your Servant’s Heart

Finding your unique ministry is the first __ vital part of serving others—the second is developing your _servant’s heart,_ which allows you to serve unselfishly in whatever way God calls you. Your servant's heart is made up of your _character_ and _attitude_.

  * Someone with a servant’s character makes themselves available to serve _whenever_ it’s needed; sees things that need to be done without being asked; dedicates themselves fully to _all_ their tasks; is reliable; and doesn't expect praise for their work. 
  * Someone with a servant’s attitude always puts others’ needs first; recognizes that everything they have is a gift to be temporarily taken care of; doesn’t compete with others or compare ministries; doesn’t feel that any task is “beneath” them; and sees their ministry as an opportunity to express gratitude to God for all he’s given them. 



### Purpose #5: Your Mission (Week 6)

Whereas your _ministry_ is how you serve other believers, your _mission_ is your service to unbelievers. God wants you to spread word of his love, his glory, and the promise of eternal life to unbelievers, through your unique mission and a shared mission.

#### Your Unique Mission: Your Life Message

Your story of your experience with God helps you explain the benefits of joining his family to unbelievers. Your message has four main parts:

**1) Personal testimony.** Your testimony reveals how God has made a difference in your life. This is a valuable tool for connection—you come across as a peer rather than an authority figure trying to “sell” God’s Word. Your testimony should touch on how you felt about your life before you discovered your purpose, when you realized you needed God, the difference you’ve felt in purpose driven living, and how you’ve felt God’s power and love in your life.

**2) Lessons you’ve learned.** Explain what you’ve learned from your life experiences. This demonstrates that everything has _meaning_. This is especially helpful when talking to someone who doesn’t know how to find lessons in her experiences yet.

**3) Your passions.** God will give you a passion for something he cares deeply about so that you’ll be compelled to speak about it to others and find a way to make a difference with it. For example, you may feel passionate about a _cause_ such as the environment, a _group of people without a voice_ such as wrongfully convicted prisoners, or _bringing his Word to specific groups_ such as college students.

**4) The Good News.** The last part of your life message is your explanation of the gifts that come along with trusting and obeying God, such as a deep sense of meaning, unselfish love, forgiveness of our sins, and the promise of eternal life.

#### Your Shared Mission: Represent Christianity Everywhere

You and all Christians share the mission of spreading the word about God all over the world—just as Jesus did. Like him, share what you know about God throughout your life, to everyone you can. Make sure you’re not missing out on your mission because of a purpose-blocking mindset, such as:

  * **“I’ll spread the news my way.”** Put others’ needs first—in speaking to unbelievers, think about what _they_ need from _you_ in their spiritual journey, not the other way around. Imagine the person you’re speaking to says, “All that Bible stuff isn’t for me.” You personally think Scripture is the best way to talk about your faith, but _their need_ is a less Scripture-based approach. You respond, “I understand. How about I tell you about my personal experience of finding meaning instead?”
  * **“I would, but…”** Don’t let excuses deter you from answering the call to spread God’s Word. There are many available excuses, such as, “I don’t speak any other languages,” or “I’m not able to travel.” You can _always_ find a way to fulfill your mission—you might join a trip to a country that speaks your native language or spread the word about God right in your hometown by connecting with new communities.
  * **“God hasn’t told me I’m ‘ready’ yet.”** No use waiting—God’s Word has _already told us_ , numerous times, that we’re called to spread the Good News and show his glory. 



### Conclusion: Keep It All in Balance

There are four ways you can maintain balance among your purposes throughout your life.

  * **Accountability partners:** Engage in regular discussion with others about your purposes—you’ll gain a better understanding of your purposes, get new ideas for fulfilling them, and strengthen your faith.**Look around you—a good support system probably already exists in your community.** For example, you might ask your fellowship group to act as your accountability partners or meet up monthly with a friend who’s on the same spiritual journey as you.****
  * **Spiritual check-ins:** Every now and then, check in on your spiritual health and honestly evaluate how you feel you’re doing in the areas of worship, fellowship, character growth, ministry, and your mission. During this check-in, ask yourself questions such as: “Are there areas of my life where I’m holding back from surrendering to God?” or “Am I being as honest and patient in fellowship as I’d want others to be toward me?”
  * **Journaling:** Journaling is useful both for tracking your progress and growth and for spotting areas for improvement. Schedule a regular time to write about what you did during the week, including the lessons you learned from your experiences and how your actions helped fulfill your purposes. 
  * **Modeling purpose driven living:** Share what you know about purpose driven living with others. This isn’t just _telling_ others what to do—be a living demonstration of what it’s all about.**** When others are looking to you as an example, you’ll naturally be more careful to uphold your work in _all_ your purposes.
