## Exercise: Recognize the Holy Spirit’s Power in Your Life

The Holy Spirit’s power doesn’t come to you in grand moments—it appears in small moments where you _choose the right thing to do_.

* * *

Describe a situation in which you felt weak or afraid, and doing the right thing felt impossible. (For example, you struggle with a gambling addiction. When you got your last paycheck, the temptation to spend it on the slots made you feel powerless.)

What was the “right thing” that you _chose_ to do? (For example, you chose to take your paycheck right to the bank and deposit it in your savings, so you couldn’t touch it.)

How did you feel the Holy Spirit’s power supporting you after you made this choice? (For example, once you made the decision to deposit the check you felt excited and sure of yourself—you went straight to the bank with no hesitation.)

How do you think this situation developed your Christlike character? (For example, you were tempted to act selfishly and without self-control, but by resisting the temptation you made the choice to act as Jesus would.)
