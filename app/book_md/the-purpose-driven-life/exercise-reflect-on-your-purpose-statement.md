## Exercise: Reflect on Your Purpose Statement

Create a written purpose statement that you can easily refer to when you feel that your purposes aren’t at the center of your life.

* * *

What are your indicators that God isn’t at the center of your life? (For example, you notice that you start to feel anxious about what other people think about you, or feel inexplicably restless.)

How can you maintain harmony and unity within your spiritual family? (For example, you commit to facing conflict rather than turning away and trying to learn about people who irritate you.)

How do you plan to use your SHAPE to serve others? (For example, your love of cooking and working with others led you to find working in your church’s soup kitchen as your ministry.)

What are the most important lessons God has given you to share with others in your mission? (For example, you spent much of your adult life as an unbeliever. As a result, you can clearly articulate how life _before_ finding God differs from life _after_ finding God.)

Write down the short, memorable slogan that will help you keep your purposes in mind. It should touch all five purposes—worship, unselfish fellowship, spiritual maturity, ministry, and mission. (For example, “My purpose in this life is to thank God and talk to him as much as I can, bring my most authentic and loving self to my church, always choose to do what Jesus would do, serve others in a way that feels _right_ to me, and share what I know about God with everyone.”)
