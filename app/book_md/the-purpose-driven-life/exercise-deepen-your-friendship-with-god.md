## Exercise: Deepen Your Friendship With God

God’s greatest desire is that you become close to him as you would a trusted friend—make sure you’re dedicating time to deepening that relationship.

* * *

What is an everyday event that you could make into an act of worship by including God? (For example, you might discuss the upcoming day with him over your morning coffee, or unpack your day with him on your drive home after work.)

What is something unpleasant that you can commit to being more honest with God about? (For example, you’re angry that you didn’t get a promotion you wanted, or you feel that your chronic illness is unfair.)

Reflect on the time you dedicate to your friendship with God. What unimportant things have you allowed to get in the way? (For example, you didn’t take any time to talk to him during the week, or you questioned something he called you to do such as forgiving someone’s wrongdoing.)

How can you commit to being a better friend to God in the near future? (For example, you write reminders of his presence on sticky notes and put them in visible places so you remember to include him, or you commit to voicing your displeasure more frequently.)
