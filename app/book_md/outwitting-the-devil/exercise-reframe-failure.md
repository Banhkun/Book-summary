## Exercise: Reframe Failure

As Hill tells us, everyone experiences failure. What separates a successful person from an unsuccessful person is their ability to take that failure in stride, and apply the lessons learned from it towards achieving their goals.

* * *

Think back to a failure you’ve experienced in your life—a failed assignment, a missed job opportunity, a personal falling out, a lost game, etc. What happened? How did you feel? How did you choose to respond?

Looking back at this failure now, what lessons could you take away from what happened?

What lessons _did_ you take away from it in the moment, and how did your overall approach to the assignment, job, relationship or hobby change? If you could do it over, would you react differently?
