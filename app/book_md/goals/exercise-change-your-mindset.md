## Exercise: Change Your Mindset

Prior to setting goals, Tracy says that you should get into the right mindset.

* * *

Take responsibility: Describe a time when you blamed your failure on external factors. What could _you_ have done differently to prevent the failure?

Clarify your values: Describe a difficult choice that you made in the past. What values does this choice reflect?

Reject self-limiting beliefs: Think of a belief about yourself that keeps you from achieving your goals (for example, you believe that you’re not good at networking). What would you do differently if you didn’t have this belief?
