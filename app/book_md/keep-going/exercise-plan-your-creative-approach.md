## Exercise: Plan Your Creative Approach

Plan out how you’ll use Kleon’s suggestions in your approach to creative work.

* * *

What do you love about the process of making creative work? How can you focus on this aspect of creativity? (For example, if you’re an actor and love making new discoveries about your character, you might take extra time to sit down with your script and read it closely.)

What are your daily rituals when you want to be creative? If you don’t have any, then what small actions can you take to get yourself in the moment? (For example, you might start your day off with a short walk.)

Do you spend much time around people with vastly different worldviews or life experiences? If not, how can you find new, alternative opinions in a positive way? (For example: If you aren’t religious, you could try attending a church service and meeting new people there.)
