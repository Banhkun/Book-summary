## Chapter 3: Put Intense Pressure on Yourself

You now understand why always pushing hard to improve is necessary for an Unstoppable need to succeed. Now, we’ll explore Grover’s second principle: To develop an Unstoppable need to succeed, you must **constantly put intense pressure on yourself**.**** In this chapter, we’ll look at Grover’s explanation for**** how putting pressure on yourself makes you consistently relentless, as well as**** how**** to apply this pressure productively to help you succeed.

### How Pressure Makes You Consistently Relentless

Grover agrees with the commonly observed phenomenon that **people perform better under pressure** and that being under pressure**** forces us to find ways to rise to whatever challenge we’re facing. In other words, constant pressure forces you to be constantly relentless—putting in everything you have to overcome obstacles and succeed.

(Shortform note: While many psychologists agree that pressure under certain circumstances will improve performance, it’s often in the context of short-term high-stress situations like a basketball game. However, in a longer-term context or in a field that doesn’t require immediate and precise action, psychologists disagree with Grover on the benefits of pressure. For example, one study found that increased pressure correlated with worse performance in math students. This research suggests that the extent to which pressure will benefit you is dependent on what your discipline requires.)

Constant pressure**** allows you to**** avoid fear of failure and self-doubt**** in two different ways:

  1. Constantly putting yourself under pressure gives you lots of practice managing the fear and stress that comes with it, so you’ll improve at managing these feelings.****
  2. Internal pressure makes _external_ pressure easier to handle. Others depending on you or having high expectations of you won’t cause fear or panic because **the pressure they put on you can’t be any more intense than the pressure you put on yourself.**



(Shortform note: Psychological research agrees with Grover’s argument that using stress as a tool helps you succeed, and suggests that, beyond helping you avoid fear of failure, it also benefits your mental and physical health. One study found that those who think of stress as a positive, motivating force focused less on negative emotion and had less cardiovascular stress.)

### How to Productively Pressure Yourself

While pressure can help keep you relentless, Grover warns that you need to recognize the difference between productive and unproductive pressure.**** Pressure from your drive to succeed will help you stay relentless, while pressure from something like forgetting to do your work comes from a lack of commitment, and therefore doesn’t help you stay relentless.

(Shortform note: In addition to pressure from a lack of commitment, Sian Beilock (_Choke_) identifies another source of pressure that’s often unproductive: support from others. You might expect that support would inspire you to succeed, but Beilock argues that a supportive audience makes us pay more attention to the fact that others are watching us. This additional self-consciousness leads to worry and self-doubt, negatively impacting your performance.)

Grover suggests two ways that you can consistently put yourself in situations of productive pressure: leading others and reframing your successes.****

#### Lead Others

When you’re Unstoppable, others will naturally see you as a leader—Grover notes that this is a great source of productive pressure. That’s because doing everything you can to succeed often requires using this leadership role to make sure the people around you perform at their highest possible level as well.

This leadership role also adds the pressure of needing to accept responsibility and blame if things go wrong—**being at the top means that no one else is capable of picking up your slack if you fall short.** If you make a mistake or lose your mental composure, it’ll negatively affect the people around you as well. Because everything falls on you in this way, you’ll also feel the pressure of having to make sure things don’t go wrong again (part of your constant search for improvement).

(Shortform note: Marshall Goldsmith (_What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_) agrees with Grover that leaders should accept responsibility when things go wrong, but his reasoning differs from Grover’s: While Grover argues that you should accept blame to put pressure on yourself, Goldsmith claims that you should accept blame because it’ll earn you the trust and respect of your followers. He says accepting blame earns you trust and respect because it shows your followers that you have integrity, courage, and modesty.)

#### Reframe Success

The second way you can put more pressure on yourself is by changing the way you think about success. Instead of viewing it as an excuse to relax, **success should increase the pressure you put on yourself.** The principle of constantly seeking improvement means that each success is merely a step on your path towards Unstoppable dominance in your field—not the destination. After each success, you'll have to set your sights on the next, _larger_ success instead of relaxing.

(Shortform note: Grant Cardone recommends a similar reframing of success in _The 10X Rule_ , but he takes his argument further than Grover by claiming a one-time achievement shouldn’t even be called success—real success is only gained through many accomplishments over a long period of time. By adopting Cardone’s mindset, you might make it easier to frame one-time accomplishments as single steps on a journey to success, allowing you to keep up pressure on yourself.)
