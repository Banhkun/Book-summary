## Part 1: Defining Relentlessness | Chapter 1: What Relentlessness Is and Isn’t

In _Relentless_ , author Tim Grover explains the qualities you’ll need to become the best in your field—qualities which he collectively calls “relentlessness.” He came up with these qualities by learning from his own personal training career, training and getting to know some of the all-time great basketball players. Grover argues that by acting relentlessly, you can become an all-time great yourself no matter what your career, field, or discipline is.

This guide will explore relentlessness in three parts:

  * **Part 1: Defining Relentlessness** defines relentlessness by examining what it is and what it isn’t. We’ll then explain why a lack of relentlessness impacts a person’s ability to succeed.
  * **Part 2: The Unstoppable Need to Succeed** explains the first of the two main relentless qualities, and explores how constantly pushing yourself as hard as you can to succeed by any means necessary. 
  * **Part 3: The Unstoppable Control Their Instincts** explains the second of the two main relentless qualities, and outlines how to train yourself to use your animal instincts constructively in your field.



### What Relentlessness Is

Grover defines “relentlessness” as a state of mind in which you’re**fully dedicated to becoming stronger, surviving, and overcoming obstacles to achieve your goals.** Being relentless, Grover asserts, is how you can become _the_ best at what you do and succeed time and time again. He references his own experience training basketball legends like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant, highlighting them as examples of the kind of field dominance that relentlessness can lead to. However, Grover explains, relentlessness isn’t just for a select few elite athletes—it’s universal.

(Shortform note: In some ways, relentlessness is similar to what psychologists call “conscientiousness,” the ability to make and work towards goals consistently while delaying gratification and overcoming obstacles. However, there’s one major difference between the two—their approach to impulsivity: While conscientious people plan ahead so they can avoid impulsive behavior, relentless people rely on impulsive behavior to help them succeed (which we’ll explore in Part 3).)

#### Relentlessness Is Universal

Grover explains that anyone can be relentless in pursuing any task or discipline—relationships, your job, an art form, and so on. This is because **relentlessness isn’t about what you do, but about how you approach what you do**.

In addition, he says that anyone can be relentless because relentlessness is natural and instinctual.**_All_** animals, even humans, are born with an instinctual drive to overcome obstacles and survive by any means necessary—in other words, we’re born with relentlessness and just need to learn how to access it.

> **How Much Does Evolution Inspire Behavior?**
> 
> Grover’s argument here—that relentlessness is instinctual—is similar to that of “evolutionary psychology”: A framework that argues that human behavior is heavily influenced by instincts gained through evolution. However, scientists and scholars heavily debate the merits of evolutionary psychology. Its main critics tend toward two arguments:
> 
> **1) Learning and changing:** One of the main arguments made against evolutionary psychology comes from evidence that the brain physically changes in response to changes in environment or experiences. These changes would suggest that many behaviors are inspired more by what you learn, rather than what’s hardwired in you.
> 
> **2) Testability:** Another major criticism of evolutionary psychology is that it’s very difficult to test its main hypotheses. Even when researchers observe expected behaviors in studies, it’s difficult to definitively prove that instinct inspired them. Because of these difficulties, many critics argue that evolutionary psychology often relies on common sense principles or observations, rather than testing and research.
> 
> Note that Grover isn’t using this method of psychology to make his arguments—in fact, at one point he argues that science can’t ever explain relentless instincts. However, his ideas are similar enough to those used by evolutionary psychologists that these criticisms are still worth considering.

### What Relentlessness Is Not

To help clarify his definition, Grover notes several criteria that you might mistake for relentlessness and explains why they _aren’t_ necessary to a relentless mindset.

#### Raw Talent or Skill

Being talented or skilled isn’t the same as having a relentless mindset. **Just because you’re talented doesn’t mean you’ll use your talent to its full extent** , or that you’ll constantly work to improve. On the other hand, if you lack natural talent, you can _still_ act relentlessly by doing everything you can to overcome that lack.

(Shortform note: Given Grover’s argument here that talent isn’t enough for relentlessness (and the success it brings), you might wonder why people emphasize its importance. Angela Duckworth (_Grit_) explores two reasons why people overrate talent’s role in success. First, when you see others succeed, you only see the _results_ of their hard work and therefore assume their success comes from _natural_ skill. Second, many people overrate talent as a defense mechanism—assuming success comes from innate talent gives you an excuse for not succeeding: “I just wasn’t born talented.”)

#### Fame or Fortune

While you can earn fame and fortune with relentlessness, it shouldn’t be your end goal. Relentlessness means caring about success _itself_ ,**** rather than what success might bring.**** There are plenty of rich and famous people who aren’t relentless, and plenty of relentless people who aren’t rich or famous.

For example, a businessman can be a millionaire from inheritance alone and never put effort into his work, while a teacher can relentlessly do everything possible to help his students succeed and have very little money or fame to show for it.

(Shortform note: Many rich and famous people share Grover’s belief that fame and fortune aren’t the cause of success. A survey found that a large majority of wealthy families worried that their money would reduce their children’s ambition instead of inspiring them to succeed.)

#### Change

When you learn to access your relentlessness, **you don’t change who you are.** Grover repeatedly insists that nobody can change. Rather, he says, pursuing relentlessness means accessing**** the instinctual**** part of yourself that’s existed since birth.

(Shortform note: Research contrasts with Grover’s point here, suggesting that personalities _do_ change, whether it’s because of aging, a major life event, or a concerted effort. This suggests that adopting a new relentless mindset like Grover recommends _would_ change who you are.)

### Defining the “Good”

After defining relentlessness, Grover creates three categories of people defined by how often they act relentlessly:**Rarely or never relentless people are “Good,” people who are relentless in specific circumstances are “Great,” and people who are always relentless are “Unstoppable.”**

In this section, we’ll define what it means to be “Good.” The Good, according to Grover, are rarely or never relentless due to a fear of failure. This fear prevents the Good from fully committing to a task—therefore preventing them from relentlessly pursuing success. Because of this, they can be good at what they do but will never be the best or even great.

(Shortform note: Seth Godin (_Purple Cow_) agrees with Grover that fear of failure prevents success, and offers further explanation as to why this happens. Godin argues that being afraid will hold you back from taking risks—which is essential for success because it helps you stand out from everyone else who’s playing it safe. This makes other people more likely to remember you and offer you opportunities. Therefore, since fear of failure prevents risks it also prevents success.)

Grover offers two ways that fear of failure and lack of commitment prevent the Good from succeeding.

#### 1) The Good Can’t Take Initiative

Fear of failure makes the Good unable to take initiative—even when they know exactly what they _should_ do—because they fear making a mistake if they do. Instead of taking initiative, the Good tend towards two behaviors:

  * **Providing support:** Because they are followers, the Good focus on**** helping and encouraging others to succeed above themselves. This way, they can still be a part of the team without having to step up and face their fear of taking charge.
  * **Mediating conflict:** The Good will**** avoid taking sides**** when a conflict arises because they are afraid of being wrong. Instead, they’ll try to work with both sides to mediate. 



> **The Good Must Focus on Others**
> 
> You might think that Grover is criticizing the ability to support and mediate because he associates them with the Good. However, remember that Grover says you can approach _any_ skill with a relentless mindset—including those two abilities.
> 
>   * As an example, there are careers and organizations available for professional mediators—a profession in which one could pursue conflict resolution relentlessly.
> 

> 
> For clarity, it might help to consider Grover’s explanation of the Good from this perspective: Doing these things doesn’t make you Good— _having_ to do those things does. You can apply this perspective to both examples:
> 
>   * The Good have to provide support because their fear prevents them from taking charge.
> 
>   * The Good have to mediate conflict because they don’t want to take sides for fear of being wrong.
> 
> 


#### 2) The Good Freeze Up Under Pressure

Grover explains that fear of failure also makes the Good freeze up under pressure. Pressure causes the Good to focus on the possibility of failure instead of on what they’re trying to accomplish—in other words, **they’ll freeze up because they overthink what they’re doing.**

For example: A Good dancer is in a competition. They’ve practiced extensively, and have natural talent. However, once they’re about to start, they worry they won’t be able to pull off the backflip at the end of their routine. They try to remember all of the advice their teachers, mentors, and peers gave them about backflips. Now they have a ton of information and self-doubt in their mind taking their focus away from the actual dancing, and their performance suffers.

(Shortform note: Psychologist Sian Beilock agrees with Grover’s argument that overthinking leads to paralysis in _Choke_ , and offers a psychological explanation for why this is true. Beilock argues that once you learn to perform a task, your brain approaches that task without needing to think through each of its individual steps. However, **overthinking makes you go back to consciously thinking through each step** like a beginner would. This shift in approach confuses your brain, causing you to freeze up and fail to perform.)

### Defining the “Great”

One step above the Good, there are the Great—people whom Grover says can be relentless _under specific circumstances_.**** While the Great have more control over their fears and self-doubts than the Good, these fears still plague them from time to time. Grover says that the Great attempt to compensate for their fears with two different methods.****

#### Method #1: Extensive Preparation

The Great can be relentless, but **only in specific situations they have prepared for extensively**. This preparation gives the Great a clear planned approach to the situation, which allows them to avoid overthinking and commit their focus to success. However, if circumstances unexpectedly change, creating a situation that the Great hasn’t prepared for, they’ll experience the same self-doubts and fears that the Good have and freeze up. This is why the Great can only be relentless sometimes—their confidence is situational.

For example: A Great musician doesn’t overthink or freeze up as long as they’ve spent a long time studying the specific pieces they’ll play. However, during a performance the musician loses their place, their confidence shatters, and they freeze up.

(Shortform note: Sian Beilock (_Choke_) explains the science behind why unfamiliar situations cause you to freeze up. When you’re faced with a situation you know well, you experience stimulation in the portions of your brain responsible for the actions associated with that situation. However, in an unfamiliar situation, those parts of the brain aren’t as active because your brain doesn’t _have_ associated actions, and therefore, you can’t respond as quickly. Since the Great only plan for specific situations, it follows that their brains can only respond with immediate action to those specific circumstances.)

#### Method #2: Recognition From Others

Grover argues that the inconsistent confidence of the Great also means that **they crave recognition** —they try to ward off their fear and self-doubt by**** having others acknowledge their successes. However, other people can’t get rid of the Great’s insecurities; truly doing so requires developing Unstoppable confidence and focus.

> **Boost Your Confidence With Self-Validation**
> 
> If this need for recognition is something you struggle with, psychologists recommend developing self-validation: The ability to accept your emotions and experiences, encourage yourself, recognize your strengths, and accept mistakes. By developing self-validation, you’ll judge yourself less harshly when you don’t perform your best and be able to give _yourself_ positive recognition—as a result, you’ll need fewer positive judgments from others.
> 
> One effective way to practice self-validation is to talk about mistakes or underperformance _without inserted judgment_ —that is, talk only about the facts of the event. For example, if you screw up a presentation at work, don’t think, “I’m such a failure and I’ve ruined everything.” That’s a statement grounded in harsh judgment rather than your actual experience. Instead, think, “I feel frustrated because that presentation didn’t go how I wanted it to.” This statement helps you accept that the mistake happened, without discouraging you with harsh and untrue judgments.
