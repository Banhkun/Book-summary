## Exercise: Find Mastery in Your Field

Determine whether or not you have mastery in your specific discipline, and make a plan for how you can work towards or maintain it.

* * *

Are there any skills related to your discipline that you feel that you have a level of mastery in (that is, you can use those skills without consciously thinking about it)?

What situations have you faced in your discipline that required you to consciously think through your actions or the solution? (For example, if you’re a chef, you may have had a new kitchen hire make a mistake that threw the entire staff off their schedule one night.)

What kind of knowledge do you need to prevent those circumstances from surprising you? How can you obtain that knowledge? (For example, you might commit yourself to working with more people new to the field, who are prone to mistakes—this will give you practice in finding quick, creative solutions.)
