## Exercise: Recognize Your Indulgences

Identify what your primal self might want to indulge in, as well as how you might keep those desires in check.

* * *

Identify one of your primal desires, and explain how they help you keep your “pursuing success” instincts sharp. (For example, you might go on lots of dates. The constant practice of flirting with women, making a good impression on them, and getting them to want to go on a date with you is the way you choose to seek and achieve success.)

Make a plan for how often you can indulge that desire without having them negatively impact your life. (For example, “I can go on as many dates as I want every week, as long as it’s not causing any significant impact on my health and I stick to my monthly budget.”)
