## Chapter 7: Access Your Primal Self

Once you’re able to direct your instincts to properly use your knowledge and control your emotions, Grover declares that you must access your primal self: **the person you are when acting entirely through instinct.** Learning to direct your instincts productively is the foundation for this step because it ensures you’ll still relentlessly pursue your goals while acting entirely on impulse. Once you can direct your instincts, accessing your primal self will help you succeed by blocking out all distraction. Blocking out distraction is essential for relentlessness by allowing you to focus and commit yourself entirely to achieving success.

(Shortform note: The primal self Grover speaks about is quite similar to what Sigmund Freud called the Id: the part of your mind dedicated to fulfilling impulses, needs, and desires. Both Grover and Freud recognize that you can harness this part of yourself to accomplish great things. However, they have contrasting beliefs about why you might harness this animal, instinctual part of yourself: Freud believes that impulsive sexual desires motivate all great achievements in society, while Grover claims that a desire for _success in itself_ motivates achievements—in other words, the need to succeed.)

In this chapter, we’ll explain Grover’s recommendations for how to productively access your primal self.

### Indulging Primal Desires Productively

Grover explains that to access your primal self, you must indulge your primal desires: things you impulsively want but keep secret because fears, inhibitions, or society tells you to—things like sex, alcohol, drugs, or gambling. Grover points out that many successful and powerful people practice primal indulgence—this is why so many of them often get caught up in scandals.

(Shortform note: While Grover suggests that impulsively indulging desires leads to success, some psychologists argue that it’s the other way around: Power and success make people become more impulsive and indulgent, often due to their more favorable attitudes toward greed. One study found that people in higher social classes were more likely to display unethical behaviors like breaking traffic rules or taking candy from children.)

Grover explains that primal indulgence has two important roles: It encourages relentlessness, and it encourages instinctual action.

#### Primal Indulgence Encourages Relentlessness

Indulging in primal desires **allows you to find “success” (that is, something to conquer or exert control over) even outside of your discipline,** according to Grover. This way, you won’t get out of practice or lose your commitment to constantly seeking success even while relieving pressure or seeking pleasure.

For example: An Unstoppable politician’s primal desire is sex. At the end of a long day when he needs to release some pressure, he’ll seek sex out as a way to find a conquest and satisfy his need for “success”. This way, he stays relentless by still seeking “success” even after he finishes his job for the day and even while seeking pleasure.

However, Grover also emphasizes that you need to make sure that indulging your primal desires doesn’t take priority over succeeding in your field. If your desires take first priority, you’ll spend too much time and energy on indulgence and won’t be able to relentlessly pursue success in your field.

(Shortform note: While Grover suggests that indulging in your primal desires will help you succeed in other parts of your life, psychological research on impulsive behaviors provides a contrasting viewpoint. One study found that impulsivity correlated with lower levels of academic achievement in college students. This suggests that indulging your desires consistently doesn’t help you succeed and therefore doesn’t contribute to relentlessness.)

#### Primal Indulgence Encourages Acting Instinctively

Because the primal self acts entirely on instinct, indulging primal desires allows you to practice instinctive action even outside of your field. This practice means you can more easily tap into your instincts later on in the area where you want to relentlessly pursue success.

For example: An Unstoppable businessman follows his instincts and indulges his primal desire for drinking. By doing so, he continues acting instinctively even outside of work and has an easier time continuing to act on instinct at work later on.

(Shortform note: Though Grover advises indulging desires to encourage acting on instinct, this behavior resembles medical definitions of addiction. This resemblance would suggest that the more you participate in this cycle of indulgent behavior, the harder it is to control your impulsive desires—potentially to an extreme degree, where it interferes with both your ability to be relentless and your life as a whole.)

### Managing Your Filter

While you need to access your primal self to become Unstoppable, Grover still concedes that you’ll sometimes need to exercise self-control and avoid acting _entirely_ on instinct. You’ll have to put on a “filter”—**a public persona that covers up your primal self in front of the rest of the world.**

He suggests keeping this filter on in two cases: First, it helps in professional settings where dressing and acting in a respectable way will demonstrate the professional and dedicated manner with which you approach your work. Second, it’s vital to keep it on at home—the relaxed and safe environment of home and family does not mix well with the intense drive and instinctive impulses of your primal self.

However, Grover encourages you to remove your filter when you need to tap into your primal self to activate intense focus. To be truly relentless, you can’t care about your inhibitions, and so keeping a filter on would only hold you back and prevent relentlessness.

(Shortform note: Grover’s recommendation to conceal your primal self in different contexts might confuse you—it seems to clash with his earlier suggestion to ignore the judgments of others during your search for success. Following that argument, it isn’t clear why the Unstoppable would care about covering up who they are in front of the rest of the world. It might help to think of it this way—the filter isn’t meant to help you with relentlessness, it’s meant to help you maintain your existing personal, familial, and professional relationships while being relentless elsewhere in life.)

### Calling It Quits

Grover does acknowledge that there will come a time when you have nothing left to prove and are ready to finish up your career or lifelong commitment. He notes that in order for you to do so, your self-control will have to triumph over your primal self, or else you’ll never feel satisfied and won’t stop seeking success until you’re dead and gone.

> **Going From Relentless to Retired**
> 
> For advice on how to transition from relentless to retired, experts elaborate further on what this process might look like and how to best approach it. One study found that highly gifted individuals end up less happy later in life, stuck wondering if they _fully_ lived up to their potential.
> 
> However, there is a solution to this unhappy decline: helping others. By transitioning into a mentor role and teaching the people around you, you continue using the wisdom you’ve developed over the course of your life—rather than leaving it behind and ruminating over “what ifs.”. Scientists call this collected wisdom “crystallized knowledge,” and believe that crystallized knowledge peaks far later in life compared to other mental faculties—meaning that you still have opportunities to “live up to your potential” in various ways, even beyond retirement.
