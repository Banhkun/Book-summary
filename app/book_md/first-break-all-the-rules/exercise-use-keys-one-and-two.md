## Exercise: Use Keys One and Two

The first two keys focus on hiring for talent and defining goals over process.

* * *

Interviewing for talent relies on using open-ended questions to allow candidates to reveal their talents. List 3-5 open-ended questions that you could use for your interview process. When developing your questions, think about the specific needs of your organization and the signposts of talent.

Avoid micromanaging to allow your employees to use their unique talents to work toward a desired goal. Think of a time when you were guilty of micromanaging an employee when the process didnâ€™t have to do with legal, financial, or safety standards. What led you to micromanage? Describe the situation.

Now, think of a way that you could have handled the situation by defining goals instead of defining process.
