## Exercise: Navigate Around Weakness

Though you can’t directly fix your employees’ weaknesses, you need to navigate around them to keep the workplace productive. You can do this by creating a system of support, pairing people together based on talents and weaknesses, and promoting individual roles within teams.

* * *

Think about a specific employee’s weakness. What’s one way that you can navigate around that weakness using a tool or system? (For example, think of the employee who struggled to remember dates having a calendar downloaded on their computer.)

Think about the talents and weaknesses of your current employees. Now, think about the ways you can pair your employees based on their talents and weaknesses. Finally, think about one of those pairings and describe the ways that each employee’s talents would support the other’s weaknesses.

Think about the job description of one of your team members. What are some ways that you can specify their responsibilities to allow them to use their specific talents and avoid their weaknesses?
