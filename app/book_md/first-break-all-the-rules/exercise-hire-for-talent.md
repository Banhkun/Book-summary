## Exercise: Hire for Talent

When hiring, you need to focus on talent. This requires that you consider both the talents necessary for the role and the talents of your candidates.

* * *

Think about a specific role that you’re currently searching to fill or recently filled. Describe the position.

Now, think about the best employee you’ve ever had in that position. Describe their talents.

Next, think about the structure of your company. What procedures are employees expected to follow? What expectations are they expected to meet? Describe them.

With all of this in mind, describe the talents of the ideal candidate for the position you described above. Think about striving, relating, and thinking talents.
