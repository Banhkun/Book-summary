## Exercise: Break the Golden Rule

To develop efficiency in your workplace, you need to treat each employee differently according to their talents.

* * *

Think about a specific employee. What are their talents? Think about their striving, relating, and thinking talents.

With those talents in mind, think about the ways that this employee would want to be recognized for good work. Describe them.

Now, think about the goals that would motivate this individual employee. Describe them.
