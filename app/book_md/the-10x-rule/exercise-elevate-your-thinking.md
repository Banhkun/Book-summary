## Exercise: Elevate Your Thinking

People often set only modest goals that they think are realistic. However, you can’t achieve extraordinary success without setting extraordinary goals.

* * *

What are your current goals and why?

How would they change if you applied 10X thinking (set goals 10X higher than anyone else’s)?

What’s a past goal you reached, but that left you feeling dissatisfied? Why?

How about when you accomplished a seemingly unrealistic goal? How did it feel to reach it?
