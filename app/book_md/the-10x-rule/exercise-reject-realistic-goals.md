## Exercise: Reject ‘Realistic’ Goals

Many people set average goals based on what others think is possible. Others encourage us to be realistic and avoid setting goals that are too high, so we limit ourselves to doing what others do.

* * *

What are your current goals? How was your choice of goals affected by your upbringing or by those around you?

Which of your goals would be considered average or ‘realistic’ by most people? How can you reframe them as (10X) goals?

What goal could you align with a purpose to motivate you to achieve it?
