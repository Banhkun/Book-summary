## Exercise: Take Control

This book argues that things don’t happen _to_ you, they happen _because of_ you. Therefore, you need to get rid of victim thinking and take responsibility for everything—good or bad—that happens in your life. By doing so, you take control and can act at 10X levels.

* * *

Think of something bad you interpreted as happening _to_ you. Who/what did you blame?

How would the event look if you reinterpreted it as something that happened _because of_ you? What was your role?

What could you do differently in the future to minimize the chances of this event happening again or to minimize its negative impact? What’s the difference in how you feel now, compared to your original approach of blaming someone else?
