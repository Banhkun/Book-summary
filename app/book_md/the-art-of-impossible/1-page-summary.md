## 1-Page Summary

Goals feel impossible when you see no discernible way to get from where you are to where you want to be. However, this isn’t an excuse to give up on your dreams. Just because you’re _currently_ unable to see a way doesn’t mean that there _isn’t_ one.

In _The Art of Impossible_ , bestselling author, award-winning journalist, and peak performance expert Steven Kotler draws on extensive neurobiological research to demystify what it takes to achieve breakthrough success. He presents a step-by-step process for developing peak performance habits that will help you to achieve your most ambitious goals.

This guide explores _The Art of Impossible_ in two parts:

  * In the first part, we’ll explain the role that neurochemistry plays in driving peak performance habits. We’ll also explore how practicing “full engagement” primes neurochemicals to boost motivation and enhance performance.
  * In the second part, we’ll explore Kotler’s step-by-step process to practice full engagement and achieve seemingly impossible goals. We’ll cover this in three phases: cultivate intrinsic motivation, define your strategy, and adopt a positive attitude. 



### Part 1: Neurochemicals Drive Peak Performers to Succeed

According to Kotler, elite performers achieve seemingly impossible feats because they consistently perform at the peak of their capabilities and push themselves to exceed their potential. How are they able to maintain this level of commitment? Kotler argues that it’s because their **neurochemistry supports their high-performance habits**.

In this first part of the guide, we’ll explore what neurochemicals are and how they drive your decisions and habits. Then, we’ll explain how being fully engaged with what you’re doing generates a combination of neurochemicals that enhances your capabilities and motivates you to achieve your goals.

#### Neurochemicals Reward Peak Performance Habits

What are neurochemicals? In brief, your nervous system is made up of billions of neurons and neural pathways that transmit chemical information (neurochemicals) from one neuron to another. Kotler explains that these neurochemicals regulate your body and allow you to function. They also drive all of your decisions, behaviors, and habits by creating sensations that motivate you to move toward pleasure and away from pain.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Kotler’s argument that neurochemicals regulate your body and motivate you to move toward pleasure and away from pain. Furthermore, neuroscientists recently discovered that your brain continues to form new neurons your entire life. This process is called neurogenesis and it occurs in certain brain regions, most notably in the hippocampus—the same area that consolidates new information and memories. Initial research suggests that increasing neurogenesis promotes healthy brain chemistry, and it may be the key to treating cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.)

#### The Six “Reward” Neurochemicals

While there are many neurochemicals in the body, each serving a different function, Kotler’s research focuses on the reward chemicals that come into play when peak performers rise to the height of their capabilities. He argues that **peak performers feel motivated to challenge themselves and reach new heights because they find the process _pleasurable_**. The process is pleasurable because it releases six different neurochemicals—thereby rewarding and reinforcing peak performers each time they engage in their high-performance habits:

  * Dopamine: Focuses your attention, making you feel excited and engaged
  * Norepinephrine: Boosts your energy and makes you feel more alert
  * Oxytocin: Promotes feelings of love, trust, and empathy for others
  * Serotonin: Elicits feelings of calm, contentment, and satisfaction
  * Endorphins and anandamide: Induce relaxation by relieving feelings of pain and stress



It’s clear to see how each of the reward neurochemicals makes high-performance habits feel pleasurable. However, Kotler argues, **generating _one_ neurochemical at a time doesn’t provide enough motivation to sustain a peak performer’s momentum over the long term**.

> **How Neurochemicals Impact Physical, Emotional, and Cognitive Health**
> 
> While it’s true that these six reward neurochemicals can stimulate pleasurable feelings that reinforce your habits, Kotler doesn’t mention the numerous other ways that they impact your overall health. Therefore, we’ll provide an overview of how these neurochemicals contribute to your physical, emotional, and cognitive health.
> 
> **Dopamine:** Well-known for the role it plays in fueling addiction, dopamine also helps regulate cognitive functions, emotional responses, and physical reactions. Deficient dopamine levels produce numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, muscle cramps, diminished balance, mood swings, and fatigue. On the other hand, excessive dopamine levels contribute to stress, mania, aggression, hallucinations, and insomnia. Dopamine dysregulation is associated with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Therefore, healthcare professionals suggest seeking medical advice before attempting to manipulate the levels of dopamine in your system.
> 
> **Norepinephrine:** This neurochemical plays a central role in maintaining your physical, emotional, and cognitive health: It helps regulate your biorhythms, maintains your organs, and helps protect you from danger by initiating your fight-or-flight stress response. Deficient norepinephrine levels contribute to the depressive phase of bipolar disorders, attention deficit disorders, chronic fatigue, and low blood pressure. On the other hand, elevated norepinephrine levels contribute to the manic phase of bipolar disorders, chronic stress, and anxiety disorders. The most effective way to keep your norepinephrine levels in balance is to manage your mental and physical health and reduce your stress levels.
> 
> **Oxytocin:** Commonly known as the “love hormone,” oxytocin plays a key role in various emotional, social, and cognitive processes, such as increasing sexual arousal and satisfaction, promoting positive communication, and improving social memory. However, research hasn’t yet confirmed all of the different ways that dysregulated oxytocin levels can harm or benefit you. Ongoing research suggests that dysregulation of oxytocin in the brain can contribute to envy, aggression, and fear, as well as neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and eating disorders.
> 
> **Serotonin:** While it primarily stabilizes your mood and promotes happy feelings, serotonin also aids in healing and restful sleep. Deficient serotonin levels contribute to numerous psychological, cognitive, and physiological issues, such as depression, aggression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, poor memory, weight gain, fatigue, and an overactive libido. On the other hand, excessive serotonin levels are detrimental to your health, contributing to digestive problems, involuntary muscle reactions, osteoporosis, and an underactive libido. You can increase your serotonin levels by exercising, meditating, and undergoing light therapy. However, excessive serotonin levels require immediate medical treatment.
> 
> **Endorphins:** Since the main job of endorphins is to relieve physical pain and feelings of anxiety, deficient endorphin levels heighten your sensitivity to pain. Factors that contribute to endorphin deficiency include anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, and substance abuse. You can increase your endorphin levels by laughing, exercising, engaging in creative activities, and undertaking acupuncture treatment.
> 
> **Anandamide:** Otherwise known as the “bliss molecule” for the role it plays in stimulating happy feelings, anandamide also helps to regulate memory, appetite, pain relief, and sleeping patterns. Anandamide works by binding THC receptors in the brain (THC is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana). Deficient anandamide levels impede your ability to cope with stress, thus contributing to increased levels of fear, anxiety, and depression. You can increase your anandamide levels by eating pure chocolate or black truffles, or by taking (legal) CBD supplements.

##### Full Engagement Generates All Six Reward Neurochemicals

Kotler argues that the real secret to maintaining peak performance is to generate all _six_ reward neurochemicals at one time. **When combined, the reward neurochemicals produce a potent mix of pleasurable advantages that boost motivation, optimize performance, and enhance overall well-being.** The only way to generate and benefit from all six reward neurochemicals is to regularly work in a state of flow—we’ll refer to this state as “full engagement” throughout the rest of the guide.

Full engagement, otherwise known as “being in the zone,” comes about when you’re so focused on what you’re doing that you feel completely absorbed by it. According to Kotler, **full engagement offers advantages that make working toward seemingly impossible goals feel both enjoyable and effortless**. Physically, full engagement increases strength, endurance, and muscle reaction times and decreases sensations of pain, feelings of exertion, and exhaustion. Mentally, full engagement offers the following advantages:

  * Increased levels of motivation and productivity 
  * Improved learning and long-term memory 
  * Enhanced creativity and innovative ideas
  * Amplified feelings of satisfaction and fulfillment
  * Heightened empathy and social awareness 
  * Enriched collaboration and cooperation 



According to Kotler, **the positive advantages of full engagement drive peak performers to continually improve themselves and do what it takes to achieve their goals.** Therefore, if you want to adopt peak performance habits and achieve seemingly impossible goals, you must practice full engagement. We’ll explore how to regularly attain this state of mind throughout the rest of the guide.

> **How Being Fully Engaged Impacts the Brain**
> 
> Neuroscience research confirms Kotler’s assertion that regularly attaining a state of flow or full engagement is essential to maintaining peak performance habits. Likewise, it confirms that the only way to simultaneously produce all six reward neurochemicals is to achieve this mental state. Neuroimaging techniques—functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograms (EEG)—offer additional insights into how being fully engaged impacts the brain and creates the mental advantages Kotler describes:
> 
> It slows down brain waves from beta (fast and erratic) to alpha (slow and free-flowing). This dramatically **enhances your focus and concentration and makes tasks _feel_ effortless—making those tasks more satisfying and arguably making you more productive**.
> 
> Intense concentration limits activity in the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain that’s associated with self-monitoring, insecurities, and worries regarding everyday reality. This quiets your internal critic and promotes positive, non-judgmental thoughts—thus **enhancing your relationship with yourself and others by making you more empathetic and able to collaborate with others**.
> 
> Limiting activity in the prefrontal cortex also limits the thoughts that keep you aware of everyday reality. **This changes your perception of time and allows you to get _lost_ or fully immersed in your tasks.**
> 
> Cognitive activity then moves to subcortical brain regions. This speeds up your brain’s ability to process information and **sparks new connections and creative ideas that make it easier for you to expand your knowledge and learn new skills**.

### Part 2: A Step-by-Step Process to Achieve Full Engagement

We’ve just discussed how being fully engaged supports peak performance habits by generating a combination of pleasurable neurochemicals that enhance your capabilities. We’ll now explore Kotler’s step-by-step process for priming your neurochemicals to help you practice full engagement. Regularly achieving this state of mind will help you cultivate peak performance habits that will make your seemingly impossible goals more attainable.

We’ll tackle his process in three phases: cultivating intrinsic motivation, creating your strategy, and adopting a positive attitude.

#### Phase #1: Cultivate Intrinsic Motivation

Kotler argues that you’re more likely to practice full engagement and cultivate peak performance habits if you feel intrinsically motivated to pursue your goals.

He explains that two types of motivation drive your decisions, behaviors, and habits:

  * Extrinsic motivation: You do things to receive external rewards such as money, fame, or social validation. 
  * Intrinsic motivation: You do things to receive internal rewards such as feelings of interest, enjoyment, or happiness. 



According to Kotler, **intrinsically motivated goals generate more pleasurable neurochemicals than extrinsically motivated goals**. This is because intrinsically motivated goals align with your interests and passions—you choose to pursue these goals and improve your capabilities because they inspire positive emotions and you genuinely enjoy working toward them.

Each time you work toward an intrinsically motivated goal, your feelings of enjoyment trigger a flood of reward neurochemicals (such as dopamine and serotonin) to enter your system and further increase your pleasure. As a result, you associate working toward your goals with pleasurable feelings—and this reinforces your motivation to pursue these goals.

On the other hand, extrinsically motivated goals generally feel less enjoyable to pursue because they don’t align with your interests or inspire positive emotions. As a result, they don’t trigger the necessary reward neurochemicals that drive you to achieve your goal.

Therefore, before you attempt to achieve a seemingly impossible goal, you should ensure that you’re intrinsically motivated to achieve it.

> **Identify Your Motivations and Move Toward Intrinsically Motivated Goals**
> 
> Many psychologists and self-improvement authors mirror Kotler’s argument that cultivating intrinsic motivation is key to feeling engaged, achieving goals, and experiencing satisfaction. Some notable proponents of this theory include: Jay Shetty (_Think Like a Monk_), Neil Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_), Maxwell Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_), and Deepak Chopra (_The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success_).
> 
> The authors of _Minimalism_ expand on the topic with additional advice that will help you identify your motivations and move toward more intrinsically motivated goals. They claim that there are four obstructions holding you back from pursuing intrinsically motivated goals: identity, status, certainty, and money. For example, you may focus on career goals that drain your energy rather than trying to find goals that align with your interests because your financial security and sense of identity are tied up with your career status.
> 
> Become aware of how these obstructions influence you, and distinguish between the goals and activities that satisfy you (intrinsically motivated) and the ones that don’t (extrinsically motivated), by tracking all of the activities you take part in over the next few weeks. Next, reflect on each activity by asking yourself the following questions:
> 
>   * Is this something I want to do, or am I fulfilling external expectations?
> 
>   * Do I enjoy this? If so, what’s the most enjoyable aspect of it?
> 
>   * Does this make me feel energized or drained? Motivated or unmotivated?
> 
>   * How can I create opportunities to engage more in the activities that I enjoy?
> 
> 


Kotler explains how to choose an intrinsically motivated goal through the following five steps:

##### Step #1: Identify Your Interests

The first step toward cultivating intrinsic motivation involves **exploring your interests to discover what intrinsically motivates you**. According to Kotler, focusing your attention on your interests produces enough dopamine to initiate the feeling of motivation.

  * Write down 25 things that you’re interested in learning more about. Narrow down your interests so that they’re as specific as possible. For example, instead of “gardening,” write: “the specific conditions required to grow cherry tomatoes all year round.” Instead of “solar energy,” write: “the process that allows solar panels to convert energy into usable power.”



(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to come up with 25 interests, Stanford professors Bill Burnett and Dave Evans (_Designing Your Life_) offer a practical way to hone in on what drives you: Track what activities make you feel joyful, engaged, and energized. Then, zoom in on the details of each activity you’ve logged to identify what specifically engaged your interest. Pay particular attention to who you were with, what you were doing, where you were, and what you were interacting with (for example, people, objects, or a machine). If your current schedule doesn’t offer much in the way of variety, reflect on past experiences that stand out as positive or engaging.)

##### Step #2: Connect Your Interests Together

Once you’ve identified your interests, **find ways to link your interests together**. According to Kotler, this helps your brain form connections between different ideas, which generates more dopamine and increases your motivation.

  * Look for areas where two or more of your interests share common ground or complement each other. Then link them together to create a new area of interest. For example, link “the specific conditions required to grow cherry tomatoes all year round” with “the process that allows solar panels to convert energy into usable power” to create this combined interest: “the possibility of using solar power to grow produce all year round.”



(Shortform note: If you’re having trouble linking your interests together to come up with new areas of interest, create a mind map to generate more ideas. Mind mapping employs the creative side of your brain by converting your initial ideas into a visual diagram that encourages you to make associations between disparate ideas. Every new idea you add stimulates additional ideas that trigger further associations—resulting in ideas that you wouldn’t normally consider.)

##### Step #3: Explore Your New Areas of Interest

Once you’ve created connections between your interests, **set aside time each day to learn more about your new areas of interest**. Kotler argues that absorbing new information every day feeds your brain a continual stream of information while giving it time to naturally make connections between what you already _know_ and what you’re _learning_. This generates more dopamine, which further increases your motivation to learn more.

  * Spend 30 minutes every day learning more about your new areas of interest. Use a variety of media. For example, to explore “the possibility of using solar power to grow produce all year round,” you might listen to a podcast about sustainable living, read an article about how solar batteries work, or take notes from a book about indoor gardening.



> **How Your Brain Learns New Things**
> 
> Neuroscience research expands upon Kotler’s explanation of how your brain creates connections between what you already know and what you’re learning. Specifically, it explores the molecular activity that occurs inside your brain when you take in new information.
> 
> The more you learn, the more you change the physical structure of your brain by strengthening specific neural pathways. Here’s a very brief overview of neural pathways:
> 
>   * The brain consists of a dense network of pathways made up f of neurons, or information messengers.
> 
>   * Synapses transmit sensory information through this network of neurons.
> 
>   * This sensory information gets stored in your short-term memory while your brain compares it to the memories you’ve stored in your long-term memory. This allows your brain to _judge_ how relevant the new information is to what you already _know_ (the processes stored in your long-term memory) and determines whether it should be kept or discarded.
> 
> 

> 
> Neuroscientists believe that your memory and recall rely upon the relationship that your neurons have with each other. Each time you learn something new, your brain applies conscious effort and attention to form new neural connections and pathways. The more you practice recalling specific information, the stronger the relationships between the corresponding neurons in your brain, and the more likely your brain is to store the information in your long-term memory—thus converting it into knowledge.

##### Step #4: Seek Out Social Reinforcement

As you work through the process of exploring your interests, share what you’re learning with other people. According to Kotler, **including other people in your exploration garners positive feedback and social support**. This positive attention generates a combination of dopamine and oxytocin. This makes your progress feel more meaningful and boosts your motivation to continue learning more about your topics.

  * Regularly discuss what you’re discovering with other people. Talk to friends, join groups devoted to the subject, or start an online community.



(Shortform note: While social reinforcement can provide support and useful feedback, it can also reduce your motivation to pursue your interests. Psychological studies find that social reinforcement makes you feel like you’re making progress even when you’re not. This feeling of progress feels good but **it’s based on a false sense of achievement that causes you to lose sight of what you need to do to move forward**. For example, receiving positive feedback about your idea to use solar power to grow produce makes you _feel_ like an expert on the topic even though you’ve only read one book. Because you already feel like an expert, you lose the incentive to expand your knowledge and actually _become_ an expert.)

##### Step #5: Define Your Seemingly Impossible Goal

The more you learn about and share your interests, the easier you’ll find it to define your seemingly impossible goal—by exploring how your interests might solve a global problem.

According to Kotler, believing that you’re involved in something that has the potential to make a massive positive impact on the world shifts your attitude from “exploring something interesting” to “working toward something important.” **This attitude shift transforms your exploratory work into a meaningful _purpose_ that generates even more reward neurochemicals**—resulting in decreased stress levels and increased levels of motivation, productivity, resiliency, and focus. Consequently, you find it easier to sustain long-term momentum and achieve your goal.

  * Write down 15 global problems that you would love to see solved. Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of, “End world hunger,” write: “Increase access to farming skills and technologies.” Then, consider how your personal interests could potentially solve one of these global problems. For example, your interest in using solar panels to grow produce all year round might lead to a solution that involves establishing a distribution network for agricultural solar technologies.



(Shortform note: Daniel H. Pink (_Drive_) clarifies why connecting your goal to a global problem increases your motivation: You’re biologically wired to want to help other people. Therefore, goals that don’t contribute to the well-being of others feel less meaningful—because they don’t align with your natural inclination to help others. Further, scientific research confirms that actively contributing to the well-being of others makes you happier: When you act with the intention of helping others, you activate the same parts of your brain that are stimulated by pleasurable activities such as eating good food or having great sex. This implies that goals feel more pleasurable the more people they serve—thus, validating Kotler’s approach.)

#### Phase #2: Define Your Strategy

Once you’ve completed the five steps to define your seemingly impossible goal, you’ll have created enough intrinsic motivation to work on the second phase of the process: defining a strategy to achieve your goal. **Defining your strategy will give you a clear idea of what you need to do to get from where you are to where you want to be**.

Kotler presents three steps to help you define your strategy.

##### Step #1: Break Your Seemingly Impossible Goal Down Into Challenging Tasks

The first step toward creating your strategy involves breaking your seemingly impossible goal down into achievable tasks. Kotler argues that this process helps you prioritize your time and **focuses your attention on what you need to do to make progress**.

  * Break your life mission down into large, ambitious goals. Then, break these large goals into a series of challenging but achievable daily tasks. For example, your first daily task toward achieving your goal to set up a distribution network for agricultural solar technologies might be to define what resources you’ll need to move forward. Your second task might involve creating a plan to acquire these resources, and so on.



(Shortform note: Brendon Burchard (_High Performance Habits_) expands on Kotler’s method with in-depth advice on breaking your goal down into productive tasks. First, write down five major steps you need to take to achieve your goal. These are big steps that require many smaller tasks to achieve. For example, if your goal is to become a published author, one of your five major steps might be to get a literary agent. Then, under each of your five major steps, write down a list of tasks you need to complete to accomplish that step. For example, to get a literary agent, your tasks might include researching agencies and crafting writing samples. Finally, create deadlines for each of these tasks and factor them into your daily schedule.)

##### Step #2: Set Your Schedule

The second step toward creating your strategy involves scheduling time for the tasks required to achieve your seemingly impossible goal. Kotler argues that setting aside blocks of time to accomplish your tasks and improve your skills produces the neurochemicals necessary to practice full engagement and amplify your focus and productivity.

This is because each time you complete a task, you’ll trigger a dopamine spike that will increase your motivation and concentration. In turn, this will make you _want_ to improve your performance and tackle increasingly challenging tasks. As a result, you’ll rapidly gain momentum toward achieving your seemingly impossible goal.

  * Set aside at least 90 minutes of uninterrupted time each morning to accomplish your daily tasks. 



(Shortform note: Psychological research offers additional insights into how scheduling uninterrupted time increases motivation and productivity. When you only give tasks partial focus—by multitasking or giving in to distractions—you interrupt your brain from accessing and applying information stored in your mind. This slows down your progress and makes your task feel laborious—thus, slowing down your momentum. On the other hand, intense, full focus helps your brain _effortlessly_ sift through and apply information stored in your brain, speeds up your progress, and makes your task feel enjoyable—thus, increasing your momentum.)

  * Commit to this schedule even when you’re feeling stressed out or exhausted. This will train you to maintain focus during uncomfortable or difficult circumstances.



(Shortform note: Like Kotler, Brian P. Moran (_The 12 Week Year_) argues that you’re more likely to achieve your goals if you train yourself to work through your discomfort. Giving into excuses not to work on your goals leads to unproductive habits that slow down your momentum. On the other hand, committing to work on your goals no matter what helps you develop the necessary self-discipline and persistence required to maintain your focus over the long term.)

##### Step #3: Expand Your Knowledge and Capabilities

The third step toward creating your strategy involves expanding your knowledge and skill set so that you can continually exceed your capabilities and move closer to your goal. As we’ve discussed, Kotler claims that regularly learning new things encourages your brain to form connections between different ideas. **This improves your problem-solving skills and your ability to come up with creative ideas.** Further, the process of learning boosts levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in your system, making it easier to practice full engagement and build momentum toward your goal.

  * In addition to your scheduled 90 minutes of uninterrupted time for task completion, spend 25 minutes a day learning something new or improving your skills. This could include reading about new topics, improving your areas of weakness, or practicing new skills.



> **Efficient Methods to Expand Your Knowledge and Skills**
> 
> If you’re not sure how to use your 25 minutes to effectively expand your knowledge and skills, consider adopting the following two methods.
> 
> According to Jim Kwik (_Limitless_), you’re more likely to retain the information you learn and expand your knowledge if you take effective notes. He provides a three-step process to achieve this:
> 
>   * Before you start a learning session (for example, reading or watching a presentation), ask yourself what you’re specifically hoping to learn from it.
> 
>   * Keeping your goal for the session in mind, filter through the information you’re getting, and write down only what’s relevant to that goal.
> 
>   * Once your session is complete, highlight the most valuable information and make an outline of the key points.
> 
> 

> 
> Angela Duckworth (_Grit_) argues that you’re more likely to stretch your skill set if you break each skill down into different components and focus on mastering one component at a time. She provides a four-step process to achieve this:
> 
>   * Focus on a specific component of the skill you want to improve or learn. For example, if your goal is to learn how to play guitar, focus on mastering a single chord. Give that specific component your undivided attention.
> 
>   * Once you think you’ve mastered that component, ask others to evaluate your progress. Pay more attention to what you did wrong than what you did right.
> 
>   * Reflect on the feedback you received and continue to give that single component your undivided attention until you master it.
> 
>   * Repeat the process until you’ve mastered all of the different components of your chosen skill.
> 
> 


#### Phase #3: Adopt a Positive Attitude to Sustain Your Momentum

The third and final phase of the process to achieve seemingly impossible goals involves cultivating a positive attitude. Kotler argues that staying positive promotes a continual release of reward chemicals that **alleviate stress and help you develop the resilience you need to overcome obstacles and sustain your momentum.** Additionally, a positive state of mind expands your perspective, making it easier for you to notice and absorb new information. This new information inspires creative ideas and solutions to help you achieve your long-term goals.

Kotler recommends six methods to cultivate a positive mindset:

##### Method #1: Practice Mindfulness

Spend at least five minutes each day _observing_ your thoughts without _judging_ them. According to Kotler, this process increases awareness of your habitual thoughts and how they make you feel. This awareness makes it easier for you to identify, interrupt, and reframe the negative or unhelpful thoughts that prevent you from maintaining a positive state of mind.

(Shortform note: Mental health practitioners confirm that practicing mindfulness increases self-awareness, encourages positive thoughts about yourself, your circumstances, and others, and improves your mental well-being. Consequently, mindfulness practices also help you manage the symptoms of many stress-related health issues such as high blood pressure or tension headaches. In _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , Bhante Gunaratana recommends establishing a schedule to turn your mindfulness practice into a habit. Begin by setting aside 10 to 20 minutes each morning or evening to observe your thoughts, lengthening your time as you get more comfortable with the process.)

##### Method #2: Be Grateful

Each day, write down 10 things you’re grateful for and take the time to feel good about each item on your list. Kotler argues that taking time to feel thankful makes you feel more positive because it keeps you focused on what’s going well in your life. It also trains you to seek out positive information—a skill that helps you reframe problems and find solutions to overcome any challenges you face.

(Shortform note: Though the mood-boosting benefits of gratitude are well-known, it can be difficult to practice focusing on what’s going well, especially when things _aren’t_. Like Kotler, many psychologists suggest overcoming this difficulty by establishing a daily gratitude practice, such as keeping a gratitude journal. This creates a _habit_ of thinking grateful thoughts. Some self-help practitioners also suggest using visual reminders to trigger thoughts of gratitude. For example, use a gratitude quote as your screensaver or place a picture of something you’re grateful for by your desk.)

##### Method #3: Connect With Friends and Family

Spend at least two hours each week developing positive relationships that you can rely on for emotional support. According to Kotler, **the quality of your relationships directly impacts your mental and physical health and overall life satisfaction**. Therefore, the better your relationships, the healthier and happier you feel.

(Shortform note: Shawn Achor (_The Happiness Advantage_) adds further insight into how the quality of your relationships impacts your health and happiness. Positive relationships provide critical physical and mental health benefits that boost your overall life satisfaction: They improve your general health and increase your life expectancy by boosting your immune, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine systems. They also make it easier for you to overcome stress, maintain a positive state of mind, and achieve success by increasing your levels of energy, engagement, productivity, and resilience.)

##### Method #4: Confront Your Fears

Identify your fears and practice overcoming them. While this may sound like an uncomfortable process, engaging in behavior that’s outside of your comfort zone—and therefore feels risky—triggers dopamine spikes. This means that **you’ll experience pleasure each time you attempt to overcome your fears**. Kotler claims that this process will train you to move forward and remain psychologically stable even when you’re feeling uncomfortable—resulting in proactive behavior that accelerates your progress.

(Shortform note: While Jay Shetty (_Think Like a Monk_) also argues that overcoming fear is essential to maintaining a positive state of mind, he explains that before you can identify your fears, you must first get to the root of them. Though your fears may appear to relate to a specific subject, they often arise from a broader, unconscious fear. He suggests that you should keep asking why you’re afraid of something so that you can identify the fear at its root. For example, you’re afraid of talking to experts about your idea. Why? Because you don’t feel confident enough? Why? Because you don’t feel like you know enough? Why? Continuing with this line of questioning will provide clues about what specific actions you can take to resolve your fears.)

##### Method #5: Get in the Zone

Spend two to six hours each week pursuing recreational activities that fully engage you so that you can benefit from the pleasurable advantages that all six reward chemicals offer. According to Kotler, **the more you practice being fully engaged when you’re _not_ working toward your goal, the easier you’ll find it to be fully engaged when you _are_ working toward it**. For example, you feel fully engaged when you hike through the woods, complete jigsaw puzzles, and bake cakes. You spend two hours each week pursuing each of these three activities—totaling six hours of full engagement.

(Shortform note: It’s true that the more you practice being fully engaged, the easier you find it to attain this state of mind. This is because it employs six of the most addictive reward neurochemicals at once—making it an addictive mental state. However, since being fully engaged continually pushes you outside of your comfort zone, it can create serious negative consequences—especially if your full engagement activities center around activities that involve a high degree of risk, such as base jumping or cave diving. Numerous extreme-sports athletes have lost their lives in the pursuit of chasing the thrill that full engagement offers. Therefore, proceed with caution: Focus on activities that _don’t_ hinge on mastering death-defying stunts.)

##### Method #6: Exercise Regularly and Sleep Well

Spend three hours exercising each week and try to get at least seven hours of sleep a night. Kotler argues that staying active and sleeping well alleviates symptoms of stress and anxiety and increases your ability to maintain a positive state of mind.

> **How Staying Active and Sleeping Well Promotes a Positive State of Mind**
> 
> Scientific evidence confirms that good physical health promotes good mental health, thus backing up Kotler’s method. Neurobiology research shows that in addition to improving your physical health, regular exercise releases the neurochemicals GABA, serotonin, BDNF, and endocannabinoids. **These chemicals help maintain a positive state of mind by stimulating cognition, regulating emotions, and enhancing self-esteem.**
> 
> Regular sleep promotes healthy brain chemistry by flushing out toxins that impair the flow of information between neurons. While you’re awake, your brain and body burn sources of energy such as oxygen and glucose. This process creates metabolic waste that accumulates in your system and leads to feelings of fatigue, stress, and irritability—impeding your ability to maintain a positive state of mind. **Sleep allows your body to flush this waste out of your system and restore your energy sources** —thus improving your state of mind.
> 
> You’re more likely to maintain a healthy exercise and bedtime routine and improve your brain chemistry if you **set realistic goals that complement your daily schedule and energy levels**. For example, if you naturally rise at 6 am, start your bedtime routine at 10 pm. If you have more energy at midday, schedule this time to go for a brisk walk or a run.
