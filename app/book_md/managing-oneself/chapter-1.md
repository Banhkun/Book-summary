## Chapter 1: Defining Self-Management

_Managing Oneself_ is a guide to finding success in your career. Peter Drucker provides **a template of the necessary steps to build a career where you thrive and feel rewarded** , complete with self-reflection exercises to apply his ideas to your career.

In this guide, we’ll explore Drucker’s ideas on how to manage yourself. We’ll begin by discussing why self-management is necessary. We’ll then look at the steps of self-reflection Drucker recommends, as well as how to put this self-reflection into action. Finally, we’ll look at Drucker’s notion of a second career, which is a new career starting around the midpoint of your working life.

In this chapter, we’ll discuss what self-management is and why it’s a practice that Drucker believes you should engage in.

### What Does It Mean to Manage Yourself?

According to Drucker, **managing yourself is taking responsibility for yourself and your career development** so that you can grow and learn throughout your working life. In other words, it means taking the initiative to develop your skills so that you maximize your chances of having a successful career.

When managing yourself, Drucker notes that it’s helpful to think of yourself as your own boss, making decisions about your future. These decisions could be pursuing additional training courses to bolster your CV or improving your social skills to engage more positively with your colleagues.

> **Other Views of Self-Management**
> 
> Rather than giving a precise definition of what self-management _is_ , Drucker slowly reveals his concepts of self-management throughout his book. Other authors have offered more of a concise definition of self-management, sometimes drawing on Drucker’s ideas.
> 
> For instance, in _The First 90 Days_ , a guide to succeeding in your new job, author Michael D. Watkins outlines two pillars of self-management. The first is to create habits that will ensure your success, such as blocking off time to pursue your medium-term and long-term goals. The second is to build yourself a support system, such as a network of people whose advice you know you can trust.
> 
> Other authors also add an emotional component to self-management. In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradbury defines self-management as the ability to use self-awareness to manage your emotions. This means acting on rational thoughts to avoid being controlled by emotion and using positive self-talk. Bradbury also ties self-management to support systems, encouraging you to publicize your goals so that others can hold you accountable and support you.

### Why Is It Necessary to Manage Yourself?

Drucker believes self-management is necessary because our working lives have changed drastically. We are now in the era of the “knowledge worker,” which has altered the kind of work we do.

Knowledge working means that **now we can make choices about our working lives** , and Drucker asserts that making _good_ choices is necessary to having a successful career. As a knowledge worker, you can, for instance, choose where you work, and for how long you work there, unlike in the past, when workers had one career path for life. As you are likely to be the only constant factor throughout your career, you must take responsibility for your career path by learning to manage yourself.

> **What Is a Knowledge Worker?**
> 
> Drucker briefly discusses the concept of being a knowledge worker and the choices this involves, but he doesn’t give a definition of the term. He actually coined the term “knowledge worker” in his book _The Effective Executive_ ,__ in which he defined it as someone whose chief professional asset is their knowledge. This contrasts with a role in which your chief asset may be your physical strength or your deftness when operating machinery.
> 
> Examples of knowledge workers include programmers, lawyers, academics, and architects. As developed economies move away from production-related industries and towards service industries like technology, marketing, and research, knowledge worker roles are increasingly common.
