## 1-Page Summary

_Managing Oneself_ is a guide to finding success in your career. Peter Drucker asserts that through careful self-management, you can **build a career where you thrive and feel rewarded.** Drucker likens managing yourself to taking responsibility for yourself and your own career development so that you can grow and achieve throughout your entire working life.

> **Other Views of Self-Management**
> 
> Rather than giving a precise definition of what self-management _is_ , Drucker slowly reveals his concept of self-management throughout his book.
> 
> Other authors have offered a more concise view of the concept of self-management, sometimes drawing on Drucker’s ideas. For instance, in _The First 90 Days_ , a guide to succeeding in your new job, author Michael D. Watkins outlines two pillars of self-management. The first is to create habits that will ensure your success, such as blocking off time to pursue your medium-term and long-term goals. The second pillar is to build yourself a support system, such as a network of people whose advice you know you can trust.

In this guide, we’ll cover two of Drucker’s key principles of self-management: working from your strengths and setting—and achieving—impressive targets to make yourself stand out.

### Self-Reflecting to Find Your Strengths

Drucker suggests that self-management begins with self-reflection, which helps you get to know yourself better. The most important quality that self-reflection helps you discover is your strengths.

Drucker states that discovering your strengths is necessary to success because **_working_ on your strengths is the most efficient, and thus best, way to make yourself stand out** and advance your career. It doesn’t take much effort to improve something you have a natural ability in, and this effort could turn you into an _exceptional_ performer. Conversely, it would take a good deal of effort to work on areas in which you’re less skilled, and the results would be less impressive—taking you from poor to mediocre.

> **The Importance of Favoring Your Strengths**
> 
> Drucker’s advice to work on the things you’re already good at may seem counterintuitive because you may assume that it’s important to focus on improving areas of weakness. However other authors have echoed this idea.
> 
> For example, Cal Newport, author of _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , suggests that it’s important to feel like you’re competent at your work, which can**stem from choosing to do what you’re good at:** in other words, playing to your strengths. Competence is important because it’s a pillar of the principle of self-determination, which is the intrinsic motivation you feel to perform well. In turn, self-determination brings a sense of job satisfaction. Therefore, if you play to your strengths and thus feel like you’re competent at your job, your sense of job satisfaction will naturally increase.

#### How to Identify Your Strengths

To work from your strengths, you must first identify them. Drucker outlines a strength identification method that we’ll call the future predictions technique. He asks you to **write down a prediction of what you think will happen** every time you’re at a significant crossroads in your professional life**** and have to decide on a course of action. At the end of each prediction’s time period, go back and evaluate how accurate your assumptions were. Drucker’s suggested time window for predictions is nine to 12 months.

> **How Does the Future Predictions Technique Work?**
> 
> Drucker doesn’t explain exactly _why_ he believes this technique to be so successful at predicting your areas of strength. To link the technique to your strengths, when you’re reflecting on the last nine to 12 months, frame your analysis around what went well and what didn’t go so well. Then, use this to infer your strengths, presuming that your successes were thanks to your strengths.

### Use Goals to Excel in Your Role

Now that you know your strengths, you’re ready to answer the question, “How can I excel in my current role?” Drucker says that you excel by making a notable difference to your workplace, using your strengths. Do this by setting a work-related target and then working backward to make a step-by-step plan for achieving it. Achieving these targets will help you proactively advance your career, which is an important aspect of self-management.

> **Setting SMART Targets**
> 
> Drucker’s advice on targets is similar to the “SMART” target model outlined by George Doran _._ Doran said that every target should be:
> 
>   * **S** pecific: The target should clearly identify a desired outcome.
> 
>   * **M** easurable: The results should be easily measurable.
> 
>   * **A** ssignable: The tasks needed to achieve the target should be assigned to specific people.
> 
>   * **R** ealistic: The target should be achievable within the current circumstances.
> 
>   * **T** ime-bound: There should be a clear timeline for all steps of the target.
> 
> 

> 
> Doran found that adding “SMART” aspects to targets makes it more likely that you’ll achieve them.
> 
> Doran’s technique works for targets set _by_ anyone _for_ anyone, as they’re assignable. On the other hand, Drucker is more interested in ambitious targets that you set only for yourself—in other words, the type of targets that keep you focused on your own path and career advancement.
