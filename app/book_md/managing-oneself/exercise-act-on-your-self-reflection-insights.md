## Exercise: Act on Your Self-Reflection Insights

Drucker gives two main steps to apply the knowledge gathered from self-reflection to your career. In these exercises, you’ll see how to apply the information gathered from your self-reflection to your career so that you can advance and receive recognition from those around you.

What target could you set that would play to the strengths you identified during self-reflection and make a difference to your workplace? Explain how your target fits these criteria.

What are the first three steps you should take to achieve this target?

Now, think of a person that you collaborate closely with in your professional life. What is their top work strength? What would you say is their top work value?

What steps could you take to better accommodate this person’s strengths and work values?
