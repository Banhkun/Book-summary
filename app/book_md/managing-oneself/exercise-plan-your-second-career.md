## Exercise: Plan Your Second Career

Drucker encourages everyone to have a second career, to keep their working life interesting and to increase their chances of career success. These exercises will help you to plan out your transition to your second career.

* * *

First, identify what your ideal second career would be. (Would it be a shift into a totally different field or a change to a different role within your current industry?)

Now, consider which route into a second career would be best for you: a gradual career transition or a sudden switch. Why this route?

What three actions could you take within the next year to lay the foundations for your second career? (For instance, you might take a training course relevant to your ideal new role or professionally network with people in your desired industry.)
