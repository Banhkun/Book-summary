## Exercise: Assess Your Electronic Interruptions

It’s hard to make time for anything if you’re constantly responding to other people’s demands, and modern technology makes it even easier for the outside world to intrude. Assess the level of electronic distractions in your own life.

* * *

While reading this guide, how many times were you interrupted by your phone or your computer?

Which of those interruptions were important, and which were merely distracting?

Consider any interruptions that were genuinely important to you. Would you have responded to them differently if you had put them off until you finished reading this guide?
