## Exercise: Practice Setting Goals

According to the authors of _Influencer_ , when trying to achieve a goal, the first step is to state exactly what your goal is and how you'll know when you get there.

* * *

Consider a big goal you have in your personal or professional life. Write your goal below.

Reread the goal you wrote down. Is it specific? Is it measurable? If not, rewrite the goal to ensure that it's specific and includes a clear benchmark for success.
