## 1-Page Summary

_Influencer_ is a book for leaders who want to more effectively accomplish their goals.

According to the authors, **effective leaders can accomplish big goals by strategically influencing human behavior.** They call people with this skill “influencers.”

With a shared background in social science and organizational change, the authors (Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler) worked together to found Crucial Learning (previously known as VitalSmarts), an organization that offers professional training in communication, performance, and leadership. The authors also previously co-authored _Crucial Accountability_ in 2004, which builds on the ideas in _Crucial Conversations_ (written by Grenny, Patterson, McMillan, and Switzler in 2002), a guide on how to more effectively manage difficult conversations.

This guide will focus on the authors’ three-step process for becoming an effective influencer: setting clear and measurable goals, identifying critical practices, and using every area of impact to exert influence. We’ll also show how the author’s advice is rooted in human psychology and expand on the book’s strategies by incorporating the advice of other subject matter experts.

### The Importance of Being an Influencer

In this first section, we’ll delve into what it means to be an influencer and preview the three steps required to become an effective influencer.

The authors argue that influence is about more than just convincing people of something. It’s about understanding how and why they act the way they do, then finding ways to inspire and support them to change their behavior. According to the authors, being an effective influencer has broad implications across numerous fields, and it holds the potential to unlock big goals—from eliminating recidivism to saving thousands of lives.

> **The Rise of the Term ‘Influencer’**
> 
> In today’s vernacular, an influencer has come to mean someone who's able to impact consumer decisions using their social media platform. While the word “influencer” has been in-use in the English language since the mid-1600s, the term only took on new meaning with the rise of social media marketing. In fact, the word “influencer” couldn't be found in a dictionary prior to 2016. While some influencers happily claim the term, others balk at the title, arguing that there's a distinction between people who get paid to sell products and those who create original content using social media as the platform.
> 
> The authors of _Influencer_ touch briefly on the common usage of the term “influencer,” but they make clear that they're uninterested in the “lower” form of influence necessary to persuade an audience to buy a product. Their use of the term influencer more closely aligns with the first definition listed in Merriam-Webster:****“a person who inspires or guides the actions of others.”

The authors outline three steps to becoming an effective influencer:

**Step 1: Influencers must outline specific and quantifiable goals.**

**Step 2: Influencers must then identify one or two critical practices.**

**Step 3: Influencers must finally use every possible area of impact.**

### Step 1: Make Measurable Goals

To inspire people to change their behavior, effective influencers must first outline specific and quantifiable goals.

According to the authors, **a strong goal has two parts: a clearly defined purpose and measurable benchmarks.** They must be clear on what they want the long-term outcome to be. A specific and quantifiable goal allows everyone to know what you're working toward and how you'll know when you get there.

> **The Questionable Effectiveness of S.M.A.R.T. Goals**
> 
> At first glance, the authors’ recommendations for goal-setting align closely with the popular S.M.A.R.T. goal model, which defines well-developed goals as specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. This model has become almost ubiquitous in corporate and educational settings and is used widely as a goal-setting and accountability tool.
> 
> However, a study found that employees who are asked to set S.M.A.R.T. goals not only fail to see the purpose of the goal-setting, but are also less likely to love their jobs. Realistic, attainable goals consistently failed to spark inspiration, suggesting that the best way to be inspired and inspire others is to set “difficult or audacious” goals rather than reasonable ones.

The authors offer the example of Don Berwick, former CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. During his tenure as CEO, Berwick wanted to address the fact that health care was the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. He made a goal to “save 100,000 lives…by June 14, 2006 at 9 a.m.” Not only was this goal clearly defined, but it also offered a concrete measure of success (saving 100,000 lives) and a timeline.

(Shortform note: Berwick’s inspiring goal to save 100,000 lives became known as the 100,000 Lives Campaign. On June 14, 2006, Berwick’s team announced that 122,000 “needless deaths'' had been prevented, meaning that over the 18-month campaign, the team exceeded their goal. Interestingly, while the authors of _Influencer_ argue that only one or two critical practices are necessary to accomplish big goals (as we’ll see), the 100,000 Lives Campaign outlined at least six initiatives that would be necessary to help them reach their goal. It seems unlikely that implementing only one or two of these critical practices would have had the same impact.)

### Step 2: Identify the Critical Practices

Having established a measurable goal, influencers must then identify the critical practices necessary to reach that goal. They must know what behaviors need to change to make their goal possible. In this section, we'll define critical practices and discuss strategies for identifying the critical practices that will be most impactful in reaching your desired outcome.

**Critical practices are the behaviors that need to change in order to accomplish a goal.** While identifying the necessary behavior changes can seem overwhelming, the authors argue that there are usually**** one or two critical practices that have a disproportionate impact on the desired outcome. For example, if you wanted to minimize texting-related car accidents, a critical behavior might be placing cell phones out of reach while driving.

(Shortform note: While many agree that behavior change is a critical step in accomplishing long-term goals, there are different psychological theories about what causes long-term behavior change. For example, the theory of reasoned action suggests behavior change requires intention, shaped by attitude and social norms. The social cognitive theory on the other hand posits that personal ability and social learning prompt behavior change. Though there are subtle differences between these theories, most theories of behavior change point to the importance of individual ability and motivation and social influence as the key factors.)

Identifying critical practices can be challenging. The authors outline several strategies you can use to identify critical practices.

First, **always** **start with the basics.** Sometimes the critical practices are the most obvious ones. For example, 79% of people killed in bicycle accidents between 2010 and 2017 weren't wearing a helmet, and yet a 2016 study revealed that 56% of participants said they never wear a bike helmet. Putting on a bike helmet before going for a bike ride is a critical practice that has a disproportionate impact on the number of fatal bike accidents. (Shortform note: This suggestion is an example of the principle of Occam’s razor, which states that the simplest solution is probably the best one. The validity of Occam’s razor is up for debate, as critics of the concept argue that it values simplicity over accuracy.)

If you’re feeling stuck, **look for the anomalies.** If one person or institution is having success where many are failing, ask what they're doing differently. For example, if one teacher in a school has significantly fewer classroom management issues than his colleagues, you might observe his class, and look for teaching practices he uses that aren't being used in other classrooms.

(Shortform note: Anomalies have the potential to drive innovation, but they can be difficult to spot because they challenge our expectations. Because human brains are wired for pattern recognition, we easily filter out information that doesn't fit patterns we’re used to. However, even though spotting anomalies doesn't come naturally, psychologist Gary Klein suggests it’s a skill we can improve through practice and a commitment to open-minded curiosity.)

When attempting to implement a critical practice, **consider your timing.** The authors explain that identifying a critical practice isn't just about identifying the right behavior, but identifying the right behavior at the right time. For example, experts say that when potty training children, the timing of when you introduce the new behavior is critical—too early and your child won’t be ready, too late and they’ll be harder to train.

(Shortform note: Daniel H. Pink elaborates on the importance of timing in his 2018 book _When._ Pink describes how humans’ capacity for focus and creativity changes depending on the time of day. Pink’s conclusions suggest that the timing of the introduction of critical practices matters down to the detail of the time of day.)

It can also help to **check for blind spots.** Sometimes the critical practices are the ones that challenge the status quo. These behaviors can often be the hardest to initiate because they defy long-standing behavior expectations and often require changing the culture itself. For example, in the US, people say “I’m fine” when someone asks how they're doing, regardless of how they're actually feeling. Getting people to be honest about how they're feeling would be a challenging norm to change.

> **The Challenge of Changing Culture**
> 
> Sometimes the behaviors we need to change are the most difficult to see because they’re a part of the culture we live in, and culture is challenging to change because it’s built on shared values and belief systems. Not only do our values take time to evolve, but we’re often very attached to them.
> 
> In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear explains that to sustain the adoption of behaviors, the new behaviors must match your sense of self. He refers to three necessary layers of change—your goal, your habits, and finally your identity. This final layer encompasses all your opinions, beliefs, and assumptions about yourself and the world; therefore, the final layer isn't only the most important, but also the slowest to evolve. Because culture change requires an evolution of values, and values are slow to change, culture change can’t happen quickly.

Finally, **the authors emphasize the importance of testing your hypothesis.** Just because you’ve identified what you think is a critical practice doesn’t mean it’s the right one or the one that will have the impact that you hope for. Sometimes a well-intentioned critical practice has unpredictable outcomes. For example, as some companies have shifted to unlimited paid time off (PTO) policies to attract workers and address employee burnout, studies suggest that employees with unlimited PTO actually end up taking less time off. So as you're attempting to implement critical practices, make sure the critical practice has the outcome you want it to.

(Shortform note: While the _Influencer_ authors warn against undesirable unintended consequences, sometimes unintended consequences can have a positive outcome. For example, when disability advocates in the 1960s pushed for the broad implementation of ramped curbs on sidewalk corners (“curb cuts''), they didn’t anticipate how much the changes would also benefit the elderly, people pushing strollers, or travelers pulling roller bags. The response to the addition of curb cuts was so positive that it became known as “the curb cut effect”—the conclusion that disability-centered design is universally beneficial.)

### Step 3: Use Every Area of Impact

After creating a goal and identifying critical practices, the third step of being an influencer is using every tool in your tool box to encourage the adoption of the necessary critical practices. In the following section, we'll explore six areas of impact identified by the authors and discuss strategies for influencing behavior in each area.

To ensure that people adopt critical practices, **influencers must exert as much influence as possible wherever possible.**(Shortform note: Unlike the authors of _Influencer,_ some self-help authors, like Tony Robbins, focus only on the individual’s ability to change their own behavior, without acknowledging the multiple co-existing variables that impact an individual’s conscious and unconscious decision-making.)

The authors suggest that two main variables affect behavior: _inspiration_ and _skill._ They identify six areas of impact that influence people’s ability and desire to change their behavior:

  * _Individual Inspiration_ : Do I want to do it?
  * _Collective Inspiration_ : Do the people around me encourage me to do it?
  * _Environmental Inspiration_ : Do the systems in place incentivize me to do it?
  * _Individual Skill_ : Can I do it?
  * _Collective Skill_ : Do the people around me empower me to do it?
  * _Environmental Skill_ : Do the systems in place give me what I need to do it?



According to the authors, many would-be influencers make the mistake of trying to effect change haphazardly, attempting to make changes in only one or two areas at a time. This rarely works. Instead,**** the authors**** argue that taking advantage of all six areas of impact will all but guarantee that the critical practices are adopted.

> **Fundamental Attribution Error**
> 
> The authors make clear that in order to successfully exert influence, you must consider the skill and motivation of both the individual and their community. Interestingly, in the United States people tend to incorrectly attribute the root cause of all behavior to the individual—a phenomenon called “fundamental attribution error.” People overestimate the influence of internal factors, like personality, and underestimate the impact of external factors, like environment or social relationships.
> 
> Research has shown that more individualistic cultures, like the US, Canada, or Great Britain are more likely to fall into the trap of the fundamental attribution error and attribute individual successes and failures to a person’s disposition. On the other hand, collectivist cultures are more likely to recognize the impact of collective relationships.

#### Inspiration

In the next sections, we'll discuss the first three areas of impact that affect people’s _desire_ to perform a critical practice: individual inspiration, collective inspiration, and environmental inspiration.

##### Individual Inspiration

**The first area of impact is personal inspiration.** In this section we'll answer the question: How do you persuade people to adopt a critical practice?

There are several reasons why motivating individuals to adopt critical practices is hard, according to the authors. First, the importance of a critical practice may not be objectively clear to the people you're trying to influence. Why change a behavior if you don’t see a reason to? Second, the critical practice required to reach a goal may not be immediately rewarding. For example, if the goal is to decrease cholesterol levels, one critical practice is reducing the consumption of fatty foods. Unfortunately, for many of us, fatty foods are immediately satisfying, even if there are long-term consequences. Long-term benefit is harder to sell than immediate satisfaction.

(Shortform note: Psychology and economics professor Dan Ariely points to a third reason why it can be hard to motivate people to change their behavior. In their personal and professional lives, people often have numerous responsibilities that leave them mentally and emotionally drained. Change requires an additional mental load that can further demotivate people to adopt new practices.)

When someone seems unmotivated to change their behavior, the authors caution against judging their lack of inspiration as laziness, selfishness, or apathy. **Lack of motivation is rarely an innate flaw.** More often it’s the result of a lack of focus on what's important or lack of awareness about the impact of their behavior. Instead of judgment, the authors advocate for empathy and curiosity.

(Shortform note: This empathetic approach to leadership is similar to a common client-centered therapeutic practice known as “unconditional positive regard.” Unconditional positive regard assumes that every person deserves acceptance and support and has the internal resources necessary for their own healing and growth. It is a non-judgmental approach that honors individuals’ unique perspectives, strengths, and areas of improvement. Leaders can use unconditional positive regard in the workplace to make sure all employees feel valued and supported. Increasing an employee's sense of belonging will in turn increase their intrinsic motivation to contribute to the collective good of an organization.)

The authors offer several strategies that influencers use to address these challenges and help people see the purpose and value in adopting a critical practice:

First, they recommend avoiding coercion. As an influencer, you must first **honor personal agency** by not mandating behavior, which could decrease motivation and increase resistance. Instead of dictating behavior, the authors recommend providing the opportunity to opt into the critical practice. Offer the new practice as an invitation rather than a directive. People will more willingly come aboard if they feel they have a choice.

(Shortform note: In psychology, our resistance to being told what to do is called “psychological reactance,” and occurs when something happens that we perceive as a threat to our freedom. People who tend to see themselves as unique and distinct from other people are more likely to perceive demands on them as a threat to their identity, so offering the new practice as an invitation rather than a demand may be even more impactful for these individualists.)

Next, **ground the behavior in reality.** Help people see the importance of putting critical practices into action by providing experiences and stories, so that behaviors that might seem unappealing at first glance begin to resonate.

(Shortform note: First-hand experiences and stories are powerful tools because they touch on human emotions. Psychologists and rhetoricians agree that logic alone rarely wins arguments, so influencers must deploy emotions strategically to persuade people to change their behavior. According to research, different emotions can have different impacts depending on the situation. For example, one study showed that shame was more effective than pride in influencing voting behavior.)

People are also more likely to want to adopt critical practices if you **make it fun**. The authors suggest making the behavior a part of a game or competition, ensuring there are ongoing opportunities for improvement and recognition to sustain motivation. For example, when people compete to get the highest number of steps in a day, they're more likely to increase their step count.

(Shortform note: Turning a critical practice into a game is an example of gamification, a growing trend in which elements of game design (like competition, levels, rewards, or points) are incorporated into an experience. Gamification has become increasingly popular in large part due to its demonstrated ability to increase participant engagement. Evidence of gamification can be seen from brand marketing strategies to education to productivity apps. However, some studies have shown that the use of gamification strategies in the workplace actually has a negative impact on employee well-being, engagement, and job satisfaction.)

##### Collective Inspiration

**The second area of impact influencers should focus on is collective inspiration.** In this section we'll answer the question: How can you use the power of community connection to inspire people to adopt a critical practice?

Humans are social creatures, and therefore our social relationships are a powerful resource to exert influence. The authors offer the following strategies as tools for capitalizing on social connection as a tool of inspiration: (Shortform note: Humans’ innate desire to connect and build relationships isn't only emotionally beneficial, but is also a crucial variable in our evolutionary success. Our empathy has allowed us to build collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships that have contributed to our survival.)

**Start by being a leader.** If you're respected and trusted in your community, people are more likely to listen to your opinion and advice. The opposite is also true: If you lack the admiration and trust of the people you're trying to influence, there's very little you can do to persuade them to act. The authors suggest that selfless acts, like giving up time and money or apologizing when you make a mistake, are effective ways to build trust in your leadership.

(Shortform note: Brendan Burchard, author of _High Performance Habits,_ also points to generosity as a fundamental tool to become an influential leader. He argues that the more you give to the people around you, the more they'll trust you. However, he adds that being able to ask for what you want and elevating people with words of encouragement and appreciation are also fundamental skills of influential leadership.)

Once you’ve established yourself as a leader, **recruit other leaders.** There are often a few people in any community others look to for guidance. The authors refer to these figures as “opinion leaders.” These community leaders often have a wealth of knowledge and a higher level of work or education experience than the general populace. Getting the unspoken leaders on board with your plans will have a disproportionately large impact on the larger community.

(Shortform note: Opinion leaders are a part of the “informal network” of a company or community— a web of social ties that can exert as much influence, or more, than the formal leadership structure. Some change management experts recommend a “network analysis,” a survey of client relationships and attitudes, as a tool to identify members of the informal network who exert a disproportionate amount of influence.)

However, even with leaders on board, you'll still likely have to **transform the culture.** One tool for changing culture is establishing widespread accountability. Each person should be responsible for themselves and for their team members to ensure that new cultural norms are followed. For example, the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign that was implemented after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York was an effort to shift the culture of public safety so that it became the responsibility of everyone instead of only the transit authority personnel.

(Shortform note: While many organizational leaders talk about the importance of accountability in the workplace, there are ways that a culture of accountability can go wrong. For example, conversations about being held accountable often focus on negative or undesirable behaviors. If people feel as if they're always being critiqued, they'll become increasingly demoralized. A healthy culture of accountability must grow out of a commitment to the collective good, which requires celebrating successes in addition to areas of growth.)

##### Environmental Inspiration

**The third area of impact is environmental inspiration.** In this section we'll answer the question: How can you use environmental structures and policies to inspire the adoption of a critical practice?

Environmental inspiration encompasses the use of rewards and punishments to inspire certain behaviors. The authors offer the following strategies for using these systems to reinforce internal and collective inspiration:

The first step is to**remove roadblocks.** Before implementing incentives, look closely to see if there are any structures in place that might be disincentivizing the desired critical practice. For example, if a floor manager wants assembly line workers to slow down to improve product quality, but she pays them based on the number of products produced per hour, she is incentivizing speed and disincentivizing slow, methodical work. This practice is a roadblock to the critical behavior she is trying to implement.

(Shortform note: In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear suggests using environmental design as a tool to remove roadblocks. He argues that visual cues are an especially strong trigger for habit formation, therefore removing visual cues that trigger negative behaviors will help facilitate behavior change. For example, removing alcohol from your direct sight line can help minimize consumption.)

The authors recommend that you **use rewards sparingly** because incentives can harm intrinsic motivation. Also, rewards don’t have to be big. Intentional symbolic rewards, like a companywide shout-out or thoughtfully written card can be just as powerful as monetary incentives.

Then**use punishment as a last resort.** There are times when punishment is necessary, but it’s the least effective of your influencer strategies. Sometimes a warning or the threat of punishment can be as effective as the punishment itself. However, when necessary, don’t be afraid to enact punishments. A strategic and timely punishment can have ripple effects throughout a community. For example, if a treatment program states that any kind of substance abuse will result in dismissal from the program and then follows through when a program participant is found under the influence, the message will be clear to the other members of the community that the behavior expectations of the program are taken seriously.

> **The Evolution of Motivation Strategies**
> 
> In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink argues that there was a time when rewards and punishments were a more effective tool of motivation. During the industrial era, most people were working in factories in jobs that required a concrete set of skills and little to no creativity. The tasks were simple and measurable. Extrinsic rewards worked well for this type of routine work.
> 
> However, the new economy, according to Pink, is characterized by jobs that require creativity, collaboration, and long-term thinking. The classic “carrot and stick” model no longer works as a motivational tool. In fact, it can have the exact opposite effect—rewards can decrease intrinsic motivation, while punishments often only lead to short-term results.
> 
> Instead, to increase motivation, Pink recommends giving people a sense of purpose and the opportunity for autonomy and mastery in their work.

#### Skill

Having addressed the three areas of impact that impact people’s _inspiration_ to implement a critical practice, we'll now explore the three areas of impact that affect people’s _ability_ to implement a critical practice: individual skill, collective skill, and environmental skill.

##### Individual Skill

**The fourth area of impact influencers should focus on is individual skill.** In this section we'll answer the question: How can you ensure that people have the skills necessary to perform the critical practice?

Most importantly, the authors argue that effective influencers must believe in what Carol Dweck refers to as a _growth mindset_ —the understanding that you, and others, are capable of learning and getting better at something—because implementing critical practices almost always involves learning new skills. Instead of telling people what they need to do, effective influencers spend their time creating opportunities for people to learn and practice the skills they need.

> **The Debate Over Growth Mindset**
> 
> There has been some debate about the impact of a growth mindset on skill development. After Carol Dweck published _Mindset_ in 1998, the concept quickly became a part of the conversation about how to improve student outcomes in schools. However, some studies found that encouraging a growth mindset in students had little to no impact on their academic performance, while others demonstrated that students who had adopted a growth mindset received higher grades and showed increased motivation.
> 
> Dweck has gone on to clarify that in order for a growth mindset to be impactful, “the environment has to support the belief change and the behaviors that come with it.” In the context of exerting influence, believing in a growth mindset is less important than creating an environment that celebrates learning, mistakes, and failures as much as it does success.

The authors recommend using the following strategies to help people learn and practice critical behaviors:

To support skill development, **provide** **opportunities for intense focus over short periods of time.** This intentional practice requires deep concentration that cannot be sustained over long periods of time; therefore, it's best to practice skills for short periods of time before focus begins to fade.

(Shortform note: In _Peak_ , Anders Ericsson elaborates on this idea of practice, arguing that not all forms of practice are created equal. He echoes the authors’ belief in the value of short, intense training sessions, but goes on to add that the highest form of practice is _deliberate_ practice in which the learner’s work is measurable, competitive, time-tested, and observed by a teacher or coach. According to Ericsson, engaging in deliberate practice is the best way to become an expert at any skill.)

As people practice a skill, **offer ongoing feedback based on clear expectations.** According to the authors, consistent feedback is more important than the time spent developing a skill. Not only does frequent feedback help people improve their skills more quickly, but it's also motivating to observe ongoing progress and areas of growth.

(Shortform note: As you support others in learning a skill, be wary of “feedback fatigue,” emotional depletion caused by ongoing negative feedback. While people seek out opportunities to improve and grow, we also crave acceptance. Everyone’s threshold for constructive feedback is different. If you notice that someone is constantly second-guessing their work, is overly self-deprecating, or rejects positive feedback, it might be a sign they're experiencing feedback fatigue.)

Throughout the process, **normalize setbacks.** People will struggle to learn new skills if they lack the resilience to work through challenges. Learning something new isn't a smooth road, and you'll have more success if you normalize the challenges that will come along the way. (Shortform note: When learning a new skill, not only is it important to normalize setbacks, but also to accept failure as an integral part of the learning process. A 2019 study found that to achieve optimal learning, people need to fail about 15% of the time. When we reflect on failures, we have the opportunity to apply our learning again, increasing our rate and retention of knowledge.)

Finally, the authors say, **don’t underestimate the importance of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, or** “soft skills.” People’s ability to work effectively with others and manage their own emotions is critical to their long-term success and ability to persist through challenges. (Shortform note: While some people argue that soft skills cannot be taught, research has shown that coaching and mentoring programs have led to dramatic increases in participants’ resilience, focus, and self-regulation.)

##### Collective Skill

**The fifth area of impact is collective skill.** In this section we'll answer the question: How can you ensure that a community’s skills contribute to individual adoption of a critical practice?

Our communities have the power to enable critical behaviors or deter them. For example, studies have shown that if people see more garbage on the ground, they're more likely to litter themselves. (Shortform note: While we’re influenced by those around us, people also have the desire to be distinct from one another. Jonah Berger, author of _Invisible Influence_ , calls this tension the Goldilocks Effect—the human desire to be “optimally distinct.” While being a part of a group provides a sense of community and belonging, differentiating ourselves from the group reminds us that we are also unique.)

The authors offer the following strategies to ensure that community members are working collectively to support the individual adoption of critical practices:

**First, tap into the power of collective creativity and wisdom.** Groups often hold more wisdom than any single individual. When confronting challenges and setbacks, individuals should know that they can rely on the collective wisdom of the people around them. For example, in the age of remote work, many workplaces have established Slack channels specifically for employees to use when they need help—allowing them to tap into the collective wisdom of colleagues to solve challenges at work.

> **The Wisdom of Crowds**
> 
> In _The Wisdom of Crowds_ , James Surowiecki clarifies that not all crowds are necessarily wise. For example, mob mentality or pack mentality describes how people can act against their better judgment when caught up in the emotions of a crowd.
> 
> Surowiecki points to five criteria necessary to create a “wise crowd:”
> 
>   * Diversity of opinion: Each person is able to develop their own interpretation of the known facts.
> 
>   * Independence: People’s opinions aren't determined by the opinions of others.
> 
>   * Decentralization: Each person can draw on their own specific expertise and knowledge.
> 
>   * Aggregation: The collective decision is determined by the accumulation of private decisions.
> 
>   * Trust: Individuals trust the judgment and fairness of the group as a whole.
> 
> 


Next, **provide an outside perspective.** People can’t always see their own work clearly. Hearing the observations of other people and getting consistent specific feedback allow everyone to see their own progress more clearly, and become proficient more quickly. An outside perspective can be offered by a colleague, a friend, or someone outside the community. (Shortform note: Soliciting outsider feedback is important because people have a tendency toward confirmation bias—the cognitive bias that causes us to favor information that reinforces existing beliefs. External feedback provides a balance to our own subjective interpretation of our work and behaviors.)

Both the above strategies work to **nurture a sense of solidarity** , according to the authors**.** Influencers encourage everyone to act in ways that benefit the collective good rather than the individual. This not only cultivates community buy-in, but it also creates widespread accountability where everyone is looking out for each other.

(Shortform note: While the authors embrace the importance of nurturing solidarity, they don't offer specific strategies that influencers can use to cultivate a cohesive community. In _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , Patrick Lencioni outlines the five most common “dysfunctions'' that prevent a team from working collectively, and offers concrete steps to remedy dysfunctional teams: build trust, address conflict, get buy-in, hold everyone accountable, and celebrate group outcomes.)

##### Environmental Skill

**The sixth and final area of impact is environmental skill.** In this section we'll answer the question: How can you ensure that people’s environment encourages the adoption of a critical practice?

The authors note that our environment has a deceptively strong impact on our behavior, so it can be a powerful (and often underutilized) resource in influencing the adoption of critical practices. For example, many city planners are looking at ways to increase sustainable commuting practices, like biking, walking, or taking public transportation. Studies have shown that cities that invest in biking infrastructure see a significant rise in bike commuters. Changing the environment by adding more bike lanes or bike-friendly roadways results in a change in commuter behavior.

The challenge is that our environment is so much a part of our daily lives that it's often hard to see the way in which it shapes our everyday behaviors.**** Because of this, the authors suggest that the first step is to become more aware of our environment. After that, we can start to discern how aspects of our environment encourage or discourage certain behaviors.

> **The Power of Environment**
> 
> Alexandra Horowitz explores the human challenge of “seeing” our environment in her 2013 book _On Looking._ Horowitz highlights two themes of environmental awareness. First, because of our evolved pattern recognition, we practice “efficient seeing,” meaning we filter out the information in our environment that we don't deem crucial. Therefore, we rarely see all the nuances of our surroundings. Second, we see our environment through our own personal lens, so no person experiences the same environment the same way.
> 
> Despite the challenge of looking at our environments holistically, it's a crucial skill. Studies in the field of environmental psychology have shown that our environment, natural or man-made, not only affects our behaviors, but also our physical and mental health. For example, poor housing quality has been shown to cause psychological distress, and the mental health of psychiatric in-patients is impacted by how furniture is arranged in common spaces. Becoming more aware of our environment is the first step in designing spaces that promote mental health and facilitate desirable behaviors.

The authors offer the following strategies to make sure the environment is conducive to the adoption of critical practices:

**First, shine a spotlight on subconscious behaviors.** For example, if you find yourself snacking mindlessly during the day, keep the wrappers for all your snacks in a clear container on your desk. In doing so, you'll draw attention to a previously unconscious behavior and give yourself more agency in controlling that behavior. (Shortform note: In _The Power of your Subconscious Mind_ , Joseph Murray expands on the idea of drawing attention to our subconscious behaviors, suggesting that people have the power to use their conscious mind to change the habitual practices and patterns of thinking of their subconscious mind to create more frequent and positive experiences.)

As you’re thinking about the built environment, **focus on creating relationship-centered spaces.** The authors argue that relationships are built through proximity. If, as the authors suggest, relationships are crucial to ensuring that individuals have the ability and motivation to adopt a critical practice, then it's important to make sure your space facilitates community-building.

> **Relationship-Centered Design**
> 
> What does a “relationship-centered space” look like? Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, many offices, particularly in Silicon Valley, were implementing open office floor plans. At first glance, it would seem that open offices would encourage interaction and collaboration. However, in reality, studies found that companies that shifted to open floor plans saw a 70% decline in employee interactions.
> 
> As work culture continues to evolve, people are trying to figure out how to facilitate relationship building with a combination of in-person, hybrid, and remote work arrangements in play. Some suggest that the “hub-and-spoke” model works for all of these work styles. The hub-and-spoke model includes a central “hub” where people can gather and collaborate in-person and “spokes” that offer a more individual space, which could include private offices, satellite offices, or someone’s home.

Finally, **eliminate choice whenever possible.** The authors encourage influencers to make adopting the critical practices as easy as possible. For example, if you’re trying to get your family to eat healthier food, keep some fruit or nuts as a snack on the counter so they don’t have to choose between healthy snacks and junk food.

(Shortform note: In _Nudge,_ Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein refer to this option as the “default choice,” meaning the choice that’s automatically made if the chooser does nothing (for example, opting into a 401k by default). They recommend this strategy when attempting to get people to act in their own self-interest; however, the strategy could also be applied when thinking about how to get people to act in the best interest of a larger goal.)
