## Exercise: Evaluate and Adjust Your Attitude Toward Saving and Spending

Reflect upon how well you currently balance saving money and spending money on meaningful life experiences. Consider if you might need to shift the balance toward either spending or saving.

* * *

Do you feel you currently balance saving money with enjoying fulfilling life experiences? Or do you feel you prioritize one over the other? Briefly describe your attitude toward saving and spending and note if you think this attitude is serving your overall happiness.

What are some experiences youâ€™d still like to have during your lifetime? Describe three and note at what age it would make the most sense to have each.

Now, briefly consider how you might shift the balance of your current saving and spending patterns to enable you to have the experiences you noted. For instance, if you want to have a stronger network of friends right now, you might need to spend more money on social events. Conversely, if you currently spend a lot of money on social events but want to go back to graduate school in a few years, you might need to start saving more now.
