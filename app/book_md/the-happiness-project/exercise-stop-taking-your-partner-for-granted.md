## Exercise: Stop Taking Your Partner for Granted

Almost everyone is guilty of taking their partner or their family members for granted at some point. Spend some time remembering what makes them great.

* * *

What are some habits or qualities of your partner or family member that you love, or find endearing?

Describe a few significant ways they contribute to your relationship or your household.

How does your partner or family member like to show love? (For example, your father loves helping fix your car, or your wife loves buying you small gifts.)

How can you express your gratitude to your partner in a way thatâ€™s meaningful to them?
