## Exercise: Determine What “Good” Spending Looks Like

Knowing what kind of spending feels good for you can help you spend your money in happier ways.

* * *

What’s a small splurge that makes you feel good and creates a feeling of growth? (For example, spending money on your hobby, or splurging on high-quality ingredients for your meals.)

How can you commit to _rarely_ indulging in this meaningful splurge? (For example, setting small growth benchmarks within your hobby that “warrant” a splurge, or only buying expensive ingredients when you’re trying a brand-new recipe.)
