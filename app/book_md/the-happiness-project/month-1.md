## Month 1: Get Energized

To kick off your happiness project, focus on bringing more _energy_ into your life. This is a vital starting point because resolutions and long-term projects are often hard to maintain—the more energy you have, the more motivated you’ll be to stick with your plans and goals. Additionally, boosting your energy starts a positive cycle. Having energy allows you to take part in things that foster happiness—such as social events or your hobbies—and increases your self-esteem, and taking part in happiness-fostering, self-esteem boosting events give you more energy in return.

**There are two types of energy to address this month—your physical energy and your mental energy.** First, we’ll discuss ways to increase your physical energy, which will give you the push you need to work on getting your mental energy in order.

### Improve Your Physical Energy

Improving your physical energy is a good starting point for your happiness project. **_Happiness_ is an overwhelming and intangible goal, but small steps toward simply being physically healthier are tangible and achievable—naturally increasing your willingness to pursue the goal of happiness**. There are two important steps to increasing your physical energy: _getting better sleep_ and _exercising more_.

#### Get Better Sleep

Most people don’t get the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night. While you may be _used_ to feeling sleepy, your body still suffers the physical and mental effects, such as impaired memory, a slow metabolism, and a weak immune system. Getting more sleep can combat these effects, in addition to cutting your afternoon crash and making you less irritable.

There are two main reasons that you might not be getting enough sleep or often stay up far later than you should.

  * **First, you feel you have too much to do.** The end of the day is “me” time for many people—the time to read, do housework or paperwork, or spend time with your spouse. You fear that by going to bed “too early,” you’re missing out on experiences. 
  * **Second, you may be avoiding your bedtime routine.** It’s counterintuitive, but many people will stay up even when they’re tired because the thought of completing their bedtime routine—washing their face, laying out clothes for the next day, brushing their teeth—feels too exhausting. 



##### How Can You Get More, Better Sleep?

There are three effective ways to train your brain to get to sleep earlier.

  * First, put your brain “to bed”—don’t do anything that will stimulate your brain late at night. For example, instead of playing video games, read a book. Additionally, lower your lights at night—this signals to your brain that it’s time for sleep. 
  * Second, question your “me” time. If you’re staying up because you have too much to do, ask yourself: Am I really enjoying these activities or performing them effectively if I’m exhausted? Where possible, push your tasks to other times when you’ll be more alert, like the weekend. 
  * Third, get ready well before your bedtime, _before_ you’re too exhausted for your routine. 



**Good sleep is a difficult commitment—there will always be more “urgent” matters.** But, as it’s the foundation for your mood and energy throughout your happiness project, it’s worth the effort. Try putting reminders of your good-sleep resolution around your home, and set an alarm for your bedtime.

#### Exercise More

Besides helping you get better sleep, exercise comes with myriad benefits such as improved mental clarity, lower risk of dementia, and boosted energy. However, 25% of Americans don’t get _any_ exercise—even though it takes just a bit to see results. Studies show that**just 20 minutes of exercise three days a week improved the energy levels of chronically tired people.**

There are several simple ways to start—and stick to—exercise routines.

  * **Ask a friend.** Studies show that asking someone how happy they are doing an activity often reveals how happy _you’ll_ be partaking in the same activity. Find a friend who loves their routine, and try it out for yourself. If you don’t like it, try again with a different routine. If you _do_ enjoy it, you’ll be motivated to stick with it.
  * **Walk when you can.** Walking is a low-intensity exercise that comes with many benefits—it reduces stress, provides a quick increase in energy, and getting out into the sunlight stimulates dopamine and serotonin production, improving your mood. Furthermore, it’s very accessible—you just need to commit yourself to it. You can do this in several ways. First, vow to walk when you need to run errands that are reasonably close by. Second, get a pedometer—it will help you track your daily activity and striving to hit 10k steps gives you a bit of extra motivation.



### Improve Your Mental Energy

Once your physical energy is ramping up, focus on tasks that will enhance your mental energy: **tidying up __** and **clearing away your mental clutter.**

#### Tidy Up

Your surroundings affect your attitude, calmness, and energy. Clutter in your home drains your energy, while eliminating clutter in favor of useful, well-liked things is energizing because it:

  * Alleviates the guilt you feel about bad purchases or too-small clothing. 
  * Eliminates the frustration of not being able to find what you’re looking for. 
  * Surrounds you with more of what makes you happy—even though you might have _fewer_ belongings, in the end, they’re the belongings that you genuinely like and use.
  * Cuts down on choice. Often, too many options make you feel overwhelmed or discouraged—this is why you feel you have “nothing to wear” even with a closet full of clothing. Having fewer, better choices is more satisfying and less overwhelming.



Don’t look at your whole house at once—this will make the task feel insurmountable. Instead, **pick _one_ place to start—such as your bedroom closet, the dining room table, or the kids’ playroom—and take stock of your clutter.** To _clearly_ see what needs to be eliminated, understand that “clutter” takes many forms.

  * **Nostalgia clutter** includes items you’re holding onto from your past, even though you don’t need or use them, such as hockey equipment from your college days. 
  * **“Useful” clutter** includes items that _are_ useful, just not for _you_. This clutter looks like boxes of old cell phone chargers or half-empty cans of house paint. 
  * **Sales clutter** includes items you bought because they were on sale, but don’t use, such as impractical clothing or one-purpose kitchen gadgets. 
  * **Free clutter** includes items**** you’ve accumulated because they were given or handed down to you, such as company tote bags or a gifted purse that’s not your style.
  * **“Shouldn't” clutter** includes items that you’re holding onto but really shouldn't use anymore, such as ratty sweatshirts or a half-broken pair of skis. 
  * **Ambitious clutter** includes items that you have the _ambition_ to use, but probably won’t, such as scrapbooking materials or fancy cake decorating supplies.
  * **Buyer’s remorse clutter** includes bad purchases—while holding onto it feels like you’re “using” it in some way, giving it away would feel like admitting you made a poor choice.



For each of your decluttering tasks, set up three piles: _throw away_ , _give away_ , and _keep._ Then, assign your items to one of these piles.

  * Put anything that is objectively useless into the _throw away_ pile, such as t-shirts that are riddled with holes or phone chargers from the early 2000s. 
  * _Give away_ anything that’s usable but you’ll realistically never use, such as pants that haven’t fit for 5 years or the breadmaker still in its sealed box. 



**Be ruthless.** Once you’ve made your obvious throw-away and give-away choices, things become a bit trickier—you’ll now have to consciously work against your rationale for keeping unnecessary things. Ask yourself: Do I have a specific plan for using this item within the next month? If not, give it away. If you say, “I _would_ or _could_ use this…” that indicates that it’s _not_ something you use. If you say, “I _have_ used this…” it means it’s not in _regular_ use. Give it away.

##### Maintaining a Clutter-Free Home

One of the most difficult parts of getting rid of clutter is maintaining a clutter-free home, but you can stay on top of it by effectively **identifying the problems** and setting up **daily decluttering rituals**.

**Identifying the problems:** If you’re having a recurring clutter problem, think about the _root_ _problem_ of the clutter—this will naturally lead you toward solutions. For example, if you’re constantly picking up shoes all over the first floor of your house the problem is likely that there’s no convenient place to put them. Put a shoe rack by the front and back doors.

**Set up daily decluttering rituals.** Putting two daily rules in place will help make sure that your space doesn’t become overrun with clutter again. First is the _one-minute rule_ —if a task can be accomplished in one minute, such as putting away clean dishes, do it right away. Second is the _before bed ritual_ —spend ten minutes before bed tidying up your space. Not only does this create a happier and less stressful environment to wake up to, but it’s also a calming physical activity that primes you for good sleep.

> **Tried and True Decluttering Tips**
> 
> Rubin’s blog readers offered their best solutions for keeping their homes free of clutter—they may help you stick to your clear space resolutions, too.
> 
>   * When you’re deciding where to start decluttering, focus on the places you’re most likely to dump all your stuff—such as the entryway, That Chair in your bedroom, or the dining room table.
> 

>   * When you buy a new electronic device, put all its parts into a labeled Ziploc bag—this way, you can always find the right accessories when you need them, you don’t end up with a box of mystery cords, and if you get rid of the item in question you ensure that you get rid of _all_ of it.
> 

>   * Pretend you’re packing for a move. Walk around your space and ask yourself, “Would I pack this up and move it with me?” If not, give it away.

#### Take Care of Mental Clutter

You need to take your mental clutter out alongside the physical clutter. **This means confronting your list of incomplete tasks that makes you feel overwhelmed and guilty whenever you think about it.**

While putting off tasks for “later” feels easy in the moment, tackling them is vital to your happiness because constantly thinking of your to-do list is a huge drain on your mental energy. Letting these tasks nag at you doesn’t make sense because many of them—such as sending an email or asking for a favor— _aren’t particularly time-consuming_. The mental space you allow them to occupy is disproportionate to their size or difficulty. There are two steps to clearing out this unnecessary mental clutter.

  1. Sit down and list all the tasks bouncing around your mind—such as emails to be sent, coffee dates to set up, repairs to be done, doctor appointments to make, and so on. Include every task you can think of, large and small. 
  2. Commit yourself to working down the list and checking off tasks. Here, your physical list comes in handy—the physical action of crossing items off a list and visualizing progress is inherently motivating and energizing.



Throughout this process, practice acceptance of how tasks tend to multiply.

  * Some tasks create _more_ tasks. For example, taking your car to the mechanic may create the new task of ordering a new part. 
  * Some tasks are “forever” tasks to check off the list every day, such as flossing your teeth or taking your vitamins. 



### Acting With Energy

Lastly, though this month will help you boost your energy levels, you won’t always feel energetic. **To give your physical and mental energy levels a pick-me-up, commit to acting with energy whether you feel energized or not.** For you, this could look like taking a 15-minute walk in the middle of the workday, or putting more energy into your voice when talking to students. Or, when you’re playing with your children, come up with games that _demand_ energy from you—such as tag or coming up with a play—instead of looking for ways to play with them in the least exhausting way possible.
