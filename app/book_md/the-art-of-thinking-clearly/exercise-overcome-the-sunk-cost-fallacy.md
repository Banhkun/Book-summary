## Exercise: Overcome the Sunk Cost Fallacy

The sunk cost fallacy means that the more you invest in something, the more you value that thing. This means you’ll hold onto things you’ve heavily invested in beyond their usefulness. You can overcome the sunk cost fallacy by focusing on the future benefits or consequences keeping that activity or item would bring.

* * *

Describe something you’ve been investing in. (It could be a hobby, a business, stocks, or anything that takes time, money, or effort.)

Next, describe the potential benefits and consequences of keeping that activity or item. How likely is it that those benefits and consequences will occur? (Be realistic: The goal is to get an objective view of the situation.)

Now, describe the potential benefits and consequences of discarding that activity or item and their likelihood of occurring.

Finally, weigh the potential benefits and consequences of each option. Does it make more sense to keep or discard the activity or item? Explain your reasoning.
