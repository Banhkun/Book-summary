## Chapter 10: You Have Too Much of a Good Thing

Our next set of fallacies revolve around situations in which you have too much of a good thing. Many times, you make bad decisions because you don’t have enough options, information, or experience to make logical ones. However, _too many_ options, information, or experience can also inspire irrational decisions, Dobelli says.

In this chapter, we’ll look at the following situations where excess causes irrationality:

  * Too many options
  * Too much information
  * Too much experience



### Too Many Options

The first situation we’ll cover is having too many options. Most people think that having more options to choose from is better than having fewer, Dobelli says. However, **having** **too many options can be just as bad as not having enough** for three reasons:

**1\. Having too many options paralyzes you.** A wide range of options makes you so afraid of choosing the wrong one that you avoid any decision, Dobelli says. (Shortform note: Some people tie this paralysis to loss aversion, discussed in Chapter 5. The more options available, the more options you _lose_ by choosing. You fear losing the other options more than you want to gain a single option by choosing, so you don’t choose.)

**2\. Having too many options lowers your standards.** Lower standards make your decision easier by lessening the analysis needed for each choice, Dobelli adds. For example, if you’re overwhelmed by options for a new dishwasher, you won’t look for an affordable, quiet model that’s the right size with a good warranty. Instead, you’ll pick whichever one is the right size, regardless of other features.

(Shortform note: You make your choice easier by lowering your standards because you’re suffering from _decision fatigue_. Analyzing your options drains your willpower, leaving you without any willpower to make the final decision. Therefore, to make a decision, you dismiss your standards, focusing your remaining willpower on a single feature.)

**3\. Having too many options inspires uncertainty.** After making your decision, you’ll be unhappy because you’ll never be sure it was the right choice, Dobelli says. With so many other options available, how do you know a different dishwasher wasn’t the better choice after all?

(Shortform note: This uncertainty stems from buyer’s remorse. You narrow your choice criteria, as discussed above, but you don’t forget about all the other options and features you’re sacrificing. You _ignore_ those options to make your choice easier, but once you’ve made your decision, the knowledge of what you ignored returns, inspiring remorse and uncertainty.)

How can you avoid being overwhelmed by too many options? Dobelli suggests **writing down the qualities that are important to you before evaluating your options.** This stops you from becoming overwhelmed because it lets you immediately dismiss options that don’t fit your criteria.

(Shortform note: When writing down the qualities you want, be realistic about what you can actually gain. For example, if you can’t afford the dishwasher that meets all your criteria, then you can’t gain that dishwasher and need to broaden your scope. This mindset also applies when you’re making life-changing decisions. While “You can do anything” is a nice sentiment, it’s not actually true: What you can do is based on your past experience and skills. Thus, objectively evaluate your experience, skills, and options to focus on the options you can actually achieve. Doing so will ease decision anxiety and make you happier.)

### Too Much Information

People also consider having more information to be better than having less. However, too much information causes problems, too. Dobelli says **an excess of information causes problems in two ways: burying basic facts and wasting time.** When you have too much information, a lot of it’s irrelevant to your situation. This irrelevant information makes it harder to access the useful, basic facts about your situation. In addition, you have to waste time unearthing those basic facts.

For example, consider an expert teaching a freshman physics class. The expert has so much information on atomic physics that he struggles to simplify his course and focus on the information the freshmen need to know: The basic facts are buried by the teacher’s knowledge. In addition, the teacher wastes time discussing information beyond the freshmen’s level. The students have too much complex information and not enough time to understand the simpler information they actually need.

> **Information Overload in the Modern World**
> 
> The excess in information that Dobelli discusses is also called “information overload.” When experiencing information overload, your extensive knowledge is confusing rather than helpful. You can’t sort the information by relevance, so distracting, unimportant information intrudes on your thought processes.
> 
> The dangers of information overload that Dobelli discusses have grown increasingly severe in the modern world because there’s so much information available. Approximately 2.5 _quintillion_ bytes of information are put online _every day,_ and social media algorithms and 24-hour news cycles continually expose you to that information. Rather than helping people to stay updated with world events, this inundation of information makes it almost impossible to find the basic facts about certain situations because they’re buried by opinion pieces and analysis. This increases the time you spend trying to understand these situations.
> 
> Modern information overload arguably causes even more problems than Dobelli outlines: A lot of the information in the news is negative, and a constant influx of bad news sparks anxiety and depression. This is why many people take “information detoxes” or breaks from social media: When experiencing depressing information overload, ignorance really is bliss.

### Too Much Experience

Finally, having too much experience, which Dobelli calls “déformation professionnelle," can also cause problems. When you have a lot of experience in a particular field, **you form a rubric based on your experience that you follow when identifying and fixing problems.** This is an asset when dealing with problems in your field of expertise. However, you apply this rubric when dealing with problems outside your field of expertise, too. This leads you to misinterpret situations or use your knowledge in harmful ways.

For example, soldiers are experts in emotional regulation and efficiency. These rubrics of problem solving are essential to how soldiers think during conflict because they allow the soldiers to act quickly in high-stress situations. However, when they return home, the same rubrics that helped soldiers in the military can damage their relationships. Trying to deal with a crying toddler through emotional regulation and efficiency won’t end well.

To overcome this issue, Dobelli recommends **expanding your knowledge to give yourself as many rubrics of behavior as possible.** This means you’ll know the best ways to behave in a variety of fields and situations, not just the one you’re an expert in. It's especially important to compensate for any areas your existing rubrics and expertise leave undeveloped. The soldier, for example, might learn more about the benefits of emotions or how to accept people being less efficient.

> **Over-Experience, Common Sense, and Morality**
> 
> As discussed, Dobelli calls having too much experience “déformation professionnelle,” a play on the French phrase for professional training. The idea is that after a certain point, professional training stagnates your growth instead of helping you.
> 
> While most people agree with this definition of déformation professionnelle, some take it a step further. They argue that déformation professionnelle erodes your humanity as well as your adaptability. They say the modern focus on professional development means people discard their morals, compassion, and wisdom in favor of advancing their careers.
> 
> Even if you ascribe to the second definition, Dobelli’s recommendation to expand your collection of rubrics arguably fits. Forming other rubrics prevents you from focusing solely on professional development, protecting your humanity.
> 
> However, not everyone agrees with Dobelli’s recommendation. Some argue that you only need one rubric: common sense. They argue that if you step away from your rubric of expertise and look at your project with common sense, you’ll catch problems that your expertise hid.
> 
> That said, making this shift to common sense is very difficult. If you struggle to shift to your common sense rubric, you can also ask a non-expert for help. Chances are, they’ll be able to see a solution since they’re not blinded by expertise.
