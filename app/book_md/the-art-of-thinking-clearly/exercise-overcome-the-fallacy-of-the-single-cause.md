## Exercise: Overcome the Fallacy of the Single Cause

The fallacy of the single cause is the desire to simplify a situation until it has only one cause. This is problematic because everything is caused by a complex web of influences. You can use this knowledge of the web of influences to overcome the fallacy.

* * *

Describe a current project. Make a list of all potential influences on the success of that project.

Next, break those influences into two groups: “I can influence” and “I can’t influence.” (Be realistic. Influences like the location of a store you run might technically be under your control, but realistically, you can only change that if you have the funds to move.)

Finally, make a plan to experiment with each item under the “I can influence” group. For instance, if you’re running a store, you might change the frequency of your social media posts or the quantity of your stock and see how it affects sales. (Schedule these experiments one at a time so you can isolate how each influence affects your success.)
