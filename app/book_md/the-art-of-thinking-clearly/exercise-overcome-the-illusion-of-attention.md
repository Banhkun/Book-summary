## Exercise: Overcome the Illusion of Attention

The illusion of attention makes people think they’re paying attention to everything around them, when really, their brain discards many details it deems unimportant. You can overcome this illusion by challenging your expectations and assumptions of your situation.

* * *

Describe a situation where you thought you were paying attention to everything but were later surprised by something you missed. (This could be someone reacting differently than you anticipated or a decision having unexpected consequences.)

Next, describe your expectations and assumptions going into the situation. What did you think was going to happen? Why were you so sure? Be specific.

Next, consider what you missed that caused the situation to surprise you. Why didn’t you notice it?

Finally, make a plan for how you can reduce the illusion of attention in the future and catch all important details about a situation. (For instance, you might discuss your plans with other people so they can tell you if you’ve missed anything or reduce sensory input so you can register all important information.)
