## Exercise: Incorporate Purposeless Time Into Your Schedule

Make time for purposeless activities like hobbies to keep you grounded in the present.

* * *

Make a list of hobbies or leisure activities you enjoy. These can range from small, daily activities (like doing a crossword puzzle) to more involved pursuits (like traveling). If your list is long, pick three to five activities you feel you can commit to pursuing now.

Now, look at your weekly or monthly schedule and note down when you can make time for these enjoyable activities. Be realistic and only commit as much time as you truly think you can afford. Then, block that time off in your calendar to ensure you don’t schedule anything else at those times (for example, block off 20 minutes in the mornings for the crossword puzzle and a long weekend for travel).

Finally, to prevent yourself from backing out of your leisure activity, write down a few ways you’ll guard against distraction and keep your commitment. (For instance, you might silence your phone while doing the crossword or ask your boss now for the day off you want for travel).
