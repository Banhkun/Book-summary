## Exercise: Develop Your Patience by Drawing Out Completion of a Project

Enhance your capacity for patience by working on a big project over many shorter periods of time.

* * *

Think of a large project you’re working on or want to start working on and describe it briefly. How long will this project take you? (For example, you want to complete an art project you’ve been working on, which you estimate will take you 20 hours.)

Now, using your weekly calendar or schedule, note down when you could dedicate a short, set amount of time toward the completion of the larger project each week or day. Once you’ve determined the commitment you can make, add that commitment to your calendar. (You might wish to work on the project for 30 minutes every evening, for instance.)

Finally, put in place a framework to ensure you work on the project at the scheduled times and that you don’t spend more time than allocated. How will you ensure you sit down to your task when it’s scheduled? How will you ensure you stop working, even if the work is engaging? Write down tactics you’ll try. (For instance, you might turn working on your project into an after-dinner habit and create a reward for yourself after your time is up so you’re incentivized to stop.)
