## Part 3: Inspectional Reading

After elemental reading, the second level of reading is inspectional. According to the authors, inspectional reading is a skimming of the book to understand its main points and its structure. It aims to gain the best understanding of the book in a limited time (the authors advise setting a target for 15 minutes to comprehend a 300-page book).

Adler and Van Doren argue that when most people read a book, they do so cover to cover. When you read a book in that way, **you’re trying to understand what a book is _about_ at the same time you are trying to understand what the author is saying**. To contrast, if you start by skimming the entire book to get a sense of what it’s about before reading from the beginning, you’ll already be in the right headspace to process the information.

(Shortform note: Adler and Van Doren recommend inspectional reading as a precursor to analytical reading. However, if you don’t plan to come back and read the book analytically, you can make the most of reading it inspectionally by putting the book’s ideas into practice immediately in your daily life. That way, you’ll get the maximum benefit from the information even without a deep, analytical reading.)

### How to Read Inspectionally

After reading inspectionally, the authors believe you should be able to answer these three questions:

  * What genre does the book fit into?
  * What is the overall message of the book?
  * How does the author develop her arguments?



(Shortform note: You may also want to answer, “How qualified is the author to write a book on this subject?” For example, a hit new business book by a relatively unknown author may be less reliable than a book by an established business leader like Sam Walton, founder of Walmart and Sam’s Club (and author of _Made in America_). This isn’t a hard and fast rule as good ideas can come from anyone, regardless of their external qualifications, but it can help you decide how much to buy into the author’s ideas.)

#### Techniques for Inspectional Reading

  * Read the title.
    * How helpful this is depends on the book. Some titles tell the reader exactly what to expect from the book, like Ibram X. Kendi’s _How to Be an Antiracist_ or Henry Hazlitt’s _Economics in One Lesson. _However, many modern titles are less explicit, like Malcolm Gladwell’s _Blink. _
  * Read the preface and the blurb.
    * The author often explains what the book is about, and how to tackle it.
  * Read the table of contents.
    * (Shortform note: This is less effective if books obfuscate titles to generate a sense of mystery. For example, Ryan Holiday’s _Ego Is the Enemy_ features chapter titles like “To Be or to Do?” and “Follow the Canvas Strategy.” Without reading the book, it’s impossible to get a sense of what those chapters contain.)
  * Scan the index for a range of topics covered. More important topics will have more pages.
  * Find the main chapters of the book, and read the summary areas of those chapters.
    * The summary areas are often at the end of the chapter, or at the end of each major section.
  * Flip through the book to get a general sense of the book’s pacing and how the author’s argument will unfold. 
  * (Shortform note: This list of techniques is not exhaustive and doesn’t take into account 21st-century resources like online reviews and summaries. To take advantage of them, try reading the top Amazon reviews of the book or scanning through one of our book guides to get a sense of the book’s main arguments. Additionally, you may want to read the book’s introduction and spend time looking at any charts, graphs, or images.) 



In school, you may have learned to look up new words or concepts as you read. However, the authors believe this will make you miss the book’s main points because you’re getting too caught up in individual words and ideas. Instead, they advise reading difficult books straight through, without pausing to look anything up. Even if you understand less than 50% of the information, this cursory reading will improve your comprehension the second time around, ultimately saving time.

> **Inspectional Reading Techniques Helped Obama Become the Most Well-Read President**
> 
> Reading a difficult book straight through without pausing to look anything up is a familiar strategy for some well-read cultural icons. For example, in _A Promised Land, _former U.S. president Barack Obama describes how he relied on this technique while devouring classic books in high school. He’d circle words he didn’t know, finish the book, then go back and look those words up _after_ reading.
> 
> This technique clearly works well for Obama, as he’s known as one of the most well-read American presidents in history and even releases an annual list of his favorite books (which, over the years, have included works like _How Democracies Die_ by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt and _Factfulness _by Hans Rosling, among many others).
> 
> In addition to making him well-read, Obama’s penchant for reading difficult books shaped him into a deft writer. In describing Obama’s first memoir, _Dreams From My Father_ , one writer argued that “no other president has written a book that aspired to literature as clearly as Obama’s did.” This shows another benefit of reading well—it can improve your skill as a writer.

### Categorizing a Book

When starting a book, Adler and Van Doren recommend figuring out what genre of book it is. This prepares you to customize your engagement with the particular type of text because you’ll want to treat a book from one genre differently from books of a different genre. For example, if you’re reading a science fiction novel, you might reasonably expect to be entertained; but if you’re reading a dense text on quantum physics, you might reasonably expect to encounter some equations and challenging ideas.

Here is the authors’ hierarchy of genres at a glance. We’ll describe each category in more detail below.

![howtoreadabook_categories.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/howtoreadabook_categories.png)

  * Fiction vs Expository
    * Expository books contain facts, opinions, theories, data, and so on. These books can also be called “nonfiction.”
  * Theoretical vs Practical
    * Theoretical works primarily provide information about a subject. The authors of theoretical works aren’t necessarily trying to persuade you to act in any particular way. Practical works, on the other hand, are written under the assumption that the reader will put the information into action. All “how to” guides (including _How to Read a Book)_ are practical by definition.
  * The authors further break down theoretical works into history vs science vs philosophy.
    * **History** books describe a specific time and place in the past (unlike science and philosophy books, which are about universal phenomena that aren't bound to a specific historical context). 
    * **Science** deals with phenomena that you can’t observe or understand from life experience alone (for example, cellular proteins doing things unobservable to you; species evolving beyond your observable time scale).
    * **Philosophy** deals with things you can understand based on life experience alone, without any special tools or data (such as the nature of happiness).



> **The Limits of the Authors’ Classification System**
> 
> The broad genre categories that the authors discuss may not be a practical way to categorize _all_ nonfiction books. For example, according to Adler and Van Doren’s classifications, many social science books would fall under “philosophy” because they deal with interpersonal relationships, which are a visible and accessible phenomenon—but social science is a distinct discipline from philosophy.
> 
> We can compare the authors’ broad approach to more specific approaches to book classification. For example, Amazon organizes its “Books” department into 32 subcategories. That level of specificity might be more helpful for books that fall outside of strict science, history, and philosophy silos.
> 
> Additionally, the authors don’t break down the “fiction” category into further subcategories in their classification system. This implies that readers should have the same approach or set of expectations for every type of fiction, from epic fantasy sagas to poetry to short stories. However, later in the book, the authors acknowledge that that isn’t the case—they provide specific tips for approaching literature, poetry, and plays.
> 
> Finally, the authors assume there is a firm, universal distinction between theoretical and practical books. While they admit that there is an occasional overlap (as in, a book that is both practical and theoretical), this may be more common now than it was when Adler and Van Doren were writing. For example, Ibram X. Kendi’s _How to Be an Antiracist _appears thoroughly practical from the outset (the “how to” in the title points to this), but the book itself weaves in a heavy dose of theory, history, and even biography—none of which fall under the authors’ “practical” umbrella.

### Writing a Skeleton Outline

Once you’ve skimmed through a book, the authors recommend writing out a very general overview of the book’s structure and information.**** They propose a methodical way to do this:

  * First, articulate the thesis of the book in a sentence.
    * This is easiest to do for science and philosophy books, as those authors typically lay out their entire argument in the very beginning. 
  * Then, construct an outline of the major parts of the book. Note how they relate to each other and to the central theme.
    * Start by listing the major sections of the book; then, outline each section of the book; finally, outline each subsection.
    * Not every book deserves this treatment. Adler and Van Doren advise spending less time outlining simple books and more time outlining dense, unfamiliar texts. 



> **Some Books Resist the Skeleton Outline Approach**
> 
> While Adler and Van Doren write as though _all_ books have a single, unifying thesis, some reviewers believe that idea doesn't always apply. For example, the authors insist that this strategy applies to fiction as well as it does to expository books because the unified thesis of fiction is simply the main plotline. While this may be true for some stories (the authors cite the _Odyssey_ as an example), it doesn’t work for books that are more character-driven than plot-driven.
> 
> For instance, if we summarized the main plot of _The Catcher in the Rye_ in a single sentence, it would look something like, “Teenage protagonist Holden Caulfield gets expelled from school, wanders around New York City, meets up with various acquaintances, and reflects on life.” This surface-level treatment gives the reader very little useful information about the book because it ignores Holden’s internal journey as he grapples with a loss of innocence and feelings of alienation.
