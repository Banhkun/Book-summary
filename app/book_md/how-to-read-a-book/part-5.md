## Part 5: Reading Approaches for Different Genres

The authors believe that the principles of reading we’ve explored so far apply generally to all books and to expository books in particular. This section discusses different genres and gives specific guidance on how to adjust the four key questions to books in each genre:

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
  * Is the author's argument valid?
  * What are the implications?



We’ll cover practical books, imaginative literature, history, math and science, philosophy, and social sciences.

### Practical Books

According to the authors, practical books concern how to do things better. They can be mainly comprised of rules (like _Robert’s Rules of Order_ by Henry Martyn Robert), principles that recommend certain rules be followed (like Aristotle’s _The Nicomachean Ethics_), or somewhere in between. The practical book itself can’t solve its targeted problems directly. It requires action on the reader’s part. (Shortform note: Thus, you should be wary of books that claim they’ll “change your life.” This can be an effective marketing claim because a quick fix to life’s problems is so tantalizing; however, ultimately, the only person who can change your life is _you_ , by applying the book’s principles.)

Note that practical books are not purely theoretical emotionless treatments like math proofs are. To be effective, the authors argue they contain rhetoric or propaganda that appeals to your feelings. Be wary of separating the arguments from the emotional language, but don’t be completely resistant—consider the author’s emotional arguments and open yourself accordingly.

Understand the context of the author. Know something about the author’s background and historical context, and how it affected the problems she saw and the rules she espouses. (Shortform note: This doesn’t just apply to older books. With the exponential pace of technological change in the 21st century, a book that’s just a few years old can quickly become outdated. For example, Steve Harvey’s 2009 dating guide, _Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, _is already partly out of date because it makes no reference to online dating.)

**The Four Questions**

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * What problems are being addressed?
    * Discover the rules that are being recommended.
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * Discover the principles that justify the rules.
    * Find the applications of the rules to concrete cases.
  * Is the author's argument valid?
    * Does the rule actually work?
    * Do you desire the end that the rule guides to?
  * What are the implications?
    * If you agree with the book’s means and end, then you are obligated to put the means to action. Not doing so is _not_ a sign of laziness; it’s a sign that you either don’t fully agree or don’t have the power to put the author’s suggestions into practice. 
    * Figure out how the rules should be applied in practice.



> **Emotional Language as a Tool of Persuasion**
> 
> As we’ve noted above, Adler and Van Doren advise readers to look out for emotional appeals in practical books. This gives rise to another question to ask as you read: How is the author trying to impact your emotions through her language? This may be helpful to note because authors who use more emotive language may be trying to subtly persuade you to see things from their perspective.
> 
> These emotional appeals can be obvious (such as when Ibram X. Kendi describes his childhood classmate enduring racist treatment in _How to Be an Antiracist_) or more subtle. For example, consider these two sentences.
> 
>   * Samirah talked about her job.
> 
>   * Samirah whined about her job.
> 
> 

> 
> By changing just one word, we’ve turned a neutral sentence into one that passes negative judgment on the subject. If the author wanted to paint Samirah in an unflattering light without exposing her own bias, she could continue using subtle emotive language to influence readers’ perceptions. Thus, be on the lookout for emotive language and always ask yourself how the author is using such language to influence your understanding of the subject.

### Imaginative Literature

Most of the principles so far apply to expository writing, where the aim is to convey information or lead to action. The authors believe that the goal of imaginative literature is different: **to convey an experience**. Thus, as a reader, **you should open yourself to being emotionally affected**. Allow the book to move you. Only then can you fairly judge the merit of the work. (Shortform note: Some writers may have a higher goal beyond simply conveying an experience—their purpose is to increase our empathy for others and show us that a better world is possible.)

The authors recommend judging imaginative works by how well they reflect reality: not necessarily in the details (as science fiction or fantasy violate this) but rather in whether what is being said rings true—characterization, how characters respond to events, whether themes are revealed that reflect your experiences. (Shortform note: Keep in mind that this is a highly subjective set of criteria. What rings true for you may be very different from what rings true for others. Instead of thinking about whether the book reflects your immediate experience, look for universal themes that everyone can relate to, like love, loss, and coming of age.)

According to Adler and Van Doren, reading imaginative works should still be active and critical. When you say you like or dislike a fictional work, you should articulate why, and what is good or bad about the book. (Shortform note: Again, the authors assume that you’re reading for the purpose of understanding. However, if you’re reading for pure entertainment, you should still articulate what you did and didn’t like about the book, if only for the purpose of finding similar books to read for entertainment. For example, if you recognize that you enjoyed how the author wrote from a first-person point of view, you might deliberately seek out other books with that style of narration.)

**The Four Questions:**

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * Summarize the plot of the book in a few sentences.
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * What are the elements of the work—its setting, characters (and their thoughts and actions), events?
    * What is the shape of the plot, to climax and aftermath?
  * Is the author's argument valid?
    * Did you like the book? Did you see yourself reflected in it? Why or why not?
  * What are the implications?
    * Have your views shifted at all after reading the book? Has the experience changed you in some meaningful way?



> **How to Read Fiction Analytically**
> 
> While Adler and Van Doren assert that their analytical reading approach works as well for fiction as it does for expository books, some reviewers disagree: They feel that applying this method to fiction is too big a stretch because it ignores the complexities of literary theory and criticism.
> 
> We can look to Thomas C. Foster’s _How to Read Literature Like a Professor _for guidance on how to read fiction analytically, such as:
> 
>   * Look for allusions to “sacred texts” such as the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, classic fairy tales, and myths. These references are common in great literature and usually mean the author is commenting on the source material in some way. You’ll get more from the book if you can decode those comments than if you take the book at surface level.
> 
>   * Remember that almost anything in a story can have symbolic meaning. For example, if the story takes place during winter, that can symbolize old age or death; if it takes place during spring, that can symbolize rebirth and new beginnings.
> 
>   * Keep an eye out for archetypes. Archetypes are patterns that pop up repeatedly in fiction, such as trips or quests, shared meals, and sidekick characters. These archetypes tie diverse works together and highlight common meanings (for example, any time a character takes a trip, they’re really going on a quest for self-knowledge).

#### Types of Imaginative Literature

**Stories/Novels**

  * Stories are universally enjoyed—the authors suspect this is because it serves our subconscious wishes and longings. For example, readers live out fantasies in the characters: passionate love, empire construction, overcoming struggle. (Shortform note: In _The Storytelling Animal_ , author Jonathan Gottschall argues that storytelling is such a fundamental part of human nature that our species could be dubbed “ _Homo fictus_ ” (fiction man) rather than _Homo sapiens_(wise man).) 
  * The authors argue that truly great books tend to satisfy the deep wishes of almost everybody. They recommend totally immersing yourself in these books and reading them ideally in one sitting. As you read, resist the urge to judge a character’s actions before you understand their motivations. (Shortform note: Sometimes, an author may deliberately trick you into misjudging a character so that you’ll see them in a new light later in the story. For example, in _To Kill a Mockingbird_ , the reader is meant to join Scout, the young narrator, in her fear of her mysterious and agoraphobic neighbor, Boo Radley. That way, when Boo then saves the day at the end of the novel, the reader and Scout must both realize that they’ve judged Boo prematurely.)



**Plays**

  * The authors argue that most plays are not fully experienced when read, since they’re meant to be performed on the stage. When you read a play, you can address this incompleteness by pretending to be the director. Instruct the actors on where to stand, where to face, and how to say their lines. Tell them how crucial certain lines are. (Shortform note: To help you envision the play being performed, you can try mentally casting your favorite actors to play certain roles. This gives your imagination a template to build on.)



**Poetry**

  * When you read a poem for the first time, read it in its entirety without trying too hard to understand every single line. Adler and Van Doren believe the essence of a poem is never in the first line, but rather in the entire work. (Shortform note: This echoes what acclaimed author Virginia Woolf wrote in 1926: We should seek to understand poetry “with the senses, not with the intellect.”)
  * The second time you read a poem, read it aloud. You’ll pick up on new insights. In fact, the authors argue that you should continue coming back to your favorite poems throughout your life—each time you read them anew, you’ll discover new things you didn’t notice before. (Shortform note: According to former United States Poet Laureate Joseph Brodsky, reading lots of poetry has another benefit: It teaches you to be more discerning about prose. Specifically, since poetry is usually terse, reading it extensively teaches you to be more critical of needlessly verbose prose.)
  * The authors believe that poems often stand alone, so don’t feel you have to know about the author and the times. (Shortform note: While poems often _can_ stand alone, knowing some context about the poet can add another layer of meaning. This is especially true if the poem has been translated from another language. For example, the ancient Greek poet Sappho is well-known for writing love poems about other women; however, for nearly 200 years, it was common practice for translators to heterosexualize her poetry. Without this context, readers who encounter a censored version of Sappho’s poetry may accept the translation as is and miss out on part of what makes the poem unique.) 



### History

According to the authors, history has a greater impact on people’s actions today than any other type of work. History shows the actions of people in the past, making it less imposing for you to repeat them (in the case of good achievements) or avoid their mistakes. **The way to read history is not just to learn what happened, but also to discover the commonalities between people across time.** This will help illuminate certain universal truths of human nature. For example, while readers of Anne Frank’s _The Diary of a Young Girl _may not be able to identify with her specific situation (hiding from the Nazis), they may empathize with Anne’s description of the loneliness of adolescence and feeling misunderstood.

Adler and Van Doren assert that accuracy is always an issue in historical works. It’s hard enough in a modern-day court to prove that anything happened, with live witnesses. Historical works try to establish that something happened in the past with no live witnesses to question. Historians must infer what happened from source material, and often have to impose patterns and infer motivations. (Shortform note: You may also find it useful to think about how reliable the source material is. For example, an author writing a biography of Abraham Lincoln will have access to ample primary sources (such as letters written in Lincoln’s own hand). On the other hand, an author writing a biography of Homer will have much more difficulty—he lived so long ago that there are almost no surviving primary sources about his life. As such, what information we have is all second-hand and therefore less reliable.)

Therefore, according to the authors, **you should always be on the lookout for bias as you read history.** Ask yourself: What is the author trying to prove, and to whom? Is she qualified to report on these particular events? You should also read multiple historical discussions of the same event. The more you read, the more the various authors’ biases will cancel each other out, and you’ll get a sense of the core issues on which they all agree.

**The Four Questions**

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * Know the limited scope of the work. 
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * Does the author describe events chronologically or by grouping them into themes?
  * Is the author's argument valid?
    * Do you agree with the historian’s interpretation of her sources? Is she drawing the right conclusions based on the available evidence?
  * What are the implications?
    * How do the lessons of these past events apply to modern problems? What changes do they inspire you to make in your own life?



> **How (and Why) Historians Get Things Wrong**
> 
> According to modern historians, Adler and Van Doren are right to urge caution when reading historical books, not only because of the bias historians can show, but also because historians can often get things completely wrong—sometimes directly _because_ of this bias. For example, for centuries, historians constructed an image of the Vikings as an all-male fighting force, and, based on this bias, assumed that a skeleton of a Viking leader discovered in Sweden was male. However, in 2017, an osteologist analyzing the skeleton realized the warrior was actually female.
> 
> According to philosopher Alex Rosenberg, alongside bias, another reason historians are so often wrong about history is that they force complex historical events into a cohesive narrative. We expect stories to make logical sense, so historians often ignore important evidence or draw connections that don’t exist in order to make their historical stories make sense.
> 
> This isn’t deliberate deception—in fact, organizing random events into cohesive narratives is a universal subconscious tendency. In his landmark book, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls this “the narrative fallacy.”

#### Types of Historical Works

Biographies

  * The authors caution that the definitive biography is usually written after several other biographies have been written. For example, Ron Chernow’s definitive biography of Alexander Hamilton (which inspired the hit musical “Hamilton”) came after at least 14 other biographies.
  * According to Adler and Van Doren, autobiographies and authorized biographies (where the subject (or her estate) gives exclusive right to private materials) should be assumed to be biased. The subjects have incentive to hide the negative and embellish the positive. (Shortform note: This is arguably true of _all_ biographies, not just authorized ones; the biographer must have a strong interest in her subject in order to take on such a project and is therefore likely to skew the information to the positive.)



Current Events

  * When reading current events, Adler and Van Doren advise asking yourself, “Who is the intended audience?” If the work is intended for a group that already agrees with the author, you may find it frustrating if you are outside the group. (Shortform note: Despite this frustration, it’s important to engage with works written by people with whom you disagree. If you only ever read things you already agree with, you risk entering an echo chamber and missing out on the chance to challenge (and potentially strengthen) your own beliefs.)
  * Since these works primarily convey information, the authors feel you need not perform the full analysis. But you should continue asking the critical questions (including, “What facts have been left out?”). (Shortform note: In the “fake news” era, it may be more important than ever to read the news analytically. To start, you can check the political bias of your preferred news source.)



### Math and Science

According to the authors, historical math and science works tend to be more accessible than people think because 1) historically, they were written for broad readership, and 2) they tend to clarify upfront their terms and propositions. On the other hand, the authors argue that modern works tend to be written for an audience of experts, since fields have become deeply specialized. Thus they contain jargon and require prior training. The techniques in this book don’t apply as well in these cases. (Shortform note: This may no longer be true for modern math and science books. For example, Darrell Huff’s _How to Lie With Statistics_ and Richard Dawkins’ _The Selfish Gene _are both easily accessible, even for readers who are new to those subjects.)

When reading math, Adler and Van Doren advise remembering that math is a language like any other, with its own conventions and grammar. It is in fact easier to understand than most languages, since it is not spoken and there are no emotional connotations. Treat it like this and it will become less inscrutable. (Shortform note: Many people are intimidated by math after struggling with it in school. According to Barbara Oakley, author of _A Mind for Numbers_ , it’s entirely possible to teach yourself math concepts as an adult, even if the subject doesn’t come naturally to you.)

**The Four Questions:**

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * State as clearly as you can the problem the author has tried to solve.
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * What experimental data are required to believe the arguments? They are likely outside the realm of your experience.
    * What assumptions are required to form the propositions?
  * Is the author's argument valid?
  * What are the implications?
    * Theoretical conclusions can have important practical consequences (for example, on climate change).



> **Reading Outdated Science Books**
> 
> Adler and Van Doren argue that one of the primary reasons to read scientific texts is to understand the history of science and the thought process that underlies the scientific method—not necessarily to understand the science in the book itself. This is particularly important because science is constantly evolving and some foundational works no longer represent scientific fact.
> 
> For example, Ptolemy’s _Almagest_ is one of the earliest classics of scientific literature. It describes a geocentric model of the solar system (in which the sun revolves around the Earth, rather than the Earth revolving around the sun) that was the dominant scientific understanding of the universe until the 16th century. From a modern perspective, we know that Ptolemy’s astronomy was wrong; however, reading the _Almagest_ is still valuable because it gives us a glimpse into how historical humans made sense of the world around them.
> 
> Thus, while reading older science books is a worthy endeavor, it’s important to ask additional questions, like “When was this written? Does this author’s conception of scientific fact still hold true?”

### Philosophy

According to Adler and Van Doren, philosophical works discuss the kinds of questions that children ask. Broadly, these questions can be:

  * Theoretical/speculative questions about what is or what happens. These fall into three categories:
    * Metaphysics: questions about what it means to exist
    * Nature: questions about change or transformation
    * Epistemology: questions about knowledge, its causes, and its limits
  * Practical/normative questions about what should be done. These can be divided into:
    * Ethics: right vs wrong
    * Politics: good society and the individual in relation to the community



Unlike science, which often requires external data, philosophy deals with questions that can be answered entirely within the mind. (Shortform note: In a 1989 interview, Adler argued that “the sciences give us knowledge of the world, but not understanding of it and certainly no wisdom about it.”) The questions are varied and deep—for example, does life have meaning? Where do thoughts come from? How did the universe begin? And so on. However, note that not all questions asked by philosophers were philosophical. For example, the question “Where do thoughts come from?” may not be purely philosophical in light of advances in modern neuroscience.

> **New Questions for the 21st Century**
> 
> In many ways, philosophy is a relatively unchanging discipline—philosophers today struggle with the same questions that Aristotle and Plato asked. However, the social technological revolutions of the last century have brought some new philosophical questions to light, including:
> 
>   * Should we privilege romantic love between two people above other forms of relationships (such as platonic love between two people or romantic love between three people)?
> 
>   * Is a sophisticated artificial intelligence system “conscious” in the same way that a human mind is?
> 
>   * How can we define “gender”?
> 
> 


Adler and Van Doren argue that the masses were the intended readers of philosophy works, at least until the 1930s. This includes the work of ancient philosophers like Aristotle and Plato. However, like math and science books, the authors argue that modern philosophy books aren’t written for lay readers. (Shortform note: While this may have been true in 1972, several popular, easily-accessible philosophy books have been published since. For example, in 1974, Robert M. Pirsig published _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ , a philosophical novel that quickly became a bestseller.)

Classic philosophical works occur in various forms, such as:

  1. Dialogues (like Plato)
  2. Essays written straightforwardly (like Aristotle)
  3. Meeting of objections, first giving the wrong answer then countering (like Aquinas)
  4. Systemization, which is formalizing in mathematical form (Descartes)
  5. Aphorisms, containing pithy statements that the reader must work to connect and expand (like Nietzsche).



(Shortform note: If you’re brand new to reading philosophy, you may wish to start by reading dialogues. Philosophical dialogues are written like a play in which two or more characters debate philosophical topics. The use of characters and the conversational format makes it easier and more fun to follow the argument.)

On theological works: Adler and Van Doren recommend temporarily suspending your disbelief about the dogma in order to evaluate the author’s argument. Take the assumptions to be true, then see what arguments and conclusions result. Do not discard the entire work, assuming the arguments are as dogmatic as the assumptions. (Shortform note: Adler’s perspective on reading theological works as a nonbeliever is unique. He spent much of his career as a secular philosopher studying the work of Catholic theologian St. Thomas Aquinas before eventually converting to Christianity at the age of 81.)

**The Four Questions:**

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * State the questions the work tries to answer.
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * Discover the assumptions of the author.
    * Define the terms: They often come from common speech but are used in a very special sense (for example, in _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ , Pirsig uses the word “quality” in a very specific way).
  * Is the author's argument valid?
    * You must answer the important questions for yourself, with arguments to back them up. 
  * What are the implications?
    * Theoretical conclusions can have important practical consequences.



> **Additional Tips for Reading Philosophy**
> 
> Many guides to reading philosophy parrot Adler and Van Doren’s advice for general analytical reading (such as skimming first, reading twice, and taking notes in the margins). Here are some additional tips for reading philosophical works that expand on Adler and Van Doren’s advice:
> 
>   * Take your time with the ideas. After you close the book, continue to sit with the ideas as you go about your day. Philosophy is often dense by nature, so you’ll need this extra thinking time before you can make an informed judgment on what you’ve read.
> 
>   * Imagine yourself in the author’s shoes. If you find yourself criticizing their arguments, try to think of how the author would answer your criticisms. This is a deep form of intellectual empathy that can help you understand the author’s arguments.
> 
>   * Familiarize yourself with philosophical language. Words like “valid” and “sound” have a special meaning in the context of philosophy—understanding this special language will make it easier to answer the second major question, “How does the author's argument unfold?”
> 
> 


### Social Sciences

This group includes economics, politics, sociology, psychology, and possibly those of professional trades (law, business). According to the authors, social science texts appear to be “easy” reading material, since they use jargon that has penetrated daily life—words like “psyche” and “gender.” The topics relate to your everyday experience. However, for this reason, you likely come in with preexisting bias, which must be ignored to read analytically.

(Shortform note: In _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , Daniel Kahneman calls this form of bias “What You See Is All There Is.” As humans, we naturally see the world from our own perspectives—so much so that we don’t even realize others might see the world in a different way. Therefore, the first step to overcoming bias is to realize your own view is biased in the first place.)

Furthermore, unlike science works, social science works tend not to define the essential terms and postulates. This is aggravated by the blending together of multiple fields, thus creating a struggle to define terms like “workforce” as clearly as “electron.” (Shortform note: Many authors in the social sciences _do_ define their essential terms—however, these terms may differ from common usage. For example, in _White Fragility_ , author Robin DiAngelo defines racism in terms of social power and control of key institutions, _not_ in terms of individual prejudices.)

Adler and Van Doren advise reading several social science books on the same subject, since there usually aren’t single texts that comprehensively explore a topic. You should also look out for new or revised editions of social science books you’ve already read, since the field evolves quickly and authors often revise their work in order to stay relevant. (Shortform note: Revising and rereleasing older work is less common among social science writers now than it was when Adler and Van Doren were writing; now, social scientists typically release new books as a complement to their older work. For example, Daniel Kahneman published his landmark book, _Thinking, Fast and Slow, _in 2011; in 2021, he collaborated with other subject experts on _Noise_ , which extends the ideas of _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ into a new direction.)

> **Applying the “Four Questions” to Social Science Books**
> 
> You may notice that, unlike the sections on other types of books, this section does not end with “The Four Questions.” That’s because Adler and Van Doren are adamant that readers of social science literature shouldn’t focus on a single book—they should focus on a single _subject_ and read several books on it (hence why this section comes at the end of the chapter, just before Comparative Reading). However, if we were to apply the Four Questions template here, it might look like this:
> 
> **The Four Questions:**
> 
>   * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
> 
>     * State the questions the work tries to answer (just as you would for any other subject). 
>   * How does the author's argument unfold?
> 
>     * Sketch out the author’s argument. What are the premises, and what evidence does she present to support them?
>   * Is the author's argument valid?
> 
>     * Social science is unique in that it takes a scientific approach to everyday life phenomena. Therefore, you should ask yourself whether the author’s argument reflects both your personal experience and your academic knowledge of the subject. 
>   * What are the implications?
> 
>     * For some books, if you agree with the author’s conclusions, it’s easy to act on them (for example, books about communicating better with others). For books that address wider societal issues, you may agree with the author’s conclusions, but only be able to act on them indirectly. For example, if you agree with _Biased _author Jennifer Eberhardt that cash bail is an unjust system, you can’t singlehandedly end it—but you could volunteer your time or money for the cause.
