## Part 2: Elementary Reading

So far in this guide, we’ve learned the purpose of reading well and discussed how to choose which books to read. In the next three parts, we’ll cover the first three levels of reading: elementary, inspectional, and analytical, in that order.

The authors describe elementary reading as the pure mechanical reading of text and comprehension of what the symbols literally mean. It’s the most basic form of reading that we learn to do as a child. (As an adult, you revisit the difficulties of elementary reading when you first try to read in a foreign language.) (Shortform note: The authors spend considerable time discussing the specific steps of learning to read at an elementary level. However, if you’re reading this guide, you’ve already mastered those steps. Therefore, we’ve condensed this chapter to just the information that is relevant to readers who are proficient in elementary reading and want to improve their higher-level reading skills.)

According to the authors, children learn to read quite magically. At some point words suddenly have real meaning to them. Science is not clear on how this happens. Children become more capable readers as they build vocabulary and infer meanings from context clues. (Shortform note: Some researchers believe reading comprehension has two key components: written language “decoding” skill and oral language comprehension. In other words, to read effectively, kids need to be able to translate squiggly lines on a page into a recognizable word they can say aloud _and_ know the meaning of that word when they hear it. When both those components are in place, the metaphorical light turns on and children can suddenly get meaning from written language.)

#### A Note on Speed Reading

One way that adults revisit the basics of reading is through speed reading courses, which purport to teach them how to increase their reading speeds without sacrificing comprehension. According to the authors, a helpful component of speed reading is training your brain not to subvocalize (pronouncing each word in your head so that you can “hear” them in your mind). To practice this, the authors recommend this exercise: Use your hand to cover the text, and move your hand downward faster than you can currently read. Your brain will be forced to catch up.

However, after a point, reading faster necessarily trades off with comprehension. When speed reading helps you avoid spending time on texts that don’t deserve your analysis, this is good. But you wouldn’t want to speed read the _Tao Te Ching_.

More critical than speed reading, according to the authors, is **being able to modulate your reading speed dynamically**. Read certain types of texts (like fiction) faster than others that contain denser content, like science textbooks. Within a text, read key points more slowly than fluff to give yourself time to think through the logic.

> **Modern Science Supports Adler and Van Doren’s View of Speed Reading**
> 
> The first edition of _How to Read a Book_ contains no mention of speed reading, which wouldn’t be introduced to the American public for another 19 years. However, when Adler and Van Doren wrote the updated and revised _How to Read a Book_ in 1972, speed reading was at the height of its popularity in the United States—even President John F. Kennedy was a vocal proponent of speed reading.
> 
> Adler and Van Doren were particularly concerned about the popularity of speed reading because they believed that, to a certain degree, speed reading and reading for comprehension are mutually exclusive. Modern science corroborates that claim—research shows that when readers double or triple their reading speed, comprehension suffers. This supports the authors’ points: When you merely need a surface-level understanding of a topic, speed reading is a helpful tool; however, if you want to truly wrap your mind around a complex idea, you’ll have no choice but to slow down.
> 
> Fortunately, there _are_ some factors that can increase reading speed (albeit not to the extreme degrees that speed reading programs advertise) without sacrificing comprehension, such as:
> 
>   * Having a deep knowledge of the subject matter as well as the writing style in which it’s presented
> 
>   * Intense focus while reading
> 
>   * Continuous practice reading difficult texts
