## Exercise: Analyze Your Nation’s Wealth

Consider where your nation lies on the global wealth gap and what factors may have influenced its placement.

* * *

On a global scale, would you consider your nation to be rich, poor, or somewhere in the middle? Why?

How could your nation’s geography contribute to its wealth? For example, maybe it has lots of coastline that has enabled lucrative international trade.

How could your nation’s culture contribute to its wealth? For example, maybe your culture highly values and encourages monetary success.

How could your nation’s political system contribute to its wealth? For example, maybe your government has problems with corruption or inefficient spending.

Historically, has your nation been harmed by or benefited from exploitation? Do you see any lingering effects of this today? For example, maybe your nation still owns many corporations in its former colonies.
