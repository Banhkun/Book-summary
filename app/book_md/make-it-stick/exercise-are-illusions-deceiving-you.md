## Exercise: Are Illusions Deceiving You?

Use this exercise to try to identify when illusions are making you misjudge your competency.

* * *

What’s a topic you feel very familiar with and/or what skill do you feel very confident performing?

Why do you feel so confident?

How might “fluency illusions,” “oblivious incompetence,” or another cognitive bias be influencing your feeling of competence?

How can you determine whether or not you’re truly competent?
