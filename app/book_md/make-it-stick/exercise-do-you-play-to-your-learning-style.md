## Exercise: Do You Play to Your Learning Style?

Use this exercise to reflect on if and how you play to your learning style, and what the results have been.

* * *

What’s your learning style—visual, auditory, or kinesthetic?

How do you approach work differently when it’s designed for a different learning style?

What have you noticed about your performance on work that fits your learning style versus work that doesn’t?

Describe something you learned recently that you were successful at despite it being taught in a different learning style.
