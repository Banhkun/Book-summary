## Part 4: Sleep | Chapter 11: Dealing With Insomnia

The third of the six topics the author covers in the 4HB is how to improve your sleep. First, we’ll look at some solutions for insomnia and tips for getting a good night’s sleep. Then, we’ll look at ways to spend less time sleeping but still be functional.

### The Qualities of Good Sleep

The author had chronic onset insomnia (taking a long time to fall asleep) and self-experimented to find solutions. Self-experimentation is particularly useful for sleep because, in a formal setting like a sleep lab, you’re in an unfamiliar location with wires attached to you, which makes it even more difficult to fall asleep.

The author measured his sleep patterns using a variety of at-home gadgets, the most useful of which was the Zeo, a headband that measures brain activity. (He found that devices that use motion-sensing technology to determine whether you’re asleep or not—such as the FitBit or WakeMate—aren’t always accurate because this technology can’t always tell the difference between sleep and being awake but motionless.)

Using data from the Zeo and his other devices such as his glucose monitor, the author discovered the following qualities of good sleep:

  * **The ratio of REM**(rapid eye movement sleep, which consolidates memory) **to total sleep was more important than the actual amount of REM sleep.** The author found that when the ratio was higher, the sleep was more restful and he better remembered things from the previous day. He could increase the ratio either by sleeping for longer than nine hours or waking up for five minutes after four and a half hours of sleep.
  * **To increase total REM by 20-30%, take 200 micrograms of Huperzine-A half an hour before bed** , a maximum of three days a week. REM sleep is partly caused by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and Huperzine-A slows the breakdown of acetylcholine.
  * **A high ratio of deep-wave sleep**(sleep during which your muscles grow and heal)**to total sleep increases physical performance** the next day. The author increased deep-wave sleep with California poppy extract (15 or more drops). The author’s deep-wave sleep decreased if he drank more than two glasses of wine within four hours of falling asleep.
  * **If you sleep 8-10 hours and still feel tired, it’s probably because your blood sugar is low.** The author felt better in the mornings if he ate celery sticks with two tablespoons of almond butter before bed. Sometimes he also had 120-240 calories of flaxseed oil.
  * **If you wake up when your brain activity is high, you feel less groggy.** Some sleep-measuring devices have “smart alarms,” which will go off when they detect high brain activity within a certain pre-set time, and the author found these helpful.



### Activities to Induce the Qualities of Good Sleep

The author found that the following activities helped him fall asleep and wake up feeling good:

  * **Sleeping at the ideal temperature.** For the author, this was under a single bedsheet at 67-70 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to changing the temperature of your room, you can try wearing socks to keep your feet warm.
  * **Having a ten-minute ice bath an hour before going to bed.** Cold signals the body that it's time for sleep. 
  * **Eating fat and protein three hours or fewer before bed.** For the author, if he ate more than 800 mg of cholesterol and 40 grams of protein, he fell asleep faster. Eating rib-eye steaks was most effective.
  * **Using a humidifier.** In addition to helping the author sleep, the humidifier reduced his facial wrinkles and eliminated sinus problems.
  * **Using a NightWave.** A NightWave is a device that emits a blue light that slowly changes luminosity. Synchronize your breathing to the intensity changes to fall asleep faster.
  * **Using a blue-light emitter.** Blue-light emitters give off light that resembles a sunny day. The author found if he pointed the light at himself for 15 minutes in the morning, he fell asleep the next night within ten minutes.
  * **Exercising.** Exercise, in general, helps you fall asleep, and the author got the best results with injury prevention stabilization exercises (see Chapter 12).
  * **Sleeping in the military crawl position.** It’s difficult to move out of the military crawl position, so once you’re positioned, you’re less likely to fidget, and when you can’t fidget, you fall asleep faster. To get into position, lie on your stomach with your head turned to the right. Your left arm should be straight by your side, palm up. Your right arm should palm-down, bent at 90 degrees, or tucked under your pillow. Your left leg is straight and your right leg should be bent at 90 degrees.



### Alternative Sleeping Methods: Polyphasic Sleep

Most would consider staying asleep for eight hours straight a good sleep. However, it’s also possible to feel well-rested by dividing your sleep into chunks, which is called polyphasic sleep. **As long as you time your chunks properly, it’s possible to feel fine with only two hours of sleep a night.**

Polyphasic sleep works because the most useful phase of sleep is REM, which most people only experience for 1-2 hours a night. The hours of light sleep (6-7, if you’re sleeping eight hours a night) don’t have that much benefit, so if you can force your body to spend every unconscious moment in REM sleep, you can spend less time unconscious. To do this, you can either:

  * **Make yourself exhausted.** When exhausted, the body goes straight into the REM phase.
  * **Trick your body.** If your body thinks you’re only going to get a small amount of sleep, it will enter REM whenever you go to sleep.



#### Polyphasic Sleep Schedules

There are three common schedules for polyphasic sleep, all of which include the tricks for forcing yourself into REM sleep:

  1. **Siesta.** In this method, you take one 20-minute nap during the day and then sleep for six hours starting around midnight.
  2. **Everyman.** In this method, you take naps during the day and a chunk of core sleep at night. There are multiple versions of this method:
     * Everyman 2: Two 20-minutes naps during the day and 4.5 hours starting around midnight.
     * Everyman 3: Three 20-minute naps during the day and 3 hours starting just after midnight.
     * Everyman 4: Four to five 20-minutes naps and 1.5 hours starting just before midnight.
  3. **Uberman.** In this method, there are six 20-minute naps a day every four hours. It takes two to three weeks to adjust to this schedule.



**The more naps you have, the more strictly you must adhere to the schedule.** In the Uberman method, you can’t miss a nap by more than half an hour or oversleep, or you’ll be tired for days.
