## Chapter 10: Improving Men’s Sex Lives

In the last chapter, we learned how to make sex more pleasurable for women. Now, it’s time to look at how to improve things for men. First, we’ll look at men’s anatomy and biology. Then, we’ll look at how to influence biochemistry to improve sex and sperm.

### Men’s Anatomy and Biology

Men’s testosterone levels have a huge impact on their libido and sex appeal (testosterone affects pheromone production). However, improving your sex life isn’t as simple as just injecting your body with external testosterone.

There are two major hormones related to testosterone production:

  1. **Luteinizing hormone (LH)** , which tells the testicles to make testosterone. 
  2. **Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG)** , which makes testosterone inert. When it’s inert, your body can’t use it.



To increase your bioavailable (usable) testosterone levels, you’ll increase LH and decrease SHBG.

### Two Protocols for Increasing Testosterone

Through self-experimentation, the author developed two protocols to increase testosterone levels, leading to higher libido. While he was experimenting, he increased his total testosterone from 245 to 653 ng/dL and his bioavailable (non-inert) testosterone from 150 to 294 ng/dL. One night when he was on a dinner date, all the women in a restaurant were interested in him, and he had great sex with his date later.

The first protocol is for maintenance and the second is for a boost right before sex. (Shortform note: The protocols are covered in two of the book’s chapters and the dosages vary between chapters. We’ve included the range given by both chapters.)

#### Protocol #1: Maintenance

Protocol #1 involves diet, using supplements, and temperature manipulation.

##### Diet and Supplements

To keep your testosterone levels high, before bed and every morning, eat the following:

**1\. 3,000-5,000 IU of Vitamin D3**. Vitamin D helps build muscle, which makes you stronger and improves your performance. Once your blood contains 50-55ng/mL (after approximately four weeks) maintain it at that level. Increasing it further may be dangerous—more than 150ng/mL is toxic.

**2\. Two capsules of fermented cod liver oil.** Cod liver oil contains, among other things, vitamin A, which increases testosterone production.

**3\. Vitamin K(2)** via butter fat (cook your eggs in it) and/or lacto-fermented foods such as kimchi or sauerkraut. Vitamin K(2) helps prevent vitamin D toxicity and strengthens the effects of vitamins A and D.

**4\. Three Brazil nuts (only if you’re deficient in selenium).** Selenium increases the quantity and quality of sperm (up to a point—if you get more than 400 mg a day, it actually harms sperm, and, according to the author’s experiences, causes acne). You might be deficient in selenium if:

  * You eat meat (which is normally rich in selenium) that comes from animals who grazed on selenium-poor soil.
  * You’ve spent time in the metabolic state of ketosis, which is when your body gets most of its energy from burning fat. The Slow-Carb Diet puts you in a state of non-permanent ketosis (cheat day avoids the diet being permanently ketotic).
  * You have high mercury levels. Selenium binds to mercury. To decrease your mercury, you might try chelation, but it hasn’t had much effect on the author so far.



##### Temperature Manipulation

In addition to using diet and supplements, take two 10-minute cold showers or ice baths a day, one before bed and one after waking. The author believes this is effective because the area of the brain that’s stimulated by cold exposure is the same area that produces most of the body’s GnRH, a hormone that triggers the release of LH.

#### Protocol #2: Short-Term Boost

Protocol #2 is purely diet- and supplement-related. The day before you plan to have sex, consume one of the following:

  * Option #1: Consume at least 800 mg of cholesterol all at once within two to three hours of going to sleep. (Cholesterol is mainly produced at night.) Cholesterol decreases SHBG, and decreased SHBG will result in more bioavailable testosterone. 
  * Option #2: Drink a shake made of the following ingredients at 4 pm and then again before going to sleep:
    * 2 raw egg yolks
    * 4 tbsp almond butter
    * 12 oz whole milk, organic or raw
    * ½ tsp cinnamon
    * 3 tbsp chia seeds
    * 1 tsp vanilla extract



Four hours before sex, eat the following:

  * 20 almonds. The author has a higher sex drive after eating almonds and suspects it’s due to their high vitamin E content. Vitamin E has three relevant characteristics:
    * Combined with vitamin A and selenium, vitamin E is a treatment for androgen deficiency (low male sex hormones).
    * It combats oxidative stress, which can decrease sperm and testosterone production.
    * It stimulates the hormonal chain that eventually results in the release of LH. 
  * 4 Brazil nuts
  * 2 capsules of fermented cod liver oil and vitamin-rich butter fat



#### Side Effects

The protocols involve eating a lot of cholesterol and protein, which the author thought might cause side effects because:

  * The Lipid Hypothesis suggests that cholesterol is bad for your heart. The author is skeptical of this hypothesis because there’s scientific evidence to the contrary and when he tried to lower his cholesterol, he became tired and his testosterone levels decreased.
  * Too much protein can affect kidney function.



After following Protocol #1 for four months and eating a lot of red meat and additional protein for another experiment, the author got tested. To his surprise, **he found that his diet hadn’t caused any problems:**

  * His cholesterol actually lowered.
  * His creatinine and BUN, which indicate kidney stress, were slightly elevated but still within normal values.



### Sperm Counts

In addition to testosterone levels, **sperm count is an important measure of men’s sexual health.** Sperm count is judged on three factors:

  * Number: The total count of sperm.
  * Shape: The count of how many sperm are shaped properly (like a tadpole).
  * Motility: The count of how many sperm can swim forward.



All three factors are important—for example, if the number of sperm is high but none of them can swim, fertility is decreased.

**Low sperm count is a problem for many men,** including at one point, the author, and **the solution is simple—stop carrying your cell phone in your pocket.** Studies have shown that the radio frequency electro-magnetic fields (RF-EMF) produced by cell phones decrease serum testosterone and motile sperm in rats. The author found that the RF-EMF was affecting his sperm too.

The author started carrying his phone in an armband, so it would be further from his sperm, and only put it in his pocket when it was off. After 11 weeks, his motile sperm count had increased by a factor of three. (He was also doing some other body experiments at the same time, such as cold treatments and eating Brazil nuts for selenium, but he suspects that moving his cell phone was the major factor.)

#### Why You Should Store Sperm

Even if you stop carrying your cell phone in your pocket, there are still good reasons to store sperm. The author recommends it for several reasons:

  * It’s hard to avoid things that are bad for your sperm count. For example, preservatives are bad for your sperm count, and many foods have them. 
  * Medical procedures, such as chemotherapy, can cause infertility.
  * Even if you think you don’t want kids, you might change your mind.
  * The only downside is the cost.



There are six steps to storing sperm:

  1. Find a local sperm bank and make an appointment.
  2. At the initial appointment, you’ll probably be tested for STIs and you’ll learn more about the process. Initial appointments typically cost between $100-200.
  3. Plan to make six deposits for every child you hope to have. You need six because 50% or more of your sperm doesn’t survive the freezing process, and it can take a long time and several attempts for a woman to get pregnant. Each deposit costs $150-200.
  4. Don’t ejaculate within 48 hours of each deposit but do ejaculate at least 72 hours before. This will create the ideal ratio of live sperm to dead sperm.
  5. Expect challenges. When depositing, if your experience is anything like the author’s, you’ll be shown to a private room and given porn DVDs. It will probably be more difficult than you think to ejaculate.
  6. Find somewhere to store the sperm. Usually, the bank where you made the deposits will have storage available. This costs $300-600 per year.
