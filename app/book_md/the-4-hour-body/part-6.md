## Part 6: Sports-Specific Skills | Chapter 14: Running

The fifth of the six topics the author covers in the 4HB is how to improve sports-specific skills. **No matter what sport you play, it's helpful to be strong, because being stronger than someone else of equal skill gives you an advantage over them.** In this chapter, we’ll first look at some tips for strength training for any sport. Then, we’ll look specifically at how to train for running, the first of five sports the author has tips for.

### Strength Training for Athletes

There are some principles to keep in mind when strength training:

**Principle #1: Train your sport-specific skills six days a week,** do sports-related training (such as conditioning) three days a week, and do strength training three days a week on the days you’re not doing sports-related training. (In Part 2, we learned that training less frequently is effective for building strength, but as athletes have more complicated goals than simply getting stronger, they should train more than once a week.)

**Principle #2: Sets should only contain two or three reps.** Total reps should number around 10, whether that’s five sets of two or three sets of three.

**Principle #3: Do only a few exercises that target most of the bodies’ muscle groups** , such as the bench press or deadlift.

**Principle #4: Spend five minutes resting in between all sets.**

**Principle #5: Don’t push to failure** (being so fatigued you can’t do any more reps).

**Principle #6: You should feel stronger after lifting than when you started.**

**Principle #7: Do the Janda sit-up** to strengthen your abs. According to scientific theories, Janda sit-ups are effective because they force you to contract your hamstrings, which turns off your hip flexors and forces your abs to do all the work (people often cheat at abs by recruiting their hip flexors for help). To do the exercise:

  * Sit on the ground and wrap a towel or resistance band around your calves. Ask a training partner to pull on the towel at a 45-degree angle, or wrap the band around something high like a door handle to get the same 45-degree angle.
  * Pull your belly button towards your tailbone.
  * Sit up without letting your legs move. If you can’t do this, which is normal, sit up however you need to and do only the lowering part of the sit-up without letting your legs move.



All of the above principles are based around the idea that you should lift heavy weights but not do anything too hard. While strength training is important for athletes for a variety of reasons, developing strength is never the priority: skill development is. Therefore, your **strength training should never interfere with the practice of your sport** , for example, by making you too sore to practice.

  * For example, Wimbledon star Maria Sharapova’s strength training only included small sets of pull-ups, one-legged squats, push-ups, and Janda sit-ups. 



### The Benefits of Shorter Training Sessions

You might find it counterintuitive that training just a few exercises for short periods is effective, but **there’s plenty of evidence to show that working harder for a shorter period creates the same or better results than working less hard for longer.**

For example, in 2005, Martin Gibala, a researcher at McMaster University, publicized the results of a study that indicated that doing six minutes of high-intensity exercise three times weekly was just as good as doing an hour a day of moderate exercise. In his study, one group did 30-second stationary bike sprints four to sevens times, with four minutes of rest in between. They did this workout three times weekly for two weeks, while a control group did an hour of moderate exercise a day. The sprint group almost doubled their endurance capacity and their leg muscles developed more endurance enzymes. When the test was repeated with similar workouts the results were the same.

### Sprinting

Now that we understand the value of strength training for athletes, it’s time to look at training for specific sports. First, we’ll look at sprinting. The author spoke with two different experts about how to increase sprinting prowess: Barry Ross, who coaches track athletes, and Joe DeFranco, who teaches football players how to ace the physical tests in the NFL Combine, part of the tryout and drafting process.

#### Barry Ross and Track and Field

Barry Ross is the expert coach who trained Olympian Allyson Felix. He spends a lot of time developing his athletes' strength—most of his trainees can lift more than double their body weight, and they achieved these results in fewer than 15 minutes of lifting time a week. In sprinting, **strength is important because athletes slow down when their muscle fibers aren’t strong enough to maintain tension during impact** , such as when a runner’s foot hits the ground. (Previously, coaches believed that athletes slowed down because muscles ran out of fuel.)

Ross uses a three-step process to train his athletes, and you can use the process too:

##### Step #1: Get in Shape

You need to be able to run a 100-meter dash in less than 23.8 seconds before you can start training to compete. To get to this baseline, **walk 7.5 minutes in one direction and then walk back to your starting point in another 7.5 minutes.** Walk as fast as you can—it should feel inefficient and you should want to switch to jogging (but don’t). Do this three times a week, and each time, walk farther. It will take about four weeks to get in shape and be capable of running the 100-meter in the required time.

##### Step #2: Get Stronger

Once you’re in shape, to build strength, follow this program three times a week (an earlier version of which Allyson Felix used):

**Exercise #1: 6-7 reps of over-under dynamic stretching.** Using two power racks, set one bar at waist height and the other at 30-32 inches off the ground. Squat and step sideways under the lower bar and then step over the second one. If you don’t have access to a power rack, use benches or ropes. This exercise should take less than five minutes.

**Exercise #2: Do either 10-12 push-ups OR the following bench press sequence** :

  * One set of 2-3 reps of bench presses. (The weight should be 95% of the heaviest weight you can lift once (one repetition max, or 1RM) To estimate, multiply your 5-rep maximum by 1.2.) 
  * 4-5 bench-press plyometrics. To do this, find two boxes that are between 6 and 12 inches high and put them outside your shoulder width. Do a push-up between them, and when you’re at the bottom of your push-up, push off your arms and jump them onto the boxes. Jump back down to the fully-lowered position. As soon as you land, take off again—the landing phase should be as short as possible. 
  * Five minutes rest. 
  * One set of bench presses with 5 reps at 85% 1RM.
  * 4-5 bench-press plyometrics. 



**Exercise #3: Deadlifts sequence.** To deadlift, use a sumo stance. Keep your back straight and keep your shoulders in the locked position. **After lifting to knee height, drop the weight instead of lowering it to avoid hamstring injuries** (if you’re not also training sprinting, which involves a lot of hamstrings, it’s fine to lower the weight). You shouldn’t spend more than 10 seconds under tension—spending any longer leads to lactic acid production, which creates muscle soreness. Do the following sequence:

  * One set of 2-3 reps at 95% of your 1RM.
  * Plyometrics. Ideally, sprint 10-15 meters for 2-4 reps. The next best option is to jump onto a 12-18-inch box for 5-7 reps. As soon as you land, take off again—the landing phase should be as short as possible.
  * Five minutes of rest.
  * One set of deadlifts with 5 reps at 85% 1RM.
  * Another set of plyometrics.



**Exercise #4: 3 sets of 3 reps of the torture twist.** Sit on a bench and tuck your feet under a bar or another bench. Keep your body parallel to the ground. Turn to your left and stay there for three seconds. Then turn to your right and stay there for three seconds. That’s one rep. After each set, sit up and take a 30-second rest. As you improve, you can increase to 5 reps and increase your holding time to 15 seconds.

You can lift and then go directly to running practice, but don’t run and then lift—you might injure yourself.

##### Step #3: Get Faster

To increase your sprinting speed:

  1. Measure your baseline with two time trials:
     * Run 40 meters but only time the last 20 meters. 
     * Run 305 meters and only time the last 300 meters. 
  2. Enter your times into the Anaerobic Speed Reserve (ASR) algorithm. This algorithm predicts how fast you should be able to run any distance and will give you goal times.
  3. Choose a random distance between 15-55 meters and get the corresponding time from the algorithm.
  4. Run the distance in under the algorithm’s time. 
  5. Rest four minutes. 
  6. Continue running the distance and resting for four minutes. Stop when you can no longer make the time or when you hit 10 reps. If you can’t make the time on the very first attempt, you can try once more.



This is a departure from conventional sprint training, which usually suggests you run the distance you’ll be racing multiple times at different percentages of your maximum speed. This technique isn’t effective because no one knows the exact percentage of effort or speed they’re using.

Conventional running training also recommends running longer than you’ll have to in a race to improve your endurance, but Ross doesn’t recommend this. None of his athletes who compete at 400m or less ever run a training distance of more than 70 meters, and this doesn’t hurt their performance at all—his athletes do very well. For example, using the training, one of his 100-meter sprinters reduced her time from 13.35 seconds to 12.75 seconds.

#### Joe DeFranco and the 40-Yard Dash

Like Ross, DeFranco has his athletes run shorter distances than they’ll ultimately need to run. In football, as part of NFL tryouts, hopefuls have to sprint a 40-yard dash. Joe DeFranco has his athletes spend 80% of their training time on 10-yard dashes. In addition to Ross’s reasons, DeFranco finds that **practicing shorter distances is effective because it gives athletes more opportunity to practice their starting stance and experiment with posture and stride.**

DeFranco’s method is effective—for example, Dallas Cowboys’ Miles Austin ran a time of 4.67 seconds in the 40-yard dash even though he’d only practiced that distance three times, and had practiced the 10-yard distance over 100 times.

With the help of DeFranco, the author improved his 40-yard speed from 5.94 seconds to 5.61 seconds using the following tips:

**1\. Wear cleats.**

**2\. Warm up properly** , using exercises that include the same postures and techniques required for a sprint:

  * 2 sets of skipping for a 20-yard distance
  * 6 reverse lunges on each side
  * 2 sets of backward cycling (pretend you’re riding an invisible bicycle backward) for a 20-yard distance
  * 2 sets of squatting side shuffle (squat partway down, facing sideways, and replace your front foot with your back foot) for a 20-yard distance
  * 10 roll-backs into straddles
  * 10 fire hydrants (Shortform note: The author doesn’t describe the movement or provide an image or video. You can view a generic version of the exercise here.)
  * 10 mountain climbers (don’t ever put your heels on the ground)
  * 20 seconds of pogo jumps (jump on the balls of your feet as fast as you can with your legs straight)
  * 2 sets of five seconds of wide-outs



**3\. Use an effective starting position.** If you’re right-handed, set up behind the line with your left foot a foot behind the line, and your right foot right behind your left heel. Your feet should be hip-width apart. Put the thumb, index, and middle finger of your right hand on the line. Put your weight on your right arm so that your shoulder is forward of your hand. Bend your left elbow at a 90-degree angle. Look at a spot on the ground three feet in front of your left foot and keep your head down. (If you’re left-handed, do everything opposite.)

**4\. Start with good technique.** Your right arm shoots backward. Your first step is with your left leg and it should land on the spot you focused your gaze on in the previous step. Your knee should be forward of your toes when you land.

**5\. Maintain good form as you sprint.** As you run, your upper body should always be forward of your lower body and your chin should be down (if it’s up, your feet hit the ground heel-first, which can injure the hamstrings). Use as few steps as possible.

#### Avoiding Hamstring Tears

Hamstring injuries are common in sprinting. There are some prehab exercises you can do to reduce your chance of injury:

  * Practice the natural glute-ham raise. 
  * Strengthen your hip extension using hyperextensions, kettlebell swings, sled dragging, or supine hip thrusts.
  * Stretch your hip flexors. If they’re tight, they constantly pull on your hamstrings.



If your hamstrings start to feel tight while training, they’re close to tearing, so stop your workout and rest. Don’t stretch (the muscle is already overstretched). Instead, ice the muscle and apply arnica montana.

### Endurance Running

Running long distances requires different training and technique than sprinting short distances. The author trained with and learned from Brian MacKenzie, who’s well-known for training long-distance runners by having them run short distances for short periods. For example, one of his trainees, “Rookie,” had never run more than four miles. After 11 weeks, he was able to run a 50-kilometer ultramarathon.

There are three steps to learning endurance running:

#### Step #1: Learn Running Technique

The first step to endurance running is learning the Pose method, which was developed by Dr. Nicholas Romanov and is Brian MacKenzie’s preferred technique.

To run in the Pose method:

  1. **Get your forward motion from gravity.** Don’t push off your feet to move forwards. Instead, lean your weight forward by imagining you’re falling forward from the hips and use your hamstrings to pull your feet off the ground at a 45-degree angle.
  2. **Always keep your legs bent.** This will force you to use gravity instead of pushing off.
  3. **Use good foot positioning.** As you run, your feet should always be under you, not in front of you, and you should be running on the balls of your feet.
  4. **Take at least 180 steps a minute.** This speed forces you to employ the techniques mentioned above and will make use of muscle elasticity. To keep your stride small enough to meet this tempo, you’ll also have to keep your arm movements small. Bend your elbows at 90 degrees and keep your wrists at chest height.



One way to learn this technique is to take photos of yourself running with a high-speed camera that takes 30 frames a second. Ideally, you want to see the following in a single stride:

  1. Your body is in the air for 5 frames.
  2. Your body is touching the ground for fewer than 3 frames.
  3. Your legs should cross for only ¾ of a frame.



While the Pose method has some great benefits, such as improving running speed, making it possible to run on ice, and saving the knees, **it has a downside: potential calf and Achilles tendon injuries.** Learn the Pose technique gradually, and if you experience pain during any of the steps, skip them.

Brian MacKenzie has some additional tips about running form:

  * To avoid sore shins, don’t pull your toes up while running. If you have trouble avoiding this, before you start running, tire out the pulling-up muscle (tibialis anterior) by pressing your toes down with your hands and lifting your toes against them. Do this 30 times for each foot.
  * Run quietly. If you’re making a loud stomping sound, you’re probably overusing your hip flexors and quads.
  * If you get so tired that your form starts to deteriorate, concentrate on taking lots of steps.



#### Step #2: Get in Shape

Every time your feet hit the ground, your tendons, ligaments, and muscles are stretched and contracted, and experience impact. In a 50-kilometer race, your feet might strike the ground between 20,000-25,000 times, and you need to prepare your body for that kind of stress.

  * For example, when the author first started running, he pulled his hamstring and experienced back pain. This was partly because he had tight quads and hip flexors, which forced his body to bend at the hip. This bent position inhibits the glutes, so the hamstrings have to take over, and they’re less suited because they’re smaller and weaker. Tight hip flexors also pull on the lower back, which causes pain. 



Get in shape by doing the following movement exercises:

**Exercise #1: Stretch the hip flexors and quads.** You can hit both with one stretch: Kneel on one knee, like you’re proposing, in front of a couch. Put the shin of your back leg against the couch. Tense your abs to keep your back straight. You should feel a stretch in the front of your back leg, and the hip of your front leg. Hold each side for 90 seconds.

**Exercise #2: Stretch the glutes.** There are two stretches and you should do both:

  1. Stand in front of a table. Put one leg on the table with the knee bent at 90 degrees and lay the outside of your shin flat on the table (similar to the pigeon pose in yoga). Put one hand on your foot and lean forwards for 90 seconds. Then, lean 60 degrees to the left and the right of the knee, and hold each angle for 90 seconds. If your knee hurts, prop it up with pillows or let your ankle hang off the edge of the table.
  2. Stand in front of the table again and lift one foot onto the surface, keeping the bottom of your foot flat on the tabletop. Now, lean forward and hold for 90 seconds. Then, push your knee to the side with a hand. Lean away from it and hold for 90 seconds.



**Exercise #3: Reposition the hips.** Get into a crawling position. Put your weight on your hands and one knee, so that the other knee has no weight on it. Hold for 90-120 seconds. Then, put the weightless knee on top of the other ankle and let the foot turn out. Hold for 90-120 seconds.

**Exercise #4: Activate your glutes.**

  * Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet a foot away from your glutes. Lift your hips into the air, keeping your weight on your heels. Lower. Do ten reps.
  * Get in the same position as above but hug one knee into your chest. Push against your hands with your shin and lift your hips (the same way you did when both feet were on the ground). Hold at the top for one second and then lower. Do 15 reps on each side. 
  * After doing the single-leg version, go back to the double-leg version to confirm that you can lift your hips higher than before.



**Exercise #5: Build up ankle and foot strength.** Three days a week, jog for half an hour on grass, barefoot, using good running technique.

In addition to doing the exercises, you can see an ART practitioner if you have particularly tight muscles.

#### Step #3: Improve Your Aerobic Capacity

Aerobic means that the body is producing energy using oxygen. When using oxygen, the body, among other things:

  * Uses fat as an energy source. One pound of fat equals around 4,000 food calories, and even if you have a low body fat percentage, since a single pound is so calorie-dense, you have an almost limitless supply of energy.
  * Runs the sodium-potassium pump. This pump helps eliminate muscle soreness and helps muscles recover after a workout.



Anaerobic means the opposite—the body is producing energy without oxygen. When your body runs out of oxygen (you’re moving so fast that it takes too long to get the oxygen you’re breathing to your systems), it:

  * Uses glycogen (a carbohydrate) as an energy source. Your body can only store around 1,800-2,200 calories as glycogen, so your energy supply is limited and will quickly run out. You can replenish your glycogen a little by eating, but likely not enough to complete an ultramarathon.
  * Shuts down the sodium-potassium pump.



**The goal of MacKenzie’s training is to increase your body’s capacity to run aerobically rather than anaerobically.** First, we’ll look at the different parts of the program. Then, we’ll look at how to schedule them.

The program includes:

  * **Interval training.** Interval training is alternating periods of intense exercise and short rests. In this program, the interval training involves running 1,600 meters divided up into 8 sets of 200m, 4 sets of 400m, or 2 sets of 800m. For 8 or 4 sets, there’s a 90 second rest period. For the 2 sets, there’s a 2-3 minute rest period.
  * **CrossFit.** CrossFit includes exercises designed to condition the metabolic system. CrossFit exercises are usually done for 2-10 minutes. You can find CrossFit exercises and routines here.
  * **Time trials.** Time trials measure how fast you can run certain distances so you can measure your progress over time. It’s normal for these to get slower in your first three weeks of training. After that, you’ll see improvement.
  * **Refueling.** You need to learn how to eat while running because ultramarathons take so much time and energy. Every 20-30 minutes of running, eat half a gram of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight while gulping water. For example, if you weigh 60 kg, eat 30 grams of carbohydrate per half hour. Additionally, consider taking GENr8 Vitargo S2 after a workout. This will help you refuel on glycogen. 



There are two options for scheduling training sessions:

  1. Do intervals on Monday and Thursday mornings, CrossFit in the afternoons Monday to Friday, and the time trial on Sunday afternoons. On Mondays and Thursdays, when you’re training twice a day, make sure you have at least three hours’ rest between sessions.
  2. On an 11-day repeating schedule, do intervals in the mornings on days 2, 7, and 10. Do CrossFit in the afternoons on days 1-3, 5-7, and 9-11. Do time trials in the afternoons on days 4 and 8.



If you ever hit a point where you’ve been resting for three minutes (in the first four weeks) or two minutes (following weeks) and your heart rate is above 120, end the workout.

A weak runner will need to follow this program for six to eight weeks.

#### Step #4: Taper Training Before a Race

In the week before your race, you’ll taper (reduce) your training time. For example, if your race is on a Saturday, you might:

  * Skip your time trial on the preceding Sunday and do a 45-60-minute easy run instead.
  * Do your intervals at a slower pace.
  * Only do one CrossFit workout, and rest both Wednesday and Friday.
