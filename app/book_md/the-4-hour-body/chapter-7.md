## Chapter 7: Supplements and Temperature Manipulation

Supplements and temperature manipulation are the last of the three building blocks for recomp. We’ll look at supplements first. Consult with your doctor before taking any supplements—the supplements the author recommends can react badly with other medications and health conditions. Make sure to take lots of B-complex vitamins while taking the supplements.

### Supplements

The author discusses three families of supplements:

#### PAGG

The author recommends taking a combination of supplements with the acronym PAGG to reduce the amount of insulin your body releases and aid fat loss:

  * **P** olicosanol is a plant wax extract. The author originally took it in an attempt to lower his cholesterol (it worked for him even though there’s no conclusive scientific evidence of its effectiveness). He discovered that it had a side effect of increasing the effectiveness of the other three supplements below. Take one dose (20-25 mg) per day before going to bed.
  * **A** lpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant (a compound that protects cells against potentially dangerous molecules). It’s useful in fat loss because it encourages carbohydrate storage in muscles or the liver, rather than in fat. Take 100-300 mg (less if you experience acid reflux) four times a day before breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bed.
  * Epigallocatechin gallate, which is found in**g** reen tea. It’s useful in fat loss for two reasons: 1) like ALA, it encourages carbohydrate storage in muscles and additionally inhibits storage in fat cells, and 2) it kills off mature fat cells (when you lose weight, your fat cells shrink but don’t die). Take 325 mg three times a day (use decaffeinated green tea extract pills to avoid the caffeine and imprecision of tea-drinking) before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
  * **G** arlic extract. Garlic contains allicin, which appears to inhibit fat regain, though the science isn’t well understood. Take at least 200 mg four times a day before breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bed. Raw garlic will upset your stomach, so cook it, or take an aged-garlic extract that contains allicin and S-Allyl cysteine (which may help the body uptake allicin).



You should take the supplements six days a week and take a full week off every 60 days.

#### ECA

Before discovering PAGG, the author took a combination of supplements known as the ECA stack (**e** phedrine hydrochloride, **c** affeine, and **a** spirin). While many studies agree that the cocktail is effective, and the author saw results, **it produces some serious side effects including adrenal fatigue and withdrawal pains. He doesn’t recommend the ECA stack.**

#### Probiotics and Prebiotics

There are two types of gut bacteria related to fat absorption: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Obese people have a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. As they lose weight, the ratio includes more Bacteroidetes. Scientists don’t know exactly how Firmicutes and obesity are related yet.

**You can influence your gut bacteria populations by taking probiotics and prebiotics.** Probiotics are bacteria, and prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of bacteria.

Additionally, to keep your gut healthy:

  * Avoid Splenda. A Duke University study discovered that Splenda reduced the number of healthy gut bacteria.
  * Eat more fermented foods, such as kimchi and sauerkraut. Fermented foods contain healthy gut bacteria and are a common element to the diet of extremely healthy indigenous communities.



A healthy gut comes with some additional benefits besides fat loss—95% of the body’s serotonin, a hormone related to mood, is produced in the gut. Therefore, a healthy gut contributes to better mental health.

### Temperature Manipulation

In addition to taking supplements, you can influence your fat loss by cooling your body. This is because one type of fat, brown adipose tissue (BAT), helps burn calories as heat. **Cold temperatures stimulate BAT and might also contribute to the creation of more BAT,** which will help you burn other types of fat.

  * For example, Ray slept without blankets, took outdoor walks in the winter without a jacket, and drank ice water. Within a week, he’d lost almost six pounds. 



To harness the power of temperature in your weight-loss journey, use these four strategies:

**1\. Ice the back of your neck or upper back.** (BAT is mainly found in the upper chest and neck.) Leave the ice on for 20-30 minutes.

**2\. Drink at least half a liter of ice water as soon as you wake up.** This will increase the rate your body uses energy when it's at rest (resting metabolic rate).

**3\. Take cold showers.** Use hot water for the first 1-2 minutes, then step out of the water and put soap in your hair and face. Turn the water to cold and rinse just your head. Get fully under the water, facing away from the stream so the water hits your upper back and neck. Stay there for 1-3 minutes as you finish your soaping routine, and then rinse. Take this kind of shower before bed and/or before breakfast.

**4\. Take 20-minute ice baths** that are cold enough to make you shiver. To make an ice bath, pour two or three bags of ice into a bath half full of cold water. When the ice is 80% melted, get in. If you’re a beginner, immerse only your lower body for five minutes, and then the rest of your body minus your hands for the next five minutes. To increase the fat-loss effect, have 10-20 grams of protein and 200-450 milligrams of cayenne half an hour before the bath.
