## Part 1: Basic Body Recomposition | Chapter 2: Biology Basics

The first of the six topics the author covers in the 4HB is body recomposition. Body composition is a measure of how much of the body is made up of fat versus muscle. To change your body composition, known as “recomp,” you need to lose fat, gain muscle, or both.

In this chapter, we’ll look at three of the biological factors that affect recomp: calories, insulin, and muscle. Understanding these factors and how they affect the body will make it easier to understand the mechanisms behind the strategies in subsequent chapters.

### Understanding Calories

The calorie was invented by Wilbur Olin Atwater in the nineteenth century. He measured calories by incinerating food. However, humans don’t incinerate food when they eat; digestion is a far more complicated chemical process. (For example, eating a piece of firewood isn’t going to release the same amount of energy into your body that would be released into the air if the log were burned.) As a result, **the calorie isn’t a particularly useful measure when it comes to body recomposition** because it's not an accurate measure of how much energy you’re actually getting from digesting food.

Therefore, when thinking about your calorie intake and outtake, it’s important to keep the following in mind:

  * **Anything you ingest needs to make it to your bloodstream to have an effect.** If it goes through your body without being absorbed, your body doesn’t change in any way. (Shortform note: Today’s food calorie calculations are adjusted for absorption.)
  * **The body responds differently to calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates** —each produces a different hormonal response. For example, in a study of people on semistarvation diets:
    * The people who ate 90% fat lost 0.9 pounds a day.
    * The people who ate 90% protein lost 0.6 pounds a day.
    * The people who ate 90% carbohydrates lost 0.24 pounds a day.
  * **Exercise isn’t the only (or best) way to burn calories**. It’s only the most commonly cited because it's easy to measure and scientists, under pressure to constantly publish, choose easier studies, and then to justify them, inflate their importance. Drugs and changes in body temperature also burn calories.



### Understanding Insulin and Blood Sugar

**Insulin is a hormone that absorbs sugar from the bloodstream and, among other things, transforms this sugar into energy or stores it as fat.** Your body naturally releases insulin whenever your blood sugar rises—generally, whenever you eat or drink. The less insulin you release, the less fat your body stores.

Glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) are measures of how much a food increases blood sugar. (GL corrects for portion size and is calculated by multiplying GI by the number of carbohydrates.) These measurements have two downsides: 1) they don’t take into account different body chemistries and genetics, and 2) they’re all isolated measurements and most people eat food in combination, so the math is challenging.

The author wasn’t satisfied with GI and GL, so he monitored his blood sugar levels using a DexCom, a medical implant usually used by diabetics. He experimented with eating different foods, and different combinations of foods, to see how long it took them to affect his blood sugar and how much the levels changed. The author discovered all of the following about his own body. While everyone is different, others have found his discoveries accurate for themselves:

**Discovery #1: Maintaining a constant blood sugar of 100mg/dL is ideal for fat loss.** Consuming the following will help keep your blood sugar level flat:

  * **Fat.** Eat fat, such as nuts, before you eat the rest of your meal to keep your blood sugar levels more constant.
  * **Fructose**(fruit sugar). While fructose can help you maintain constant blood sugar, it also slows fat loss, so consume it sparingly.
  * **Fresh lemon juice.** In the author’s experiments, if he consumed three tablespoons of lemon juice before eating, his blood sugar level spike was 10% lower than it would have been.
  * **Cinnamon,** which reduces the glycemic index of food by up to 30%. This is partly because cinnamon makes it take longer for food to leave your stomach, which not only affects your blood sugar but makes you feel full. To use cinnamon most effectively:
    * Choose Saigon cinnamon, which is most effective. Cassia cinnamon is next-best.
    * Make sure the cinnamon is fresh—it loses potency over time.
    * Don’t eat more than one and a half teaspoons a day—cinnamon contains some substances that are dangerous in large quantities, such as coumarin, which is a blood thinner.



**Discovery #2: Vinegar _doesn’t_ reduce the glycemic index of food.** While there’s a lot of scientific evidence to support that consuming vinegar with a meal can lower its glycemic index, the author found vinegar had no effect on him. He thought that might have been because he wasn’t consuming enough vinegar, or because it was reacting with something else he was eating.

**Discovery #3: The speed at which you eat affects your blood sugar levels.** When you eat quickly, your body digests food all at once, which causes a spike in blood sugar. Eat more slowly to flatten the curve—take at least half an hour to eat each meal. To do this, you might:

  * Divide your plate into sections and take breaks in between each section. For example, the author divides his plate into thirds and waits five minutes after eating each portion.
  * Force yourself to chew more, which will force you to eat more slowly. For example, Matt Mullenweg forced himself to chew each mouthful 20 times. Making this one change lost him 18 pounds.



**Discovery #4: Drinking water dilutes digestion**. Drink water while you eat, ideally while you’re taking breaks between plate sections. (Shortform note: In fact, drinking water doesn’t dilute digestive juices, but it does aid digestion in other ways such as softening food.)

**Discovery #5: It takes a long time for food to increase blood sugar.** It usually took 90 to 180 minutes after eating before the author would see his blood sugar spike. Orange juice was faster, at 40 minutes. This meant that if the author needed energy for a workout, he needed to eat between an hour and a half and two hours before going to the gym.

### Understanding Muscles

Muscle fibers are made of two pieces:

  1. Myofibrils are filaments that contract muscles. Myofibrillar growth (adding more filaments) increases the strength of muscles and makes them a little larger. This growth is caused by doing a few reps (1-5) with a lot of weight (80-90% of the heaviest weight you can lift once).
  2. Sarcoplasm is the liquid around the myofibrils that stores energy. Sarcoplasmic growth (increasing the volume of fluid) increases the size of muscles and makes them a little stronger. This growth is caused by doing more reps (8-12) with lighter weight (60-80% of the heaviest weight you can lift once). (Bonus: This kind of training also creates more capillaries, which help the body deliver nutrients more efficiently.)



Both myofibrils and sarcoplasm are important. Some people deprioritize the sarcoplasm because it’s “just water,” but water helps promote protein production and dehydration decreases muscle endurance. Finally, the size of sarcoplasm is important because when the sarcoplasm grows, its potential for energy storage increases as well.
