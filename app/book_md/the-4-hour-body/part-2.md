## Part 2: Advanced Recomp | Chapter 8: Bigger Changes

In the previous part, we looked at some basic strategies for moderate recomp. Now, we’ll look at some advanced strategies to create significant change. Like basic recomp, advanced recomp involves a combination of diet, exercise, and supplements, but often one is prioritized, depending on your goals.

First, we’ll look at significant fat loss. Then we’ll tackle significant muscle gain.

### Losing the Last Pounds of Fat: Copy Bodybuilders

Once your body fat percentage is low enough that you only need to lose a final 5-10 pounds, you can employ some of the strategies bodybuilders use to get their body fat percentage below 10%.

#### Diet

Diet is the most important factor when it comes to losing your last few pounds. Move from the Slow-Carb Diet to the following diet. Eat one of the following five meals every three hours. You have to eat your first meal within an hour of waking and your last meal within the hour before sleeping. You can’t skip any.

  1. Whey protein and nut butter OR nuts
  2. Cooked, non-fatty, white fish and nut butter OR nuts
  3. Cooked chicken or turkey and nut butter OR nuts
  4. Cooked, fattier protein such as ground beef or dark poultry and macadamia or olive oil
  5. Eggs



At each meal, you can also eat as much as you want of broccoli, collards, asparagus, spinach, kale, and Brussels sprouts. You can have a cheat meal every week or so.

If you weigh 160 pounds or less, eat the following quantities:

  * 30 grams of whey protein
  * One tablespoon of nut butter or a quarter cup of nuts
  * 4 ounces of meat
  * Half a tablespoon of oil
  * 3 eggs



If you’re heavier than 160 pounds, adjust the portions:

  * To get the amount of whey protein, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.25.
    * For example, if you’re 200 pounds, you should eat 50 grams.
  * To get the number of tablespoons of nut butter, divide your weight in pounds in half. 
    * If you’re 200 pounds, you should eat 2 tablespoons.
  * To get the number of cups of nuts, divide your weight in pounds by 400.
    * If you’re 200 pounds, you should eat half a cup.
  * To get the ounces of protein, for each additional 10 pounds of lean body mass you have, add an ounce.
    * If you’re 200 pounds, eat 8 ounces.
  * To get the amount of oil, divide your weight in pounds by 400.
    * If you’re 200 pounds, you should eat half a tablespoon.
  * To get the number of eggs, divide your weight in pounds by 40.
    * If you’re 200 pounds, you should eat five.



(Shortform note: The author doesn’t give the calculations for all portion adjustments. We’ve come up with the numbers based on his two examples.)

#### Drugs

Some bodybuilders use drugs, such as steroids, to get their body fat as low as 4%. The author doesn’t think steroids are as dangerous as the media hypes them up to be—they work for certain medical conditions—but he doesn’t recommend anyone experiment with drugs without medical supervision.

### Gaining Significant Muscle: Occam’s Protocol

To gain significant muscle and a bodybuilder-like build, you’ll use a combination of exercise and diet that the author developed called Occam’s Protocol, with the option of additionally using supplements. The protocol has impressive results:

  * Example #1: Although the author was genetically predisposed to not be bulky (he had a common genetic mutation), he was able to gain 34 pounds of muscle in less than a month using the protocol. 
  * Example #2: Neil, while following Occam’s Protocol, gained ten pounds of muscle in four weeks and was able to lift 50 pounds more than when he started.



As usual, the protocol will make use of the MED and requires fewer than four hours in the gym per week. All you need to do is hit the threshold to start muscular growth and then manipulate your diet so that energy from food goes toward growing your muscles instead of being stored as fat.

(Note: The goal of Occam’s Protocol is to improve your appearance, not to become stronger. While you will become stronger because you’re building muscle, if your goal is functional strength, see Part 6 for some sports-specific strength tips.)

#### Exercise

Exercise is the first element of Occam’s Protocol, and the workouts are based on a routine developed by Mike Mentzer, a successful competitive bodybuilder. The program is designed to be as safe as possible and the author has never hurt himself.

First, we’ll go over the workouts in detail. Then we’ll look at some general rules for both workouts, how to choose appropriate weights, and how to schedule your training.

##### Workouts

The protocol contains only two workouts. They can both be done with either machines or free weights. The author recommends machines for most people, but if you train at different gyms, free weights are easier to standardize. (Shortform note: If the author doesn’t describe how to do the exercise, we’ve included a link to a video of the generic exercise.)

**_Workout #1_**

**Machine Version**

Do one set of the following:

  * At least 7 pull-downs. Use a close, supinated (palms facing you) grip.
  * At least 7 shoulder presses
  * Optional: 10 myotatic crunches and 10 cat vomit exercises



**Free Weight Version**

Do one set of the following:

  * At least 7 Yates rows. Bend at the waist at a 20-30 degree angle. Pick up a barbell with your palms facing away from you and let it hang with your arms straight. Lift it to your hip.
  * At least 7 overhead presses with a barbell. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart or split, which protects your back. Don’t flare your elbows. When you lift the bar, pass it in front of your face, but at the top, it should be above your head.
  * Optional: 10 myotatic crunches and 10 cat vomit exercises



**_Workout #2_**

**Machine Version**

Do one set of the following:

  * At least 7 bench presses. (See Chapter 15 for bench press instructions.) Incline or decline the bench up to 20 degrees to protect your shoulders. If the bench isn’t adjustable, you can put a towel behind your lower back. Don’t lower the weights all the way—this will help reduce injury and increase your chest development.
  * At least 10 leg presses. (The leg set has more reps because this will increase the hormone response of the whole body and form new capillaries.)
  * Optional: 50 kettlebell swings
  * 3 minutes on a stationary bike at a pace of at least 85 rpm. This will help reduce leg soreness. You don’t need to do any additional cardio because weight lifting activates the same system—the aerobic system—as cardio. This is because the point of the aerobic system is to serve muscles. 



**Free Weight Version**

Do one set of the following:

  * At least 7 bench presses. (See Chapter 15 for bench press instructions.) Use a shoulder-width grip.
  * At least 10 weighted squats. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder-width and 12 inches in front of your hips. Sit back until your upper legs are parallel to the floor. Don’t pause or look down.
  * Optional: 50 kettlebell swings
  * 3 minutes on a stationary bike at a pace of at least 85 rpm. This will help reduce leg soreness.



##### General Rules for the Workouts

  * There’s no need to do a warm-up before workouts. Instead, start each set by doing three reps of each exercise at a 1/2 cadence (one second to lift, two seconds to lower) with 60% of the weight you’d use for a real set. This will reveal any joint problems or new injuries. The author has never seen anyone get injured using the protocol.
  * You can train with a partner if you like, but make sure socializing doesn’t distract you. Don’t let your partner help or spot you, because then you may not be lifting the full weight yourself.
  * Keep your shoulders in the locked position.
  * Use a 5/5 cadence (five seconds to lift, five seconds to lower). Don’t pause during any of the movements except as noted in the exercise directions.
  * Rest for exactly three minutes in between sets. (If you don’t want to get bulky, you can shorten the rest times to 30 seconds, which will target fat loss rather than muscle gain.)
  * Never change anything except the weight and reps. Speed, rest, and form should all stay the same.
  * Don’t do anything that isn’t part of the workout. Doing extra could result in injury.
  * By the end of each set, you should reach failure, the point at which it’s physically impossible for you to move the weight any more. Hold the weight at the failure point for five seconds and then _slowly_(take 5-10 seconds)__ lower it. The failure rep is the most important.
    * For example, if you’re doing a push-up and can’t push yourself all the way back to the top, hold your body at the point where you’re stuck and then slowly lower yourself.
  * Record the settings on the machine (for example, the seat adjustment) so that you can reproduce the same conditions every time.



##### Choosing Your Weights

To figure out which weight to start the program with:

  * Choose a reasonable-seeming weight, do a set of five reps of each exercise (cadence fast but controlled on the up, and 2 seconds down), and rest 60 seconds. 
    * For example, say you start with 80 pounds on the pull-down.
  * Increase the weight by 10% or 10 pounds, whichever is lighter, and do another five reps. 
    * For example, move up to a 90-pound weight.
  * Keep increasing and resting until you fail to complete a set of five.
    * For example, say at 110 pounds, you can only complete 4 reps.
  * Once you fail, multiply the weight of the last set you successfully completed by 60% for the shoulder press and 70% for everything else. This is your starting weight (round to the closest available weight on the bar or machine).
    * For example, say your last successful set was 100 pounds. Multiply this by 70% to get a starting weight of 70 pounds.
  * Rest three minutes before beginning the protocol set.
  * Rest five minutes before testing the weight for your next set.



After testing, only change the weight in between workouts, not during. Increase the weight whenever you can complete the minimum number of reps for all non-optional sets, and increase by 10% or 10 pounds, whichever is larger. If the new weight still feels easy after a few reps, pause for five minutes. Then add another 5-10 pounds.

##### Scheduling the Workouts

The general principle behind scheduling your workouts is that **the stronger and bigger you get, the more time you need to rest. Muscles grow faster than they recover.** Expert Dr. Doug McGuff found that most people get the most benefit from training less than once a week (putting aside benefits like sports being fun).

Before starting Occam’s Protocol, stop any training that damages your muscles (resistance training) for a week. Then, schedule your workouts as follows:

  * Rest two days in between workouts #1 and #2.
  * After you’ve done both workouts twice, rest three days in between them.
  * When you hit a plateau in more than one exercise (you can’t increase the weight), rest four days in between workouts.
  * Add another rest day in between workouts every time you hit a plateau.
  * Once your workouts are spaced a week apart, if you’re not continuing to gain muscle, try splitting your workouts into two parts so that you’re training twice a week.



As far as workout time, **studies have shown that people’s muscles are strongest between 4 pm and 6 pm.** Pain tolerance for some conditions, such as arthritis, is highest between 4 pm and 5 pm. However, according to the author, most of these studies don’t take wake-up time into account. **The author has found that for him, strength and pain tolerance are highest 8-10 hours after waking up** (4 pm to 6 pm is 8-10 hours after a typical wake-up time of 8 am).

Regardless of when your ideal training time is, **you should work out at around the same time every day so that you can accurately gauge your progress.**

#### Diet

While working out according to Occam’s Protocol, follow the Slow-Carb Diet but include the following additions:

  * Drink half a shake in the morning and before bed. To make the shake, combine:
    * 5 ice cubes
    * 3 cups milk (2% or whole organic)
    * 1 banana
    * 30g whey protein isolate
    * 3 heaping tablespoons almond butter
  * Add starch to the meals without shakes.
  * Optional: If you’re struggling to gain muscle mass, drink up to four liters of 2% organic milk daily, between meals. Milk increases fat gain, so start with just a liter per day. If you’re lactose intolerant, start with one glass of organic whole milk per day—after a couple of weeks, drinking milk may be comfortable. (Shortform note: We recommend consulting your doctor first.)



**If you’re not gaining at least 2.5 pounds of muscle a week, you probably need to eat more.** You need to eat 20 calories for every pound of your lean body weight plus an extra 200 calories per day. Count calories for one day to make sure you’re not accidentally undereating.

If you have trouble eating enough, soldier on—your body just needs some time to adjust to the changes.**** If the problem is that you have trouble eating a lot _at once_ , eat smaller portions more often instead. Or, try liquid food instead of solid, such as shakes, which is especially helpful for those who have trouble with breakfast.

  * For example, bodybuilder Dave Palumbo couldn’t eat any more food without throwing it up. He blended his food and then stayed still for 15 minutes to let his body settle.



##### Protein

As part of your quest to eat a lot, make sure you eat a lot of protein. To build muscle, **you should eat 1.35 grams of protein for every pound of lean body weight.** For example, if you weigh 120 pounds and your body fat percentage is 15%, 18 pounds of your body is fat. Subtract 18 pounds from 120 to get 102 pounds: your lean body weight. Multiply 102 by 1.35 to get 127.5 grams of protein.

While popular belief says the human body can’t process more than 30 grams of protein in a single sitting, this is untrue. **It’s fine to either eat protein throughout the day or eat it all once.** Researchers in France found that for 26-year-old women, it didn’t matter if the protein was consumed all in one sitting or throughout the day; the body handled either method just fine. Older subjects actually retained the protein better if they ate it all at once.

#### Supplements

You don’t have to take supplements with Occam’s Protocol—it works fine on its own—but if you’d like to, the author has four recommendations:

  1. **Cissus quadrangularis.** This medicinal plant is usually used for joint repair, but when the author was taking it after elbow surgery, he noticed that it also stopped him from gaining weight. He took 2.4 grams half an hour before eating, three times a day, and didn’t gain weight even though at that time in his life, he was eating a lot of rice and sugar.
  2. **Alpha-lipoic acid**. See Chapter 7 for more detail on its uses.
  3. **L-glutamine.** This amino acid helps repair tissue, notably the intestines, which need to be in good working order to process all the food you have to eat as part of the protocol. For the first five days of the protocol, consume 10 grams every two hours until you reach 80 grams. On subsequent days, optionally consume 10-30 grams after each workout.
  4. **Creatine monohydrate.** This compound increases protein synthesis, as well as the force of muscle. Have 5-20 grams daily, 3.5 grams when you wake up and before bed daily.



#### Troubleshooting

Like any program, there are challenges with following Occam’s Protocol. Here are some of the common problems people encounter and how to fix them:

**Problem #1: You miss a workout because of travel.** If you have to miss a workout, take the time as a rest day rather than trying to do a partial or adjusted workout. If you travel a lot, consider using free weights instead of machines because most gyms have standardized versions.

**Problem #2: You miss the minimum number of reps.** Failing to complete reps happens for two reasons: You didn’t eat or rest enough, or you stopped too early and didn’t push yourself to total failure. If you miss by more than one rep on the first exercise, stop and take a rest day before trying again—don’t change the weight or make an adjustment. Take an extra rest day between all future workouts.

**Problem #3: You feel the 5/5 cadence makes you slower in other athletic pursuits.** There’s no evidence to suggest that using a slower cadence will make you slow in general. In fact, there’s evidence to the contrary: In 1973, a high school weightlifting team trained by doing slow negatives and were very successful at Olympic weightlifting, which requires a lot of speed. As long as you don’t let weightlifting get in the way of your other training, you’ll be fine.

**Problem #4: You want to change the protocol.** This program is designed to help you gain 10 or more pounds of muscle in a month. If you have a different goal, choose a different program.

**Problem #5: You want to train less often.** Some trainers suggest training only once or twice a month. This technique is more helpful for strength gain than size gain. To gain size, you need to eat a lot and use exercise to encourage insulin to deliver glucose to muscles rather than fat. If you only train once or twice a month, you can’t eat as much.
