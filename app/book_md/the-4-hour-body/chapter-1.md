## Chapter 1: Introduction—The 4-Hour Body (4HB)

**The 4-Hour Body (4HB) is an experimental lifestyle with the goal of finding out what makes your body work best.** Author Tim Ferriss has been living this lifestyle for years. In _The 4-Hour Body_ , he shares what he’s learned about his own body from researching scientific literature, interviewing experts, and self-experimentation. The book’s title comes from a 28-day experiment in which he spent only four hours total in the gym but lost three pounds of fat, gained 34 pounds of muscle, and decreased his total cholesterol.

Ferriss covers six topics:

  1. Body recomposition (changing the percentages of your body that are made up of muscle vs. fat)
  2. Enhancing sex
  3. Improving sleep
  4. Preventing and recovering from injuries
  5. Improving sports-specific skills
  6. Living longer



While everyone’s body is different, much of what the author discovered is broadly applicable to most people, so you can **use his recommendations as a starting point and inspiration for your own self-experimentation.** His suggestions are small, straightforward, and easy to adhere to. You’ll see results so quickly that you won’t need any self-discipline—if a technique is obviously creating results, it’s easy to be motivated to keep doing it.

There are four rules to using the book (or summary):

  1. Don’t read the whole thing all at once. Start by choosing only one performance goal (for example, learn to swim) and one appearance goal (for example, lose 20 pounds).
  2. Don’t worry if you don’t understand the science behind the author’s recommendations—if you follow them, you’ll still get results.
  3. Maintain healthy skepticism. While all the strategies in the book will get you results, the author’s explanation of why may not be correct—50% of what humans know about the universe is wrong. However, don’t be so skeptical you don’t try anything.
  4. Be entertained. The reading experience should be fun.



(Shortform note:

  * We’ve rearranged some of the book’s content for coherence and clarity.
  * We recommend consulting your doctor before starting any of the book’s programs or self-experimenting.)



### The Value of Self-Experimentation

Some scientists endorse self-experimentation. It has several advantages compared to conventional scientific research because it’s:

  * **Fast-paced.** When you have an idea about how to improve some element of your life, you can quickly make a change and observe the results. A single scientific study, on the other hand, takes a long time to get started because it requires extensive funding, which is time-consuming to secure. Additionally, it takes it years after a study is completed for the research to be replicated and officially endorsed. 
    * For example, the Food and Drug Administration is 10 years behind published research and 20 years behind evidence.
  * **Unbiased.** Self-experimentation can focus on simple solutions, such as diet or sleep, which have been around since the Stone Age. Conventional research tends to focus on more complicated solutions, such as drugs, because drug companies will fund this work. 
    * For example, dermatologists are focused on the use of drugs to improve acne, even though there’s compelling evidence that diet changes might improve it.
  * **Lead by people who are strongly motivated.** Self-experimenters are motivated by the desire to improve their lives, which is a powerful driver. Conventional researchers, on the other hand, are usually motivated by other goals, such as keeping their jobs, regularly publishing papers, getting funding, or obtaining status. 
  * **Far-reaching.** Whenever you make a change to your lifestyle, you see corresponding changes in your body, some of which you might not have predicted. These changes can lead you to new discoveries and experiments.
    * For example, Seth had been having trouble sleeping for years. When he changed what he ate for breakfast for unrelated reasons, he found that eating fruit instead of oatmeal made him sleep worse and that he slept better when he didn’t eat breakfast at all.
  * **Multi-disciplinary.** As a self-experimenter, you can combine theories from different fields and take more factors into account than a narrow scientific study. 
    * For example, doctors never consult bodybuilders about the impacts of testosterone, and bodybuilders don’t always talk to doctors either. They could learn from each other, but they don’t, and the field of performance enhancement is held back.



### Brush Up on Performance Science

To start your self-experimentation journey, you’ll want to brush up on the cutting edge of performance science. Unfortunately, “common sense” and published research aren’t always accurate, and you’ll need to learn to distinguish what’s legitimate from what’s propaganda.

Always keep the following in mind when you encounter new information on this topic:

**1\. The language around health can be misleading.** Sometimes, health advertising is full of meaningless terms that cause confusion. Whenever you hear a term, ask yourself if you can measure it, and if you can’t, you should avoid it. (For example, a program that will make you “strong enough to do ten chin-ups” is measurable, while one that promises to make you “strong and healthy” isn’t.) There are two specific types of terms to avoid:

  * **Marketer-speak.** These terms have no physiological basis and are used to sell you something or scare you into buying something. For example, “cellulite” is marketer-speak: It first appeared in _Vogue_ in 1968 because the magazine was running out of fashion content and invented a problem in order to give themselves content to write about. Cellulite is simply fat; it’s not a disease.
  * **Scientific-_sounding_ terms. **These words don’t actually have a basis in science and are used in so many contexts that they no longer have much meaning. For example, “optimal” is a scientific-sounding term that doesn’t mean anything—optimal only has meaning when applied towards a specific goal.



**2\. Existing recommendations are based on incomplete knowledge.** Humanity doesn’t fully understand how the world works. When it comes to food, there are probably nutrients no one has isolated yet, and it’s impossible to identify a deficiency in something unknown. Additionally, taking nutrients in isolation (as supplements, rather than getting them through food) can have unexpected effects.

  * For example, many people took beta-carotene supplements, but taking beta-carotene by itself can create many health problems such as increasing the risk of brain hemorrhages.



**3\. Women and men don’t need to train differently** —that’s just a myth invented by marketers. Most of the time, everyone wants the same thing—a little bit more muscle and less fat—and everyone should do the same thing to achieve this. There are two relevant differences between men and women, but neither necessitates a different type of training method:

  * On average, women have less than 10% as much testosterone as men, so they don’t grow muscle as quickly. As a result, there’s no need to worry about bulking up overnight—it won’t happen, even if you’re a woman who has a higher amount of testosterone than average. If you do start to see visible changes to your muscles you don’t like over time, you can change your program.



**4\. Your genes affect your body, but they don’t rule it.** While you might be more likely to be overweight or have a particular type of muscle, you can overcome a predisposition.

  * For example, you inherit one of two muscle types from your parents: slow-twitch (good at endurance) and fast-twitch (good for sprints and strength). However, you can change the amount of both types by training.



**5\. A “drug” is anything that you ingest that affects your body (except whole foods).** Different names and categories for drugs—supplements, over-the-counter, and so on—don’t indicate what’s effective or safe.

**6\. It’s not always easy to tell what factor is causing a result.** Ask yourself three questions:

  * Have you correctly identified the result? For example, sprinters have a muscular body type. It’s important to determine whether the body type is a _result_ of training sprinting, or the _cause_ of why people go into sprinting in the first place. The body type is actually the cause, not the result.
  * Is it the absence or presence that’s important? For example, is going on a vegetarian diet effective because getting rid of meat makes you live longer, or because adding more vegetables to your diet does? (It’s the second one.)
  * Are there other variables at play? For example, if a study tested the effects of yoga on the heart and all the participants in the control group were from the same upper-class demographic, the fact that rich people can afford healthier food might have more to do with the results than yoga.



#### Assessing the Validity of Scientific Research

You might think that scientific research would be free from the biases and inaccuracy of popular belief and marketing, but unfortunately, some studies aren’t legitimate. Additionally, the sources that publicize scientific results (like the media) sometimes have an agenda, and even if the science is solid, the reporting may skew it.

To find out what research actually shows, and if research is flawed, dig deeper when you come across the following:

**1\. Results that are relative rather than absolute.** If a headline or study uses words like “longer” or “more,” or gives percentages rather than numbers, dig deeper. These are techniques to obscure results.

  * For example, if you read a headline that says people who eat bananas lose 10% more fat, look at the actual numbers. 10% could be the difference between 90 and 100 pounds, or the difference between 0.09 and 0.1 pounds.



**2\. Results based on surveys or self-reporting when the reporting takes place after the fact.** If a study relies on people remembering their habits, the data the participants provided might be inaccurate, since memory can be flawed. That doesn’t mean the study is completely useless, but it’s more relevant for broad strokes than specifics.

  * For example, 194 people responded to a questionnaire about the Slow-Carb Diet (for more on this diet, see Chapter 4). The data isn’t perfectly accurate for two reasons: 1) people could have forgotten or made up their numbers, and 2) survivorship bias (the tendency of people who achieved positive results being more likely to respond) might have been in play. The questionnaires can, however, tell us that the diet works well for most people who follow the rules (failures were almost all due to people not following the instructions).



**3\. Results from observational studies.** Observational studies look at groups of people outside a controlled environment, so there are many variables at play that may affect the results. The only thing an observational study can tell you is that two things _might_ exist in one group at the same time, not that they necessarily have any cause or effect on each other (except when the numbers are massive, such as the twentyfold increase in lung cancer risk among smokers compared to non-smokers). Their only value is in helping researchers (or yourself) come up with ideas of what things might be related so that they can do a properly controlled test in a lab.

  * For example, a 2004 observational study looked at a group of women who were using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The women in this group had lower heart disease, and the study suggested that HRT was responsible. In fact, this was untrue—later studies found that HRT actually slightly increases the risk of heart disease.



**4\. Results of diet studies that claim to have used a control group.** It’s very hard to change only one thing in a diet study because food is made up of many different elements. Self-experimentation is more valuable in these cases because the state of your body before you make a change is in your control, and you don’t need to know exactly what you changed to get the result—just that whatever you ate _created_ results.

  * For example, in a whole-food diet, when one group stops eating a fatty food, this will decrease both fat _and_ protein in the diet, which in turn decreases calories. This change means that the control group and test group have at least three variables differentiating them: the amount of fat, protein, and calories they’re consuming. It’s impossible to know which variable will be responsible for the study’s results.



**5\. Results that are caused by randomness, not causation.** All good scientific studies include a p-value, which indicates how likely it is that the results are simply random. Studies with a p-value of lower than 0.05 have results that are statistically significant—there’s a lower than 5% chance that they’re random. There are three things to keep in mind about p-values:

  * Remember that chance can explain a lot. For example, at a party with 23 attendees, there’s a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.
  * Small sample sizes are okay if the differences in results are large. For example, if changing a controlled variable triples an effect, you don’t need to test it on very many people to show that the change is significant.
  * Combining p-values of multiple experiments invalidates the accuracy of the p-value. Scientists sometimes do this if they’re trying to make their results match their agenda, so it’s important to watch out for.



**6\. Results funded by organizations with an agenda.** Sometimes, organizations that fund studies want a particular result that will benefit them, and to maintain funding, scientists will skew the data to achieve this result. Skewing the data ranges from comparing the drug to a placebo (as the placebo does nothing, the drug is almost guaranteed to have better results than it), only generally and vaguely asking about side effects, or leaving out negative results. To find out who funded a study, read the “conflicts of interest” section, and look for notes about consulting fees.

  * For example, researcher James Hill’s work about the relationship between high sugar consumption and obesity is funded by corporations who make high-sugar foods. Hill is attempting to show that sugar doesn’t lead to obesity.



### Minimum Effective Dose

An important part of your experimentation will be to find the **minimum effective dose (MED), which is the smallest dose that will create a particular result.** For example, the MED to boil water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Heating water past 212 degrees doesn’t make it any more boiled. Further heating just wastes fuel.

**Whenever you want to make a change to your body, only do the minimum that’s required to cause the change.** This is for two reasons:

**Reason #1: Avoiding injury.** If you do more than you need to, you’ll actually slow your progress or go backwards because you’ll tire yourself out and overload your body’s healing mechanisms.

  * For example, if you need to put your shoulders under 100 pounds of tension for two minutes twice a week to strengthen them, don’t train every day—you’ll put your shoulders under unnecessary strain and risk injury. Instead, only do the minimum.



**Reason #2: Saving time and energy.** Pareto’s principle states that in general, 80% of results are caused by 20% of the effort. When it comes to performance science, the ratio is even higher—according to the author, 2.5% of effort is responsible for 95% of results. Doing more than you have to isn’t going to have much effect and is a waste of your time.

### Getting Tested

There are limits to what you can learn from self-experimentation if your only data-gathering technique is observation. For example, you might notice that after eating bananas, you feel better, but this could be for a variety of reasons—bananas contain important nutrients, so perhaps you were feeling unwell because you were deficient in those nutrients. Or, you could have just been hungry. Either way, you might have felt even better if you ate something else. **To learn more about what’s actually going on with your body, you need to have tests done.**

There are three rules for testing:

  1. **Don’t test anything you can’t change.** There’s no point in knowing you’re predisposed to an illness if you can’t do anything about it.
  2. **Double-check alarming results.** If you get a result that requires you to make a big change, get retested, ideally by a different lab, to confirm the result.
  3. **When retesting, try to create the same conditions as the original test.** Take your tests on the same day of the week, around the same time, and at the same time in your menstrual cycle (if applicable).



We’ll look at specific tests for specific goals in later chapters, but the author encourages you to get tested every six months (every three if you’re not eating animal products) to make sure your body is working properly. Everyone should test their aspartate aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (for liver health), total cholesterol (for, among other things, heart health), and follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and prolactin (for sexual health). Men should additionally test their testosterone levels and get their semen analyzed. Women should additionally test their egg supply.

Your insurance might cover your testing, but US doctors often won’t order preventative tests, especially images, because this can open them up to audits by insurance companies. Even if you have to pay for your tests yourself, they’re worth it—they help you detect health problems early.

#### Medical Tourism

Often, testing is less expensive in other countries than the US, so consider getting your tests done while you’re traveling, or plan a trip around them. For example, when the author went to Nicaragua on a surf and writing trip, he also had some MRIs and urine and blood testing done. He paid $400 per MRI (they’re $750 in the US) and he saved $640 on urine and blood tests. Altogether, he saved $3,090, which was more than the cost of his trip.

### Sticking to an Experiment or Program

To successfully carry out an experiment (or to stick to a program that your experimentation has revealed is effective), you need to change your lifestyle. This can be hard when the change makes your life uncomfortable or inconvenient. Even though logic might tell us that we need to make changes, logic isn’t enough of a motivator to result in behavioral changes. For example, many people struggle to quit smoking even if their lung health depends on it.

There are two reasons you may not stick with plans:

  1. **The stakes aren’t high enough.** You would like to successfully make a change, but life’s not that bad if you don’t.
     * For example, Chad had been overweight for years and knew it was a problem, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything permanent about it. He wasn’t going to drop down dead if he hadn’t lost weight by a certain time.
  2. **You’re not tracking your progress.** You can’t hold yourself accountable if you don’t know how closely you’re sticking to the program.



Fortunately, there are some strategies for mitigating these factors:

**Strategy #1: Force an epiphany.** Don’t just wish for change—think of it as necessary.

  * For example, when Chad was clothes shopping, he realized he wasn’t going to look good in anything because of his weight. This was the tipping point that propelled him to change.



**Strategy #2: Measure a variable.** Ideally, you’ll measure the variable most responsible for creating results, but if that’s not possible, measure something else—measuring something is better than nothing.

  * For example, counting calorie intake isn’t a particularly good indicator of weight loss, but if it's all you’ve got, measure it anyway. (Measuring body fat percentage would be better.)



**Strategy #3: Oversimplify.** It’s a lot of work to track and record changes, and the effort required can be discouraging. To avoid this pitfall, estimate instead of striving for exact numbers. The difference is likely negligible, especially if the numbers are large. As long as you’re close, you’ll see results.

  * For example, Chad planned a week’s worth of meals and calculated the exact calorie count, aiming to eat five or six 200-calorie meals a day. After that first week, he estimated how many calories were in his meals, based on what he’d learned from the week’s worth of experience. His estimates were close enough that he saw results.



**Strategy #4: Accept halfway completion.** Even if you can’t finish something, or you can’t do it perfectly, you’ll still reap some benefits from having done part of it.

  * For example, if you never exercise, doing just a little bit of inefficient exercise is still an improvement.
