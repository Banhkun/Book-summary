## Exercise: Develop a Business Idea Based on Your Passions

Fox extensively describes her process of taking her business from idea to reality. Follow the same steps to generate and explore a business.

* * *

Create a list of things youâ€™re passionate about, such as fields, professions, or hobbies. (For example, Fox was passionate about fashion and design.)

Brainstorm a list of ways you could turn one or more of those passions into a business idea, whether as a product or a service. (For example, Fox created a service women could use to design their own shoes.)

Would you need suppliers to help you manufacture your product or provide your service? If so, what method would you use to find suppliers? (For example, you can find suppliers through online professional networks like LinkedIn, through trade shows, or through other companies who make a similar product.)
