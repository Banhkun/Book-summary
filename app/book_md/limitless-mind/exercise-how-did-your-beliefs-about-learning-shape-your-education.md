## Exercise: How Did Your Beliefs About Learning Shape Your Education?

In _Limitless Mind_ , Jo Boaler contends that being labeled as a high, average, or poor achiever, as well as being told that you are or arenâ€™t good at a subject, creates a limiting mindset that can keep you from reaching your full potential. Think back to your time in school and reflect on what kind of messages (positive or negative) you were given by parents and teachers and what impact they had on your educational growth.

* * *

During your early school years, were you labeled as an above- or below-average student? If so, what expectations do you feel were set for you? As a result, do you feel you received more or less attention from teachers than other students in your class?

Were you ever told that you had a special aptitude for any given subject? If so, what was it, and why? How did being told you had a talent affect your efforts and dedication to that subject?

Were you ever discouraged from doing well in a subject? If so, what reason were you given? If you chose to pursue that subject anyway, how did you go about it? If you chose to return to it as an adult, how would your attitude toward it be different?
