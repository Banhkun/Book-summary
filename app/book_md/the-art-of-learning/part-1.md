## Part 1: Fundamentals of Learning | Chapter 1: Three Keys to Learning

_The Art of Learning_ is about chess prodigy and tai chi champion Josh Waitzkin’s approach to learning and growth. He explores the fundamentals of method and mindset, building incrementally through intermediate to advanced strategies.

A prolific learner and competitor from a young age, Waitzkin has a lifetime of practical knowledge in skill-building. At 6 years old, he took on streetside chess hustlers in New York City’s Washington Square Park, and soon drew the attention of legendary chess coach Pandolfini, who became his first mentor.

At 11, Waitzkin drew a match with World Champion Garry Kasparov in a simultaneous exhibition (where a Master plays against several weaker players all at once). Through his childhood and teenage years, Waitzkin dominated the US Junior chess scene, winning multiple national championships and becoming an International Master by age 16.

(Shortform note: Hungarian chess teacher Laszlo Polgar holds that chess prodigies are raised, not born. While natural talent is key to becoming a young Grandmaster, Polgar argued that the keys to genius are _fortunate circumstances_ and _hard work_. Research confirms this, showing that on average, young Masters practiced chess for around 20 hours a week for eight years before becoming Masters. Regarding favorable circumstances, the same study found that chess parents spend about $5,000 to $10,000 annually on lessons, travel, tournaments, and other resources.)

After a later coach disrupted his passion for chess, Waitzkin stepped away from chess and into tai chi. Under Grandmaster William Chi-Cheng Chen, he trained in Tai Chi Push Hands, the competitive variant of tai chi. Waitzkin brought to bear his talent for learning, became the US National Champion, and in 2004, won the World Championship in Taiwan.

Since then, he’s co-founded a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu school with BJJ legend Marcelo Garcia (under whom he earned his BJJ black belt), and now offers personalized training for individuals in the finance, investment, and environmental impact sectors.

(Shortform note: Despite having written a book called _The Art of Learning_ , Waitzkin doesn’t prescribe a set approach. Instead, he offers a reflection on what he learned while encouraging readers to experiment and develop their own methods. In interviews, Waitzkin says personalized training is superior to any set method, since everyone has unique needs, strengths, and preferences.)

Waitzkin argues that **effective learning comes from a resilient commitment to your growth process**. One step at a time, you can build your skills and your mindset, striving toward excellence—which ultimately means developing your personal approach to the skill you’re building.

He explains **how to build a strong foundation, how to develop your personal style, why depth beats breadth** , and much more, drawing from his long experience as a world-class competitor.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin’s approach shares qualities with a number of contemporary perspectives on growth and learning. We’ll refer to incremental development as explained by Matthew Syed in _Black Box Thinking_ ; we’ll bring in the neuroscience of skill-building as explained by Daniel Coyle in _The Talent Code_ ; and we’ll compare Waitzkin’s ideas to those of Barbara Oakley, author of _Learning How to Learn_ and co-founder of the eponymous online course.)

Our guide presents Waitzkin’s approach from the bottom up: **We’ll cover the fundamentals of learning; then his intermediate learning techniques; and finish with his advanced competitive strategies.**

**Part 1 begins with three key themes of effective learning** :

  * To always strive for “presence”
  * To learn through trial and error 
  * To balance tensions as you grow 



Note: These themes aren’t “steps” to take. Rather, they’re features of the growth process to continually return to.

For example, presence helps whether you’re a high school high jumper or an Olympian; you can use trial and error to improve whether you’re a beginner or a master; and you’ll always need to balance tensions, like proper exertion and recovery. After laying out these themes, we’ll explore the fundamentals of Waitzkin’s method, which revolves around patient, incremental learning.

**In Part 2, we’ll discuss his intermediate learning techniques** for developing your methods and mindset in tandem, so you can both improve your technical skills and develop your creative side.

**Part 3 finishes with Waitzkin’s strategies for high-level competition** , including explanations of how to trigger peak performance states, win the mental game, and develop a personalized repertoire of techniques. We’ll finish with his views on how parents and coaches can raise children to love learning.

### Theme #1: Presence Is Central to Life and Learning

Waitzkin**says that presence—which he defines as a deep, focused calm—is essential for the mastery of any skill**. In competition, presence takes on a sharp, knife’s-edge quality—like the swordsman standing relaxed, yet intensely focused, when facing his opponent.

**Presence, Waitzkin argues, underpins everything**. The more present you are every day in every circumstance, the richer your life will become. Since presence features throughout _The Art of Learning_ , we’ll first explore what presence means to Waitzkin.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin’s emphasis on presence evokes Eckhart Tolle’s perspective in The Power of Now, where Tolle argues that living intensely “in the here and now” is the only path to true fulfillment. While the two approach life differently—Waitzkin with an intense, single-minded focus on learning and growth and Tolle with an emphasis on healing, joy, and spiritual enlightenment—presence seems to uplift and aid both of them. This suggests that presence is a flexible tool for each individual to find and explore their own path toward fulfillment.)

Waitzkin gives **two key reasons presence is important** in life and competition:

#### Reason #1: Presence Equips You to Navigate the Turbulence of Life

The world is unpredictable. Distractions and discomfort, Waitzkin says, often crop up without warning. If you want to be great at anything, you have to learn to navigate these obstacles.

**Presence—a calm, focused mind—helps you handle tension, whether it’s physical, mental, or emotional**. Though Waitzkin doesn’t explain specifically how, he suggests that presence is a key tool for focusing in distracting environments and overcoming emotional discomfort.

For example, in soccer, a dishonest competitor might illegally trip you. It’s reasonable to get angry at such behavior, but that doesn’t help you perform. Instead, use presence to recenter and get back on track.

(Shortform note: It’s helpful to think of Waitzkin’s notion of “presence” as _mindfulness_. Recent research supports his claim that presence is a key tool for emotional regulation. In short, practicing mindful presence develops your capacity for emotional nonreactivity—the capacity to experience your emotions without allowing them to dictate your behavior—by teaching you to find space between a stimulus and your reaction to it. This greater “cognitive flexibility” is useful in competition, as Waitzkin says, and throughout life.)

#### Reason #2: Presence Is the Key to Competitive Success

**Being** **present helps you remain focused on the growth process and regain perspective when you lose**. For example, Waitzkin recounts an early loss in his chess career that knocked him off balance. By separating himself from the game and being present within his life, he was able to return refreshed and reinspired.

At a high level, a competitor’s level of presence greatly affects their success. The margins are so slim at the top that deeper presence is a significant advantage—namely, because it helps you reach a flow state, or “the zone.” If you can reach the zone under competitive pressure and your opponent can’t, Waitzkin says, you’re going to win.

**Competitive success at any level requires that you regulate your emotions and show up fully. Both of these depend on presence** , which helps you calm emotional turbulence as well as reach and maintain focus. Waitzkin says when he lost presence in competition, opponents took advantage of his turbulent emotions and lack of focus.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness plays a huge role in modern athletic training. Athletes like Derek Jeter, Kobe Bryant, and tennis champ Bianca Andreescu (who defeated Serena Williams) all cite presence as key to their success. Amy Saltzmann, a mindfulness coach who works with athletes, suggests that mindfulness training could even help amateur athletes to climb the ranks faster: Since mindfulness hasn’t fully permeated professional athletics, those who start practicing it while young can gain a mental and emotional advantage over their competition.)

### Theme #2: Growth Comes From Trial and Error

Having discussed presence, we’ll now look at Waitzkin’s second key theme. **Learning, he explains, happens through trial and error**. You take one step at a time, sometimes succeeding, but often slipping up. When you make a mistake, you have an opportunity to grow.

For example, imagine you try to play a chord on a guitar. It doesn’t sound quite right, so you adjust your fingers and try again. Each time you do it incorrectly, the feedback tells you how to correct your form. Eventually, you’ll find the correct finger placement.

(Shortform note: In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed argues that error is inherent in learning. Mistakes reveal the flaws in our skills and show us where to grow. As Syed shows, incremental growth is profoundly powerful: It’s the mechanism that drives both evolution and the scientific method. He argues that organisms and ecosystems evolve by undergoing continuous stress tests (storms, drought, predation, and so on) that select for the fittest creatures. Scientists also follow this method, positing theories, testing them, and adjusting them based on feedback. So while “learn from your mistakes” might sound like a platitude, it’s profoundly useful.)

**Each time you perform this trial and error cycle—act, err, adjust, repeat—you make an incremental improvement**. In Waitzkin's view, to learn is to build increment on increment on increment. Each addition builds your knowledge—in other words, the peak of success lies atop a mountain of mistakes.

This approach requires presence, which helps you grow through failure with patience, focus, and resilience. Presence helps you accept and act from the here and now. When you meet obstacles, a calm, focused state of being helps you face them head-on, accept internal and external turbulence, recover from falls, and stay oriented to your growth process.

> **How to Learn From Your Mistakes**
> 
> In _Black Box Thinking_ , Syed gives a step-by-step process for how to learn from errors. The key is to set up a tight feedback loop between the steps you take and the lessons you learn:
> 
>   * **Take action using your current knowledge**. Start practicing that habit you’ve been thinking about (for example, beginning a 30-minute morning cardio session).
> 
>   * **Observe how things go and gather data**. You might keep a simple log in which to reflect daily on how you feel after your workout.
> 
>   * **Note any mistakes and analyze what went wrong**. Maybe you missed a day, and you notice it was because you were tired from staying up too late.
> 
>   * **Use that data to make a simple, actionable change**. Incorporate the feedback into your next action. In the above situation, you might adjust by turning your phone off at 9 p.m. to avoid late-night use.
> 
> 

> 
> Each time you perform this cycle, you learn about what works and what doesn't, and can adjust your efforts accordingly. The following are examples of this method applied to various skills:
> 
>   * **Language learning:** Practice pronouncing a foreign word until you’ve got it just right, adjusting your pronunciation according to each mistake.
> 
>   * **Snowboarding:** Practice balancing on flat ground, adjusting your stance until you can stay steady and calm.
> 
>   * **Writing:** Practice articulating ideas one phrase at a time, adjusting your phrasing and word usage until you’ve got it just right. Or, get feedback by sharing your writing and adjust according to what works and what doesn’t.
> 
> 


#### Focus On the Process

**To improve through trial and error, you need to have a growth mindset**. Waitzkin explores Carol Dweck’s research on “incremental” versus “entity” theories of intelligence. In _Mindset_ (Dweck’s book on the topic) she refers to these as “growth” and “fixed” mindsets.__ Here, we’ll examine Waitzkin’s interpretation of the two mindsets as they relate to skill building and competition.

**With a growth mindset, you believe that you can develop your abilities through patient practice** , building increment upon increment, and you see challenges as opportunities to stretch your current capacities.

(Shortform note: Angela Duckworth's notion of _Grit_ is closely related to a growth mindset. Duckworth argues that grit—a personality trait combining hard work, resilience, and perseverance—predicts success better than talent or luck, because those who drop out when the going gets tough won't make it to the top even if they’re naturally talented. It’s worth noting that in addition to advocating for a growth mindset, Waitzkin himself possessed natural talent as a 6-year _-_ old chess prodigy and skilled meta-learner. So while effort matters, innate ability still plays a role in success.)

Waitzkin argues that **a growth mindset corresponds to focusing on the _process_. It's about the overarching experience of learning**, not any single point throughout it. Short-term goals test your progress, but they aren’t the ultimate point.

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth offers six steps for navigating the growth process that are similar to Matthew Syed’s steps. In short, Duckworth instructs us to: 1) Set a stretch goal—something just beyond your current abilities. 2) Work toward that goal with deep focus, practicing daily. 3) Gather feedback, focusing on what you did _wrong_ rather than what you did _right_. 4) Reflect on the feedback and adjust your efforts accordingly. 5) Continue to work toward your stretch goal. Once you reach that goal, step 6) is to set a new one, continuing the process of growth. The fact that Duckworth’s and Syed’s methods overlap so closely speaks to the efficacy of a trial-and-error growth process, which Waitzkin also recommends.)

In contrast, **people with a fixed mindset believe that ability is inherent and set in stone.** Waitzkin warns that**** a fixed mindset is dangerous because it doesn’t prepare you for obstacles. Instead, people with fixed mindsets tend to give up when confronted with challenges that surpass their current abilities.

For example, a teenage football player with a fixed mindset will start to crack when he reaches the limits of his natural talent. When he can no longer win by talent alone, he’ll fall behind those who learn from their weaknesses.

A fixed mindset focuses on outcomes over process, Waitzkin says. So**competitors with a fixed mindset worry about whether or not they’ll succeed, rather than focusing on what they can learn**. When you inevitably face adversity, a fixed mindset gives you nothing to fall back on—your whole identity is built around winning, so you’ll collapse emotionally when you lose. This hampers growth, because growth comes from struggling at your limits.

(Shortform note: Fixed mindsets aren’t necessarily fixed. In fact, one argument suggests that you can choose your mindset based on the given situation. Furthermore, in some instances, a fixed mindset is preferable. For example, assuming a fixed mindset is effective when you need to quickly complete a task, especially if it’s for the benefit of a group in a collaborative situation. In other cases, such as when you’re working on a solo project, you can switch to a growth mindset and focus on developing and improving your own skills.)

##### Commit to Long-Term Effort

Because fixating on results makes you fragile, Waitzkin argues, **winning is ultimately a weak incentive. It isn’t a reliable motivation, because you’ll inevitably lose at some point—becoming excellent requires it.**

Waitzkin gives the example of a young chess player who was the best at his school. But at a chess conference, this boy refused to play against Waitzkin or anyone that he knew was better than him. According to Dweck’s mindset theory, this preserves the identity he’d built around being the local best by avoiding failure—and it exemplifies the fragility of fixating on results.

(Shortform note: A 2017 study of elite golfers on the PGA tour found that nonmonetary incentives—namely, glory—correlate with poorer performance. The study followed top US golfers as they competed to earn a spot on the US Ryder Cup team, and it found that this high-stakes environment placed substantial pressure on the golfers, causing them to choke in critical moments. Though this research is still young, it supports Waitzkin’s assertion that worrying too much about results is a fragile motivation.)

Rather than focusing on a desired outcome, Waitzkin recommends **committing to the process of growth—to daily practice, focused patience, and adaptation in the face of obstacles**. According to Waitzkin, this approach keeps you resilient, because you embrace failure as part of the journey instead of fearing it.

For example, he details how he lost repeatedly against the chess hustlers who set up in NYC parks, but took every loss as a learning experience. As the losses, thus lessons, accumulated, he improved his skills.

(Shortform note: It’s worth noting that you don’t need to _immediately_ learn from your failure, and it’s okay to feel strong emotions after a heartbreaking loss. Waitzkin acknowledges this by detailing how after losing an important youth tournament, he needed a few weeks away from the game to clear his mind and reset. You also don’t need to be a growth robot: Leaning on family and friends can help you process your emotions and get back on your feet. In this way, close community is a valuable extension of your own mindset.)

#### Balance the Process and Results

Results aren’t everything, but Waitzkin argues that they’re useful if you subordinate them to your growth process. In other words, **set short-term goals** , like medaling in an important competition, **but think of them as tests—not the ultimate measure of your worth.**

**Testing yourself with short-term goals keeps you aware of your progress**. Waitzkin explains that when you fail, that tells you that you need to work harder; and when you succeed, you can feel good about how far you’ve come.

For example, say you’re learning to speak Cantonese, and your goal is to chat with the cart pushers at your favorite dim sum spot. If you fall short the first time, that tells you to train harder. If you succeed, celebrate that win—then reorient to your process, and keep on training.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that feeling like you’re making progress is one key to developing a positive, productive relationship with difficult creative work. Managers can help workers recognize improvement by setting small, achievable goals, and celebrating successful steps toward the larger goal. In taking these actions, management can help workers create healthy inner work lives—staying motivated, focused, and feeling good about the work they’re doing.)

**You need to win often enough to develop competitive confidence and lose often enough to avoid becoming overconfident**. Overconfidence, Waitzkin says, causes arrogance, and arrogance makes you prone to mistakes. You forget that you’re fallible, and eventually someone will exploit that weakness and knock you down.

Waitzkin recommends that you regularly put yourself on the line in order to understand the stakes of competition and develop balanced confidence. At the same time, seek to learn whether you win or lose, treating each goal as a leg of your overarching journey.

(Shortform note: In _Skin in the Game_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains that “skin in the game” means having a personal stake in the outcome of some effort or enterprise, so that if it fails, you lose something tangible. Waitzkin had skin in the game when he went to the 2002 Push Hands championship—countless hours of training, plus his own physical well-being. Skin in the game matters because we learn better from painful experiences than easy ones. If there’s an easy way out, the lesson doesn’t sink in as deeply. Waitzkin lost that 2002 championship, but took home a visceral understanding of what it would take to become the best in the form of a shoulder injury. Just two years later, he came out on top.)

### Theme #3: Growth Requires Balancing Tensions

**Waitzkin holds that learning is a process of balancing tensions**. There are no clean, sharp lines that indicate what to do, where to stop, and so on. Rather, growth is a gray area that requires you to navigate fuzzy, nebulous experiences. For example, your body gives no obvious indication of when you’ve reached your mental limits, so you have to learn to sense when that edge is near.

#### Tension #1: Exertion and Relaxation

Properly managing how you stretch your limits, and how you recover, is one key to sustainable growth. **Stretch far enough that you’ll expand your limit, but not so far that you hurt yourself mentally or physically.**

For example, you have to learn your muscular limits when exercising. You can easily push too far, or not far enough—the key is to find an “optimal tension” somewhere in the middle, and maintain it as best as you can.

(Shortform note: In yoga, the balance of tension and relaxation centers around your “edge”—a point in the posture that offers just the right balance of challenge and ease. We can extend this notion of a “growth edge” to many areas of life. For example, you might find that in the workplace, you have an emotional edge around speaking up in big meetings, and can stretch into it just a bit at a time in order to grow. Or in language learning, your edge might be conversation that’s just a bit more complex than you can yet understand—an opportunity to stretch your mind toward new linguistic capacities.)

**On the micro-level** , effective **cycling of effort and rest is key** to building muscles and minds. Think of burnout—if you work nonstop, you’ll eventually crash, so it’s essential to rest at intervals in your workflow.

**On the macro-level** , Waitzkin argues that **all competitors go through periods of toughness and periods of softness**. Being present to those periods helps you maintain self-compassion and grow at a healthy pace. For example, athletes need both the off-season and a regular competitive schedule to stay fit and healthy.

(Shortform note: Modern athletic programs consider rest and recovery essential to effective training. Michigan State University notes that both short-term recovery (like cooling down after practice) and long-term recovery (like the off-season) play a role in maintaining athletic well-being. Related to this, Waitzkin draws on the _Tao Te Ching_ to suggest that exertion and relaxation are yin and yang: mutually essential, each implied in the other.)

#### Tension #2: Process and Results

As we explained in Theme #2: Growth Comes From Trial and Error, you need a long-term, process-oriented mindset to grow effectively. At the same time, Waitzkin says to **use results to understand how you measure up, while remembering that where you stand isn’t the whole point**. Finding enjoyment in the process itself is a more sustainable focus.

For example, applying for your dream job will tell you whether you’re competitive. But what you do with the result—whether you get it or not—determines whether you’ll grow or regress.

(Shortform note: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs suggests that the opportunity to build your life around a personal growth journey, like Waitzkin did, means that you have your basic needs covered. From his anecdotes, Waitzkin appears relatively privileged, with his material needs taken care of, a loving and supportive family, plenty of friends, tropical vacations for relaxation, and so on. This enabled him to focus on self-actualization, the highest level of Maslow’s hierarchy. So while hard work did play a role in his success, Waitzkin also fits Malcolm Gladwell’s definition of an “outlier”: Multiple favorable circumstances, like the above, enabled his efforts to work out as they did.)

#### Tension #3: The Technical and the Creative

**Skills have two aspects, according to Waitzkin: the practical, technique-focused side, and the creative, emotional side.** Becoming excellent requires that you develop both of these, attaining a solid technical foundation without letting technique override your passion for the skill.

For example, many independent filmmakers commit to expensive projects fueled by their passion for the medium. But you can’t just point a camera and yell “action;” you need to actually know what you’re doing. At the same time, don’t let prescriptive training methods—which tend to mold everyone to a single style—dampen your unique artistic spirit.

(Shortform note: The history of jazz education provides an interesting counterpoint to Waitzkin’s argument. Many jazz musicians learned simply by listening to recordings and trying to figure out how to play what they heard, without formal technical instruction. Considering that Waitzkin wrote _The Art of Learning_ as a reflection on his life, it might be that he didn’t consciously develop his personal style when he was only 6 years old. Maybe he learned more like a jazz musician—picking things up through observation and intuition, as opposed to a systematic effort to develop his creative side.)
