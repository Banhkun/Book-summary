## Chapter 7: Win High-Level Competitions

So far in Waitzkin’s advanced strategies, we’ve looked at how to systematize your states to prepare for competition. In Chapter 7, we’ll explain how to win when the margins are incredibly slim. To do so, you have to operate on a deeper, more subtle level than your opponents.

First, we’ll look at how to achieve enhanced perception through deep refinement of your skill. From there, we’ll discuss how to win the mental game (and why it’s so important), and how to use your personal style to create techniques that elevate you above the competition.

### Develop Enhanced Perception

At a high level of mastery, Waitzkin says, **you can achieve enhanced perception in high performance states**. This comes from refining your skills until they flow seamlessly, intuitively, and effortlessly. Once you’ve reached technical mastery, the brain processes more information with less effort.

He explains that, subjectively, this feels like enhanced perception: You've grown so sensitive to the minutiae of the techniques that time seems to slow down. Punches seem to come in slow motion, because you’re intimately aware of every subtle movement—the shift of weight that telegraphs it, the opponent’s breath in to prepare, the shifting forward of his shoulder, and so on.

(Shortform note: While many of us haven’t experienced high-level perceptual enhancement, we do have an everyday experience that’s something like it: driving. When we first learned to drive, we had to work much harder to process everything. Now it’s automatic, and many of us drive without much conscious effort—what was once a rapid barrage of sensory input becomes a slower, manageable experience.)

#### Two Ingredients for Enhanced Perception

How do you consistently "slow down time" and perform at such a high level? There are two ingredients.

##### Ingredient #1: Relaxed, Focused Presence

**The first ingredient** **is a relaxed, focused presence that allows the unconscious mind to navigate your network of techniques and deploy them without conscious thought**. Waitzkin argues that performing from instinct requires balancing conscious presence with unconscious, intuitive action.

When you’re building your network of chunks (as we explained in Chapter 2), you’ll eventually reach a point where the layers of principles and patterns become too complex to consciously navigate. For example, think of spoken language. There are simply too many things to consciously consider—word choice, grammatical patterns, tone of voice, meaning and subtext—and everything changes depending on the context (you’ll speak differently to your grandma than to your friends, or to strangers).

So, Waitzkin says, you have to rely on your _unconscious_ mind to make sense of the information, and to effectively act. With language again, we’d struggle if we had to consciously consider every principle that governed every sentence we spoke. But we don’t—we all speak from deeply instilled linguistic intuition.

(Shortform note: While much of the information about the complex, contextual relationships between the elements of a skill is implicit, Nora Bateson of the International Bateson Institute has attempted to name the conundrum with her concept of warm data _._ Warm data refers to that messy, ever-changing information that depends on context. In chess, any position involves layers upon layers of context-specific information: how the pieces could and should move given the opponent’s pieces; which principles may apply, and which may not; and how the situation could evolve from its present form. Bateson’s mission is to figure out how to generate and study this fuzzy, intangible data.)

**To navigate by intuition in high-pressure situations, Waitzkin says you need to relax your conscious mind** and allow the mental chatter to recede. This state allows your conscious and unconscious minds to work in tandem. He describes it as follows:

  * First, you consciously direct your attention to the problem. 
  * Then your unconscious takes it in, processes it, and offers up creative solutions to the problem.
  * Then you consciously evaluate those solutions and hash out practical details.



Say you're writing, and you need to articulate a complex idea. Instead of trying to consciously work it out, you simply relax, wait, and let your intuition surface the right words. Then you consciously handle the practical details, like typing it out, adjusting punctuation and phrasing, and so on.

(Shortform note: In _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , Daniel Kahneman casts light on Waitzkin’s ideas about the conscious and unconscious. Roughly, Kahneman’s System 1 mode of thinking corresponds to Waitzkin’s notions of the creative unconscious; System 2 corresponds to conscious deliberation. System 1 operates on heuristics: Making quick, intuitive judgments based on limited information. It can often err—intuition isn’t infallible. But if you’ve developed it through committed practice, intuition is likely better than System 2 in high-stakes competition, because you can’t stop to calculate your next move when a fist is flying toward your face.)

##### Ingredient #2: Deeply Refined Skills

**The second ingredient** **is a deeply refined repertoire of skills, grounded in fundamentals and developed according to your personal style**. As we explained in Chapter 2, building up a network of interwoven chunks yields an instinctive grasp of the skill.

(Shortform note: We all have one such repertoire: Our language skills, which comprise a deep, complex network of words, grammatical patterns, semantics and pragmatics, and so on. Each of us has personal language skills, called our idiolect. Your idiolect is the specific set of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation that’s particular to you. In a sense, we could say that you develop an “idiolect” for non-linguistic skills, too, whether it’s piano, gymnastics, skiing, or whatever else. In other words, you could model your skill as a layered, cascading network of patterns that go from simple to complex.)

**When you have a deeply refined network of chunks for some skill, your unconscious mind does most of the processing**. Those circuits fire automatically, and that frees up your conscious mind for navigating the present situation (like managing unexpected changes, unfamiliar tactics, or acting on your own creative ideas).

Because of this efficient back-end processing, you consciously experience things in more detail with less effort. Think of a video slowed down to one frame per second—that’s a decent approximation of the experience as Waitzkin describes it.

(Shortform note: Jason Haaheim, timpanist of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, argues that deep practice leads to enhanced perception in music. He says that through thousands of hours of practice, musicians develop the ability to perceive more information than laypeople hearing the same music. Due to this ability, he’s able to judge whether an audition tape is up to standard within the first few bars. He perceives a flood of subtle information about the musicians’ skill, ranging from rhythm, timing, intonation, and smoothness. Similar to how Waitzkin _sees_ more with less effort in tai chi, Haaheim _hears_ more with less effort in music.)

So in a wrestling match, for example, you would perceive all your opponent’s subtle motions in great detail. When they start to lunge you’d notice the tiniest initial telegraph: How they shift their weight, the movement of their eyes, an inhalation that telegraphs the attack. To the untrained eye this is indecipherable, but a master reads their opponent as effortlessly as you read this text.

According to Waitzkin, the ability to operate on this level of deep, subtle perception is essential to becoming a strong competitor. **If your opponent perceives the fight more efficiently than you, they’ll be able to exploit your lesser awareness and send you packing.**

(Shortform note: In _The Book of Five Rings_ ,__ legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi distinguishes between sight and perception. In short, to _see_ is to merely notice without separating important details from unimportant ones. In contrast, to _perceive_ is to keep your gaze broad yet focused, picking out the most salient details of a situation—telling movements of the opponent’s sword, important details of the landscape, changes in his “spirit” or energy, and so on. This reflects Waitzkin’s descriptions of enhanced perception, where he explains how he’s able to perceive and adjust to microscopic nuances in the heat of competition.)

### Control the Mental Arena

Aside from developing enhanced perception, another key high-level strategy is to control the mental battle—keen perception is no use if you’re easy to manipulate. Waitzkin explains that everyone near the top has technical mastery, so **at the highest level, competition takes place on the psychological battlefield**. To win, you have to learn how to read your opponent and exploit the chinks in their mental armor. This is especially true when you’re evenly matched in technique.

(Shortform note: Snowboarding culture provides a counterpoint to Waitzkin’s perspective. While chess and martial arts are cutthroat arenas, snowboarding culture is more laid back and encourages riders to enjoy themselves. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, both male and female competitors showed camaraderie in cheering each other on, celebrating great runs, and supporting the medal winners, even when they didn't win. Waitzkin, in contrast, has an intensity characteristic of the vicious scholastic chess scene, which fueled his strategic, pragmatic approach to excellence.)

#### Learn to Read and Not Be Read

**We all have “tells,”—unconscious habits that give away how we’re feeling or indicate what we’re going to do.** Waitzkin emphasizes the importance of “reading” the tells of your opponents.

You can study tells by paying attention to your competitors in and out of competition:

  * In competition, look for things such as their breathing patterns, blinks that precede movement, and whether they get emotional mid-competition. 
  * Outside of competition, Waitzkin suggests that many competitors obliviously reveal aspects of their psychology—for example, you might notice that a rival of yours gets impatient over lunch between matches or frustrated with hotel accommodations. 



(Shortform note: In poker, you can study your opponent at the table and elsewhere. At a live table, pay attention to opponents’ eyes, how they handle their chips and react to their cards, and whether they sound nervous in casual table talk. Outside of the game, Waitzkin’s tips hold true—paying attention to how they eat, how they converse, and how they conduct themselves can reveal psychological traits that you can exploit in the game. For example, you might find that they’re often overconfident at social events, and that translates to recklessness at the poker table.)

Waitzkin doesn’t say explicitly how to train this observational ability, but we can infer that it takes repeated practice. Whether you’re studying tai chi, chess, poker, Go, or whatever else, **getting a dedicated practice partner helps familiarize you with common tells and twitches** that may give away your opponent’s mind state.

Observing your opponents tells is a great way to prepare for competition. Understanding who your opponents are emotionally helps you exploit their specific weaknesses.

(Shortform note: While it may seem like studying your opponent’s psychology outside of the arena is ruthless, such gamesmanship is not typically against the rules. It stretches them, highlighting the fact that you need to push the limits to become the best. This level of intensity prioritizes winning, rather than enjoyment, which might contradict Waitzkin’s earlier recommendation to focus on the process. On the other hand, he might view it as an extension of the process—assuming part of your process is to become the best in the world. It really depends on how far we each want to take our skills.)

While it’s great to read your opponents, **it’s crucial to mask your own state of mind**. If you’re easy to read, your opponents will exploit _your_ weaknesses. Waitzkin doesn’t prescribe specific steps, but he does describe the strategy he used: He would mix false emotion with genuine emotion.

By oscillating unpredictably between expressiveness and an impenetrable poker face, he’d confuse his opponents about how he actually felt. Then when he expressed sincere emotion, his opponents wouldn’t know whether or not it was genuine.

(Shortform note: For a familiar example of reading, think of the classic “poker face.” It’s the characteristic anti-reading technique. It’s crucial for concealing your emotions, psyching out your opponents, projecting an illusion of confidence, and so on. Unlike Waitzkin in chess, it’s unusual to express too much personality in a live poker game, since savvy opponents can easily catch on to unsophisticated tricks.)

#### Get Inside Your Opponent’s Head

Once you can read and not be read, the next step is to get inside your opponent’s head. According to Waitzkin, this means controlling their intentions by conditioning them to react in certain ways. This combines subtle psychological manipulation with technical virtuosity.

**To get inside your opponent’s head, repeat a certain move until your opponent expects it, and then exploit their reaction to that expectation**. In soccer, for example, you could shoot toward the lower-left corner until the goalie expects that, then shoot high and right while they dive in the opposite direction.

(Shortform note: Mind games may not apply to all disciplines. Many skills, like musicianship, painting, dance, and rock climbing, aren’t competitive in the same way as martial arts or chess. While mastery of technique __ matters to any discipline, it would be a stretch to say that musicians or painters should condition their “opponents.” However, a band still might _read_ the mood of their audience, and tailor the performance to the crowd’s needs. In this sense, Waitzkin’s principles may still be of use for skills that are service- or performance-oriented, rather than competition-oriented.)

Let’s look at the steps Waitzkin describes:

  1. **Start by probing your opponent**. Use noncommittal moves to identify how they’ll react—whether they'll aggress, stay neutral, or fall back. For example, a fencer might do a couple of safe, simple advances to feel out her opponent.
  2. Once you’ve learned how they'll respond, **pick a small gesture and repeat it a few times**. With each repetition, you’re teaching your opponent to expect that gesture. The fencer above might throw three or four safe, high thrusts in a row, teaching her opponent to react with a high deflection.
  3. Finally, **act as if you’re going to repeat that gesture, and then exploit your opponent's reaction**. Instead of thrusting high once more, the fencer would hint at the beginning of that move, but then strike elsewhere. Done correctly, Waitzkin says, this should catch your opponent by surprise and result in a score for you.



(Shortform note: Conditioning plays a role in many other martial arts, from MMA to BJJ; even in fighting video games. Just as Waitzkin describes, competitors condition their opponents by performing the same move a few times in sequence. Done well, this trains the opponent to react in a predictable way—allowing the superior player to exploit their behavior. This is a form of Pavlovian conditioning: You offer a stimulus a few times, and figure out how they’ll respond. Then, you teach the opponent that the stimulus means that they can respond to you in a particular way. Finally, you take advantage after they perform as you’ve “trained” them to.)

Waitzkin cautions that many high-level competitors are aware of this strategy. That’s why it’s crucial to have deeply refined technique: As we discussed in the previous section, technical refinement enables enhanced perception. **If you can perceive your opponent more efficiently than they perceive you, you can play mind games beneath their awareness** , operating on a fractionally more subtle level that enables you to prevail.

For example, a poker player who’s learned to control his subtlest facial expressions can easily confuse players and bait them into folding, or continuing to play—whichever the superior player wants.

But **if opponents are evenly matched in the psychological arena, Waitzkin explains that the game becomes a test of minds and wills**. You can read all their tells and habits, and they can read yours. The battle will continue until one finally catches the other off-guard.

(Shortform note: This upward spiral of competency, where each opponent provokes the other to learn and grow, demonstrates a _virtuous cycle_ : a feedback loop where each agent positively benefits the others. So while having a ferocious rival may feel like an obstacle to your success on the surface, they’re in fact a huge part of what drives your growth. The heights of any discipline grow through competition; without that back-and-forth, the skill would stagnate.)

### Systematize Your Personal Style

As we explained in the previous section, everyone near the top of a discipline has achieved technical mastery. Because of this, Waitzkin says, **true champions triumph by making use of their unique creativity**.

**Your creativity is a unique asset** —just like every musician makes their own music, **you’ll express your skill in a way unique to you.** Think of great Olympians, like the American skier Lindsey Vonn or the Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt—they each compete like nobody else does.

To make optimal use of your personal style, Waitzkin argues that you can systematize it, harnessing one-off creative moments to develop a repertoire of skills that are unique to you. Experimenting in practice can lead to such insights—for example, you might come up with a new basketball dribbling rhythm that better enables you to dodge past defenders.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin’s perspective makes sense of why some musicians succeed and others don’t. In hip-hop, those at the top have distinct, one-of-a-kind styles. Kanye West, for example, composes and produces music that’s in a class of its own; Kendrick Lamar brings an intensity and lyricism that no one can imitate; and so on. Yet hip-hop has no formal training centers. We can wonder, then, if Waitzkin’s personal way of systematizing excellence would be useful in other disciplines, or if it might encroach on individuals’ unique approaches to learning.)

**As you develop your personal techniques, you render yourself ever more competitive**. Opponents won’t have any experience with your repertoire, giving you an edge in the critical moments.

(Shortform note: In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed discusses how the Mercedes F1 racing team developed a unique set of tactics and techniques that no other team had. They did so by incrementally developing their process, finding points of weakness, and figuring out how to improve them. For example, they optimized their pit stop routine until they could complete it in less than two seconds. F1 racing is far from Waitzkin’s single player, one-versus-one skills, demonstrating that his principles apply even more broadly than he explains.)

#### Turn Creative Insights Into New Techniques

Waitzkin explains that **when neither you nor your opponent can win with technique alone, victory depends on flashes of creative action**. In other words, you intuitively sense an opportunity and act on it in a new way. You might, for example, intuit a new tennis strike that gives you a fractional advantage, off-balancing your opponent just enough to eke out the point.

**To systematize** these insights into **your unique creative style** , Waitzkin suggests **building off the top of your “pyramid” of understanding**. This is similar to building your chunks, as we explained in Chapter 2. Here’s how his method works:

  * Remember the earlier notion of building up layers of chunks. This is the technical foundation for your skill: knowledge of the elements and how they relate.
  * As you develop your skill, you build layers of understanding, each atop the previous. Atop the fundamentals you layer intermediate principles and patterns; atop those you layer ever more complex rules and exceptions to the rules.
  * After you’ve reached a high level of skill, you don’t need to keep studying established methods. **Because you deeply understand the elements and principles of your skill, you’ll naturally make creative leaps as you practice**. When you do, you gain a glimpse of the next layer up—a layer of skill that you can only reach by developing your personal style.
  * To systematize these creative insights, find some way to record your practice—Waitzkin recommends recording your practice sessions. Then, review the videos to study what happened. You can take what arose as instinct and work out its technical underpinnings.



Now you've converted a creative insight into a concrete technique, rendering it practicable. **Repeat this enough, following your creative disposition, and you'll develop a repertoire of one-of-a-kind tactics that align with your personal style**.

(Shortform note: In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed quotes Steve Jobs, who said that “creativity is connecting things.” Though Waitzkin suggests that creative insights come from instinct, we can use Jobs’s interpretation to consciously create new techniques. For example, say you’re a snowboarder. You notice that downhill skiers consistently tuck down to gain speed, and you realize you could use that to better retain speed on the halfpipe. Or, maybe you realize that the bulky clothing typical of snowboarders could be swapped out for tight-fitting skier-style clothing, which is more aerodynamic. In this way you can train your creative muscles by actively connecting disparate ideas, instead of just waiting on your intuition to do it for you.)

Waitzkin describes how he developed a new repertoire of tai chi techniques by refining creative intuitions taken from high-level sparring. He and his partner were so evenly matched that only their creative instincts could secure the win. They recorded their matches, codified those insights, and gradually built up a new layer of unique, novel techniques.

(Shortform note: For an example of another world-class performer with a repertoire all his own, just think of Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix was a legendary guitarist of the ‘60s who was known for his virtuosic guitar playing and on-stage theatrics. He’d play guitar solos with his teeth, sling the guitar around his body while performing, use effects pedals to create wild sounds, and set his guitars on fire. While Hendrix didn’t systematize his performance states like Waitzkin does, he still demonstrates that stand-out artistry comes from fearlessly expressing your own creative style.)
