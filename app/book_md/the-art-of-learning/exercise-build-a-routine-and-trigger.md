## Exercise: Build a Routine and Trigger

Consider how you could create a routine to get into “the zone.”

* * *

Identify some activities that activate your peak state. Where, when, or what gets you into “the zone”? For example, you might find that weekend hiking trips put you in a great state of mind.

Having identified an activity that gets you into “the zone,” how could you start to systematize that state? Write out three or four actions you could take prior to the activity that activates your “zone.” For example, you might pack your backpack a certain way, stretch for five minutes, and write a quick journal entry in anticipation of your hike.

Now that you’ve created a routine, how can you put it into action? When, or where, could you practice using the routine to get into your zone? For example, you might commit to two weekend hikes a month, and practice the routine each time.
