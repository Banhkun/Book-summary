## Exercise: Seek Out a Challenge

Practice looking for opportunities to stretch your abilities.

* * *

Describe an area of your life in which you’re currently trying to grow. For example, you may be learning how to learn more effectively.

Think back to Waitzkin’s advice to “invest in loss,” which means to actively seek opportunities to fail so that you’re incentivized to grow faster. **In the area of life that you described above, how could you “invest in loss”?**

For example, you might commit to trying a difficult memory technique, like visualizing a memory palace, in order to struggle with a challenging new skill.

When we neglect to invest in loss, it’s often due to an attachment to our current ways of doing things. **When you think about failing in this area of your life, do you feel any fear or other self-focused emotion that could be preventing you from growing?** For example, you might hesitate to try this very technique because you feel like you already understand it.
