## Part 2: Intermediate Learning Techniques | Chapter 3: Develop Your Personal Style

So far, we’ve explained Waitzkin’s advice for mindset, for studying the fundamentals, and for developing your skill as a network of chunks. In Chapter 3, **we’ll begin our discussion of his intermediate techniques.**

Specifically, we’ll explain **how to develop your personal creative style** , which stems from your unique relationship to your skill; and we’ll explain how to use **_themes of error_** to guide that development.

### Find Your Personal Style

In addition to achieving mastery, **incremental skill building enables your unique style to emerge**. When you intuitively understand the elements of a skill and their interrelationships you can combine them in creative ways.

Waitzkin argues that **we’re each naturally drawn to particular skills**. While he doesn’t directly explain this, we can infer that it’s a deep _feeling_ , not conscious thought, that draws you in. For example, Waitzkin felt an intense resonance with chess from the first time he saw it played.

(Shortform note: While Waitzkin doesn’t explain how to find your personal style, you may already have a sense for it. Consider that you know what kind of music, food, clothing, and friends that you like. Your _taste_ suggests what you’re most drawn to, and it’s a good starting point for finding your style in a particular skill. Taste develops over time as we discover what we’re good at: As we get better at something, we tend to like it more, because we feel good about being able to process it fluently. This could explain why Waitzkin was drawn to chess—from the beginning, he had a natural sense for how the pieces could move.)

**Your personal style is how you instinctively approach the skill**. For example, Waitzkin describes himself as having been a chaotic, rough and tumble kid—and his aggressive, attacking chess style reflected those traits.

According to Waitzkin, **you must honor your personal style if you want to become truly great**. Honoring your personal style means developing your skill according to what most inspires you, so that you come to embody that skill as only you can.

Consider nearly any top performer: jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong; Brazilian footballer Pelé; Olympians like Simone Biles and Serena Williams. Each is known for their characteristic style, demonstrating Waitzkin’s point—that imitators don't rise to the top. Be true to yourself and you'll go much further.

(Shortform note: Personal style is on full display in Olympic ice skating, where athletes compete in customized outfits, with personally selected music, using choreography tailored to their strengths and creative inclinations. In fact, judges score ice skaters on two metrics that parallel Waitzkin’s technique-creativity dichotomy: their technical execution, and their artistry.)

If you fail to honor your personal style, you risk losing your balance. You can dampen your passion by learning your skill in a way that contradicts your natural feel for it. Waitzkin explains how one teacher had him study a slow, constrictive chess style that opposed his inclination toward aggressive, free-form play. This threw him off-balance, because the style didn’t come naturally to him, and he lost touch with his passion for chess.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin also says your mind state must be unblocked to express your creativity through the skill. If you feel fear, doubt, or anxiety about finding your personal style, you may need to process that before it emerges. Often, you can't know where life is leading you, and the key is to experiment, try what feels right, and gradually develop your passion. A fire starts as a spark, and only grows into a blaze with patience.)

#### Balance Technique and Creativity

While developing your personal style is crucial, **Waitzkin stresses the importance of balancing your creative impulses with a strong technical foundation**. As we explained in Chapter 2, _start_ by studying the basic elements and principles of your skill, then follow what most inspires you.

In other words, allow your intuition to guide what you learn. Say you're learning Mandarin, and you've built a solid foundation of vocabulary and grammar. Now study what you're drawn to, whether it's restaurant conversation, business culture, classic literature, or whatever else.

(Shortform note: In _Fluent Forever_ , Gabriel Wyner applies this process to learning a language. In Wyner’s view, the best way to learn a language is to first train in pronunciation, then establish a basic vocabulary. With those fundamentals built, he recommends studying what interests you, because it’ll naturally hold your attention and encourage you onward. In contrast, studying subjects or techniques you aren’t attracted to leads only to boredom and disinterest.)

Waitzkin says that **as you follow what attracts you, your creative style will naturally develop**. In terms of chunks, he describes this as a layered, interwoven network of skills that expands outward from a central heartbeat—your passion for the skill.

If you’re an aspiring rock guitarist, for example, you’ll want to study your favorite songs, riffs, and solos. As you explore and learn what you love, you’ll end up with a repertoire of guitar skills that’s all your own.

(Shortform note: While Waitzkin argues that your personal style is beneficial no matter what, research indicates that some personality traits correspond to athletic success better than others. The study followed 300 Polish athletes and measured their personalities in terms of the Big Five psychological model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). They found that champion-level competitors had lower levels of neuroticism, with higher extraversion and openness. If this effect holds true, then it could be that some personality types are better suited to competitive success than others.)

### Actively Engage With Your Emotions

**To effectively develop your personal style** , Waitzkin explains, **you need to maintain an emotional state that allows for confident, uninhibited self-expression**. If you have any mental or emotional conflicts, you can’t access optimal creative states.

To maintain mental and emotional stability, actively engage with your emotions by “sitting mindfully” with them. In other words, **try to feel your emotions as fully and non-judgmentally as you can** , avoiding the urge to label them “good” or “bad.”

As you do so, you’ll get to know yourself better, thus developing personally and artistically. Waitzkin describes how when fame overwhelmed him, he went to live in rural Europe, where he developed his techniques and his psychology. The relaxed countryside setting helped him grow into a more open, spiritually-engaged competitor and artist.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Daniel Goleman argues that understanding your emotions is crucial to success in life and work. Emotion, he says, precedes rational thought: If we’re emotionally riled up, we can’t think straight, and we’ll act irrationally. This supports Waitzkin’s argument that you need to regulate your emotions if you want to succeed. Goleman recommends viewing your emotions objectively, as opposed to labeling them “good” or “bad.” This makes it easier to process and learn from your emotions whether they're uncomfortable or not, leading to increased self-control and reduced reactivity in stressful situations.)

#### Process Distractions Mindfully

Waitzkin’s main recommendation for maintaining emotional stability is to **be present in the turbulence of your life**. Though he doesn’t say this directly, we can infer that in this instance, “presence” refers to a state of calm, focused _mindfulness_.

Mindfulness helps you handle both internal and external turbulence. As we explained in Chapter 1, it equips you to process discomfort and move beyond it. When faced with distraction, tough emotions, or unexpected chaos, you simply bend and flow like a willow in the wind.

Waitzkin doesn’t directly describe how to do this, but we can infer that it involves **mindfully embracing the turbulence and choosing not to react to it**. Instead, you accept it as part of the experience. For example, many athletes need to focus amidst cheering or jeering crowds, and they can do so by accepting the noise as part of the experience.

(Shortform note: Letting go of what we can’t control is a tenet of Stoicism. As Ryan Holiday explains in _The Obstacle is the Way_ , many aspects of reality are out of our control—the weather, other people’s actions, chance hardships, and so on. Holding an “emotional grudge” against reality is useless, since it tires you out and does nothing to fix the problem. Instead, focus on accepting the unwanted circumstances, regulating your emotions, and moving forward with resilience.)

#### Catch Yourself When You Fall

Waitzkin argues that **mistakes are only problematic when they cause you to spiral out of control**. In competition, this frequently happens when you make a mistake while winning.

A crucial mistake, he says, can cause you to lose touch with what’s actually going on. Because mistakes feel awful, **we’re prone to remaining attached to what we had before the mistake**. This can cause you to act desperately, trying to preserve a situation that no longer exists, leading to further mistakes—like a tumbling house of cards.

(Shortform note: In another example from Olympic ice skating, Chinese skater Zhu Yi demonstrates the tragic effects of a downward spiral. After falling in her short program during the team competition, she visibly faltered and finished with a low score. Despite being among the top 25 women’s ice skaters, her mistakes rattled her and led to further mistakes in her next program, where she fell twice. This was momentum accelerating in the wrong direction, with big consequences.)

Waitzkin explains how in chess, **the winning player often pressures for a greater lead but can make a mistake that negates his advantage**. When this happens, he’ll often lose his cool, which in turn causes him to act incautiously, risking his lead even further. If this spiral continues, the player will lose.

To prevent this collapse, Waitzkin suggests developing a technique that returns you to mindfulness (or “presence”). He offers this rule of thumb: **Refresh your mind by moving your body, and refresh your body by mindfully resting**. Specifically, he suggests splashing your face with cold water, sprinting a short distance, or taking deep breaths.

(Shortform note: Recovering from errors is hugely important in sports psychology. If an athlete is knocked off-balance, their performance will suffer and they won’t be able to play in the zone. The key is to stop dwelling on the mistake by choosing to ask what you can learn from it, and moving on. So, what Waitzkin says is par for the course in sports psychology—though it’s less recognized in disciplines outside of sports, like writing, chess, teaching, and so on.)

### Analyze Your Mistakes

**As you develop your skill, you'll face challenges that are beyond your current abilities.** When you fall short, Waitzkin suggests that you **pay attention to both the _technical_ and the _psychological_ aspects of your mistakes and **use that feedback to improve.

There are two aspects of any weakness, and you need to grow through both:

  * **Technical errors** are mistakes with form: You don’t understand some principle, so you fail to execute the proper techniques. For example, a novice piano player would struggle with complex five-finger chords—she just doesn’t have the technical capacity yet.
  * **Psychological errors** concern your mindset and emotions. Oftentimes, strong negative emotions affect your performance, so you might blunder even though you know the right technique. Think of when professional athletes get frustrated and start to falter—this is an emotional problem, not a technical one.



(Shortform note: In the 2020 Olympics, gymnast Simon Biles experienced psychological difficulties that threw off her technique. Despite wide acclaim as the “GOAT,” or “greatest of all time” in women’s gymnastics, she fell prey to “the twisties,” a phenomenon wherein the gymnast’s mind and body go out of sync. Since gymnasts perform complex, life-risking maneuvers, it’s risky to compete if the twisties come over you; Biles indeed stepped out of the competition. This illustrates how intimately technique and mindset intertwine, and how a steady, self-assured mental stance underpins any successful technical execution.)

**Technical errors often entangle with psychological errors** , Waitzkin argues. With this in mind, Waitzkin suggests **identifying weaknesses by finding connections between your emotional life and your technical mistakes.**

To find where you're slipping up, look at what's presently meaningful in your life. Ask: “What does my mind keep returning to?” After you identify the emotional theme, look at the technical mistake you are struggling with and see if there is a connection. For example, when Waitzkin was struggling with big life changes in the wake of “Searching for Bobby Fischer,” he also struggled to keep up with positional changes on the chess board.

(Shortform note: The emotional aspects of your skills aren’t always “mistakes'' to fix. While Waitzkin was a competitor, plenty of skills are about self-expression instead of winning. Developing as a musician, for example, doesn’t necessitate a constant effort to eliminate your weaknesses. If it were, the variety of music in the world would likely be less diverse. As Waitzkin later says, there’s more than one way to approach any challenge—and while books like _The Art of Learning_ can help, it’s often up to us to create our own paths.)

**By analyzing your mistakes, you’ll learn about principles and patterns that you couldn’t previously see.** First you understand these new chunks mentally, or in words. But with enough study, Waitzkin explains, you reach an _embodied knowing_ that goes beyond that propositional (thought-based) understanding. In other words, you can _feel_ the principle or technique intuitively.

Waitzkin recommends periodically examining your skill set for weaknesses, as above, to keep your technique effective and your psychology robust. Each time you do this, you improve your intuition for that skill.

> **How to Analyze Your Mistakes**
> 
> Waitzkin doesn’t explain _how_ to find the theme of your errors, instead explaining that he spent dozens of hours laboring to understand new chess positions. To analyze your own mistakes, try asking these questions:
> 
>   * What specific technique fell short, and what did your opponent do that surpassed you?
> 
>   * Is there emotional discomfort entangled with your technical error? If so, reflect on where it may be coming from.
> 
>   * What could you have done differently?
> 
> 

> 
> By spending time in reflection, you’ll figure out what you need to do to improve.
