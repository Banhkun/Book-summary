## Part 1 | Chapters 1-2: Three Categories of Choice

Schwartz writes that **the choices we face in our lives have increased over time, and they continue to increase.** They’ve also become more complex, and we often have little guidance or knowledge of how to make smart choices.

Schwartz attributes the expansion of choice to: 1) the incentives of market-based economies to provide as many options as possible for consumers, and 2) in the United States specifically, the nation’s core values of independence and freedom.

Schwartz explores and defines the major categories of choices—consumer choices, complex choices, and personal life choices—and the consequences of expanded choice in each of them:

  * **Consumer choices** are choices about consumer or tangible goods, from potato chips to computers.
  * **Complex choices** involve more complicated decisions about intangibles that have a greater impact on our lives than products. Examples are choosing which college to attend, which health insurance plan to choose, or which cell phone plan to purchase. 
  * **Personal life choices** are broad, long-term choices that don’t explicitly involve purchases, but instead incorporate how we want to experience our lives and present ourselves to the world. These typically involve choices about our personal relationships and our identities (religious, social, and so on). 



Schwartz explains how choices in each of these categories have expanded and become more complex, and how this expansion complicates our lives.

(Shortform note: Schwartz uses two categories instead of three: “shopping” choices that Americans have always made (for example, groceries), and “new” choices that largely stem from the transition from “bundled” economic resources offered by monopolies to a broad array of services that consumers freely choose from (for example, utilities). Schwartz’s categories are rather broad and not totally accurate, categorizing some long-standing choices as “new” and putting services and personal life choices in the same category. The three categories Shortform uses instead are more specific and applicable for readers looking to incorporate Schwartz’s principles into their lives.)

### Consumer Choices

The first category is consumer choices. These are small, routine choices about consumer products. Most people make multiple consumer choices on an average day.

Schwartz contends that these choices have expanded to the point that seemingly simple decisions require a lot of unnecessary thought and energy—for instance, if there are 30 brands of cookies to choose from at a supermarket, you must give more attention to deciding which cookie to buy.

One way to mitigate this stress in consumer choices is to identify the decisions that are worth your time and energy. To do this, **Schwartz distinguishes between “durable” and “nondurable” consumer goods: Durable goods are those that last a long time, like electronics or appliances, and nondurable goods are used quickly, like groceries.**

People typically spend more money, time, and energy to choose among durable goods than nondurable ones, because you’ll use these goods for a long time, the lengthier decision-making process is worth the effort. In contrast, by spending too much time making choices among nondurable goods, we use up energy we should spend on choosing durable goods.

(Shortform note: All durable and nondurable goods are tangible, meaning they’re physical objects you can use. In contrast, services, such as restaurant service or exercise classes, are intangible. Broader life choices, like marriage or religion, can’t accurately be described as either goods _or_ services.)

With durable and nondurable goods in mind, Schwartz lists the different kinds of consumer choices people frequently make.

#### Groceries

Schwartz paints a picture of the vast array of choices a shopper faces at a grocery store. He writes that he counted the number of brands he noticed in a store for various products. The results? Dozens of brands and varieties of just about everything: crackers, juices, chips, suntan lotion, lipstick.

Different brands and varieties, of course, aren’t all that different. One kind of potato chip might be extra salty, one might be low-sodium, and another might have ridges, but they’re all similar products.

**This overwhelming variety often leads shoppers to buy only what they’re familiar with.** Since it would take a long time to compare many products to each other, buying something you’ve purchased before and found satisfactory is the easiest way to go. To support his point, Schwartz cites a statistic indicating that the average shopper doesn’t notice 75% of the products in their supermarket, instead sticking with the products they already buy.

(Shortform note: Schwartz’s assertion that grocery stores carry an overwhelming amount of products is reflected in current data: According to the food industry association FMI, the number of items an average supermarket carries is 31,119. While Schwartz focuses on large supermarkets, bear in mind that there’s a wide array of grocery stores, including small, local markets; farmers markets; dollar stores; wholesale clubs; high-end grocers, and so on. So before deciding what items to buy, you must first choose among a variety of grocery store types.)

It might be overwhelming, but since the items in a grocery store are nondurable goods that don’t last, Schwartz says your decisions don’t matter much in the long term. If you don’t like one brand of cereal, you can get another without much of a problem.

#### Electronics

The process of shopping for electronics in a store is similar to grocery shopping, yet since electronics are durable goods, the stakes are higher. **Electronics are meant to last a long time and accordingly cost more, so Schwartz says that it’s more important to think about your purchase.**

Schwartz found almost as much variety in an electronics store as in the grocery store. Since electronics are durable goods, making a decision will likely be more challenging than choosing groceries. Additionally, most people don’t buy printers or televisions often, so it’s harder to default to a familiar brand.

> Since the publication of _The Paradox of Choice_ in 2004, the durability of many electronic devices has declined. Widely used appliances like cell phones and laptops are no longer built to last; instead, they typically lose their functionality after a couple of years, so consumers are incentivized to purchase new ones. That said, electronics remain more durable than products like groceries and clothing.
> 
> Additionally, the variety of electronic products has grown, with multitudes of laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other gadgets available. As of 2015, for example, over 24,000 styles of Android smartphones were available, a number that has presumably grown since then.

#### Entertainment

Just about anything you could possibly want to watch or listen to is now available with the click of a button. For this reason, Schwartz says that **even choosing entertainment for relaxation can cause indecision and stress.**

Entertainment is generally a durable good. Whether you buy a collection of albums, subscribe to a new streaming service, or purchase a new cable plan, your entertainment choices typically last for a sustained period of time.

(Shortform note: When Schwartz discusses entertainment, he mainly refers to it as a durable good. However, there are many instances where an entertainment-based purchase would be considered nondurable—buying a ticket for a concert or a movie, for example. One could also argue that cable and streaming packages would more accurately be categorized as services than goods, even though the devices needed to access them are typically durable goods. In any case, the proliferation of entertainment options carries with it the difficulties of expanded choice, no matter how we categorize them.)

The number of entertainment options we can enjoy from home increases every day. When Schwartz wrote _The Paradox of Choice_ in 2004, cable television provided viewers with hundreds of channels, and TiVo allowed viewers to record numerous programs to watch whenever they wanted.

(Shortform note: Our options have grown exponentially since then. Cable and TiVo are still available, but subscription streaming services have become increasingly popular. As of 2021, there are over 200 streaming services available for a subscription, from the uber-popular Netflix to niche services like Shudder, a service for devoted horror fans. These streaming services often have hundreds of shows and films to choose from. Combine streaming services with cable, network television, on-demand offerings, and physical media like Blu-rays, and one can easily see how the vast array of entertainment options can be overwhelming.)

Schwartz theorizes that, someday soon, there will be little-to-no water cooler conversation about the latest hit TV show, because no two people will be watching the same shows.

(Shortform note: With the plethora of streaming options now available, Schwartz’s prediction has largely come true. While some television shows, such as _Game of Thrones_ , have generated widespread public discussion, the general entertainment landscape is still more fragmented and individualized than in the past.)

> **Online Shopping and Consumer Choices**
> 
> In the years since _The Paradox of Choice_ was published, online shopping has further increased the number of consumer options and has made it easier to access them, particularly with the rise of Amazon Prime and two-day shipping. Amazon has become by far the most dominant online retailer, and their prioritization of speedy shipping has created new consumer expectations for convenience. As of 2020, there were approximately 200 million Amazon Prime members worldwide, with more than half concentrated in the United States.
> 
> Amazon allows customers to set some purchases to recur automatically, potentially lessening the choices we make. However, despite the new ability to automate some choices, online shopping also has the potential to add to our mental loads. For example, its convenience makes it easier to spend much more time shopping than before the rise of e-commerce. Plus, there are many more choices available online than in brick-and-mortar stores. Ultimately, we can easily get carried away with searching for the best products, comparing items to one another, and reading dozens of reviews.

### Complex Choices

The second category of choices is complex choices. These are choices, relating mainly to intangible services, which have a major impact on one’s health, finances, education, and career. These are more consequential than everyday consumer choices, and **since these choices are complex and often require research, it can be difficult and depleting to make informed decisions.**

#### Utilities

**Schwartz notes that a host of options exists for utilities, such as telephone and electric service.** In the past, utilities like these were owned by monopolies, leaving consumers with little to no choice. For example, people could only purchase their telephone plans from one company, the Bell System.

(Shortform note: Bell was broken up in 1982, since it discouraged free-market competition. For many consumers, Bell had been the only option, and they had to lease phones and buy service from Bell. As a result, new companies and greater choice of utilities followed.)

Regulation has provided consumers with multiple options and incentivized companies to improve services and lower prices to stay competitive. On the other hand, there are many choices for phone and electric services, and it can be difficult to distinguish among companies and make informed choices. For this reason, Schwartz writes that most people stick with the plans they already have, without investigating other options (even if they could be more cost-effective or provide more reliable service).

(Shortform note: With many options and sometimes minimal information, choosing a utilities plan can be challenging, and it may lead to unintended consequences like inadvertently paying more than you did before. For example, deregulation of electric services in some states has led to a proliferation of deceptively expensive plans from power suppliers.)

#### Insurance

Schwartz notes that, while employees had few health insurance options in the past, companies now tend to provide employees with an array of options. If people must buy their own insurance, they have even more choices to make.

**Health insurance is complicated and difficult to understand, and choosing the wrong plan could have significant consequences.** There’s frequent public debate about whether the government should step in and provide health insurance to a greater extent, or continue allowing the free market to dominate the industry.

> **The Challenges of Choosing a Health Insurance Plan**
> 
> Many countries have national health care systems, or use a combination of public and private systems.
> 
> However, choosing a health insurance plan in the United States can be complicated due to the number of options available, each coming with significant trade-offs. Government-subsidized plans, for example, are categorized as Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, each with a different range of coverage. If you select a Bronze plan, your insurance will cover less of your care but your deductible will be low; on the other hand, if you select Platinum, your insurance will cover nearly all of your care, but your deductible will be very high. It could be easy for someone to get overwhelmed and miscalculate—for example, choosing a Bronze plan for the low deductible without considering that they need frequent medical care and will have to pay high rates for their appointments. Because of the complexity of choosing a government-subsidized plan, the government provides Navigators to assist people in the process.
> 
> More choices abound: Choosing a network type affects which health care providers you’ll be able to see and in which areas. You can also choose whether or not to purchase dental insurance. Since these choices have a direct and significant impact on health and finances, the stakes are high, and the chooser is likely to experience stress. Re-enrolling and switching plans is an option every year, taking a bit of the pressure off, but since the decisions involved are complicated, most would not want to go through the process very often.

(Shortform note: While utilities and insurance are important choices that take time and energy to consider, the areas of choice that follow, such as education and retirement, are generally of greater importance. People with the financial means have the opportunity to change their utilities and insurance plans if they are unsatisfied, but the complex choices described below have more long-lasting consequences that may significantly affect the life of the chooser.)

#### Education

One of these vitally important choices is education. Schwartz particularly focuses on choices in higher education.

Colleges and universities in the United States previously had a more or less fixed curriculum for their students. Students generally took the same introductory courses, which gave every student a shared experience of college education.

In recent years,**education has moved to accommodate students’ individual interests and pursuits.** At most colleges and universities, students are able to choose their courses from a catalog of hundreds, with dozens—sometimes hundreds—of majors (and minors) to choose from.

Schwartz compares this educational model to a “shopping mall.” Most schools still have some kind of core curriculum, but even within these boundaries, there tend to be many course options. **While the increase in choices in higher education allows students to follow their own goals and learn about topics they’re interested in, it also means students must make choices that will affect the rest of their lives while still teenagers.**

> The choices college students must make are consequential, and many find that they regret them later on. In a 2017 survey, 36% of college graduates reported regretting their field of study. Given the importance of this decision and the young age at which most students attend college, many may be ill-equipped to make an informed decision from a large selection of majors and minors.
> 
> Many college students also take out substantial loans to finance their education. Again, many graduates regret this decision: One study found that 84% of graduates born between 1982 and 2000 had some level of regret about their student loans. Loans, then, are another decision that those entering college aren’t yet prepared to make.

#### Retirement

While education is a consequential decision many people make in preparation for their careers, planning for your life post-career also involves a variety of choices.

Schwartz notes that **retirement planning has grown more complicated, requiring employees to make many choices about their pension plans.** As with health insurance, employers typically offer employees numerous pension plan options. Plans have largely shifted from “defined benefit,” meaning that a retiree’s pension is directly correlated with their years of service, to “defined contribution,” meaning the pension results from a series of investments made by employee and employer.

Defined contribution plans provide employers and employees with potentially dozens of choices, in both high-risk and low-risk investments. Employees may not have enough prior knowledge to make an informed selection, and since there are so many investment choices available, it’s difficult for employers to provide oversight and guidance.

(Shortform note: While defined benefit plans are now uncommon in comparison to defined contribution plans, some employees may find themselves facing a choice between the two types of plans. This creates yet another high-stakes choice to make for retirement plans, and those who have to choose between defined benefit and defined contribution plans have numerous factors to consider—including which would provide a greater financial benefit and whether they want to choose their investments or stick with a stable plan.)

#### Medical Care

Medical care is another area where choices have proliferated and grown increasingly complex.

In the past, Schwartz writes that doctors generally dictated medical care to the patient. Even if the patient disagreed with the doctor’s advice, the doctor would typically disregard their concerns and proceed with the treatment they thought was best.

Now, rather than being told what is appropriate by medical professionals with little room for disagreement, patients are typically given more autonomy to decide what care they want to receive. This often benefits patients, as they now have more control over the care of their own bodies. However, according to Schwartz, **too much choice in their medical care can overburden patients.** Many people imagine they want total autonomy in their medical decisions, yet there are situations in which having to make one’s own medical decisions can cause stress and hardship.

Schwartz illustrates this point by citing a study on whether cancer patients want to choose what care they receive, conducted by physician Atul Gawande. When Gawande asked one group who did not have cancer to imagine what their preference would be, 65% of this group said they would want to choose their treatment. However, in the group of participants who actually had cancer, only 12% said they would want to choose their own treatment.

(Shortform note: Factors other than simple preference also may complicate patients’ choices about medical care. In the United States, the high cost of care increases the difficulty of making medical decisions. Recent studies found that 22% of Americans had recently skipped medical care because of the cost, and 29% had not taken prescription medicines properly for the same reason (for instance, some rationed pills to save money). Your insurance plan has a significant impact on how much you pay for medical care, which shows how closely insurance decisions and medical decisions are connected.)

#### Jobs

**Numerous advances in technology and work culture allow many people flexibility to choose when, where, and how to work.** However, Schwartz posits that these advances can also require people to make important decisions about work on an ongoing basis, rather than settling into a satisfactory job long term.

Schwartz explains that people now have greater choice over which careers to pursue. In the past, many were unable to further their education, and so were left with a limited pool of careers, often taking jobs that their parents or other family members did.

Since then, social mobility has expanded, and many more middle-class Americans can now attend college. As a result, it is more common to be able to freely choose one’s career or job.

Additionally, remote work provides professionals with the option to work from any location. Also, remote work, plus digital technologies like email, allows us to choose _when_ to work, even if not during regular working hours.

As a result of these changes, Schwartz notes that many people choose to switch jobs many times and to constantly seek new work even while employed.

(Shortform note:**** While it’s a common perception that people switch jobs more than they used to, evidence doesn’t support it, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. In fact, since the 1980s, the number of workers who stay with employers for only a brief time has declined, while the number staying for a long period has increased. This misperception may be due to the fact that men have seen a decrease in extended employment, while women have seen an increase.)

### Personal Life Choices

The third category of choices we regularly make is personal life choices. These include close relationships, spiritual practices, identity, and self-expression.

#### Relationships

Schwartz writes that standards for romantic relationships are less defined than they were in the past. While strict social norms previously led many people to marry, buy property, and have children on an expected timeline, most people now have the freedom to create romantic relationships that work best for them.

(Shortform note: Same-sex marriage and interracial marriage are two types of relationships that have grown significantly in social acceptance following their respective legalizations. Same-sex marriage was legalized federally in 2015, at which point 60% of the public supported it; that support climbed to 70% in 2021. When interracial marriage was legalized federally in 1967, 20% of the public supported it; as of 2021, 94% of the public supports interracial marriage.)

Many people are now able to live happy lives in relationships that would have been more difficult or impossible in the past. However, the number of choices within the relationship (like whether to move in together, whether to marry, and whether to have children) can stress relationships.

> **Expanded Choice in Romantic Relationships**
> 
> Since this book was written, dating apps and websites have expanded the pool of potential partners, although some of these services are more useful than others. In some of the most popular apps, the number of options can be overwhelming—for example, Tinder users swipe through an endless array of photographs, accumulating “matches” along the way.
> 
> A _Nautilus_ article argues that websites such as eHarmony that curate your matches are more effective because they force you to look closely at a few people rather than attempting to decide among dozens. The article quotes Schwartz as pointing out that “with a million options, you’re less likely to persevere” in a relationship.

#### Religion

Most people still inherit their parents’ religious practices, but it is now largely accepted to either change religious affiliations or to practice only the parts of a religion that are meaningful to you.

Schwartz asserts that it benefits many people to be able to choose their religious affiliation or non-affiliation and which aspects of their religion to practice. However, choosing a religion and deciding the extent of one’s observation are challenging decisions that can preoccupy you for years.

(Shortform note: In the United States, switching religions is common: In a 2015 survey, 42% of people said they’d changed their religious affiliation at least once. Disengaging from religion entirely, too, is becoming more common: Between 2007 and 2014, people reporting a lack of religious affiliation increased from 16% to 23%.)

#### Identity

All of us possess multiple identities: race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexuality, and so on.

Schwartz writes that, in the past, your identity was typically associated with your family history—for instance your ethnic, national, or class background. People now have more choice to express which aspects of their identity are important to them. It’s also common to choose which identities to highlight in which contexts (for instance, someone can engage with their queer identity in an L.G.B.T.Q. social group, then engage with their Jewish identity when attending services at their synagogue).

(Shortform note: Legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality in a 1989 paper describing how Black women experience an overlap of gender and racial discrimination; the term is now widely used to describe how your numerous identities—like gender, race, and class—combine to create distinct experiences, advantages, and disadvantages in your life.)

### The Consequences of Expanded Choices

**When faced with numerous choices in each of the three categories, Schwartz argues that we become overwhelmed and depleted.** Besides making us unhappy, this leads us to prioritize our choices poorly, potentially spending time and energy on inconsequential decisions without giving ourselves space to consider more important choices.

Schwartz identifies two ways we make decisions: deliberately and unconsciously. **Deliberate choices are those we actively think about, and unconscious choices are those we make automatically.**

Think about the routines you go through every day—for example, the steps involved in getting ready for work or getting your children ready for school. Even though every step is technically a decision, you do them on autopilot. If you thought deliberately about every decision you made in your morning routine, you’d wear yourself out by the time you got to work.

Our ability to make some choices unconsciously allows us the energy and time to consider the decisions we must make deliberately. However, **the expansion of choice in market democracies presents us with more deliberate choices than we might be able to handle.**

Making so many small decisions lessens our mental capacity to make more important ones. Schwartz cites economist Fred Hirsch, who calls this phenomenon the “tyranny of small decisions”: The cumulative effect of these inconsequential decisions is a heavy mental load that controls us, contradicting the idea that we’re in control when we make constant choices in every aspect of our lives.

Schwartz describes a study called “When Choice is Demotivating” that showed how tiring expanded choice can be. Researchers set up a display of jams, with free samples available. Customers who decided to buy a jar were given a $1-off coupon. One scenario offered six varieties for tasting and another scenario, 24. In the six-samples scenario, 30% bought a jar, but in the 24-sample scenario, only 3% bought one. Since choosing among 24 jams takes much more effort than choosing among six, many people elected to save their energy and not choose at all among the 24 varieties.

When we waste energy on choices (like jam) that should be easy to make, it’s harder to make more important decisions about things like education or marriage. **Schwartz contends that we often don’t recognize this as a problem because of how highly our market democracy values freedom of choice.**

Understanding that we face too many decisions to process, and that many of these decisions don’t have much impact on our lives can help us to prioritize the choices that matter and brush aside the ones that don’t.

> **Can Expanded Choice Have Positive Effects?**
> 
> Some researchers have come to opposite conclusions about the consequences of expanded consumer choice, arguing that instead of overwhelming us, it helps us to clarify what we really want.
> 
> A group of psychologists and economists repeated the jam study numerous times and weren’t able to replicate the results. After conducting 10 similar experiments where subjects were made to choose among either limited or expanded options, the researchers found no correlation between expanded choice and difficulty of decision-making. Instead, they found that offering many choices doesn’t have much of an impact on decision-making either way.
> 
> Another researcher found that when people had only one option, they were less likely to make a decision than when they had multiple options. He concluded that stores shouldn’t limit people’s options. (The research didn’t address the idea that there may be a “sweet spot” at which people feel they have enough options to choose from without being overwhelmed by too many choices.)
> 
> These studies seem to contradict Schwartz’s main findings about the stress expanded choice can cause: If having many choices has either no effect or a positive effect, then it’s not a problem that needs to be fixed. However, Schwartz has responded to these claims by arguing that, while some studies have indicated that expanded choice can have a positive effect, numerous other studies published since _The Paradox of Choice_ have indicated negative effects. He also notes that some stores that have reduced options have seen increased business. So while expanded options might not have a negative impact in some situations, evidence suggests that they can cause negative consequences in others.
