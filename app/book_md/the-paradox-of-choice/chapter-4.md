## Chapter 4: Are You a Maximizer or a Satisficer?

In the previous chapter, Schwartz described two kinds of choosers: deliberators, who think about their decisions, and guessers, who do not.

In this chapter, Schwartz distinguishes between two kinds of deliberators. Both types of deliberators carefully consider their decisions, but in different ways:

  1. **_Maximizers_ accept only the best possible option. **
  2. **_Satisficers_ accept an option that meets their standards.**



Schwartz explores the differences between maximizing and satisficing, the pitfalls of being a maximizer, and why people maximize in the first place.

> **The Theory Behind Satisficing**
> 
> The terms “maximizing” and “satisficing” were coined in 1956 by economist and psychologist Herbert A. Simon in the article “Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment.”
> 
> While the predominant economic theory at the time was that humans are rational actors who will gravitate toward the best possible choice, Simon argued that people are generally incapable of selecting the single best option from a wide range, but are able to choose an acceptable option that will satisfy their needs.
> 
> Thus, Simon didn’t consider maximizing to be possible, a view that Schwartz echoes in arguing that trying to maximize is ultimately fruitless. Simon’s thoughts on making decisions in a society with expanded choice likely would be similar to Schwartz’s: Since people are naturally able to satisfice, but not to maximize, choosing options that are “good enough” instead of “perfect” is the better decision-making strategy.

### Maximizing vs. Satisficing

Maximizing and satisficing both come from a desire to make good decisions, but **Schwartz argues that maximizing causes stress and eats up much more time than satisficing.** If you maximize, you need assurance that every decision you make is the best one you could have made. Maximizers spend a lot of time examining alternative options, even if they have one or more satisfying options, or if the decision is inconsequential. Even though it’s not possible to examine every option, maximizers aspire to consider every option they can.

For example, if a maximizer is choosing a restaurant for dinner, they might spend hours on the decision. They’ll look up every restaurant in the area, read every menu, read all the online reviews, and ask friends for their favorites. Ultimately, they’ll end up wasting time they could’ve spent eating at one of the restaurants they considered.

A satisficer, on the other hand, would consider their options and have high standards, but once they find an option that meets those standards, they’ll likely accept it rather than continuing to explore options.

Schwartz explains that while maximizers might think satisficers are settling for second-best, what satisficers really aspire to is making good decisions without stressing over whether they’re missing out on better options. In the restaurant example, the satisficer will have an enjoyable dinner and will have saved themselves the time it took the maximizer to closely examine every possible option.

Schwartz believes that, **while maximizers think they’re prioritizing their best interests, they’re actually causing themselves unhappiness. Satisficers, on the other hand, make their decisions more effectively.**

> **Are Maximizers Actually Unhappy?**
> 
> Some research on maximizing counters Schwartz’s belief that maximizing and unhappiness are correlated, instead suggesting that there’s no meaningful connection between them.
> 
> Schwartz and other researchers use a metric called the Maximization Scale to determine whether people are maximizers or satisficers. However, a 2008 study contends that this scale is flawed, as it asks respondents questions that may not be directly correlated to maximizing (for example, whether they like to rank movies). The researchers created a narrower scale of measuring maximizing tendencies, and they found that, though maximizers are still more likely to feel regret, they’re just as happy as satisficers.

### How Maximizing Harms Decision-Making

**While maximizers may think they’re making the best decisions for themselves, their preoccupation with having “the best” makes them feel dissatisfied with their choices.**

Schwartz writes that maximizers are susceptible to “buyer’s remorse,” meaning that they’re likely to regret their purchases, especially if they find out later that something “better” was available. Maximizers are also likely to feel anticipatory regret: Even before they make a decision, they feel there may be a better option that they’re not considering.

The regret maximizers tend to feel before or after making decisions can lead to general dissatisfaction with their choices. Even if a maximizer always makes the best decision objectively speaking, they’re likely to feel worse subjectively, because the decision ultimately didn’t bring them satisfaction.

While you might think that making the objectively best decision is important for major life choices, such as education, careers, or relationships, Schwartz believes your subjective experience still matters most.

For example, a maximizer could choose a job in the perfect location for them with an excellent salary, while a satisficer could accept a job that’s mostly the right fit, but that’s in an inconvenient neighborhood and pays a little less. The maximizer would still be less satisfied because they’re thinking of how the job could be even better, while the satisficer would likely be happy where they are because the job meets their standards.

**Ultimately, while maximizers aim to make the best possible decisions, they undermine their decision-making skills by denying themselves the ability to be happy with their choices.**

> **The Results of Maximizers’ Decisions**
> 
> Schwartz focuses on how maximizing leads people to be dissatisfied with their decisions, no matter the outcome. However, it’s important to note that the decisions made by maximizers can actually lead to objectively better outcomes.
> 
> One study, where Schwartz was a researcher, found that maximizers took jobs with starting salaries that were 20% higher than satisficers. This has a material impact on your life: A 20% difference in salary can affect where you live, whether you can travel, whether you can pay off debt, and a host of other financial considerations.
> 
> The maximizers, though, were less satisfied with their jobs than satisficers, despite the higher pay. So while maximizing might be a logical path for consequential life decisions, it still can have negative psychological effects.

### When People Maximize

Maximizing isn't necessarily something people do all the time. Rather, **there may be certain areas where you’re more inclined to maximize than others, and even people who are generally satisficers may maximize for certain decisions.**

For example, you may always maximize when selecting a movie to watch, but satisfice when buying shoes. Maximizers, then, are people who maximize more often than not, and satisficers satisfice more often than not. Neither is absolute.

Because few people maximize or satisfice all the time, this implies that **maximizers have the potential to incorporate satisficing into their life to a greater extent—** after all, it’s likely they’re already doing that in certain areas.

> **Holiday Maximizing**
> 
> The same year that _The Paradox of Choice_ was published, PBS NewsHour interviewed Schwartz about expanded choice. To illustrate the point about expanded choice, the journalists conducted most of these interviews at the King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia—one of the largest malls in the United States—at the peak of the holiday shopping season.
> 
> In the broadcast, a self-identified maximizer told interviewers she found the amount of choice overwhelming, but still always insisted on getting the best deal she could find, keeping a highly organized wallet full of coupons. This is an example of someone who has one particular area she maximizes in: finding deals. She didn’t mention the quality of her purchases, or which stores she bought them from—presumably, she’d be content with a wide array of options, focusing more on which products she’d get a good discount on.
> 
> Schwartz would likely argue that this shopper could tamp down her maximizing by considering which areas of her life she satisficed in and applying her satisficing process to her hunt for deals.

### Why People Maximize

Given the many drawbacks, why do people maximize? Schwartz identifies several reasons:

**1\. Maximizers are often unaware of their maximizing.** They’re not fully conscious of their constant comparing of options in the search for the best. Some maximizers might just think they’re indecisive.

**2\. Maximizing reflects the universal desire for status.** The desire for social status, which can be demonstrated by possessions, has always been a part of human society, and this has only increased in recent years. In a competitive capitalist society, refusing to settle for anything but the best can be a compelling way to climb the social ladder.

Schwartz cites economist Fred Hirsch, who argued that the concern for status is a result of competitiveness over scarce resources. Hirsch believed that in a society where many people’s basic needs are already met, competition for scarcer resources grows. Aiming for only the best is a means to set yourself apart by attaining scarce products or experiences.

**3\. A society of expanded choice may create maximizers.** Schwartz argues that people who are naturally satisficers may become maximizers, because the availability of a wide variety of options encourages them to pay more attention to their choices. Schwartz acknowledges that this idea is speculative and not backed by research, but he believes it’s worth taking seriously.

(Shortform note: Schwartz has argued that maximizing too much can undermine decision-making, but one might wonder if it’s possible to go too far in the direction of satisficing. Schwartz doesn’t raise this possibility, but it is conceivable that satisficing could work against you if you picked the first option that met your standards in high-stakes areas like housing or education. While satisficing is an effective and efficient decision-making strategy, it’s important to go beyond baseline acceptability in examining your options for big decisions.)
