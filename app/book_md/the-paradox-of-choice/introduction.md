## Introduction: Overwhelmed With Choices

**Freedom of choice is integral to living a fulfilling life.** Schwartz explains that individual autonomy and satisfaction increase as choice increases, and he acknowledges that living a life with no choice at all causes unhappiness.

But while Schwartz stresses the overall importance of freedom of choice, **he believes that _too many_ choices can actually hinder autonomy. **In market democracies, we’re presented with boundless choices on a daily basis, from groceries to health insurance plans. **Schwartz argues that the number of choices we face often leaves us stressed and indecisive.** At a certain point, Schwartz posits, expanded choices do not bring us further happiness and independence, but instead overload us with inconsequential decisions to make.

To lift this burden, **Schwartz recommends we learn how to prioritize decisions** , so we can deal with expanded choice more efficiently.

Schwartz’s interest in this topic stems from both his career and his personal life. He’s a psychologist and professor at Swarthmore College, specializing in the interactions between psychology and economics. _The Paradox of Choice,_ published in 2004, was inspired partly by Schwartz’s experiences as a consumer facing dramatically expanded choice.

In _The Paradox of Choice_ , Schwartz explains:

  1. The types of choices we make
  2. How we make these choices
  3. Why making so many choices causes us to suffer
  4. How we can learn to better approach choice through prioritization



> **The Internet Drives More Choice**
> 
> Schwartz’s argument about expanded choice has only grown more salient in the years since its 2004 publication, as technological, market, social, and labor shifts have added choices in many areas of our lives.
> 
> In a 2015 article in _The Guardian_ , Schwartz explains how his views on choice have developed since his book’s publication. He cites the internet as a main driver of proliferating choice. While entertainment services and online retailers have developed recommendation systems that aim to lessen the massive influx of choice, Schwartz is skeptical, commenting that the internet is trying to fix a problem of its own making. He argues that dating websites, in particular, have created a heavy burden of choice in people’s romantic lives by showing users hundreds of potential options.
> 
> We’ll discuss topics like the internet and dating websites in detail later in this guide.
