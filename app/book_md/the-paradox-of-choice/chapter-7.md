## Chapter 7: Pitfall #2—Regret

In the last chapter, Schwartz discussed how the fear of missed opportunities makes decisions challenging. **In this chapter, he examines another pitfall of too much choice: regret.** He explains what causes regret, the tendency to imagine scenarios that make us regretful, the negative effects of regret, how expanded choice makes regret worse, and how we can use regret in a healthy way.

### Why We Regret

Schwartz describes three factors that influence how we experience regret:

**1\. Omission bias** : When reflecting on the _recent_ past, we regret choices we made instead of those we failed to make. The opposite is also true—when reflecting on the _distant_ past, we tend to regret choices we failed to make instead of those we made.

(Shortform note _:_ While Schwartz focuses on the individual effects of cognitive biases like omission bias, your decisions can have broader effects, as well. For instance, countries where you have to opt out of being an organ donor have high rates of organ donation: Since you have to actively decide against being an organ donor, opting out feels like doing harm, which you want to avoid. The United States, on the other hand, requires you to opt in to being an organ donor, and it has lower rates of organ donation—since you’re _not_ acting by neglecting to opt in, you likely don’t feel as regretful about it.)

**2\. Nearness effect** : If a choice nearly works out, we feel bad that it didn’t. For example, if you order a Christmas present that arrives on December 26, you might feel worse than if it had arrived after New Year’s. You’d feel that if you’d ordered it a day earlier, it might have arrived on time. However, if the present arrived even later you’d feel less in control of the outcome.

(Shortform note: In addition to creating regret, there’s evidence that the nearness effect also gives us a jolt of motivation. Research has suggested that when we _almost_ win a game, part of us feels like we won, making us want to try again. The nearness effect, therefore, also poses a risk for people who engage in risky activities like gambling: If you rack up near-misses on the slot machines, for example, you’ll want to keep going, and likely end up regretful after the fact.)

**3\. Responsibility:** We only regret choices we feel personally responsible for. If something goes wrong but we’re not at fault, we might feel bad, but we don’t personally regret it. But if something goes wrong because of a choice we made, we regret it because we feel that we’re responsible for the outcome.

(Shortform note:__ Some researchers have found that although we experience regret for decisions we’re responsible for, we experience greater disappointment for decisions we’re not responsible for. This is a different kind of negative feeling—instead of wishing we acted differently, we feel upset that we’ve been placed in an unsatisfying situation through no fault of our own. This is a benefit of regret: When we feel regret, we at least have the motivation and the ability to change our actions in the future.)

When these three factors combine, regret can grow even stronger.

### Upward and Downward Counterfactuals

Schwartz writes that, to make matters worse, **we have the ability to imagine scenarios—called counterfactuals—that prompt regret**.****

Counterfactuals are hypothetical situations we imagine. For example, we envision how past events might have gone differently, or what our lives would be like had we made different choices. These hypothetical scenarios can make us regret the choices that led to our current circumstances.

Schwartz writes that we typically imagine counterfactual scenarios when something makes us unhappy. For instance, you could be generally satisfied with your life, but every day you get stuck in traffic on your commute to work. One morning, in particularly bad bumper-to-bumper traffic, you imagine life without this inconvenience. Then you start to regret your life as a whole—if you’d chosen a different career in a different city, you wouldn’t have such a frustrating commute. Imagining how things could be better is an _upward_ counterfactual.

(Shortform note: A 2017 study showed a correlation between upward counterfactuals and depression. It’s unclear whether depression causes people to think of upward counterfactuals or vice versa, but this data backs up Schwart’s idea that frequent counterfactual thinking leads to unhappiness and regret.)

In contrast, Schwartz explains that imagining how we could be worse off—a _downward_ counterfactual—can be positive because these counterfactuals can make us feel grateful for our lives and the choices we’ve made. After all, we could have chosen much worse. We don’t naturally imagine downward counterfactuals (or look on the bright side), so Schwartz advises people struggling with regret to make a point of doing so.

For example, imagine a college student who studied hard for a calculus exam and got a C+. Although she’d hoped to do better, she could choose to imagine a downward counterfactual: She might not have studied at all and failed. Imagining a worse outcome makes her feel better about her C+.

> **Downward Counterfactuals and Procrastination**
> 
> While Schwartz writes that most people don’t naturally imagine downward counterfactuals, some are inclined to do so—namely, procrastinators. The tendency to imagine downward counterfactuals is associated with the tendency to procrastinate.
> 
> A study indicated that, when presented with scenarios that can cause anxiety, like seeking medical care, participants with a tendency to procrastinate generated numerous downward counterfactuals and relatively few upward counterfactuals. For instance, they imagined the ways in which their health could be worse, reducing their sense of urgency about seeking medical care. This seems to be linked to procrastination because imagining downward counterfactuals takes the pressure off making tough decisions—since things aren’t so bad now, you don’t need to make a decision right away.
> 
> Procrastination is related to difficulties in decision-making, since challenging choices can trigger stress, leading some to put off making the choice indefinitely. People who regularly imagine downward counterfactuals, then, may be people who already have some difficulty making choices.

### The Consequences of Regret

Schwartz notes that, while regret has several distinct causes, what we notice most in our lives are its negative effects. Regret can carry consequences detrimental to our decision-making and emotional health.

#### Regret Aversion

Schwartz asserts that**one of the major consequences of regret is regret aversion: making choices with the primary goal of avoiding regret.**

Regret aversion is related to the concept of risk aversion, an aspect of prospect theory. People tend to avoid risk when making choices, even if the upside of the risk is highly positive. Regret aversion is a type of risk aversion. If faced with a choice between two options—a “safe” option we know what to expect from and a risky option with potential upsides—most people would choose the safe option to avoid regret.

Schwartz points out that regret aversion can also cause people to delay making decisions—called inaction inertia—due to the potential for regret. Meanwhile, they miss out on the more attractive option and are faced with deciding on a less attractive one. Again, they put off a decision, and the cycle continues.

For example, imagine a new digital camera is on sale for 25% off. You want to buy it, but you’re concerned it’s still too expensive for a product that might not totally satisfy you. You wait too long, and after a week it’s no longer on sale. You still want the camera, but now you can’t justify buying it because you didn’t get it while it was on sale.

The ultimate consequence of decision avoidance can be regret for failing to make a choice. Inaction inertia, therefore, doesn’t prevent regret at all.

> **FOMO and Regret Aversion**
> 
> One example of regret aversion you may have encountered is FOMO—the “fear of missing out,” often triggered by social media posts showing others having a good time. When you experience FOMO, you’ll likely make commitments you don’t want to make for fear you’ll miss something memorable. This is a classic case of regret aversion. Instead of choosing something you actually want, you’re choosing something to stave off future regret.
> 
> If you struggle with FOMO, it might be helpful to think of what you actually want in the moment, as opposed to what you think you might want in the future.

#### Avoiding Sunk Costs

Regret also causes us to avoid “sunk costs,” or wasting resources we’ve already committed. Logically, we should base decisions on what’s best for us in the future. However, as explained in Chapter 3, we frequently do things we don’t necessarily want to because we’ve already committed ourselves and want to justify it. For instance, if you buy a movie ticket a week in advance but don’t want to go to the movie when the time comes, you’ll most likely go anyway because you purchased the ticket.

Schwartz argues that the desire to avoid sunk costs stems from feelings of regret and responsibility. Since we already made a choice or investment, we follow through to avoid regretting the decision (as previously noted, this type of thinking is known as the sunk cost bias). But we don’t satisfy ourselves, or even avoid regret, by trying to justify choices we made in the past.

> **High-Stakes Sunk Costs**
> 
> Schwartz discusses the sunk cost bias in the context of individual choices, but organizations can also succumb to the sunk cost bias, with significant consequences.
> 
> A high-profile example of a large organization falling victim to the sunk cost bias is Walgreens, which maintained a partnership with the fraudulent blood-testing company Theranos even after suspecting Theranos’s testing equipment didn’t work.
> 
> In _Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup_ , John Carreyrou details how Walgreens gave in to sunk costs. When Walgreens began to have doubts about Theranos’s technology, it didn’t cut ties, in part because it had already spent a significant amount of money on building clinics and didn’t want to back out of a high-profile commitment.

### How Expanded Choice Worsens Regret

Schwartz contends that **expanded choice, and the maximizing tendency it encourages, amplifies regret.**

With expanded choice, virtually every decision we make has many options. Since there are many options, there are many opportunities to make a choice that will cause regret. Expanded choice increases regret by making bad choices more likely.

Schwartz notes that an increase in choices also implies an increase in opportunity costs. Increased opportunity costs means that every decision entails many alternatives to weigh, creating potential anticipatory regret and post-decision regret: You worry that you’ll make the wrong choice, and once you’ve chosen, you wish you’d chosen an alternative.

Regret is a much more potent issue for maximizers when there is expanded choice. Aiming to choose only “the best” will create regret whenever a chosen option isn’t completely satisfactory, which is almost all of the time. Satisficers, since they are content with “good enough,” don’t regret their choices as often as maximizers.

> **Maximizing and Regret**
> 
> Studies have shown that regret is one of the key negative impacts of maximizing. One study even suggested that quality of life for maximizers is affected _only_ when the maximizer feels regret.
> 
> Because maximizers don’t have consistent standards, and instead constantly consider what better options there are, they have the potential to regret any decision they make. Thus, maximizers feel regret constantly. This can lessen quality of life, because significant regret can harm mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and dissatisfaction.
> 
> Therefore, learning to be a satisficer has the potential to lessen regret and improve satisfaction with your life. If you’re a maximizer and struggle with decision regret, try taking steps to satisfice, like setting standards, making firm decisions, and accepting options that are “good enough” instead of perfect.

### The Benefits of Regret

While Schwartz has described the pitfalls of regret in relation to decision-making and expanded choice, he also emphasizes that regret has several useful purposes.

First, anticipatory regret forces us to take our decisions seriously, since we’re already concerned about the outcome before we’ve made the choice. Post-decision regret helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Regret can also compel us to act in order to reduce the impact of our past mistakes, or to help to mend the damage they’ve caused. When you express regret, it tells others that you’re sorry for the harm you’ve caused, and that you aim to make better choices in the future.

These positive effects show that regret is a necessary, useful emotion. What Schwartz emphasizes is how regret can go too far, particularly when faced with expanded choice.

For those who have major issues with regret, such as maximizers, taking steps to reduce regret can positively impact their lives. Schwartz offers that some ways to reduce regret include practicing upward counterfactuals and aiming to satisfice in your decision-making.

> **How to Benefit From Regret**
> 
> To make sure you benefit from your regret, try taking these steps. These will help you consider how you can use regret to make better choices in the future, instead of stewing over your regrets.
> 
>   * Acknowledge the regret you feel, but look for positive choices you can make in the future, instead of dwelling on the past.
> 
>   * If you struggle with regret spirals, find some ways to cut them off. It’s helpful to find tasks or projects to work on, since those will take your focus elsewhere.
> 
>   * Remind yourself that you can see the events you regret from a different point of view, and you can find positives in any decision.
> 
>   * Talk to yourself about your regrets like a trusted mentor or loved one would, instead of talking to yourself negatively.
> 
>   * Use your regret to determine what’s important in your life, and take this knowledge into your future decisions.
> 
>   * Take action to make better decisions in the future.
> 
> 

> 
> Taking action is especially important because it helps you lessen future regret. For example, if you lost a job because you showed up late too often, you’d likely feel regret because of the consequences of your lateness. You could use this regret effectively: When you start a new job, you could make it a priority to always be on time.
