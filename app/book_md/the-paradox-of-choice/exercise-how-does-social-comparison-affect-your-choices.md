## Exercise: How Does Social Comparison Affect Your Choices?

Social comparison affects everyone. While we canâ€™t escape it, we can understand and change how it impacts our lives.

* * *

Think of a recent occasion when you compared yourself to someone you know. Was it an upward comparison (someone you think is better off) or a downward comparison (someone you think is worse off)? How did this comparison make you feel?

How did this comparison affect you? For example, was it productive, or did it cause you emotional stress?

Going forward, what can you do differently if you find yourself making an unhelpful comparison?
