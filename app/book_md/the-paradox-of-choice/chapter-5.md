## Chapter 5: How Choice Affects Happiness

Schwartz previously discussed the contradictions of choice and happiness: Although freedom of choice is essential to autonomy and satisfaction with your life, _too much_ choice can create stress and dissatisfaction.

In this chapter, Schwartz first acknowledges the benefits of freedom of choice. Then he explores how voluntarily limiting our freedom to choose in some cases can make us happier.

### Why We Need Choice

**Schwartz argues that freedom of choice is valuable because it provides basic autonomy, the material ability to live your life as you see fit, and the ability to present yourself to the world however you want.**

Schwartz cites 18th century economist Adam Smith, who posited that freedom of choice allows the market to respond to people’s desires by providing things they want or need, and people then have the freedom to choose the goods that best fit their lifestyle. Schwartz also emphasizes that freedom of choice allows people to express who they are. The goods and experiences we choose shape how we show ourselves to the world. This is a form of autonomy that helps us feel satisfied in our lives.

(Shortform note: There is scientific evidence for autonomy’s importance to well-being. A report in the _Journal of Personality and Social Psychology_ found that autonomy is the most important indicator of happiness: Those who feel control over their lives tend to be the happiest. Part of autonomy is the freedom to choose—if we don’t have choice in our lives, then we don’t have control. Some level of freedom of choice, then, is essential to our happiness.)__

While autonomy and choice are essential to our well-being, Schwartz notes that lacking autonomy has negative psychological consequences. People who generally lack autonomy or control may succumb to learned helplessness,**** or passive acceptance of their circumstances even when they might be able to choose change. Learned helplessness can cause physical and mental health issues, such as a suppressed immune system or severe depression.

On the other hand, **a constant barrage of choices can leave us feeling out of control, rather than in control.** Schwartz argues for a balance between no choice and excessive choice. He explains how to achieve this through our social relationships and prioritization of choices.

> **Learned Optimism**
> 
> Psychologist Martin Seligman, one of the researchers who developed the concept of learned helplessness, continued his work by exploring its opposite: learned optimism, the idea that people can learn to become optimistic over time just as they learn to feel helpless.
> 
> Seligman came to view optimism as a strategy for improving your outlook on life through techniques such as viewing problems as external, temporary, and common. Viewing your problems this way can lead to a greater feeling of control over your life, in contrast to learned helplessness, in which you feel permanently out of control.

### Why Limiting Our Choice Can Make Us Happier

While Schwartz acknowledges the importance of choice, he advocates voluntarily limiting our choices in order to avoid being overwhelmed. Above all, he recommends limiting choice by prioritizing relationships. When we choose to invest in close relationships, we limit our options and assume responsibility for others, yet Schwartz argues that limiting our choices in this way makes us happier. ****

Schwartz explains that, generally speaking, those who have strong social, familial, romantic, and communal relationships are happiest. It’s not clear whether people are happier _because_ of their relationships, or whether people who are already happy are more likely to have stronger relationships. However, he argues that both are probably true: Close relationships make people happy, and happy people also tend to have an easier time forming close relationships.

**Close relationships require compromising our choices for the sake of others.** For instance, if you decide to have a monogamous relationship with a partner you’re in love with, you’re no longer free to seek romantic relationships with others. While this is a constraint, it’s one that will make you happy. **The connection between relationships and happiness argues against the belief that absolute freedom of choice is the way to be happy.**

Schwartz cites research by psychologists David Myers and Robert Lane that underscores this point. They argue that the United States has been experiencing a decline in well-being since the middle of the 20th century. While wealth has increased in this time, strong social relationships have decreased. With society’s focus on individualism, many people have a hard time forging the type of close relationships that bring happiness.

> **The Long-Lasting Effects of Strong Relationships**
> 
> Besides contributing to happiness, close romantic and social relationships predict health and longevity. Research from the Harvard Study of Adult Development indicates the importance of close relationships to health. The study began in 1938 to examine the factors affecting how adults age, and it continues to this day. Over the many years that researchers have been following the original group of adult men in the study (later incorporating their wives and children), they found that one of the key predictors of long-lasting health is happiness and stability in close relationships.
> 
> Close, happy relationships, both romantic and social, were found to be excellent predictors of longevity, besting even good genes. Additionally, satisfying relationships in middle age were strong predictors of good health in advanced age. Clearly, prioritizing close relationships can reap benefits for one’s health, emotionally, mentally, and physically.

#### Relationships and Time Commitment

Schwartz has described how the freedom of choice encouraged by market democracies can be at odds with strong relationships. One way this conflict manifests is through struggles for time.

It takes time to form a trusting relationship and to maintain it. Additionally, relationships entail unexpected time commitments. Everyone with a strong social network sometimes has to drop what they’re doing to, for example, support a friend during an emotional crisis or take care of a sick family member.

With an overabundance of choices requiring us to spend more and more time making decisions, it’s easy to neglect time commitments in our relationships, causing our bonds to fray.

> **Lack of Time Causes Relationship Issues**
> 
> Lack of a time commitment can lead to problems in relationships, including being unaware of your partner’s emotional state, not missing them when you’re apart, and feeling physically or emotionally distant. Besides affecting romantic relationships, these issues can also undermine close friendships and family relationships.
> 
> If you’re spending much of your time making significant and insignificant decisions, these issues can pop up quickly or develop slowly over time. For example, if you’re stressed about finding a job, you may spend much of your day examining job postings and your free time making smaller choices, such as what to make for dinner. If you end up too preoccupied to spend time with your partner for days or weeks, the distance between you could easily grow.

#### Freedom vs. Commitment

Another point of conflict between a society of expanded choice and intimate relationships is the length of commitment that relationships require.

Schwartz points out that when making consumer choices, people are incentivized to walk away if they’re unsatisfied. For example, you might switch to a new coffee shop if your usual spot stops serving your favorite latte, or you could buy a new brand of shoes if the quality of your current brand decreases.

In contrast, relationships require long-term commitments. Walking away from a relationship is generally a last resort, once conversations and compromises have failed.

**Since we have conflicting approaches toward commitment in the free market and in our relationships, we have to balance our overall approach to loyalty and commitment in our lives.**

> **Fear of Commitment in Relationships**
> 
> A common obstacle in romantic relationships is the fear of commitment. Signs of a relationship with commitment issues include communication problems, different priorities between partners, and problems with financial compatibility.
> 
> Schwartz might add the fear of making a firm choice to this list. If you commit to a partner, that means you’re eliminating the possibility of forming relationships with other people. Even if someone fearful of commitment is able to enter a long-term relationship, arguments or problems in the relationship might tempt them to walk away and look for romance elsewhere.

### How to Prioritize Decisions

In addition to narrowing our freedom of choice by engaging in close relationships, **Schwartz recommends deciding which choices to spend time on, and which to make without much deliberation.**

Schwartz cites the work of Cass Sunstein and Edna Ullmann-Margalit, who described**decisions we shouldn’t have to think carefully about, and can therefore automate, as _second-order_ decisions. **They identify four categories of second-order decisions: rules, presumptions, standards, and routines. Incorporating each into your life can reduce stress by limiting the number of decisions you need to make.

> **Second-Order Decisions and the Legal System**
> 
> Schwartz focuses on individualized second-order decisions, like sticking to a morning routine. However, second-order (automated) decisions may also encompass higher-stakes decisions, such as those involving the legal system.
> 
> In a 1999 paper, Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit wrote ​​that institutions and the legal system use second-order decisions as often as average people do.
> 
> As examples, Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit cited legal authorities enforcing speed limit laws (which fall under rules), or government agencies setting limits on energy use for corporations, which can be appealed if necessary (an example of presumptions).
> 
> Schwartz’s view on second-order decisions is more casual and low-stakes, since he’s only discussing them in terms of individuals. However, it is important to note that all decisions have consequences, and you should be able to revisit and reconsider second-order decisions if you think they could have a negative impact.

#### Rules

Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit’s first category of second-order decisions is rules. **By making rules for ourselves about certain choices, we can alleviate the burden of many choices in our lives.**

For example, we all technically have the choice of whether or not to stop at a stop sign. Most people, though, make a rule for themselves to always stop. This makes the decision automatic so they don’t need to think about it.

The law makes this an easy rule to follow, but there are many non-legal scenarios for creating your own rules, as well. For example, you could make a rule to always call your mother on Mother’s Day, or to never break a promise made to a friend. Rules like these can significantly help in social relationships, as well as limiting the time you spend making choices.

> **Strategies for Setting Rules**
> 
> Some rules can be decided without much thought at all, like making a rule to follow the law. However, it can be difficult to determine what other choices you should make rules for. _Psychology Today lists several types of decisions that are helpful to set rules for._
> 
>   * If there’s a product you use frequently, or often run out of, set a rule to always buy it when you see it in a store.
> 
>   * Set a rule to never skimp when you need something—for example, always fill your tank with gas if you need it.
> 
>   * When you have a routine, set a rule to always do it the same way. For example, if you already replace your toothbrush several times a year, you could set a rule to buy a new toothbrush every three months.
> 
> 


#### Presumptions

The second category of second-order decisions is presumptions. Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit assert that, **like rules, presumptions are predetermined choices you make for yourself. However, you can easily change presumptions if necessary.**

For example, if you start work five days a week at 9 a.m., you might set your alarm for 7 a.m. throughout the workweek. Your presumption is to wake up at 7 each day, so you have one less decision to make. However, if you have an 8 a.m. doctor’s appointment one day, you might set your alarm for earlier. The change of circumstance prompted you to change your presumption.

> **Presumptions and Writing**
> 
> We all use presumptions in our daily lives, but they’re especially applicable to certain areas. When you write, for example, you use a multitude of presumptions, with many reasons to occasionally break them. This is true whether you’re writing an email to your boss, a letter to a friend, or a 400-page novel.
> 
> Many grammar rules are presumptions: Starting a sentence with “and,” for example, is technically incorrect, but there are situations where it’s reasonable and effective. Presumptions are general guidelines to follow, but we allow room for flexibility when those guidelines don’t fit.

#### Standards

The third category of second-order decisions is standards. Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit write that standards are more flexible than rules or presumptions, but they still confine your choices. **To set standards means to sort your options into two categories: acceptable and unacceptable.**

An example is choosing from a menu at a restaurant you’ve never been to before. You don’t have a usual order here yet, but you know the foods you like and the foods you don’t. Your choices, then, might look something like this: You like salads and sandwiches, so you consider those as options, but you don’t like soups or fried foods, so you bypass those options. You still need to make a decision, but you save yourself time and effort by knowing how to automatically narrow your choices.

Standards also help us build relationships. If you decide to start dating, for instance, you’ll probably have in mind certain qualities you want in a partner and certain qualities you don’t. You still might have to meet many new people, but standards make it easier to decide whom you want to spend time with.

Standards dovetail with the concept of satisficing: When you make choices based on what meets your standards rather than searching for the best possible option, you make decisions easier for yourself while still finding satisfying options.

> **How Expanded Choice Can Affect Our Standards**
> 
> Setting standards is an effective technique to limit your choices, but be aware that expanded choice can inadvertently affect _how_ you set standards. Studies on how people use dating apps found that, when presented with a large number of options, people tend to set their standards for potential matches higher and reject many people. This is in line with the tendency to maximize in a society of expanded choice.
> 
> Consciously setting standards can help you avoid this, because you automatically eliminate any option below your standards.

#### Routines

Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit’s final category of second-order decisions is routines. **We build routines when we find something that meets our standards.**

To use the previous restaurant example, if you order a chicken Caesar salad and like it, you might order it every time you go to that restaurant. Because you’ve made a satisfactory and repeatable decision, you don’t have to spend time thinking about what to order again (you have a routine). Likewise, if you’ve been dating and find a person you like, you might start seeing them every Saturday night. There will likely be more choices ahead about the relationship, but for now, you’ve found a healthy routine and eliminated the need to decide what to do and with whom each Saturday night.

We have routines for spending time with friends and family, too—we don’t choose whether or not to continue the relationship every time we see them. Relationships would be close to impossible without routines.

> **Forming Routines**
> 
> In _Atomic Habits, _James Clear __ provides advice for forming new routines, which he defines as a repeated series of habits—for example, flossing, brushing your teeth, and using mouthwash every night. Clear focuses on the habits and routines that we repeat over the course of our lives, and how to develop positive new habits and routines and phase out unhelpful ones.
> 
> Clear recommends listing the different habits you repeat over the course of a day and classifying which are positive, negative, or neutral. To form new habits, he recommends planning them in advance at first to ensure you carry them out and associating new behaviors with pre-existing habits to integrate the new ones into your life.
> 
> Since our routines are made up of habits, taking these steps can form new routines. For example, if you decide to make tea instead of coffee every morning, drinking tea will become part of a daily routine.
