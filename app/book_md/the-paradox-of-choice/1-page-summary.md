## 1-Page Summary

In _The Paradox of Choice,_ Barry Schwartz contends that the vast array of choices presented to us leaves us stressed and indecisive. To lift this burden, Schwartz, a professor of social theory and social action, recommends we learn how to better navigate our choices, from groceries to health insurance.

Schwartz’s work combines psychology and economics. He wrote _The Paradox of Choice_ based on his research and personal experiences with the negative consequences of expanded choice.

(Shortform note: Schwartz’s ideas have become popularized, and the concept of the “paradox of choice” has been written about frequently since the book’s publication. However, it has also attracted criticism: Writers for outlets such as _The Atlantic_ and the _Financial Times_ questioned the premise of Schwartz’s book, arguing that the idea that expanded choice has negative effects is not grounded in sufficient evidence.)

In this guide, we’ll examine the types of choices we face, the challenges of making choices, how excessive choices make these challenges more difficult, and how to live with expanded choice. We’ll also add scientific and cultural context to Schwartz’s ideas, plus updates on how choice has grown since the book’s publication.

### Three Categories of Choice

The many different decisions just about everyone has to make fall into three broad categories—**consumer choices, complex choices, and personal life choices**.

Schwartz explains how choices in each of these categories have expanded and become more complex, and how this expansion impacts our lives.

#### Consumer Choices

**Consumer choices are choices about purchases of consumer or tangible goods, from potato chips to computers.**

According to Schwartz, consumer choices have expanded to the point that seemingly simple decisions require a lot of unnecessary thought and energy—if there are 30 brands of cookies to choose from at a supermarket, for instance, you must give more attention to deciding which cookie to buy.

One way to mitigate this stress in consumer choices is to identify the decisions that are worth your time and energy. To do this, Schwartz distinguishes between “durable” and “nondurable” consumer goods:**Durable goods are those that last a long time, like electronics or appliances, and nondurable goods are used quickly, like groceries.**

People typically spend more money, time, and energy on choosing durable goods than nondurable ones. Because you’ll use these goods for a long time, the lengthier decision-making process is worth the effort. In contrast, by spending too much time making choices among nondurable goods, you'd use up energy you should spend on choosing durable goods.

(Shortform note: All durable and nondurable goods are tangible, meaning they’re physical objects you can use. In contrast, services, such as restaurant service or exercise classes, are intangible. Broader life choices, like marriage or religion, can’t accurately be described as either goods _or_ services.)

#### Complex Choices

**Complex choices involve more complicated decisions about intangibles that have a greater impact on our lives than products**.

Common areas of complex choice include utilities, insurance, education, retirement, medical care, and jobs. Schwartz writes that choices have expanded in all of these areas. For example, there are numerous electricity plans to choose from without many distinct differences, hundreds of college majors, and many private and government-subsidized insurance plans. These choices are all consequential and take time to consider, and Schwartz argues that the proliferation of options in each of them makes it harder to reach a satisfactory and well-informed decision.

(Shortform note: While utilities and insurance are important choices that take time and energy to consider, other complex choices like education and retirement are generally of greater importance. People with the financial means have the opportunity to change their utilities and insurance plans if they are unsatisfied, but education and retirement choices have longer-lasting consequences that may significantly affect the life of the chooser.)

#### Personal Life Choices

In contrast to consumer and complex choices,**personal life choices are broad, long-term choices that don’t explicitly involve purchases, but instead incorporate how we want to experience our lives and present ourselves to the world**. These typically involve choices surrounding our personal relationships and our identities (religious, social, and so on).

Schwartz explains that aspects of our personal lives where choices have expanded include relationships, religion, and identity. People now have greater choice over their romantic relationships: Strict social norms previously led many people to marry, buy property, and have children on an expected timeline—but now, most people have the freedom to create romantic relationships that work best for them. Freedom to choose which religion to practice, or not to practice religion at all, has grown more common and socially accepted. Many people are now more free to express their identities as they want to (for example, someone can engage with their queer identity with an L.G.B.T.Q. social group, and also engage with their Jewish identity when attending services at their synagogue).

> Since this book’s publication, our choices in these arenas have only grown. In romance, dating apps and websites have expanded our relationship options, although some of these services are more useful than others. An article in _Nautilus_ argues that websites that curate your matches to a greater extent, such as eHarmony, are more effective because they force you to look closely at a few people, rather than presenting dozens.
> 
> When it comes to religion, although the options haven’t expanded a lot, 42% of people surveyed in 2015 said they’d changed their religious affiliation at least once. Disengaging from religion entirely, too, is becoming more common: Between 2007 and 2014, people reporting a lack of religious affiliation increased from 16% to 23%.

Schwartz believes that these are all positive developments, allowing people greater control over how to live their lives. However, he notes that it can be more challenging to make choices in areas as consequential as relationships and religion when you have many options available to you.

#### The Consequences of Expanded Choice

**The countless choices in these three categories overwhelm and deplete us, according to Schwartz.** These are all deliberate decisions, or choices that we actively think about, rather than unconscious choices that we make automatically, like basic hygiene. Expanded choice overloads us with deliberate decisions in inconsequential areas. As a result, we prioritize our choices poorly, spending time and energy on inconsequential decisions without giving ourselves space to consider more important choices.

> **Can Expanded Choice Have Positive Effects?**
> 
> Some researchers have come to opposite conclusions about the consequences of expanded consumer choice, arguing that instead of overwhelming us, it helps us to clarify what we really want.
> 
> A group of psychologists and economists conducted 10 experiments where subjects were made to choose between either limited or expanded options. The researchers found no correlation between expanded choice and difficulty of decision-making. Instead, they found that offering many choices doesn’t make much of an impact on decision-making either way.
> 
> Another researcher conducted a study on what happens when people are faced with only one option and found that they were much more likely to make a decision when they had multiple options.
> 
> These studies seem to contradict Schwartz’s main findings about the stress expanded choice can cause: If having too many choices has either no effect or a positive effect, then it’s not a problem that needs to be fixed. However, Schwartz has responded to these claims by arguing that, while some studies have indicated that expanded choice can have a positive effect, numerous other studies published since _The Paradox of Choice_ have indicated negative effects.

### How and Why We Choose

The process of making decisions is difficult with or without expanded choice. **Decisions are challenging in part because each decision has many layers.** A single large decision can consist of many different small decisions to weigh against each other.**** In addition, Schwartz notes that**** psychological biases can get in the way of effective decision-making.

#### Steps to a Good Decision

Schwartz establishes several steps toward making a good decision:

  1. Determine your goal(s). 
  2. Consider how important each of your goals is. 
  3. Lay out your options. 
  4. Evaluate how each option can advance your goals. 
  5. Choose the best option. 



After you make your decision and put it into action, Schwartz recommends a sixth step of reflecting on the results and using what you learn to adjust future goals and how you approach them.

> **More Decision-Making Tips**
> 
> While Schwartz gives an overall framework for making decisions, here are a few more specific strategies:
> 
>   * Make a list of pros and cons, considering the future possibilities of each decision.
> 
>   * Do some relaxing activities to decrease decision-making stress.
> 
>   * Talk through your options with people you trust.
> 
>   * If you’re concerned about others’ reactions to your decision, think about how you’ll tell them the decision you made.
> 
>   * If the decision you’ve been leaning toward starts to feel wrong, take another look at your original options to see if any of them seem more appealing now.
>

#### Psychological Biases

Numerous psychological biases, exacerbated by expanded choice, stand in the way of making good decisions. Schwartz identifies six biases that can lead to bad choices:

  1. **Remembered and Expected Utility:** Remembered utility is what you remember about an experience __ after __ it occurs, and expected utility is how we make choices for the future based on past experiences. Remembered utility is often faulty, and Schwartz writes that what we remember most about experiences are the best and worst moments, and how we felt at the end of the experience. As a result, we’re not always accurate when we use expected utility to make choices.
  2. **Availability Heuristic:** This describes how we give greater weight to information we can easily recall. Because of this, we often make decisions based on our most vivid memories, rather than accurate information.
  3. **Anchoring and Framing:** These are two biases that can lead us to make faulty comparisons among options. Anchoring is using other items as reference points for comparisons, while framing is using language to manipulate how people choose among options. 
  4. **Prospect Theory:** This describes how people choose among uncertain or risky options and the role that bias plays. One element of prospect theory is the psychological effects of gains and losses.**** As you make gains, you’ll probably feel good, but as you make more gains, the satisfaction shrinks. Likewise, when you incur a loss, you’ll likely feel bad, but when your losses increase, your dissatisfaction might not increase too much. Additionally, we feel losses more strongly than gains, which makes us try to avoid losses. There is also an arbitrary “neutral point” that determines what will feel like a loss or a gain: anything better than the “neutral point” will feel like a gain, while anything worse than the “neutral point” is a loss. This neutral point can be anything, and it’s often manipulated by anchoring and framing.
  5. **Endowment Effect:** Once you have something, you feel that it’s yours, or you “own” it. This applies even if something’s only been in your possession for a brief time.
  6. **Sunk Costs:** This is money you’ve already spent and can’t recover. Many of us prioritize avoiding sunk costs over what we actually want to do (for example, seeing a concert we don’t want to see because we already purchased tickets).



> **How Reliable Is Our Memory?**
> 
> While it’s true that our memories can be biased and skewed, scientists have had difficulty determining the extent of our memory’s reliability or unreliability. For example, _Scientific American_ described a recent study showing that people’s memories were much more accurate than anticipated: When recalling events that happened two days ago, a study group described them with 90% accuracy, much higher than the 40% that the researchers predicted.
> 
> Other studies have shown that, while memories tend to be strong soon after events occur, they diminish over time. Researchers are still studying how memory works, and how well, but understanding the likelihood that our memory can be strong in the immediate aftermath of an event and weaken over time can be helpful in decision-making.
> 
> For example, if you take a trip and are trying to decide whether to return next year, you might decide to write down your thoughts immediately after the trip. Even if remembered utility biases you to consider your feelings at the end of the trip, you’ll still probably have a sharp memory of what happened at the beginning and middle.

### Maximizing and Satisficing

Because of the difficulties of expanded choice and cognitive biases, Schwartz notes that **many people fall into a particular bad habit to save energy and effort: making most choices indiscriminately, without considering options or consequences.** These people are “guessers.” In contrast, those who think through their decisions are “deliberators.”

Schwartz notes two kinds of deliberators:

  1. **_Maximizers_ accept only the best possible option. **
  2. **_Satisficers_ accept an option that, though not perfect, meets their standards.**



(Shortform note: The terms “maximizing” and “satisficing” were coined in 1956 by economist and psychologist Herbert A. Simon, in the article “Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment.” Simon argued that people are generally incapable of selecting the single best option from a wide range, but are in fact able to choose an acceptable option that will satisfy their needs.)

**Maximizing and satisficing both come from a desire to make good decisions, but Schwartz argues that maximizing causes stress and eats up time much more than satisficing.** If you maximize, you need assurance that every decision you make is the best you could have made. Because of this, maximizers aspire to consider every option they can, even for small decisions.

Satisficers, on the other hand, consider their options and have high standards, but once they find an option that meets those standards, they accept it rather than continuing to explore options.

Schwartz believes that, while maximizers think they’re prioritizing their best interests, they’re actually making themselves unhappy. Satisficers are the people who actually make the most of their decisions.

> **Are Maximizers Actually Unhappy?**
> 
> Some research on maximizing counters Schwartz’s belief that maximizing and unhappiness are correlated, instead suggesting that there’s no meaningful connection between them.
> 
> Schwartz and other researchers use a metric called the Maximization Scale to determine whether people are maximizers or satisficers. However, a 2008 study contends that this scale is flawed, as it asks respondents questions that may not be directly correlated to maximizing (for example, whether they like to rank movies). The researchers created a narrower scale to measure maximizing tendencies, and they found that, though maximizers are still more likely to feel regret, they’re just as happy as satisficers.

### How Choice Affects Happiness

Schwartz argues that the best way to find satisfaction in decision-making is **to balance our freedom of choice with self-imposed restrictions. The most important of these is restricting our relationships to a few close ones.** When we invest in close relationships, we limit our options, assume responsibility for others, and compromise. This puts some restrictions on our freedom of choice, yet evidence shows that people with strong relationships are happiest.

#### Prioritizing Decisions

In addition to narrowing our freedom of choice by engaging in close relationships, **Schwartz recommends deciding which choices to spend time on, and which to make without much deliberation.**

Schwartz cites the work of Cass Sunstein and Edna Ullmann-Margalit, who described **decisions we shouldn’t have to think much about, and can therefore automate, as _second-order decisions_. **They identify four categories of second-order decisions:

  1. **Rules:** By making rules for ourselves about certain choices (for example, that you always stop at stop signs), you can reduce the number of choices in your life. 
  2. **Presumptions:** Like rules, presumptions are predetermined choices you make for yourself. However, you can change presumptions if your circumstances change. For example, if you start work each day at 9 a.m., you might set your alarm for 7 a.m. daily. Your presumption is to wake up at 7 each day. However, if you have an 8 a.m. doctor’s appointment, you might set your alarm for earlier.
  3. **Standards:** Standards are more flexible than rules or presumptions, but they still confine your choices. To set standards means to sort your options into two categories: acceptable and unacceptable.
  4. **Routines:** We build routines when we find something that meets our standards (for example, we buy the same latte at the same coffee shop every day).



> **Second-Order Decisions and the Legal System**
> 
> Schwartz focuses on individualized second-order decisions, like picking a morning routine or setting standards to make everyday decisions easier. However, second-order (automated) decisions may also encompass higher-stakes decisions, such as those involving the legal system.
> 
> In a 1999 paper, Sunstein and Ullmann-Margalit wrote that institutions and the legal system use second-order decisions as often as average people do. As examples, the researchers cited legal authorities enforcing speed limit laws (which fall under rules), or government agencies setting limits on energy use for corporations, which can be appealed if necessary (an example of presumptions).
> 
> Schwartz’s view on second-order decisions is more casual and low-stakes, since he’s only discussing them in terms of individuals. However, it is important to note that all decisions have consequences, and you should be able to revisit and reconsider second-order decisions if you think they could have a negative impact.

### Pitfalls of Too Much Choice

In addition to exacerbating the difficulty of making choices, Schwartz asserts that expanded choice comes with four distinct pitfalls: missed opportunities, regret, disappointment, and unfavorable comparison.

#### Missed Opportunities

_Opportunity costs_ always come into play when we make a choice: When we settle on one option, we forgo the potential benefits of the other options. While it is important to consider the pros and cons of your options when making a deliberate choice, obsessing over opportunity costs can make you dissatisfied with the choice you do make.

People who stress over opportunity costs might be dissatisfied in the end because they worry that they haven’t made the objectively correct decision, or that there could have been a perfect option they haven’t considered. **Schwartz argues, however, that opportunity costs are entirely subjective. There is no objectively correct decision, just the right decision for the chooser.**

(Shortform note: Many decisions do have objectively positive or negative outcomes—for instance, if you choose to save money by eliminating doctor visits, you’ll end up with poor health. While Schwartz’s argument is salient in that we make many decisions based on feelings, which we can overemphasize, it’s important to be more aware of objective outcomes when making choices in areas like health and finances.)

#### Regret

Expanded choice can lead us to regret our choices. Schwartz notes three factors that cause regret:

  1. **Omission bias** : When reflecting on the _recent_ past, we regret choices we made instead of those we failed to make. The opposite is also true: When reflecting on the _distant_ past, we tend to regret choices we failed to make instead of those we made.
  2. **Nearness effect** : If a choice nearly works out, we feel bad that it didn’t. 
  3. **Responsibility:** We only regret choices we feel personally responsible for. 



> **Maximizing and Regret**
> 
> Studies have shown that regret is one of the key negative impacts of maximizing. One study even suggested that quality of life for maximizers is affected _only_ when the maximizer feels regret.
> 
> Because maximizers don’t have consistent standards, and instead constantly consider what better options there are, they have the potential to regret any decision that they make. Thus maximizers can feel regret constantly. This can have many negative effects on quality of life, because significant regret can harm mental health, making you feel anxious, depressed, and dissatisfied.
> 
> Therefore, learning to be a satisficer, can lessen regret and improve life satisfaction. If you’re a maximizer and struggle with decision regret, try taking steps to satisfice, like setting standards, making firm decisions, and accepting options that are “good enough” instead of perfect.

To make matters worse, we’re able to imagine hypothetical scenarios, called counterfactuals, that prompt regret. For example, we imagine how past events might have gone differently, or what our lives would be like had we made different choices.

Schwartz identifies two kinds of counterfactuals: upward and downward. The kind that brings us regret are _upward counterfactuals_ : We imagine how something in our life could be better, and regret that that’s not the case. Using _downward counterfactuals_ , however, we imagine how things could be worse. Schwartz writes that downward counterfactuals have the potential to _reduce_ regret, and that those who struggle with excessive regret could benefit by practicing them.

(Shortform note: A 2017 study showed a correlation between upward counterfactuals and depression. It’s unclear whether depression causes people to think of upward counterfactuals (how they could have been better off) or vice versa, but this data backs up Schwartz’s idea that frequent counterfactual thinking leads to unhappiness and regret.)

Expanded choice, and the maximizing tendency it encourages, amplifies regret over decisions. Aiming to choose only “the best” will create regret whenever a chosen option isn’t perfect, which is almost all of the time.

#### Disappointment

Schwartz explains that even when we make good choices, we often end up disappointed in the long run because of _hedonic adaptation_ :**** When we get used to things that give us pleasure, they lose their novelty and we begin to take them for granted. To counteract this, many of us get caught on a “hedonic treadmill,” meaning that we constantly chase after pleasurable experiences.

> **The Link Between Shopping and Unhappiness**
> 
> An example of the hedonic treadmill that most of us have experienced is the desire to buy more and more things. Buying a coveted item, or even a random product that piques your interest at the right moment, makes you feel good in the moment, yet hedonic adaptation usually kicks in pretty quickly. It can be easy to get trapped in a pattern of purchasing random products to get a regular little jolt of pleasure.
> 
> In an article in _The Atlantic_ about how unfettered shopping can damage supply chains, Amanda Mull illustrates the futility of buying things to create happiness. The author comments that feeling bad makes people buy things to feel better. Yet studies have shown that accumulating material possessions makes you _less_ happy. Shopping is just one example of how hopping on a hedonic treadmill can make you less satisfied.

Expanded choice makes our relationship to hedonic adaptation more difficult, because we have more opportunities to be disappointed by our choices. Our decisions are also more difficult and time-consuming when we have more options to choose from, meaning that our disappointment can be heightened when we don’t feel as good about a choice as we’d expect. If we spend a lot of time on a choice, we hope it will be satisfying, therefore it can feel depleting when we’re less happy than expected.

This problem is heightened for maximizers, since they put more weight on each of their decisions. Because maximizers strive to make perfect decisions, being dissatisfied with a decision will make them feel worse than a satisficer who is occasionally dissatisfied.

#### Comparison

Schwartz notes that one reason we may feel regret or disappointment in our choices is that we compare them with others’ choices to gauge whether we’re choosing well.****

Social comparison—comparing ourselves to others—affects decision-making the most in market democracies, according to Schwartz. He notes that a motivating factor behind social comparison is the desire for status. Achieving status, however, is difficult in a society of expanded choice: _Everyone_ has more ways to accrue status, so it’s harder to get ahead.

A complicating factor is that society encourages us to compete for scarce resources. Status motivates us to compare ourselves and our choices to others’, yet scarcity means we sometimes fall short, which makes this pursuit profoundly unsatisfying. While social comparison and the drive to accrue status cause challenges for everyone, Schwartz notes that, once again,**** maximizers suffer the most acutely because of their drive for the best.

(Shortform note: Social media is one area where social comparison is especially notable. Because people tend to post idealized images of themselves on social media, users make frequent upward comparisons. When subjected to a constant stream of images that cause upward social comparison, people may experience depression, lower self-esteem, and negative body image. These results are particularly strong for those who are pessimistic.)
