## Exercise: Consider the Impacts of Slavery and Reparations

In order to move toward a more just future, it’s important to understand how the institution of slavery has impacted modern America and how we can address these injustices.

* * *

Of the three major impacts of slavery (regressive taxation, biased legal system, and poor well-being of Black Americans) which did you find most surprising and why?

Share your opinion on whether the American government should provide reparations to Black descendants of American slaves. Do you think it’s a good or bad idea, and do you have any concerns?

Can you suggest any specific reparations that can help address the issue you chose in the first question?
