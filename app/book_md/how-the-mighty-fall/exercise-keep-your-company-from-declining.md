## Exercise: Keep Your Company From Declining

Companies typically don’t fail overnight—Collins writes that there are warning signs to watch out for. Evaluate whether your company is in danger of decline and come up with a plan to keep you from falling into the fifth phase (surrendering).

Collins says that companies fall into decline when they neglect their “flywheel,” the core business whose momentum keeps the company moving forward. What is your company’s flywheel? Does your company give it sufficient attention? How so?

Another cause of decline is when companies interpret inconclusive data with an overly optimistic eye. Consider one of the key metrics of your company’s performance (for example, sales in the past month). If there’s a decrease, what could be the cause? How can the company address this?

Collins stresses the importance of having a leadership continuity loop—creating a succession plan so that the right people occupy key roles. List the names of three people on your team or in your company who could take your place should the need arise. Remember that they should be a good cultural fit, work with minimum supervision, and take accountability when things go wrong.
