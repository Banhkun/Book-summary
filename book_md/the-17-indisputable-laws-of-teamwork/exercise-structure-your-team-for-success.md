## Exercise: Structure Your Team for Success

To build a winning team, you must have the right people in the right roles. Reflect on your team’s needs and how you can better structure your team for success.

* * *

Write down the goals you hope to achieve with your team. What are some potential challenges you expect to face along the way?

What kind of people would be on your ideal team for overcoming those challenges and achieving goals? For example, you might want team members with diverse perspectives or those who are highly creative.

How does your current team compare with your ideal team? How can you adjust your team so that it aligns more with your ideal vision? For example, you could consider changing people’s roles or letting go of some members who may be holding the team back.

Does your team have a catalyst, or a person who energizes and inspires your team? If so, how can you encourage them to be more of a positive influence? If not, how might you start looking for one?

What are some ways you can train and develop the supporting members of your team?
