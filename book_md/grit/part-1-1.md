## Part 1.1: Introduction to Grit

Duckworth argues that _talent_ and _intelligence_ matter less to success than grit, which she defines as a combination of perseverance and passion that drives a person to consistently pursue goals over many years _._ In Part 1, she explores how effort enhances talent and what lies behind passion. She discusses why people tend to be biased against grit in favor of natural talent, and why effort very often has an advantage. She also includes the grit test she developed that underpins her research.

In Part 2, she explores more deeply the elements that make up grit, which she identifies as interest, practice, purpose, and hope. Then, in Part 3, she discusses both how a person can develop grit and how grit can be taught to others. Her primary focus is on how to raise gritty kids, but her insights apply to adults as well, and many of her discussions involve people who developed grit later in life.

### What Is Grit?

Duckworth formulated the idea of grit after noticing that talent and luck were incomplete explanations for success in a variety of fields, including the military, sales, business, and sports. In each of these, people who showed early potential sometimes dropped out and some successful people didn’t start off showing the most promise.

Duckworth noticed that the one characteristic that the successful people had in common that distinguished them from the non-successful was _grit_ , which she defines as **a personality trait combining _perseverance_ and _passion_. **

  * **_Perseverance_ means having resilience: **It’s the ability to overcome setbacks, work hard, and finish things rather than give up.****
  * **_Passion_ means having direction: **It’s the ability to adhere to a goal over the long term and maintain your interest level, as opposed to changing your goal mercurially.



> **Is Grit Different From Conscientiousness?**
> 
> Critics of Duckworth’s book contend that _grit_ is not a new concept, but instead is merely a deep exploration of conscientiousness, a long-known and well-acknowledged personality trait. Conscientiousness is one of the Big Five personality traits used by psychologists to predict how a person will react to life and to adversity. (The other four traits are openness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.)
> 
> Conscientiousness describes the tendency to be responsible, organized, persistent, goal-oriented, and self-controlled. Duckworth has argued that grit differs from conscientiousness in that it also incorporates _passion_ —the adherence to high-level, long-term goals—rather than just short-term commitment to goals. Thus she describes grit as not just resilience—the ability to bounce back from setbacks—but also loyalty to goals over many years.
> 
> However, some researchers have had difficulty finding distinctions between grit and conscientiousness even with this explanation, and have concluded that they’re essentially the same thing and have the same influence on a person’s success. These psychologists contend that both grit and conscientiousness describe a tendency to work hard toward goals, and any distinction that accounts for long-term goals is moot, because people who work hard naturally accomplish long-term goals.

Duckworth contends that gritty people constantly see themselves as never good enough. They’re never complacent with where they are. Yet they’re not miserable—gritty people are **content being discontented**. They work on things of great interest to them, and the idea of giving up rarely crosses their mind. This is what brings them success.

> **Getting Comfortable With Discomfort Leads to Success**
> 
> Other experts agree that discomfort is not an inherently bad thing, because it can inspire you to improve your situation. For example, Frank Yoo, who served as director of design at, among others, Google, Lyft, and Coinbase, has discussed his relationship with discomfort as a positive one. He observes that when you feel frustrated or anxious, it’s your mind and body telling you that you need to grow. He relates periods in his career when he had a choice to either keep using a skill set that he’d already mastered or to start learning a new, more difficult one, and he chose to take on the difficult one. He attributes his success to always choosing to take on a challenge.
> 
> Yoo recommends that you actively seek out challenges that make you uncomfortable so that you constantly push your limits. In doing so, he notes that you might initially feel some _imposter syndrome_ —where you doubt your abilities and feel like a fraud—but that this reaction fades with experience.

#### Research on Grit

In forming her theories, Duckworth conducted many studies measuring the predictive power of grit on success. In one of her earliest, she examined newly admitted West Point cadets, looking for personality characteristics that might predict which candidates would complete the school’s rigorous programs and which would not.

She focused on the admissions program, an intense, seven-week boot camp after which one in 20 cadets typically dropped out of the academy. For her study, Duckworth had the cadets fill out a questionnaire before they started the program, from which she calculated a grit score. After the program, Duckworth looked back to the questionnaire to see whether it predicted which cadets had stuck with the program and which had dropped out.

She also examined the cadets’ admissions scores that the school used to admit them to the academy in the first place. Admissions criteria considered SAT scores, high school rank, physical ability, and leadership potential (participation in academic clubs and sports).

Duckworth notes that the admissions criteria heavily weighted natural attributes of intelligence and physical fitness. In contrast, her questionnaire measured persistence and passion—grit. She found that the school’s admission criteria couldn’t accurately predict who would drop out, but her grit questionnaire predicted completion better than any other predictor.

Additionally, she found that grit had little relationship to IQ score, suggesting the two factors are independent. Further, grit was able to predict success even after accounting for IQ, meaning it contributes to success above and beyond IQ.

Her research found similar results in many other studies:

  * Grit predicts the retention of salespeople better than other personality traits like conscientiousness or extroversion.
  * Adults who complete graduate degrees have higher grit.
  * Children who perform better in spelling bees showed higher grit scores. 



> **Counterpoint: IQ Can Sometimes Better Predict Test Scores**
> 
> Critics of Duckworth point to studies that indicate the opposite conclusion: that IQ has a greater influence on success. A large study in England found that grit only accounted for 0.5% of the success of students taking the GCSE exams—comprehensive exams evaluating a student’s mastery of a particular subject at the end of secondary school. Intelligence mattered far more, accounting for 40% of the outcome.
> 
> Researchers concluded that grit doesn’t in fact matter to academic success, and that the current preoccupation with grit inspired by Duckworth’s book is misguided. They then advised that schools drop their grit-focused curriculums.
> 
> However, Duckworth does acknowledge that intelligence counts highly on tests like SATs. Her argument, though, is that for success _beyond_ tests—success in an overall professional or academic career—grit is a better predictor of achievement than intelligence.
> 
> The studies referenced above support this argument. The West Point program favors not just people who can intellectually and physically meet its challenges, but also those who can _endure_ through the hardships of the program. The fact that salespeople with longevity have grit shows that grit matters over the course of a career—while intelligence or talent may _get_ you a job, it’s grit that will keep you in it. Same goes for people working toward graduate degrees.
> 
> The case of the children in spelling bees brings up a nuance of the theory, though. Duckworth’s studies show that successful spelling bee contestants study longer and more effectively than contestants who aren’t as successful. This clearly points to grit, but other studies, as noted above, have shown that _test taking_ is influenced by intelligence more than grit. Spelling bees are a test. So why does grit matter here more than intelligence?
> 
> It may have to do with the type of test that these are—spelling bees are less about reasoning and more about straightforward memorization. They might, therefore, be more influenced by how many hours a person spends reviewing spellings than by intelligence alone.

#### Historical Attitude Toward Grit

Duckworth notes that historically, high-achieving people have been known to be dogged in their pursuit of achievement, and that in eras past, people often spoke more highly of hard work than exceptional intelligence. Charles Darwin commented that “men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.” Darwin himself was considered to be of above-average, but not extraordinary, intelligence, but he persisted stubbornly in tackling a problem well after others had already moved on.

Duckworth points to a 1926 study of accomplished figures from history in which Catharine Cox, a psychologist from Stanford, inferred their IQs from their accomplishments and categorized the most eminent geniuses and the least eminent geniuses. The “most eminent geniuses” (Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton) had an average IQ of 146, and the “least eminent geniuses” (Giuseppe Mazzini, Joachim Murat) had an average IQ of 143. So IQ didn’t distinguish these two groups, but “persistence of motive” did. Cox found that people with **high enough intelligence, combined with strong persistence, achieved more than the smartest people with less persistence**.

> **Grit Separates the Good From the Great**
> 
> Duckworth notes that Cox concludes that overall, these highly accomplished historical figures are on average, smarter than most of us today, and she says that this is no surprise—the work that each of these people did required intelligence. Again, this points to the nuance of Duckworth’s arguments: Duckworth acknowledges the importance of intelligence but contends that it is insufficient to explain success alone. Her theories outline the missing ingredient in success if a person has all the other requisite characteristics: intelligence, physical ability, talent, and so on.
> 
> We can assume that throughout history, there have been many people who were born with high intelligence, talent, and physical ability, but only a few achieved accomplishments on the level of those whom Cox studied. Duckworth's theories attempt to explain this: While innate ability might give some people an advantage over other people, grit is what separates the good from the great among those who are born with the natural capabilities to succeed.

### Natural Talent Versus Purposeful Effort

Duckworth contends that even though people generally acknowledge the importance of hard work and perseverance, we have underlying biases that cause us to feel talent is more important.

She notes that we’re often not consciously aware of these biases. When surveyed directly, Americans are more likely to point to hard work as the key to success, rather than talent. But when asked indirectly, we tend to show a “naturalness bias” toward talent rather than persistence.

For example, if researchers ask participants to describe the traits they’d most want in a hypothetical worker, they usually emphasize “hard working” over “naturally skilled.” However, when presented with two hypothetical candidates, they more often choose the one described as having a higher IQ than the one with a stronger resumé of experience.

> **The Origin of Our Bias Toward Talent**
> 
> The _naturalness bias_ that Duckworth explores here probably evolved as a way to save mental and physical energy. We assume a _smarter_ candidate will be easier to train, even if another candidate is already more highly trained, and therefore we believe the naturally talented one will save us time and energy in the future. We thus discount the _proven_ grit of a candidate in favor of another’s unproven potential.
> 
> The human mind has evolved many such biases—shortcuts of thinking that help us make decisions. There are solid, evolutionary reasons for these shortcuts (also called _heuristics_). If we had to spend time fully analyzing every choice we’re presented with, we wouldn’t survive: We’re primed to think certain things look dangerous, for example, so that we can quickly respond to threats before they get the better of us.
> 
> However, our biases can mislead us. This is because biases are emotion-based, and bypass our rational mind in order to make decisions. Psychologists have long noted how these biases can lead us to, for example, misjudge risk, and therefore bet on a hot stock without fully researching it because _everyone else is buying it_ —only to lose money when it tanks. The same is true when they lead us to choose a naturally talented candidate over one with proven grit, even if the gritty candidate is a less-risky choice because of their track record.

#### Why We Focus on Talent

Duckworth explores some reasons that people tend to idolize talent and credit success to natural ability.

First, she notes that when you see a successful person, you see the end result of long-term practice and perseverance. However, since you haven’t seen that hard work in progress, but instead only see the end result, it’s easy to misattribute the success to innate ability. For example, if you watch a highly skilled athlete in action, you might think to yourself what a “natural” that person is, but in reality, what you’re seeing is the accumulated result of years of hard work.

> **We Also Mistake Luck for Talent**
> 
> In his book _Fooled by Randomness_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb agrees with Duckworth that people tend to wrongly credit success to innate talent. He argues, though, that what we’re overlooking when we do so is the hidden effect of _luck_ , not necessarily hard work or persistence.
> 
> His argument assumes that many people have equal talent, skill, intelligence, _and persistence_. He maintains that what separates such equally matched people is the random effect of fortune. For example, two start-ups, both of which are run by intelligent and talented people, might have very different success trajectories if one of them gets an early contract for their product, leading to other contracts and additional business. Both companies started with equal advantages, but a bit of early luck put one on a more successful path.
> 
> Taleb does concur with Duckworth’s emphasis on hard work in some respects, though. While he focuses his discussions primarily on “wild” successes, such as becoming a superstar CEO or making a huge fortune in the stock market, he does note that run-of-the-mill success, such as developing a career as a doctor, lawyer, or teacher, depends on hard work and perseverance. For that reason, he advises his readers to aim for ordinary success, and to avoid, for example, investment trading.

Second, Duckworth references the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who argued that we characterize other people as geniuses out of a self-protective instinct. Nietzsche believed that we mythologize natural talent because it excuses our failures: **If innate talent is the primary contributor to success, we won’t feel as bad about ourselves when we see high achievers**. We won’t feel we’re to blame for our failures if those failures are inevitable—if we can say, “No matter how hard I worked, I wouldn’t be able to do what that person does.”

Duckworth strongly disagrees with this fatalistic view, arguing instead that not only is grit the important factor in success, but also that (as we’ll discuss later) grit is learnable and trainable.

> **In Defense of a Fatalistic View**
> 
> It might be said that there is some value in honestly evaluating your innate strengths and weaknesses so that you have a realistic opinion of your own potential. If you’re considering going into a field where only the superstars survive—for example, professional sports or academia at an Ivy League school—you might save yourself some heartbreak (not to mention years of effort) if you honestly assess from the start that you might not be cut out for it.
> 
> Janet Lowe discusses the advantages of this attitude in _Damn Right_ , her biography of Charles Munger (_Poor Charlie’s Almanack)_, Warren Buffett’s right-hand-man at Berkshire Hathaway. She relates that in college, Munger considered becoming a physics professor, but after watching the skill of his existing professors, he decided that he didn’t innately have what it takes to be as good as they were, and that he didn’t want to enter a profession that he couldn’t dominate. Instead, he made a name for himself as an investment trader.
> 
> It’s worth noting, though, that this attitude of “If I can’t be the best, why bother” only applies to fields that support just a select few people at the very top. In other fields where success is more evenly distributed among a wider swath of people, a person can achieve a decent level of success even without becoming a superstar—for example, there are countless doctors, lawyers, teachers, and corporate positions in which a person might be successful without becoming _the very best worker ever_.

#### The Drawbacks of Focusing on Talent

Duckworth argues that overemphasizing the importance of talent can lead to a number of problems, both in our own individual lives and in a larger organization.

In our individual lives, it can **bias us against hard-working but less talented people who could end up achieving even more** by leading us to ignore other important personal traits that contribute to success, like grit.

(Shortform note: This recalls our discussion of heuristics, in which we make emotion-driven short-cut decisions that ignore more rational analysis. This shows another way that such biases can hurt us—by causing us to miss out on opportunities that can help us or our company down the road. In this case, the missed opportunity would be a qualified person who might either contribute to our business’s success or might help us personally in our career.)

**It can also make us place a cap on our own potential.** Duckworth discusses several cases where a child who was placed in lower-level classes comes to believe that they’re not capable of achieving anything significant, only to discover later in life that they’re perfectly capable after all, if they face challenges with zeal and great effort.

(Shortform note: Duckworth’s anecdotal findings align with research showing that children with a positive, “I can do this” attitude outperformed others with a more negative, cautious attitude in math tests. Researchers theorize this is because a positive attitude shields a person from anxiety, which can decrease performance, and also primes a brain into “ready” mode, so that it’s poised to tackle challenges.)

In addition, within an organization, **a focus on innate talent can cause a toxic and unproductive work environment.** Duckworth discusses the insights of Malcolm Gladwell, who argues that an over-focus on talent mindset in the workplace creates a narcissistic culture where people are pushed to prove they’re smarter than everyone else.

Enron, the energy company that imploded under the weight of its false claims in 2001, exemplified this type of workplace. The company emphasized superstar talent so much that it fired the bottom 15% of performers annually, regardless of their actual performance. This culture led to an emphasis on the _appearance_ of competence over actual substance, and an obsession with short-term gains that looked immediately impressive, rather than long-term gains that took years to manifest. Ultimately, this led to a workforce that made poor decisions, resulting in the downfall of the company. (Shortform note: Read more about the rise and fall of Enron in our summary of _The Smartest Guys in the Room_.)

> **A Focus on Talent Can Create Perverse Incentives**
> 
> An automatic-firing policy like the one that Enron pursued can lead to a dysfunctional workplace by incentivizing people to try to keep their jobs in ways that ultimately harm the company.
> 
> Enron’s policy was a management technique based on the so-called _vitality curve_ , sometimes called “rank and yank.” Popularized by Jack Welch in the 1980s at General Electric, the principle was to sort workers into three groups: The top 20% were the best performers and would be given the best perks, the middle 70% were the adequate workers and would be offered minimal rewards, and the bottom 10% would be fired. The practice was adopted by a number of prominent firms including Motorola, IBM, Yahoo, and Amazon in an effort to winnow their workforce down to only the best, most naturally talented employees.
> 
> Many companies abandoned the practice after finding it caused employees to focus on internal competition over anything else. Microsoft, for example, abandoned the system after finding **it led people to avoid working with talented people** so they wouldn’t be ranked against them, and **it led supervisors to keep less skilled people on their teams** to protect their more skilled workers from being cut. The practice has been credited as a leading factor that brought about a “lost decade” for the company in the early 2000s where employees were more concerned with keeping their jobs than being innovative.

#### How Effort Affects Success

Duckworth lays out her theory of grit in a quasi-mathematical equation that encapsulates why effort matters so much:

  * **skill = effort x talent**
  * **achievement = effort x skill**



In this formula, skill is created by applying effort to talent. Then, achievement is created by applying effort to that skill. In this way, effort factors in twice—**it increases talent, and then it increases the application of that talent**.

This means that between two people who work equally hard, the one with more talent will improve faster. But between two people of equal skill, the person who works harder will achieve more.

Another way to look at this formula would be:

  * **achievement = effort x (effort x talent)** , or: **achievement = talent x effort 2**



Framing the equation this way allows us to graph it mathematically, giving us a simplistic model of how much a person might achieve based on inputs of talent and effort:

![grit_effort_graph.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/grit_effort_graph.png)

In this model, line A represents the achievement of someone with twice the talent of line B. When they both put in an effort level 1, Person A achieves twice as much as Person B. However, if Person A stops there and puts in no more effort, but Person B continues putting in effort, B can achieve twice as much as A, even though A has twice the talent.

This model has several implications:

  * Someone of lower talent can catch up in skill level by applying effort.
  * Even if someone never catches up in skill level, they can still achieve more by applying effort.



Consider an analogy: a low-talent painter, who is aware of the limits of her talent, works to improve her skill by taking lots of classes and creating many paintings. A higher-talent painter may start off making better paintings, but if she assumes her innate talent will propel her to success, she may put in less effort. After one year, the higher-talent painter might be making better paintings, but after two or three years, the lower-talent painter may eclipse her, and end up making better paintings and having a more successful career.

The same concept may apply to academics, athletics, career, and even social relationships.

> **Reading Between the Lines: Talent Still Matters**
> 
> This graph points to two nuances of Duckworth’s theories:
> 
>   * First, it counters critics who say Duckworth discounts the importance of natural talent.
> 
>   * Second, it implies that given equal effort, _talent matters a lot_.
> 
> 

> 
> Some critics of Duckworth point out that there are many highly talented people who’ve eclipsed the success of others who put in more effort, calling into question how important effort actually is. One famous example is long-reigning top chess master Magnus Carlsen, sometimes called the “Mozart of chess.” One study estimated the number of hours of deliberate practice he’s likely engaged in over his lifetime and concluded he’s practiced fewer hours than others who’d been less successful, refuting Duckworth’s insights.
> 
> However, Duckworth never argues that talent is irrelevant. Her formula above for predicting skill argues that effort counts twice where talent counts once—but _talent does count._
> 
> What Duckworth’s equation shows, even if she doesn’t explicitly mention it, is that if Person A has outsized talent and also puts in a lot of effort, they can achieve more than Person B if Person B puts in equal effort—or even if Person B puts in just a bit more effort.
> 
> To illustrate this, let’s examine the case of Carlsen. The authors of the study examining him argue that because he started playing chess at age eight while others often start at age four or five, Duckworth’s theories are wrong—he’s put in fewer hours over his lifetime but had more success.
> 
> However, it shouldn’t be overlooked that _Carlsen started playing chess seriously at age eight_. He didn’t, for example, merely take up chess in college. Over the course of a career that stretches into adulthood, the time that his rivals may have devoted to their craft might not be significantly more than his—not enough to overcome their lesser talent, given that he, by wide agreement, is _exceptionally_ talented.
> 
> In fact, Duckworth herself would probably not dispute the study’s final conclusion, which states that _deliberate practice by itself will not bring about high levels of performance_. Nowhere in _Grit_ does she say differently—what she argues is that talent can’t make up for a _lack_ of effort, and that given equal talent, effort is the key to success.
> 
> This illustrates a common theme in criticisms of her work. Her theories have been popularly misconstrued as arguing that effort alone is what matters, and that talent plays no part in success. However, her theories can be more accurately understood as disputing the popular notion of the naturally talented person who effortlessly stumbles into success.
