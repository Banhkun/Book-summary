## Part 2.2: Stage 2: Practice

Duckworth notes that while hard work is crucial to success, it doesn’t _guarantee_ success. The _type_ of hard work matters. It needs to be **_deliberate practice_ : a structured, purposeful, and disciplined way to direct your efforts so that they produce real results.**

Instead of just repeatedly doing the same actions, you must strive to get better each time you do it. This, she says, is the hallmark of successful people: a desire to improve on their existing expertise.

Duckworth cites psychologist Anders Ericsson’s development of the theories of deliberate practice. Ericsson popularized the idea that to become an expert, you need to invest roughly 10 years of hard work or 10,000 hours into a pursuit. But his key insight, according to Duckworth, is that the _type_ of practice matters more than the _amount_.

> **The Debate on Deliberate Practice**
> 
> Ericsson outlines his theories in his book _Peak_ , in which he explores how peak performers in any field develop their abilities. He falls squarely into the “effort over talent” camp, arguing that anyone can become an expert in any field they choose through deliberate practice. He argues more strongly than Duckworth that talent makes little difference to success, and that mastery of a skill can be almost entirely explained by practice.
> 
> His theories have sparked years of debate. While Ericsson estimates that deliberate practice accounts for around 80% of the difference between high performers and mediocre ones, subsequent studies by other researchers concluded that practice time can only account for 20% to 25% of the difference, and that natural talent is the much larger influence on mastery of a skill. Ericsson counters that those studies don’t differentiate between _deliberate_ practice and other, more casual, practice, which explains the contradictory conclusions.
> 
> Critics note that at lower levels of performance, practice might matter more because, among people of equally average intelligence and talent, practice can be the thing that sets them above their competitors. However, at the highest levels of performance, innate abilities like intelligence or natural talent make the true difference between great performers and _the greatest_ performers, because at a certain level of performance, everyone is practicing the same amount—a lot.
> 
> The debate recalls our earlier discussion where Duckworth notes that effort counts for twice talent, meaning that given equal talent, the harder-working person will go further. However, implicit in this analysis is the suggestion that given equal _effort_ , the more talented person will go further. The problem seems to be in identifying how much talent will make up for effort, and vice versa.

### How to Practice Deliberately

To properly engage in deliberate practice, Duckworth recommends the following process:

  * **Set a stretch goal:** Focus on a specific, narrow aspect of your larger goal that you want to improve. (Shortform note: Researchers point out in the _Harvard Business Review_ that stretch goals are motivating—when it comes to teamwork, people find challenging goals more appealing and perceive them as more attainable than lesser goals.)
  * **Give that goal undivided attention:** Concentrate and focus on reaching that goal. Practice in solitude, without the assistance of other people. (Shortform note: Cal Newport advises scheduling regular, uninterrupted time to accomplish intensely focused work, which he calls _Deep Work_. Then you must use that time productively by measuring your progress and holding yourself accountable.)
  * **Seek feedback:** Ask for advice or have someone evaluate how you’re doing. Be more interested in what you did _wrong_ than what you did _right_. 
  * **Reflect on that feedback:** Ask yourself what the feedback is telling you—what are you doing correctly? What are you doing wrong?
  * **Continue to give your stretch goal undivided attention until you’ve hit it.**
  * **Set a new stretch goal.**



Note how deliberate and goal-oriented this process is, compared to merely putting in time absent-mindedly and going through the motions.

> **How Important Is Feedback to the Process?**
> 
> As Duckworth notes, endless practice does not lead to success if you’re not practicing deliberately. Other experts further caution that endless practice can actually _prevent_ success if you simply repeat the same (wrong) techniques. Duckworth mentions seeking feedback as part of the process of practicing correctly but she doesn’t explore it deeply. However, other thinkers on the subject identify _feedback_ as a central piece of the process, arguing that you can’t improve without it.
> 
> In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen contend, like Duckworth, that people can only achieve success through conscious and purposeful effort toward specific, measurable goals. They then zero in on feedback, arguing that unless you accept and incorporate other peoples’ criticisms and direction, you can’t achieve success.
> 
> They note that we all have certain triggers that compel us to ignore feedback we don’t want to hear, and they argue that in order to successfully incorporate feedback, we need to recognize these triggers so that we can stop them from driving our thoughts and actions. The divide triggers into three categories:
> 
>   * Truth triggers, where you feel the feedback is incorrect
> 
>   * Relationship triggers, where you don’t want to hear the feedback from that particular person
> 
>   * Identity triggers, where the feedback threatens your sense of who you are
> 
> 

> 
> By becoming consciously aware of these triggers, you can prevent them from controlling your emotions, and you’ll be better able to effectively judge a piece of feedback. Then you can properly reflect on the feedback (as Duckworth also advises) and incorporate it into your life and work in a way that makes your efforts more effective.

### Three Levels of Engagement With an Interest

Duckworth identifies three levels on which a person can engage with their interest. Deliberate practice is just one of those levels, but, she argues, it’s the only level where a person will improve a skill. The three levels are:

  1. **Play:** A person has fun with their interest. A tennis player might bounce the ball around with a friend. A swimmer might play in the pool.
  2. **Testing:** They quiz themselves. A tennis player might challenge his coach to a game. A swimmer might race a friend.
  3. **Deliberate practice:** They engage with their interest using the deliberate practice steps outlined in the section above—setting a stretch goal, striving for it, listening to feedback, incorporating feedback, conquering their goal, and then setting another. 



The first level, play, is too casual an interaction with a skill to see improvement. It’s akin to playing pickup football with your friends every day because you enjoy it—you might do this every day for years, but if you only play in a casual, fun way, you’re not going to get truly good at football.

The second level is useful for figuring out where your weaknesses lie so that you can address them. But you won’t improve a skill just by testing it unless you also move on to the third level.

The third level is where actual improvement happens. She notes that without this third level, deliberate practice, you can put countless hours toward a pursuit but never achieve mastery.

Duckworth cautions that deliberate practice isn’t “fun.” People describe deliberate practice as effortful and tiring. After engaging in deliberate practice, people usually need to rest—some even take naps. She advises that it’s difficult to do more than one hour of deliberate practice at a time, and that most people can’t do more than three to five hours in one day.

> **Counterpoints: Play and Testing Might Be Just as Valuable**
> 
> Some experts disagree with Duckworth and argue that play and testing actually do lead to improvements in skills.
> 
> Many thought leaders have noted that breakthroughs often happen when a person is playing. In his biography of physicist Richard Feynman, _Genius_ , James Gleick relates how Feynman had an “aha” moment while playing with cafeteria plates that led to the development of his Nobel Prize-winning theory in quantum electrodynamics. Feynman would often turn to play by purposefully putting himself into a childlike mindset of exploration and fun when he was struggling with a difficult challenge, as it was often in those moments that he would make progress.
> 
> Other experts likewise argue that testing is, in fact, a valuable skill-building tool because it requires students to recall information they’ve learned, the act of which reinforces that information and commits it to long-term memory (psychologists call this the “testing effect”). Research shows that when prompted to regurgitate information, students master that knowledge much more quickly than other students who engage in straight study without being quizzed. In other words, the testing itself has a beneficial effect on a person’s mastery of a subject, not just because it points out weaknesses, but because it encourages the formation of long-term memory.
> 
> These competing schools of thought might be reconciled if we view the three levels of engagement as pieces of the same holistic process. Play not only inspires interest and leads to deliberate practice, but it also can act as the “rest” Duckworth mentions that people often need after a period of deliberate practice. Likewise, testing can serve as a form of feedback, which Duckworth notes is a crucial element of deliberate practice—or even a form of play, as it can be fun to flex your skills.
> 
> Through this lens, we can view Feynman’s playful period not as an alternative to deliberate practice, but as a part of it. After all, Feynman didn’t _exclusively_ play, but rather, punctuated his larger, more concentrated efforts with short periods of play. But otherwise, and for the most part, Feynman engaged in very focused work, spending endless hours visualizing algebraic problems and studying theories of physics.
> 
> Similarly, the students in the study who more readily mastered their subject after being quizzed on it did so within a framework of deliberate practice. They weren’t substituting practice for testing but instead were supplementing it.
> 
> We can thus detect a nuance in Duckworth’s theory, which is that deliberate practice is even more effective when allowed to stray from its “deliberate” framework. To truly harness the full benefits of deliberate practice, it’s likely that we must occasionally engage in alternate activities, allowing our minds to fully process the time we spend in regulated activity.

#### Make Practice a Habit

To get the most benefit from deliberate practice, Duckworth advises that you **make deliberate practice a regular habit**.

To make developing the habit easier, find an environment in which you most enjoy deliberate practice. This might be a place, but it also might be a _time_ —for example, maybe you enjoy working out in your living room, first thing in the morning, before your kids wake up.

Then, she encourages you to commit to deliberate practice in that environment every day. This will help you engage in your deliberate practice automatically without thinking about it.

> **How to Form Positive Habits**
> 
> Most experts agree that forming new habits can be difficult, but there are techniques that can help. In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear argues that you can achieve your goals when you adopt small, measurable, consistent changes—habits—instead of trying to achieve a major change with a massive expenditure of effort.
> 
> He explores how to establish good habits, and explains that one of the best ways to do so is to pre-plan an action and schedule it to be triggered by either a time or a place. For example, instead of saying “I will exercise more,” say “I will do 10 push-ups at 7 in the morning,” or “I will do 20 jumping jacks when I enter the basement.” When the time or place rolls around, your brain will be cued to implement the action. After a time, it will become a habit.
> 
> To apply this technique to deliberate practice, you might not only plan the time and place of your practice, but also plan a stretch goal: “I will advance to the next page once I’ve mastered the notes on this one three times with no mistakes.”
> 
> You might even plan your emotional reaction to setbacks, in order to encourage positive feelings about your practice: “When I mess up for the third time in a row, I will remind myself that mistakes are how I learn.”

#### Accept the Difficulty

Duckworth also advises that in order to get in a habit of regular practice, you should change how you feel about it. Rather than viewing its difficultness negatively, see it as simply a part of the process. Duckworth notes that children start off with this attitude—when toddlers learn to walk, they keep trying and fall over, but they don’t get discouraged. Later, when adults start giving feedback that failure is bad, the child might start feeling anxiety about deliberate practice. To rewire this tendency, Duckworth advises that you embrace difficulty—relish how hard a session was, and how proud you are that you’ve improved: “That was tough! I feel great!”

(Shortform note: Psychologists have long recommended that to conquer challenges, you view them as opportunities. This reduces stress—seeing a burden in a positive light makes it less intimidating—and it helps you formulate solutions because you see a hardship as something to be overcome and moved past, rather something to be lived with on a permanent basis, which encourages your brain to look for fixes.)

### Deliberate Practice Versus Flow

Duckworth then explores how deliberate practice relates to and differs from the state of “flow,” which is a mental state in which you feel fully immersed in your activity and can perform it almost flawlessly. Athletes and performers describe flow as an automatic performance done without thinking and without excessive effort. People who experience it describe it as enjoyable and energizing.

Some thinkers, Duckworth says, argue that mastery is not demonstrated by deliberate practice but instead by the ability to enter a state of flow. This debate matters because it offers a contradiction: While deliberate practice is difficult and painful, flow feels easy and enjoyable. How can both be a marker of expertise but feel so different?

Duckworth concludes, however, that there’s actually no conflict. During deliberate practice, your challenges exceed your current skills, which is why it feels difficult and disagreeable. During flow, your skills meet your challenges, so you can perform your task with ease and mastery. They are two different states—deliberate practice is about preparation, while flow is about performance. Deliberate practice leads to flow.

An example of this would be a gymnast who toils through deliberate practice to perfect her jumps and spins. Then, during her performance, she enters a state of flow—she’s trained for that moment, her skills meet her current challenges, and she’s able to perform her task automatically and without thinking.

> **Flow Is Part of the Process**
> 
> Duckworth’s discussion of flow is based on the theories of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who outlines the concept in his book _Flow_. Csikszentmihalyi says that flow is a state you enter into when you’ve mastered your skills. It’s an optimal experience that gives you a sense of control and purpose. Because of these feelings, you remember flow experiences positively even if they’re difficult—for example, even though a marathon runner may endure muscle cramps and fatigue, she feels good about the experience.
> 
> Csikszentmihalyi notes that flow has a cyclical nature: You enter it as you master a set of skills, then repeat those skills until they become easy, then you become bored at which time you exit flow and no longer have the sense of control and purpose. To achieve flow again, you need to set your goals higher and master a new set of skills. Then the process repeats.
> 
> Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow clearly dovetails with Duckworth’s concepts of deliberate practice and setting new stretch goals as you attain old ones. While Csikszentmihalyi focuses his discussion on the _performance_ aspect of mastery, Duckworth focuses on the _preparation_ element. But Csikszentmihalyi’s theories of flow are intimately connected to Duckworth’s theories of practice, as the second enables the first. It might be said that once you’ve achieved flow, you’ll know that it’s time to set a new stretch goal.
