## Part 2.3: Stage 3: Purpose

The next element of grit Duckworth examines is _purpose_ , which she defines as **a desire to increase the well-being of others.** Along with interest, purpose is essential to passion because purpose enables interests to survive over long periods. Passion may start with interest, but it survives with purpose.

Purpose corresponds to the “high-level goals” Duckworth discusses in her exploration of passion in the first part of the book. These are the goals at the very top, for which you can’t provide an answer to the question “Why?” What makes these high-level goals special—what makes them a purpose—is that they have a focus other than self-interest. When Duckworth questions a gritty person about their high-level goals, they inevitably mention other people, either in specifics (like their children or customers) or through an abstract concept (like society, country, or science).

She notes that some people might object that grit and purpose conflict with each other—grit means working toward your own goals while purpose means working for the good of others. However, Duckworth counters that purpose is crucial to grit because it sustains both passion (when you feel you’re helping others, you care more about your goals) and perseverance (you fight harder for goals that you care more about).

Importantly, she notes that purpose alone is not enough to create grit—**purpose must be paired with interest in order to motivate you to work harder**. For example, imagine you instinctively like to organize things. If you have a strong desire to help others (purpose) and you take a job as an office manager (which appeals to your interest in organization), you’ll be more likely to work hard (helping the office to run smoothly) than you would if you took a job in something that doesn’t interest you even if it also served the purpose of helping others—say, for example, rescuing abused animals, if that wasn’t something that grabbed your attention.

> **Aligning Your Actions and Emotions With Your Purpose**
> 
> Having a purpose is important not only for professional success but also for personal fulfilment and happiness. Some experts advise that if you are having trouble or conflict in your life, you can resolve it by examining it closely to see where your actions and desires are misaligned with your ultimate purpose.
> 
> For example, in his book _The 12 Rules for Life_ , Jordan Peterson suggests that if you are upset because you want something you can’t have, ask yourself _why_ you want that thing and _why_ you feel that way, and continue asking until you’ve arrived at the core desire that’s driving your discontent.
> 
> For example, if you want your boss’s job, ask yourself why. You may come up with a number of answers, each of which has a unique _why_ behind it:
> 
>   * You want more money. Why?
> 
>     * Because you want to provide for your family.
> 
>     * Because money makes you feel valued and recognized.
> 
>   * You want a higher title. Why?
> 
>     * Because a higher title has more status.
> 
>     * Because a higher title allows you to direct decisions more, which will allow you to do more good in the world.
> 
>   * You want to “beat” your boss.
> 
>     * You feel you’re a better employee than your boss.
> 
>     * You feel life is unfair and that you deserve it and your boss doesn’t.
> 
> 

> 
> (This is similar to the process Duckworth outlined to help you find your true purpose—to keep asking _why_ until you’ve reached the end of your _whys_.)
> 
> Then, once you’ve outlined all your _whys_ , you can evaluate which ones are most important to you. Think about which correspond to Duckworth’s ideas of selfish, pleasure-seeking goals and which ones align with meaningful, purpose-driven goals.
> 
> You might not have even been consciously aware of all of your whys in detail until you take the time to examine them, but once you do, you can either confront those that don’t align with your overall purpose in life, or you can figure out another way to achieve that purpose. For example, maybe you decide that your bitterness about life being unfair doesn’t align with your goal to do good in the world—if so, you can work on letting that feeling go. Or, maybe you decide that you can better serve your goal to do good if you take on a different role or position in your company.
> 
> Either way, when you have consciously identified your purpose, you can better align your behaviors with it and will be better positioned to find happiness and fulfillment.

### Purpose Is Instinctive

Duckworth notes that seeking a purpose is one of two ways that people find happiness. The other is seeking pleasure. Pleasure is self-centered happiness, while purpose is outward-benefiting happiness.

She argues that both of these are important because each increases our chances of survival: We seek _pleasure_ because if we didn’t pursue things like food and sex, our species wouldn’t survive, and we seek _purpose_ because a cooperative species thrives more than individuals do on their own.

Different people place different values on each type of happiness—some prioritize pleasure over purpose, and some do the opposite. Duckworth’s studies conclude that gritty people value pleasure just as much as other people, but that they value _purpose_ far more than non-gritty people do.

(Duckworth acknowledges that there is a possible sample bias in her study, in that she only included people who work in ways that basically benefit others—she didn’t interview, for example, terrorists or despots, many of whom might well be gritty but are driven by selfish motives, or who might _say_ they strive to help others but kill millions of people in the process. Therefore she acknowledges that her theory that gritty people have more altruistic tendencies might overlook a swath of gritty people who don’t have such tendencies. However, she hypothesizes that these people are probably outliers, and that overall, the data showing most gritty people to have a heightened sense of purpose is accurate.)

> **Purpose Enables You to Evaluate Your Desires**
> 
> The conflict between the selfish and the altruistic drives in the human psyche is one of the most basic tensions we live with. How we reconcile this conflict determines in large part whether we achieve happiness and lasting success.
> 
> In his book _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , Jonathan Haidt proposes that the key to happiness is to distinguish between desires for _fleeting happiness and desires for lasting happiness_. Fleeting happiness comes from satisfying immediate, often physical needs. Lasting happiness comes from fulfilling your purpose.
> 
> Haidt argues that you can only be happy when you successfully direct your attention and energy to those desires that bring lasting benefits (through your purpose) while ignoring those that only bring temporary pleasure. To do this, he advises that you work to gain control over your emotional responses, which typically drive you toward fleeting desires, and instead aim to let your more rational, thinking side steer your actions.
> 
> He argues, further, that one of the most important sources of lasting happiness is an attitude of altruism. He notes that we’ve evolved to be altruistic because what benefits the group benefits us individually, and that studies consistently show that people who are more altruistic are happier.
> 
> He concludes, therefore, much as Duckworth does, that happiness is a product of finding a purpose in life that makes your work feel impactful, and that this is tied directly to an altruistic instinct by which we want to make the world a better place for others.

### Job Versus Career Versus Calling

Duckworth says that people generally fall into three categories, depending on whether they view their work as a job, a career, or a calling. Those who see their work as a calling have a purpose over and above those who don’t.

  * People who have **jobs** are interested only in the material benefits from work and don’t receive other rewards from it. The work is not an end in itself. (“I sell tires.”)
  * People who have **careers** have deeper personal investment and enjoy advancement within the organizational structure. (“I am a salesperson.”)
  * People who have **callings** find their work inseparable from their life—the work is personally fulfilling. (“I help people make the best decisions given their safety needs and their budgets.”)



Duckworth maintains that while some careers might more obviously lend themselves to a sense of purpose (for example, medicine or teaching), there are people in all walks of life and all fields who see deeper meaning behind their jobs. Even people performing mundane tasks, like window washing or bagging groceries, can find a purpose in their work—as an important part of city maintenance, for example, or as someone who makes customers’ lives a little easier and brightens their day.

People who feel purpose in their work show meaningful benefits:

  * They feel more satisfied with their jobs and lives overall.
  * They miss fewer days of work.
  * They’re more willing to work unpaid after hours.
  * They work more overtime per week.
  * They improve performance metrics, like the number of calls made or dollars raised, in fundraising calls.
  * Anecdotally, having purpose pushes you beyond normal obstacles. Because you’re working for a greater cause and are backed by all the people you want to help, you’re not afraid to pound on doors and doggedly pursue your goal. Whereas when you’re acting selfishly, you become self-conscious about barriers.



> **Purpose Helps Organizations as Well**
> 
> When you feel purpose in your work, you not only benefit your own success, but also that of your coworkers. Companies that adopt a purpose and encourage their workers to also adopt it consistently outpace companies that don’t work under a clearly defined purpose.
> 
> In their book _The Leadership Challenge_ , James Kouzes and Barry Posner argue that strong leadership starts by firmly establishing a purpose, and to do that, you need to first explicitly communicate your values—your own values as well as the values of the company. Your values are the lasting beliefs that drive your actions and guide you toward your goal.
> 
> They then argue that the next step in crafting strong leadership is to establish an inspirational goal—a positive vision of the future that engages people’s imaginations and emotions. They emphasize how important this is because in order to move forward, you must have a specific, purposeful vision of where you're going: You can’t judge what path to take if you don’t know your destination.
> 
> Both of these ideas expand on Duckworth’s insights on purpose. People who have callings rather than merely jobs or careers have strong values that inspire an ambitious, positive vision. This vision is the high-level goal she advises you to work toward. Organizations that establish this framework have happier, more motivated employees.

### How to Develop Purpose

Duckworth notes that while some people know their purpose early and shape their career around it, most successful people typically follow a three-part progression to purpose, and that, like interests, a sense of purpose often takes time to develop:

  1. People start by being attracted to an interest for self-centered reasons.
  2. They become proficient at this interest through self-discipline and practice.
  3. They begin to understand how their skills can benefit the world around them, and they start to prioritize other people’s needs.



(Shortform note: These phases correspond to the three stages of grit we’ve explored so far—finding an interest, becoming proficient through deliberate practice, and finally, integrating skill with a purpose. We can thus see that _purpose_ is an extension of _passion_ , and that passion leads to purpose as it matures. In fact, many experts advise that the two are intimately intertwined, and that a person will only be truly passionate about something that gives their lives purpose—for example, when Simon Sinek advises, as we previously discussed, that you adopt a Just Cause in your pursuit of success, he argues that the reason it’s important to do so is that having such a purpose will inspire passion, not only in yourself but in others around you.)

Duckworth argues that because purpose often develops through this predictable process, you can consciously nurture it in your existing profession, thus turning your current job into a calling without changing jobs. The key is in seeing your tasks not just as obligations that have to be done, or as opportunities that will lead to personal success, but instead, as something that will connect you to a greater good—a larger purpose that serves humanity.

She uses the example of a man who took a job as an entry-level engineer working on New York City’s subway system. At first he took the job because he needed rent money and he had no better plan, but he ended up becoming more and more interested in the work and started to look for ways to deepen his knowledge and skills. He eventually came to see his work as a vital part of the city, helping to keep the trains running. Once he saw how he was making a contribution to society, he started to view his work as a calling.

> **Do What You Love, or Love What You Do?**
> 
> Many people are familiar with the popular advice, often attributed to Confucius, of “Choose a job that you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life.” But some experts argue that the emphasis on finding what you love is overrated, and instead, you should figure out how to love what you do by finding _purpose_ in it.
> 
> In his book _Great Work_ , David Sturt observes that people are able to craft meaningful jobs out of every sort of career path, from janitors to engineers to chefs. **The trick is not in looking for what _you_ may get out of a job, but instead, looking for how you might benefit _others_ **through your job. He argues that this is because humans are hard-wired not only to look out for themselves, but also to care about other people, and that this can inspire greater motivation than simple interest in a field can.
> 
> As an example, he discusses hospital cleaning staff who find career satisfaction by seeing themselves not just as cleaners, but also as people who contribute to the patient experience. These workers find little ways to go above and beyond their job requirements that make a difference in people’s lives—for example, they might rearrange photos on a desk of a comatose patient to give him a change of scenery, or offer tissues to family members receiving difficult news.
> 
> Sturt argues that anyone can learn to find this sort of motivation in their current position if they adjust their mindset to see their work as more than just a set of requirements, and if they try to expand the reach of their job description to benefit others as well as themselves. He notes that with this mindset, people have found satisfaction and success in a wide range of fields, many of which they might not have set out to pursue based on a pre-existing passion.
> 
> For the most part, Duckworth advises that you pursue your intrinsic interests, but her ideas intersect with Sturt’s in this section when she notes that if you can’t feasibly do that, you can still find happiness by focusing on something you can love in your current pursuit.

#### Finding Purpose in Your Current Work

Duckworth discusses three techniques that can help you figure out how to find purpose in your current position.

**1\. Reflect on how the work you’re doing can positively contribute to society.**

Researchers asked students to connect what they were learning with how the world could be a better place. The one-time intervention took just one class period. Compared to a control group, students increased their GPA (from 1.9 to 2.1), doubled their time studying on practice questions, and completed more math questions.

**2\. Think about how you can change your current work to connect to your core values, even if just in small ways.**

The idea is that even if you don’t think of your job as particularly “purposeful,” you can still adjust your work practices to align with your interests and values. Duckworth discusses studies that show employees working in positions like sales and finance, who didn’t think of their positions as very purposeful, but were significantly happier and more motivated weeks after being asked to come up with ideas for changing their daily routines to make their work more meaningful.

**3\. Find a purposeful role model.**

Identify someone who inspires you to be a better person, and who acts on behalf of other people. This exemplar proves to you that it’s possible to be successful carrying a mission greater than yourself. In turn, this inspires your own belief that you can personally make a difference.

> **Purpose Leads to Motivation**
> 
> Daniel Pink explores how purpose affects motivation in his book _Drive_ , noting that overall, motivation comes from either extrinsic forces (like a desire for money or status) or intrinsic forces (like a desire for mastery or a purpose). He argues that people are naturally motivated by intrinsic desires (think of the way a child naturally tries to learn to walk), but that we are taught to value extrinsic desires through societal expectations, our schooling system, and our employment system.
> 
> He argues that people who are motivated primarily by intrinsic desires outperform those who are primarily motivated by extrinsic desires. They also have overall better mental and physical health. He notes that this doesn’t mean that intrinsically motivated people don’t also value things like money and status, but instead that they value things like responsibility and purpose more.
> 
> To improve your motivation, or to increase the motivation in your workplace, Pink advises you look outward and try to see how your work benefits others. Like Duckworth, he observes that people are wired to help others, and that they find purpose in doing so.
> 
> He therefore advises you to find the “why” behind your work (like Duckworth’s first recommendation above, to reflect on how your work contributes to society), and to see your work as a reflection of your values like honor, justice, or beauty (just as Duckworth asks you, in her second recommendation, to connect your work to your values).
> 
> Pink doesn’t directly discuss Duckworth’s third point above, about finding a mentor or role model. Instead, he offers slightly different advice—advice that applies particularly to raising children. He recommends that to help your kids develop purpose and motivation, you give them variations of adult responsibilities. This will foster a sense of ownership of their tasks and will encourage them to feel intrinsically motivated to work on them.
> 
> For example, you can have them work on a project of their choosing and have them set performance goals toward it. You can even give them performance reviews with specific feedback for improvement (as well as praise for things done well). This is essentially a reimagining of Duckworth’s role model idea—instead of advising you to find a role model for your kids, Pink advises encouraging children to become their own role model by modeling adult behavior.
