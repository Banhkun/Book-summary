## Part 2.1: The Four Stages of Grit

In Part 2, Duckworth identifies and explores four psychological assets that lead to grit. She thinks of these four elements as _stages_ in the development of grit, and argues that these stages build upon each other:

  * **_Interest_** is the first stage—without an interest in a skill or subject, a person won’t start down the path to mastery. 
  * **_Practice_** is the next stage—practice takes over once interest has evolved from _playful exploration_ into something more deliberate. 
  * **_Purpose_** comes next, after a person has achieved a certain level of mastery and can begin to look outward to figure out how their skill can benefit others. 
  * **_Hope_** , Duckworth argues, is not a final, separate stage, but rather, is a stage that accompanies the other three all the way through, because it fuels the other stages with a feeling of optimism and empowerment. 



> **Additional Elements of Grit**
> 
> Other psychologists studying grit have suggested additional psychological assets that make up a gritty mindset that Duckworth doesn't explicitly mention. Some have noted that a gritty attitude takes courage—the ability to triumph over fear. Others add ambition to the list, noting that ambition in this context doesn’t mean a desire for superiority but rather, a desire for excellence. Quite a few psychologists mention resilience—the ability to bounce back from failures.
> 
> Duckworth doesn’t address these items as separate elements of grit, but we can see how they relate to some of the stages she does define. For example, _courage_ , _ambition_ , and a _desire for excellence_ might be products of a _sense of purpose_. A _desire for excellence_ might also drive the motivation to _practice_ , and be driven itself by _interest_. _Resilience_ is implied in Duckworth’s concept of _hope_ , which, as we’ll discuss, is a belief in your ability to improve your situation.
> 
> Overall, then, Duckworth’s four stages outline a basic understanding of how grit develops, and they serve as a jumping-off point—a framework—for identifying other qualities that also drive a person to master a skill.

### Stage 1: Interest

Duckworth contends that grit starts with _interest_ because interest is the seed of _passion_ —a well-developed interest leads to a long-term commitment to a goal. Consistently, Duckworth observes that gritty people love what they do and they’re overjoyed to do it. They pursue projects not because they’re forced to or because they feel obliged to, but because they want to.

#### Why Is Interest Important?

Duckworth argues that interest is crucial for success for two reasons:

  1. You’ll be far more satisfied with your job if you’re interested in it, which means you’ll stick with it longer.
  2. You’ll perform your job better if you’re interested in it, which will lead to better outcomes. Employees who like their jobs earn more and rise higher. Students who like their studies get better grades. 



Essentially, **people who are not intrinsically interested in an activity will not work as hard or achieve as much as people who are.**

(Shortform note: For this reason, some psychologists contend that schools that try to teach grit focus too much on the _persistence_ piece of it, and should instead focus on fostering interest, as _interest_ is the foundation for perseverance over time. They argue that success is less dependent on a mere stick-to-it attitude and is more influenced by a person's intrinsic motivation—fueled by interest—and it’s the intrinsic motivation that creates a stick-to-it attitude.)

#### Interests Develop Over Time

Surveys suggest that only 13% of adults consider themselves engaged at work, indicating that most people aren’t working in the field of their greatest interest. Duckworth notes that this is not necessarily because they decide to work in a field different from what grabs their interests—she contends that most young people starting their careers need little encouragement to follow their interests. The real problem is that most young people don’t know exactly what their interests are yet.

Duckworth notes that there’s a common misunderstanding about how a person finds their interest. People expect they’ll find something that just clicks and will fall head-over-heels in love with an idea, skill, or subject and have a solid direction from then on. They also assume that successful people found their passion early and didn’t stray from that path.

However, Duckworth observes that finding your interest doesn’t usually happen like this. Instead, **people find their interest by exploring several areas of interest, choosing one, and cultivating it to the exclusion of other interests.**

She notes that:

  * **You shouldn’t expect to discover your interest early in life or right out of college**. Many people find their life’s work only after trying lots of different things.
  * **Interests rely on trying things and receiving more information.** You won’t arrive at your interest solely by introspection or by forcing yourself to like something.
  * **Interest deepens after engaging with an activity over time**. Through repeated exposure to your interest, you discover fascinating subtleties and facets that you would never find if you didn’t stick with it. 



Duckworth argues that eventually, your interests will fuel your desire for mastery, and you’ll be driven to continuously improve your skills in order to more effectively engage with your interest.

(Shortform note: In her book _The Defining Decade_ , psychologist Meg Jay says this is part of having a productive and useful _identity crisis_ —a process of figuring out who you are and what you should do with your life. She acknowledges that reflection is an essential part of having an identity crisis, but that people misunderstand the term and think it’s only about reflection, while the truly useful part is not mere _thinking_ , but _active doing_.)

> **Counterpoint: Should You Ignore Interest Entirely?**
> 
> While Duckworth recommends that you explore your interests to find one that drives you, Cal Newport, in his book _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , argues that you should ignore your interests.
> 
> He contends that (1) only around 4% of all people have interests that are related to their work, (2) that many people who love their jobs didn’t get there by following their interests, and (3) that sometimes, a person might have an interest related to their profession but might still feel unfulfilled (for example, someone might follow their interest into medicine but still be miserable because her organization is unpleasant or because of all the paperwork involved).
> 
> Instead, Newport advises that to find success, people focus on _developing a skill set_ that will set them apart from their peers. A person can then leverage these skills to gain autonomy and control over their career, and finally, to make themselves indispensable to others. Once they’ve achieved a high level of success, they can use their autonomy and influence to fulfill their personal mission, make a difference in the world, and thus find meaning in their work.
> 
> Of course, Duckworth argues that you’re far more likely to invest time and energy into developing skills within a field that interests you. However, the debate remains about which comes first—does interest encourage skills, or do skills lead to interest?

#### Interests Often Start as Play

Duckworth notes that interests typically start out as play. Experts start as amateurs, doing something they enjoy rather than something they take seriously.

Once play has sparked an interest, supporters, such as parents, teachers, and friends, can help it thrive. A support group helps a person learn more about an interest and provides positive feedback to nurture it.

She advises parents not to push young children too hard in a specific direction, arguing that in childhood, it’s too early to detect long-term interests. People only start to gravitate to general interests in middle school age. She also warns that studies indicate forcing a passion erodes intrinsic motivation. When parents allow their kids to freely choose what kinds of activities they like, those kids are more likely to develop strong passions in later years. Duckworth thus advises parents to allow for open play and discovery before enforcing discipline.

> **Play Makes Passionate Kids**
> 
> Other writers note that in allowing children to discover a subject matter through play rather than through work, caregivers instill in the children a positive association with that subject, which sustains the child through the more rigorous practice that comes later.
> 
> In _Peak_ , authors Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool note that top achievers in a variety of fields have one thing in common: As children, they’d all been introduced to their field in a fun, lighthearted way, often through toys. For example, one future chess master started by playing with game pieces like figurines, and a future golf pro was given a toy club as a toddler. The authors note that parents encouraged their kids’ burgeoning interest with copious praise, making the experience an overwhelmingly positive one.
> 
> It was only after their childrens’ interest was firmly established that parents brought in teachers or coaches to help develop their skills. Continuing positive praise from teachers and coaches, combined with deliberate practice encouraged by their parents, eventually translated into intrinsic motivation in the children themselves.
