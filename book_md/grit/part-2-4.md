## Part 2.4: Stage 4: Hope

The fourth stage of grit that Duckworth identifies is hope. Duckworth **defines hope as the belief** **that you have the power to improve things.**

Duckworth notes that this is a different kind of hope than the hope that says “tomorrow will be better.” Hoping for a better tomorrow is hoping for luck. That type of hope doesn’t sustain grit because it depends on external factors.

In contrast, the hope that sustains grit is **an optimism that you yourself can make tomorrow better.** This hope—an enduring belief that you can eventually achieve your goals—sustains passion over long periods of time.

(Shortform note: Many psychologists have noted how important hope is in sustaining progress toward goals because it can propel you past the negative feedback that a setback gives you. When a setback signals you to _stop_ by telling you what’s not working, hope can be what encourages you to _keep going_ by promising what might work. Psychologists emphasize that hope is not a denial of reality—it’s not about ignoring or dismissing challenges, but rather, accepting the hard work needed to move past those challenges, and believing that the hard work will pay off.)

### Helplessness Leads to Hopelessness

Duckworth begins her discussion of hope by exploring its opposite: hopelessness, which is a direct result of _helplessness_. **Helplessness is a feeling of having no control over a negative situation**. Importantly, Duckworth argues that suffering itself doesn’t lead to hopelessness, but rather, _the belief that you can’t control your suffering_ does.

To demonstrate this connection, she focuses on **_learned helplessness_** , which is when you’re taught through experience or instruction that bad things can’t be stopped or controlled. Studies have shown that when people (or even animals) are taught that they can’t prevent something bad from happening, they give up, accept the negative events and suffer through them rather than try to figure out how to escape them. This attitude continues into new situations even if in that new situation, the negative events are escapable—people and animals who’ve learned helplessness typically choose to suffer through them instead of stopping them. Further, people feeling helplessness suffer depression, sleep problems, and poor concentration—all of which indicate hopelessness.

> **Learned Helplessness Leads to Lower Performance**
> 
> In _The Leadership Challenge_ , Kouzes and Posner explore how this kind of learned helplessness can affect workers in an organization. They argue that messages of either control or a lack of control can affect a person’s confidence, which in turn affects their performance—people have more confidence, as well as better performance, when they believe their opinions will affect how other people make decisions.
> 
> Studies back this up by comparing the behavior of people who’ve been told their colleagues will listen to their opinions against people who’ve been told they are welcome to voice their opinions but they won’t affect the decision-making process—the former group put in more effort and assumed more leadership roles, while the other group was demotivated.

### Optimism Drives Motivation

Duckworth suggests that the opposite of learned helplessness is **_learned optimism_**. She explains that optimists tend to attribute their suffering to temporary and specific causes, while pessimists blame permanent and broad causes. These differing interpretations of the same challenges or setbacks can have significant effects on a person’s motivation.

(Shortform note: Martin Seligman developed this theory in his book _Learned Optimism_ , in which he argues that optimism and pessimism are different _explanatory styles—_ ways in which we explain bad events to ourselves. He attributes the differences between these explanatory styles to three ways people can interpret events. The first two mirror the concepts Duckworth explores—seeing problems as either _temporary_ or _permanent_ , and either _specific_ or _broad_. He then adds one more: Optimists see problems as a result of _outside forces_ while pessimists attribute problems to _personal failures_. Like Duckworth, he feels that these habits of thinking are malleable, and that if you work at changing them, you can adjust your mindset from a pessimistic one to an optimistic one.)

For example, if a pessimist and an optimist both fail a test, the pessimist is more likely to explain it with permanent, broad causes, like, “I always fail when it matters,” or “I’m bad at math.” These are causes that can’t easily be changed, so the pessimist will more likely believe they simply can’t pass this test, and will more likely give up or drop the class.

The optimist is more likely to explain it with specific, temporary causes, like, “I didn’t spend enough time studying these particular concepts.” These types of explanations lend themselves to actionables. Someone attributing failure to these specific causes can work on them so that next time they won’t fail.

Psychologists have found that self-talk like that illustrated above can have an enormous influence on how people view challenges and how they respond to setbacks. This has given rise to the field of cognitive behavioral therapy, which treats depression and other psychological disorders by helping patients to think about negative events in healthier, more optimistic ways. The effects of self-talk are so pronounced that this type of therapy has proven more potent and longer-lasting than antidepressant medication.

> **Three Elements of Learned Helplessness**
> 
> In his book _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins defines learned helplessness as a globalized, overall belief in your own incompetence. He says this belief has three elements:
> 
>   * **Permanence:** People who suffer from learned helplessness believe their problems will last forever, while people who are able to overcome adversity understand that their problems are temporary.
> 
>   * **Pervasiveness:** People who feel helpless believe their challenges infuse every aspect of their lives, while stronger people are able to compartmentalize—the first type of person might say “I have no willpower,” while the second might say “I tend to overeat in the afternoons.”
> 
>   * **Personal:** People who feel helpless attribute their problems to personal faults, while stronger people credit their problems to the specific approach they took. It’s the difference between “I don’t get science” and “I didn’t study properly for that test.”
> 
> 

> 
> Robbins advises that to break out of a mindset of helplessness, you find something in your life that you can control and then take proactive steps toward controlling it. This will give you a feeling of accomplishment that will start to color your perspective on other challenges. For example, organizing your desk can make you feel in control of your environment, which can help you approach other problems with more confidence.

### The Growth Mindset

To further explore optimism, Duckworth discusses the research and findings of Carol Dweck, who was interested in _why_ different people develop different styles of self-talk, leading to either optimism or pessimism. Dweck’s insight was the theory of the **growth mindset** , which has become a cornerstone of many psychological theories since.

Dweck describes two mindsets that a person might have—a _growth mindset_ or a _fixed mindset_.

  * People with a **growth mindset** believe that intelligence and talent can change over time and with effort. You can get smarter or better if you have the right opportunities and you work at it. 
  * People with a **fixed mindset** believe that things like intelligence and talent are static—you are born with a certain amount of intelligence or capacity for mastering a skill, and that determines what you can and cannot do. 



If you have a growth mindset you’ll have more grit and perseverance because if you hit an obstacle, you don’t attribute it to permanent personal traits. **You instead believe you have the capacity to improve** , no matter what you do.

In contrast, with a fixed mindset, you believe that you failed at something because you simply don’t have it in you and you’ll never have it—so why keep trying?

Duckworth notes that people with a growth mindset have similar characteristics to optimists because their explanations of their failures focus on specific, changeable things rather than broad, permanent factors.

> **Growth Mindsets See Success Differently**
> 
> In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck notes that growth mindsets and fixed mindsets reflect very different attitudes toward success.
> 
> **With a fixed mindset, success is about proving to yourself and others that you’re smart and talented.** With a fixed mindset, you believe that if you fail, it means you’re not smart or talented. Therefore, failure is intolerable, as it’s a reflection on you as a person.
> 
> **In contrast, with a growth mindset, success is about stretching yourself, learning, and improving.** You define failure as not seizing an opportunity to learn, not striving for what’s important to you, and not reaching for your potential.
> 
> Dweck notes that the two mindsets create different attitudes toward effort: Those with a fixed mindset feel that if you need to put effort into something, it proves that you’re not smart or talented enough. Effort has a negative quality. In contrast, people with a growth mindset view effort positively, as an integral part of their identity and a natural part of the process of working toward a goal.
> 
> These differing attitudes toward effort can have far more of an effect on a person's success than their innate intelligence or talent. This means that people with fixed mindsets stack the deck against themselves from the outset because their prioritizing of innate talent over learned effort can itself limit their innate talent.

#### Benefits of a Growth Mindset and Optimism

Duckworth contends that a growth mindset and an optimistic attitude lead not only to greater professional success but also to more personal happiness.

Optimists are less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, tend to earn higher grades, stay healthier, are twice as likely to stay in their jobs, and are 25% more successful in sales than pessimists.

Growth mindset students are grittier, earn higher grades, and are more likely to persist through college. Duckworth relates a study that found that employees in growth-mindset cultures (that focused on developing employees rather than comparing them to the top performers) were 47% more likely to say colleagues are trustworthy, 49% more likely to say their company fosters innovation, and 65% more likely to say their company supports risk-taking.

> **Organizations Benefit as Much as Individuals**
> 
> Duckworth focuses on the importance of a growth mindset for individual success, but she touches briefly on its importance in a corporate setting as well by pointing out that employees are more satisfied with their companies when they work within a growth-mindset culture. Many management experts have drawn the same conclusion, and have gone further to argue that, like individuals, companies with a growth mindset are more successful and more competitive.
> 
> In _The Leadership Challenge_ , Kouzes and Posner argue that when leaders of an organization cultivate a growth mindset in their company, the people who work there take on more responsibility and strive to be leaders themselves, lessening the need for managers to oversee them closely.
> 
> The authors note that in successful organizations, workers often make more mistakes than in less successful organizations. This indicates that when workers feel comfortable being wrong, they stretch themselves toward higher goals. They acknowledge their mistakes along the way so that they can work on them—this is all part of having a growth mindset that sees failures as learning opportunities rather than judgments.

#### Where Does a Growth Mindset Come From?

Duckworth identifies three main influences that determine whether a person has a growth mindset or a fixed mindset: (1) feedback received during childhood, (2) habits of thinking, and (3) experiences of overcoming adversity.

##### 1\. Childhood Feedback

Duckworth contends that much of your self-talk echoes feedback you received from authority figures in your childhood. When you did something well, the praise you got, and whether it was for your efforts or for your talent, probably mirrors the language you use today when judging your successes and failures.

Parents, psychologists, and educators who know this strive to praise kids for their efforts rather than for their raw talent. Duckworth discusses some specific ways you can phrase feedback to children that encourage an attitude of perseverance, such as:

  * Don’t say: “You’re so good at this!” **Say: “Look how hard you worked on this!”**
  * Don’t say: “Oh well, you tried.” **Say: “Looks like that didn’t work. How can you approach it differently next time?”**
  * Don't say: “It’s okay if you can’t do this.” **Say: “It’s okay if you can’t do this _yet_.”**



Duckworth points to the example of the charter school system Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) as an illustration of how educators can foster an attitude of grit with demonstrable results. KIPP teachers praise effort over natural talent and are trained to use grit-encouraging phrases like these listed above. Duckworth reports that the vast majority of KIPP students come from lower-income families, almost all of whom graduate from high school and more than 80% of whom go on to college, and she credits their focus for those successes.

> **KIPP’s Successes Are Debated**
> 
> Although Duckworth lauds the KIPP program, some critics dispute the statistics showing its successes. They also contend that the successes that KIPP does have can be explained by factors other than grit training.
> 
> Critics argue that statistics showing the higher achievements of KIPP students are misleadingly presented. They note that the reported high-school graduation rates ignore the fact that there’s a significant attrition rate of students out of the program before high school—half of the fifth-graders who start at a KIPP school don’t finish eighth grade at one, and of those, only 70% choose to continue in KIPP high schools, suggesting that KIPP high schools end up with only top students to begin with.
> 
> Critics further argue that where KIPP schools do show improvements in grades, they’re working with a self-selected population of students who hail from families who prioritize education, as indicated by their interest in enrolling their kids or entering them in the lottery for enrollment. Not only that, but the students who leave KIPP schools before eighth grade tend to be the lower-scoring students, indicating that KIPP’s methods are not serving those who need it the most, and that the schools’ achievement scores are skewed because they often shed the lower performers.
> 
> Therefore, critics argue that KIPP schools don’t have the same mix of disadvantaged students (non-English speakers, homeless children, special needs kids, students with criminal histories, and so on), so that comparisons to public school performances are distorted. To properly assess KIPP methods, these critics argue, a KIPP school would have to take over an entire district, and all of its students, and apply its methods.

##### 2\. Habits of Thinking

Duckworth argues that optimism and pessimism, as well as growth or fixed mindsets, can be self-reinforcing in either virtuous or vicious cycles.

If you believe your skills can perpetually grow, and that misfortune is temporary and can be fixed, you keep trying to solve problems. **When you break through and improve, you further reinforce your positive beliefs, which makes you try even harder next time.**

(Shortform note: This corresponds to Duckworth’s earlier discussion of deliberate practice, where she notes that in order to grow your skills, you must continually have small breakthrough moments. Such moments will foster your confidence, leading to optimism and a growth mindset.)

In contrast, if you believe your skills have hit their permanent limits, and you believe life’s problems are caused by those limits, **you are less likely to overcome roadblocks** – after all, it’s logical to give up if there’s no way out. **Your recurrent failures then perpetuate your negative feelings** , which further reduce your likelihood of success and cause you to avoid challenges that would have led to growth.

(Shortform note: This explains why people who have learned helplessness during one experience will carry that attitude into their next experience. In the same way that a person suffering from learned helplessness feels they have no control over their failures, so too, do they feel they have no control over their _successes_ , either—they believe that their efforts can only amount to so much because they’re limited by pre-ordained levels of intelligence and talent. Thus, they feel a lack of control over their lives in general and are therefore more likely to give up on a goal.)

##### 3\. Experiences of Overcoming Adversity

Duckworth cites studies indicating that subjects who are taught to overcome adversity at a young age—typically around adolescence—are better able to manage adversity later in life. These studies reveal that the opposite is also true—subjects who are taught early in life that they can’t control their suffering carry that lesson with them for the rest of their life.

She references different studies involving both dogs and rats in which the animals were exposed to shocks, and some had a mechanism to stop the shocks but others didn’t. The animals that weren’t able to stop the shocks learned to be helpless, and they responded to challenges helplessly for the rest of their lives. However, those that were able to stop the shocks developed a feeling of resilience, and they were later able to overcome future obstacles. She notes that the effect in both directions was most pronounced when the animals went through the traumatic experience in their adolescence.

Duckworth sees the same patterns in humans. Children and teens who face and overcome adversity are more resilient as adults. She emphasizes that this resiliency is only developed if kids face _actual adversity_ and experience true success against it. It’s not enough to just tell kids that they can get through difficulty—in order for the brain to incorporate this belief into its wiring, kids have to _experience_ the feeling of progress against obstacles.

She notes that the duration of learned helplessness is troubling for kids in poverty, who receive a lot of helplessness experiences and not enough mastery experiences. For kids at an impressionable age, the wiring between failure and mindset can be strengthened repeatedly.

Similarly, on the other end of the spectrum, kids who coast through life without having to overcome adversity can have low grit that makes them crumble under pressure.

Both situations can be reinforced by fixed mindset attitudes from parents or teachers—“you’re just no good at this, and you’ll never amount to anything,” or conversely, “you’re so talented, what a natural you are!” Either way, the fixed mindset doesn't equip the child with skills for facing future adversity.

> **Believing in Control Is the Key to Resilience**
> 
> Experiences of overcoming adversity are the opposite of the experiences of learned helplessness that we discussed earlier. Research on the exact neurological mechanism of learned helplessness sheds light on how early experiences of either success or failure against challenges can affect a person’s future behavior.
> 
> Studies reveal that a fearful response to stress is actually the brain’s natural state—the region of the brain that releases the hormones that react to stress always acts first. Therefore, it’s not that animals are learning helplessness when they’re exposed to uncontrollable shocks, but instead, they’re learning to stay in their natural state of fear and apprehension. It’s when they’re offered an opportunity to control a situation that a second region of the brain steps in to calm down the more reactive region.
> 
> Researchers conclude that the process of _unlearning_ helplessness is more about learning that we have the ability to control a situation. In his book _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown expands on this idea by arguing that learned helplessness happens when we get overwhelmed by our circumstances and _forget that we even have an option to choose_.
> 
> McKeown argues that we can see this in children who learn early that certain subjects are difficult and then stop trying to conquer them, or in adults who, at work, feel they don’t have any choice about what tasks they choose to take on, and respond by either becoming demotivated, believing their efforts are futile, or by trying to take on all tasks, and getting burned out.
