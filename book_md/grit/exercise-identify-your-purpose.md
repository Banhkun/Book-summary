## Exercise: Identify Your Purpose

Purpose corresponds to the “high-level goals” Duckworth discusses in her exploration of passion in the first part of the book. These are the goals at the very top, for which you can’t provide an answer to the question “Why?”

* * *

Think of an everyday, lower-level goal that you have set for yourself. This might be one that improves a daily action (like getting up earlier every morning) or one that addresses a pattern of thought (like responding to criticism less defensively).

Ask yourself “why” you aim for that goal. What larger goal does your everyday goal support?

Now ask yourself “why” you aim for that larger goal. What even higher goal does _it_ support?

Continue asking “why” for each progressive goal, until you arrive at a question you can’t give an answer for. This will be your “because I do” question—your purpose. What is that purpose?
