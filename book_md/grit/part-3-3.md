## Part 3.3: Grit in Your Organization

Duckworth notes that when you’re in an organization with a strong culture (shared values and norms), it becomes part of your identity. So, for example, you’re not just a ballplayer, you’re _a Yankee_.

Therefore, Duckworth advises that to develop your grit, you should become part of a gritty group. You’ll conform to the group and adopt their gritty habits.

### How Culture Develops

Duckworth argues that the effects of culture go in both directions between a group and its members. Often, a group is made up of naturally gritty people because it selects for them—for example, a successful company only hires highly motivated workers, and a winning sports team has gritty athletes because they’ve successfully passed tryouts. The grit of each individual contributes to the organizational culture.

Then, in reciprocal fashion, the grit of the group encourages even more grit in its members. When everyone around you is acting gritty, you’re more likely to. For example, if your friends arrive at the gym at five every morning to work out, it will normalize that behavior in your mind and you’ll be more likely to do so as well. **This is the corresponsive principle at work: a group adopts the characteristics of its members and then enhances those same characteristics.**

(Shortform note: In a continuation of the corresponsive principle, when a group’s culture is firmly established and easily recognized from outside the group, the group will then attract members who identify with that culture, again enhancing it. This can be seen with companies like Google—the company advertises its culture of hard work mixed with intense fun, and as a result, attracts workers who identify with those characteristics.)

#### How Cultural Identity Affects You

Duckworth contends that when your personal identity becomes intertwined with the identity of a group, you’ll typically start adopting the characteristics of that group. So, if your group has a gritty culture, you’ll start making decisions with a gritty mindset because it becomes part of how you see yourself. For example, you’ll get up early to exercise, not because you do a rational cost-benefit analysis weighing the advantages of working out against the advantages of sleeping in, but because you’ll think of yourself as the kind of person who gets up early to work out. Eventually, such decisions become habit.

(Shortform note: The power of a group to influence habits is well-established. It’s the psychology behind weight-loss programs like Weight Watchers or sobriety programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. Psychologists have found that the social aspect of such groups is one of the primary reasons they work—people respond to peer influences partly because they are hard-wired to foster social connections, and social connections are often strengthened when people have similar values and habits.)

### How to Create a Gritty Culture

Duckworth offers several specific techniques to develop more grit within your organization:

**Verbalize your values:** Make sure your group members know how much you value grit. Pick some inspirational quotes that capture your values and post them. Some organizations (like sports teams, schools, and West Point) even require their members to memorize the quotes, which Duckworth contends helps them internalize those values.

(Shortform note: In _The Leadership Challenge_ , Posner and Kouzes write that the first step in strong leadership is to establish, convey, and then model your values. They note that strong teams are built on shared values, which is why it’s so important to be sure that everyone agrees with, or at least understands, the core values of the organization.)

**Measure and showcase your members’ grit:** Have group members fill out Duckworth’s grit questionnaire. Let them know their scores. Repeat this process at a later date so people can see their progress. Engage in activities that highlight stamina and celebrate those who succeed. For example, a sports team might run an extra-long course or a music class might memorize an overly complicated piano score.

(Shortform note: Posner and Kouzes write that recognizing and celebrating team members’ accomplishments is crucial because such encouragement helps people function at their highest level. Positive feedback helps people endure when hours are long, work is difficult, and challenges seem daunting. Celebrations act as emotional replenishment that fuels their commitment.)

**Coach grit:** Work with struggling team members. Don’t just give them a goal and let them figure it out if they’re struggling—coach them to get to that goal with improvement plans that are reasonable but ambitious.

(Shortform note: In addition to coaching, Posner and Kouzes advise that you provide access to classes, seminars, and special projects. They also recommend you rotate some job responsibilities. All of these things will help develop your team members so that they are living up to their potential, and it encourages a growth mindset where your direct reports feel that you believe in their potential to grow.)

**Hire well:** Recruit people who are demonstrably grittier than the average in your team so that they can inspire the team to aim higher.

(Shortform note: Some experts advise that you go further and hire someone who’s not just better than your average team member, but who’s better than you. When you hire someone better than you, they inspire you to keep learning new things and they fire up your competitive drive, spurring you to improve yourself.)

#### Lead With Grit

Duckworth advises that above all, you model the gritty behavior you expect of your team members.

She notes that the two key factors that foster excellence in both teams and individuals are _support_ and _continued challenges_. She notes that this is very similar to wise parenting, which offers _emotional support_ combined with _demands for excellence_. Therefore, she reasons that an effective leader is somewhat like an authoritative parent—demanding, supportive, and modeling of the correct behavior.

(Shortform note: Duckworth’s view on leadership aligns with that of many other management experts, who advise that leadership is more about fostering productive relationships than commanding underlings. _The Leadership Challenge_ , for example, advises that leaders don’t exist without a team, and a strong leader/team relationship is one where the team willingly and enthusiastically follows their leader. Therefore, **when you work to develop your leadership, you should focus primarily on developing your relationships with your team members.)**

#### Encourage Healthy Competition

Duckworth notes that _competition_ doesn’t necessarily mean a win or lose battle against another person. The word originates from Latin and means _strive together_ , a definition that doesn’t include the notion of one party triumphing over another.

Duckworth argues that the better meaning of the word “compete” is to strive for excellence—to push yourself against your obstacles so that tomorrow, you’re a little bit better than you were today. She recommends that a healthy culture of grit include an emphasis on this kind of competition—not to vanquish an enemy, but to push yourself to be better.

> **Collaborative Competition Leads to Long-Term Success**
> 
> In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek argues that competition can bring out the best in a person when they see their competitors not as rivals to be vanquished but as _worthy rivals_ from whom they can learn as they struggle against them. Like Duckworth, Sinek proposes that you view competition as somewhat of a collaboration, using your rivalry to improve yourself, and seeing the real challenge as the skill you need to grow rather than the person you need to beat. He notes that when you see competition as a win-or-lose fight, you fall into short-term thinking that leads to short-term success. However, when you view competition as a call to improve yourself, you set yourself up for long-term success.
