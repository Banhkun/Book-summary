## Exercise: Unwind Your Anxiety Loops

Brewer argues that anxiety comes from habit loops—and that many of our unwanted behaviors start off as attempts to cope with anxiety. In this exercise, you’ll map out one of your own anxiety loops.

* * *

Describe a situation where you’ve experienced anxiety. What was the situation? What were your symptoms?

Did the anxiety trigger any problematic behaviors?

Now, break that situation down into one or more habit loops. Remember, a habit loop consists of a trigger, a behavior, a result, and an implicit lesson. How did the anxious response you described above fit into this scheme?

If this were to happen again, how could mindfulness help you deconstruct this behavior loop? Which of Brewer’s specific techniques do you think would be most helpful to you and why?
