## Exercise: Implement CFRs

Conversations, feedback, and recognition are the keys to a successful performance review system. Reflect on how you can foster them at your company.

* * *

Describe your companyâ€™s performance review system. Is it constructive and motivating, pointless and demoralizing, or somewhere in between? Why?

What features of the continuous performance management system and CFRs (conversation, feedback, and recognition) would be most beneficial at your company? Why?

How can you seek more constructive feedback from your manager or direct reports?

How can you better recognize and celebrate the work of your peers or direct reports?
