## Exercise: Reflect on Your Workplace Values

Your company’s values make up the foundation of your workplace culture. Reflect on your own values and whether or not they align with your company’s.

* * *

Why does your work and your company’s work matter? How does your work contribute to the company’s goals and values?

Why does transparency in a company matter? Why would you want peers from other divisions to know what your goals are?

Why does accountability matter? How can you both hold yourself and others accountable while remaining respectful of others’ failings and forgiving of your own?

Do you think your professional values align with your company’s values? Why or why not?
