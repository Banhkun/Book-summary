## Chapters 10-11: Superpower #3—Track

Chapters 10 and 11 cover **superpower #3, track** progress.

**How to Implement OKRs for tracking:** OKRs are always measurable, and at the end of each OKR cycle you score them. These scores help you track your progress, and they indicate when you need to double down on a particular goal or when you should revise or abandon it.

Unlike traditional business goals, OKRs aren’t set in stone. OKRs are “living, breathing organisms,” and there are three phases to tracking an OKR’s life cycle: setup, midlife tracking, and wrap-up.

### The Setup Phase

The setup phase is when you decide what cloud-based system you’ll use to track your OKRs, determine the length of your OKR cycles, and designate your “OKR shepherd.” Refer to “Checklist: Focus and Commit” in Chapter 4. All of these actions will make tracking possible in the next phase.

### The Midlife Tracking Phase

Studies show that people are motivated by tangible signs of their progress toward a goal, and that **making progress can be more motivating than receiving a bonus, receiving public recognition, or even achieving the goal itself.**

But for progress to be motivating, people need to see it. This is why midlife check-ins are so important. During this phase, employees check-in with their managers to discuss their OKR progress.

Ideally, check-ins happen weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually. The frequency of these check-ins will depend on the length of time needed to achieve each key result, the quality of communication in the team, the size of the group, how geographically spread out it is, and current business needs. In addition to one-on-one meetings with employees and managers, teams and departments should meet regularly to evaluate progress toward objectives they share.

#### 4 Mid-Cycle OKR Options

At these check-ins, you and your manager check progress toward the OKRs, identify obstacles and potential obstacles, and refine key results. Discuss **four options relative to each goal:**

**Option #1: Continue** the objective or key result—If everything’s going well and you’re making progress, keep going.

**Option #2: Revise** the objective or key result—If changes in your environment or workflow have caused the goal to get off track, update it. You may need to alter your process or the goal’s timeline to get it back on track. You also may need to put other goals on the backburner so you have more time and resources to focus on this one.

**Option #3: Start** a new objective or key result—As conditions change, you may find you need to add new goals. If you already have five objectives, you may need to put one or two on the backburner to make room for the new goal.

**Option #4: Stop** an objective or key result—Some goals become irrelevant or impractical. Don’t stubbornly cling to a goal just because you set it. If it no longer serves your larger purpose or the company’s, toss it.

### The Wrap-Up Phase

The wrap-up phase usually happens at the end of the OKR cycle. During this phase, you analyze your methods, evaluate your progress, and reflect on your successes and failures. The wrap-up phase consists of three parts: objective scoring, subjective self-assessment, and reflection.

#### Objective Scoring

The employee and manager assign a score to the objectives. **The simplest way to score an objective is to average the completion rates of its key results.**

At Intel, employees use a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 to score key results based on how much of the key result was completed.

  * 0.7-1.0 is a “green” score, meaning the individual or team achieved the goal.
  * 0.4-0.6 is a “yellow” score, meaning the individual or team made progress but didn’t complete the goal.
  * 0.0-0.3 is a “red” score, meaning the individual or team failed to make progress toward the goal.



If you’ve defined key metrics well, they’ll be quantitative and can easily be scored. Say your key metric was to find 10 new prospective clients; if you found only 7, your score would be a 0.7.

At times, you may find that you made zero progress on a task due to delays or complications. That key result would earn a score of 0.

#### Subjective Self-Assessment

Objective data are important, but they don’t always tell the whole story. Low numbers could conceal a strong effort, and strong numbers could be inflated.

For example, let’s say your objective is to recruit more customers, and one of your key results is to make 50 phone calls to potential customers. You end up making 35 phone calls, for an objective score of 0.7. On paper, this looks like a success. But if you waited until the last minute and rushed through your calls, signing only 1 new customer, the objective score of 0.7 isn’t truly indicative of your performance.

For this reason, it’s important to balance objective scores with subjective self-assessments. Work with your manager to compare objective scores with the circumstances that led to them. Let’s look at how this plays out in a few scenarios with the same key result:

**Key Result:** Acquire 10 new customers.

**Objective Score:** 0.7 (acquired 7 new customers)

**Subjective Self-Assessment:** The market slump made this a lot harder to achieve than I expected. Therefore, 7 new customers is an exceptional result.

**Subjective Score:** 0.9

**Key Result:** Acquire 10 new customers.

**Objective Score:** 1.0 (acquired 10 new customers)

**Subjective Self-Assessment:** I met this goal after only eight weeks, meaning that I set the bar too low.

**Subjective Score:** 0.7

**Key Result:** Acquire 10 new customers.

**Objective Score:** 0.8 (acquired 8 new customers)

**Subjective Self-Assessment:** My strong results were more the result of luck than hard work—one new customer I signed brought five other new customers with her.

**Subjective Score:** 0.6

**Key Result:** Acquire 10 new customers.

**Objective Score:** 0.9 (acquired 9 new customers)

**Subjective Self-Assessment:** After signing them, I realized only 2 of the 9 new customers would bring in significant revenue.

**Subjective Score:** 0.5

For employees who are too harsh or too lenient in their subjective self-assessments, you as the manager need to help recalibrate these subjective scores through dialogue about how to arrive at them. These one-on-one and team discussions are often more valuable than the scores themselves.

#### Reflection

To learn from your experiences and scores, use these questions as a jumping-off point for group discussion and self-reflection:

  * Did you meet your objectives? If you did, what factors helped you be successful? If you didn’t, what roadblocks did you face?
  * For the goals you achieved, would you change anything about how you met them? What would you change?
  * What have you learned that you want to keep in mind during the next OKR cycle?



Don’t forget to celebrate your progress and accomplishments at this stage. Celebrating success boosts morale and keeps you and your team motivated.

### Example of Superpower #3: Track—The Gates Foundation

One focus of the Gates Foundation is vaccines. To make a broad, vague goal trackable, they used the 80/90 rule: 80% of the targeted districts will have at least 90% coverage through vaccination.

The foundation used tracking throughout the OKR cycle to decide whether to keep, revise, or pull certain OKRs. Sometimes, they realized **they were using the wrong data set entirely** to track their progress.

For instance, another Gates Foundation objective is to end world hunger. One of the foundation’s leaders describes this hypothetical situation: A key result toward the objective of ending hunger might be to double yam production in a particular area. Luckily, one of your partners has discovered a seed that has the potential to increase yam production. You measure progress by the number of yams produced. But if you find out that nobody will eat the yams from the new seed because they take four times longer to cook than traditional yams, the number of yams produced is irrelevant. You’ve been measuring the wrong thing. The Gates Foundation is quick to pivot when tracking allows them to see that their data and their objective aren’t aligned.
