## Exercise: Does Technology Make Us Smart?

The debate over whether technology makes us more or less intelligent rages on. This exercise will help you examine how technology affects your own life.

* * *

The author argues that technology makes us smart because it takes over menial jobs, giving us time and energy to devote to more involved tasks. Can you think of an example in your own life where technology has saved you time and allowed you to focus on other work?

Are there any parts of your daily routine that you _could_ automate with technology but havenâ€™t? What might be the pros and cons of automating that task?

Many people believe that technology makes us _less_ intelligent, since it provides constant distraction and prevents us from learning to do things for ourselves. Has technology had this kind of effect in your own life, either in general or with particular devices and experiences?

Is there a middle ground here? Is technology helpful for you in some areas and harmful in others? Why do you think that is?
