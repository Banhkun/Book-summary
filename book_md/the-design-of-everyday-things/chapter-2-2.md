## Chapter 2.2: Making Sense of Our Own Behavior

We know that behavior can be either event-driven or goal-driven, and that it can be broken down into seven stages of action. But what happens when something goes wrong? How do we explain what happened?

For designers, understanding the way users think about their interactions with technology is important for creating a positive user experience. It is not enough to know how something works on a technical level—we need to understand how the _user_ thinks the object works, and how they explain what happened if something goes wrong, since these are important factors in determining how people respond to technology. For designers and non-designers alike, understanding the biases that shape our own stories helps us make sense of our encounters with bad design.

### Causes of Behavior

To understand the way people think about their interactions with technology, we need to distinguish between a user’s overarching goal and the smaller subgoals and actions that lead up to it. Norman quotes Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt as an example, who said, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!” However, it’s unlikely that anyone _actually_ wants a quarter-inch hole in their wall just for fun. Instead, drilling a hole is most likely a subgoal leading up to a larger goal of mounting something on the wall.

**Determining the overall goal of a behavior is important because it gives designers a better idea of what users really want.** If you’re designing in response to someone buying a drill, you’ll keep making new kinds of drills. If you’re designing in response to someone wanting to hang a shelf, you might come up with a new adhesive that allows the user to mount shelves directly on their wall, without drilling holes. You’ve addressed their real need and simplified the process of meeting it.

#### Root Cause Analysis

To find the original, overarching goal of a behavior, we use a process called _root cause analysis.**Essentially, we keep asking “why?” about a behavior until there is no further answer.**_ In the drill example, the process of root cause analysis would start with asking, “Why does this person want to buy a drill?," followed by “Why do they need to put a hole in the wall?” until we reached the conclusion that “They want to hang up a shelf.” But we could push this even further by asking why they want to hang a shelf in the first place. Do they have too many books? Are they running out of floor space? Are the walls empty and boring? This gives designers more intervention points to come up with solutions to meet users’ needs.

One of the lessons of root cause analysis is that**every action has either an external or internal cause.** When an internal goal causes a certain action, we call this _goal-driven behavior_. When an outside event or a condition of our environment causes an action, we call this _event-driven behavior_. Event-driven behaviors are often _opportunistic action_ , or behavior that arises in response to unexpected events.

  * For example, if your goal is to do well on an academic exam, the action of studying would be a goal-driven behavior. If you’re trying to study in a noisy environment and reach for a pair of earplugs, that would be an event-driven behavior. 



The example above shows how event-driven and goal-driven behavior can be intertwined, since the event-driven behavior (putting in earplugs) only occurs as part of the goal-driven behavior (studying).**Designers need to be aware of the differences between event-driven and goal-driven behaviors in order to design for the user’s _actual_ needs.** In the studying example, focusing on designing better earplugs focuses only on the external factors. Redesigning the entire environment to be more conducive to the internal goal of studying would address both the internal and external causes, ultimately creating an even better user experience overall.

### The Role of Storytelling in User Experience

Root cause analysis helps us make sense of other people’s behavior. To understand our _own_ behavior, we turn to stories. Humans are born storytellers. When we’re faced with a jumble of information, our natural instinct is to organize it into a story that explains cause and effect. **Stories help us make sense of our world and our place in it.**

Reorganizing information into a cohesive story is usually a subconscious process. We operate under the assumption that there must be an underlying pattern connecting different pieces of information in a way that makes sense, regardless of whether such a pattern actually exists. **In practice, this means that humans are really good at coming up with stories to explain our experiences, but not so good at determining whether those stories are actually true.**

When it comes to understanding our physical environment, these stories take the form of conceptual models. We create a mental story to explain how something works, connecting whatever bits of evidence we have about that object into cause and effect patterns that make sense to us (but may be totally false).

A common source of false conceptual models is thermostats. Because a thermostat is such a small peek into a complex heating and cooling system, it gives us very few clues as to how it actually works. All we know is that if we’re too cold, we press a few buttons on the thermostat and the room eventually gets warmer. All the steps between “press buttons” and “feel warmer” are hidden and left to the imagination. This leads people to assume the thermostat controls a valve that opens a certain amount based on the setting, and that setting it higher will warm the room faster. In reality, most thermostats are a simple on/off switch, so setting a higher temperature has no effect on how fast the room warms up.

### Why Do We Blame Ourselves?

Faulty conceptual models often lead us to blame ourselves when an object doesn’t meet our expectations. If you push a door and it doesn’t open, you push again, but harder. You assume _your_ action was flawed somehow—not that the door itself was poorly designed.

The tendency to blame ourselves when technology fails us is interesting because it is the exact opposite of our default pattern for assigning blame. Normally, when we perform poorly, we blame our environment (perhaps the sun was in our eyes, or the dog ate our homework). But when we perform _well_ , we attribute it to our innate qualities, not the environment.

When we look at other people, this effect is reversed: we assume their successes are products of their environment, but their failures are due to their personal faults. (Shortform note: In psychology texts, this tendency is referred to as the “fundamental attribution error.” To learn more about attribution error and other cognitive biases, read our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

As new technologies pop up in every corner of our lives, we’re less and less likely to admit to struggling with them, especially when it appears that “everyone else understands this.” In reality, the opposite is true—when it comes to technology, our struggles are more likely due to design, not our own inadequacy. In other words, most people are probably experiencing the same difficulties, whether or not they speak up about it.

#### The Value of Failure

So, why are we willing to take the blame for failed interactions with technology, but not for our failures in general? One possibility is **learned helplessness: the belief that you are doomed to fail in a given situation because you’ve experienced similar failures in the past.** A history of repeated failures with a specific experience makes us assume that success is impossible, so we may as well stop trying. So, an encounter with even one or two overly confusing pieces of technology can make us conclude that we’re just not good with technology in general.

We can reframe these experiences using positive psychology. **Positive psychology is a subfield of psychology that focuses on people’s strengths and positive emotions instead of their struggles.** In this case, positive psychology requires a perspective shift. Instead of seeing repeated failures as evidence that we’re simply not skilled enough, we can actively choose to see failures as learning experiences. For example, if we struggle with a confusing computer program, we might put in the effort to troubleshoot the problem and ultimately end up with a much more thorough understanding of the program than if we’d succeeded on the first try.

Scientists use this practice every day. When an experiment fails, they troubleshoot, find the problem, and try the experiment again. The failure isn’t a bad omen—provides important information that ultimately creates results.

#### Human Errors Are Really System Errors

People make mistakes. This is a universal truth. But the technology around us often requires us to be perfect—to remember information accurately, never be distracted, and react in the same way every time.

In law, the idea of “human error” is accepted as a valid explanation for tragic outcomes. **In reality, these errors are rarely “human," but instead a fault of the system.** If a piece of technology is designed without regard to human behavior and cognition, errors are practically guaranteed. Who is responsible for those errors?

Think back to the Three Mile Island incident from Chapter 1. One person misunderstanding an indicator light caused a massive nuclear incident. But why was the control system of a nuclear reactor set up in a way that made it possible for one small mistake to escalate into tragedy? The system was designed to be perfectly logical, but the design didn’t account for the real humans who would be operating it.

Norman recommends getting rid of the phrase “human error” altogether. Instead, **we should think of interactions between person and machine the same way we think of interactions between people.** When disagreements pop up, each person can clarify their intentions, propose solutions, and move on. The ideal system allows the user and the object to interact in the same way.

For example, some digital calendars allow you to enter dates with natural language. Instead of requiring dates to be entered in a single format, the user can type “August 3rd," “8/3," or “next Tuesday” and the event will be added to the proper date. The machine recognizes that humans sometimes phrase things differently, and is programmed to expect and accommodate that.

(Shortform note: We’ll explore “human error” in much more depth in Chapter 5.)

### Designing for Imperfect Humans

If “human errors” are really “system errors," then designers are ultimately responsible for preventing those errors whenever possible. The goal is not to design a perfect system, but rather a system that anticipates inevitable errors, provides helpful feedback to correct those errors, and has no ‘slippery slopes’ where one small mistake can set off a catastrophic chain reaction. Here are some specific recommendations for designers to put this into practice.

  * **Positive psychology** : See user “errors” as feedback for where the design needs improvement. Instead of traditional error messages, provide feedback on the problem that allows the user to fix it immediately, without starting over or losing progress on the parts they’ve done correctly. 
  * **Root cause analysis:** When users struggle, continue asking “why” until you find the underlying problem. This fixes both the initial problem and any downstream problems that may stem from it.



Think back to the seven stages of design, and the questions posed by each stage. As a reminder, here are the seven stages and seven questions:

  1. Goal: What result do I want to achieve?
  2. Plan: What options do I have for achieving my goal?
  3. Specify: Which of these options will I choose?
  4. Perform: How do I execute my plan?
  5. Perceive: What happened when I did that?
  6. Interpret: What does that result mean?
  7. Compare: Did I reach my goal?



Users should be able to answer each of these questions easily. Designers can use the following tools to provide these answers:

  * **Discoverability:** Users can easily figure out how to use the device, even without background knowledge. 
  * **Feedback:** The device gives immediate, meaningful information in response to user commands. It also gives baseline information (whether power is on, if maintenance is needed, etc). 
    * Feedback should happen within 0.1 seconds of an action. Any longer and users may not automatically connect the feedback to their action.
  * **Conceptual model:** The way the device works is easy to understand, even when important affordances are hidden. 
  * **Affordances:** The device performs the functions users need. This must be true for all potential users, not just the average user. 
  * **Signifiers:** Where affordances are not obvious, the device draws the user’s attention to them with signs, visible hardware, beeping, etc. 
  * **Mappings:** Controls for the device are laid out in a logical way that gives clues as to which controls go with which functions.
  * **Constraints:** The device’s affordances are limited by physical and cultural constraints that help users narrow down potential functions. (Constraints are covered more thoroughly in Chapter 3.)
