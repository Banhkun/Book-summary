## Exercise: Reflect on The Design of Everyday Things

Now that you’ve finished the summary, let’s figure out how to apply the lessons of the book to your own life.

* * *

This book covers a wide range of topics in both design and cognitive psychology. What information surprised you most? What are you still curious about?

In previous exercises, you practiced looking at everyday objects with a designer’s eye by identifying affordances, signifiers, constraints, mapping strategies, and mental models. Is there anywhere in your daily life where this new way of looking at objects could be helpful?

Did the lessons in this book change the way you think about errors? Is it helpful to think about tracing “human” errors in your own life back to design?

Going forward, what are your most important takeaways from this summary? How will you apply them to your own life?
