## Exercise: Break Down an Ordinary Action

The seven stages of action happen automatically for easy, routine tasks, but thinking through them consciously is a helpful tool for evaluating design. Let’s practice this now.

* * *

Assume that your goal for today was to sit down and read this summary (congratulations, you’ve already succeeded!). The next stages are plan and specify, which help us bridge the gulf of execution. (Remember, the plan stage is where we consider all possible options, and the specify stage is where we select one of those options to try.) List three ways you could have accomplished the goal of reading this summary. Which one did you act on?

Since you’re reading this, we know you met your goal—the gulf of evaluation has been bridged. Now let’s apply this process to a task you haven’t completed yet. Think of a small goal you’d like to accomplish by the end of today. This could be as simple as making lunch, or slightly more involved, like finishing a small work project. What is your goal?

List three different possible ways you could accomplish your small goal. Which of these options will you choose?

Once you act on your plan, you’ll need to bridge a new gap: the gulf of evaluation. How will you know when you’ve achieved your goal? (For example, if your goal was to eat lunch, the feeling of no longer being hungry might be a way to measure success.)

How did it feel to break down a simple task into such tiny steps? Were any of the steps more difficult to identify than others?
