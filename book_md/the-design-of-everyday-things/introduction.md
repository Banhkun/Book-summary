## Introduction

Every man-made object, environment, or program in our world is designed. From doorknobs to smartphone apps, design pervades our lives to the point that it often becomes completely invisible. When we struggle with one of these designs, we assume that our difficulties are our own fault, or that we’re just not smart enough to figure it out. But that blame is misplaced. **More often than not, the true culprit in cases of “human error” is actually bad design.**

Traditionally, design is described in terms of form and function—how an object looks, and how it works. But this description totally ignores the question of how users interact with the design, and that oversight is a common reason why products fail. An object can be extremely useful and visually beautiful, but if the average user can’t figure out how to work it, it’s ultimately useless.

The first edition of this book was released in 1988 under the title _The Psychology of Everyday Things_. It was considered controversial at the time, and engineers and designers resisted the idea that understanding psychology was important for design. This revised edition was released in 2013 and contains updated examples and a few added principles, but the main ideas are the same. The author, Don Norman, is both a cognitive psychologist and an engineer. He was one of the first people to formally point out the overlap between the two fields, and to highlight the importance of considering user experience.

  * (Shortform note: The word “technology” appears frequently in both the book and this summary. In this context, it refers to any object created by humans, not just those with computer systems. So a smartphone is an example of technology, but so is a basketball.)



User interaction is a two-way relationship between a person and an object. In the first two chapters, we’ll explore the ways that relationship is impacted both by the design of the object and by the user’s thoughts and emotions. Chapter 3 explores the role of human memory for product design, while Chapters 4 and 5 discuss specific ways that good design can guide user experience and prevent dangerous errors. In the final two chapters, we’ll learn more about the ideal product design process and the way real-world pressures force designers to compromise that ideal. The summary concludes with a look to the future of user interaction in an increasingly digital world.
