## Chapter 2.1: Conscious and Subconscious Processing

This chapter gives an overview of the conscious and subconscious mental processes that determine how we perceive, interpret, and respond to objects in our environment. Traditionally, studying human cognition, emotion, and behavior is the domain of psychologists, and many designers underestimate the importance of understanding human behavior. They assume that their experience with their own thoughts and emotions is more than enough to predict how other people will think and feel in a given situation. But because the bulk of human cognitive processing happens on an unconscious level, our own experiences of our conscious thoughts only show part of the picture.

Every designed object or system will ultimately be used by people. **A product that is technically perfectly engineered but is confusing to use is ultimately a failure.** In other words, understanding the thoughts and emotions that underlie our interactions with technology has important implications for design.

### Evaluating Behavior With The Seven Stages of Action

When we interact with a new object, we have two problems to solve: “How do I use this?” and “Did that work?” Author Don Norman calls these “the gulf of execution” and “the gulf of evaluation."

  * **The Gulf of Execution** refers to the process of figuring out what an object does and how to use it. This can happen either before using the object or while trying it out. Affordances, signifiers, and mapping are tools designers use to help users bridge this gulf. 
  * **The Gulf of Evaluation** occurs after using an object and refers to the process of evaluating what the device did and whether that action matched our goals. Feedback and accurate mental models are the most helpful tools for bridging this gulf. ****



#### The Seven Stages of Action

The gulfs above are important because they represent the two components of an action: execution and evaluation. We can break these down even further for a total of seven stages that take us from the impetus of an action all the way through to successful completion. (If seven distinct steps seems excessive, remember that for _most_ actions in our daily lives, these stages play out completely unconsciously. We only become aware of them for tasks that are unfamiliar or confusing.)

A great example of this is driving a car. Experienced drivers make turns and merge into traffic without much conscious thought. The stages of action have become automatic through repetition, only requiring thought when something novel comes up, like construction blocking a particular road. New drivers, on the other hand, consciously think through every step. Where an experienced driver might think “I need to turn left," a new driver would think “I need to slow down, check my mirrors, check for oncoming traffic, turn the wheel, hit the gas pedal with just the right amount of force, then turn the wheel back again.”

**The seven stages of action are: goal, plan, specify, perform, perceive, interpret, compare.** These steps carry the user across the gulfs of both execution and evaluation. The first stage, “goal," sets the standard that will be used later to determine if the action was successful. The next three stages (plan, specify, perform) bridge the Gulf of Execution, while the final three stages (perceive, interpret, compare) bridge the Gulf of Evaluation. Each of these stages answers a particular question:

  1. Goal: What result do I want to achieve?
  2. Plan: What options do I have for achieving my goal?
  3. Specify: Which of these options will I choose?
  4. Perform: How do I execute my plan?
  5. Perceive: What happened when I did that?
  6. Interpret: What does that result mean?
  7. Compare: Did I reach my goal?

Let’s use the driving example again to see the seven steps in action. In that case, they may look something like this:

  1. Goal: I need to go grocery shopping. 
  2. Plan: Should I drive to the store or take the bus?
  3. Specify: I think I’ll drive. 
  4. Perform: I’ll follow the usual route to the store instead of a new one.
  5. Perceive: Everything went smoothly and I’ve parked at the store.
  6. Interpret: This means I can now go inside and shop.
  7. Compare: I’ve met my goal of going grocery shopping!



In the example above, the action was successful in achieving the goal. However, the goal of going grocery shopping is part of an overall system that includes both larger and smaller goals. For example, if I’m making a particular recipe but don’t have an ingredient I need, going grocery shopping would become a subgoal of my overall goal of making that recipe. Grocery shopping itself would have multiple subgoals: locating each ingredient in the store, loading the groceries back into the car, and so on.

### Conscious vs. Subconscious Processing

This section gives an overview of the different ways people cognitively process thoughts and emotions. This subject is almost never included in traditional design or engineering training, but it’s important to understand because it is the core of user experience. **People react to technology in their lives through thoughts and emotions, and good design can capitalize on those reactions.** To do that well, designers need an accurate working model of how the human brain processes information.

Generally speaking, people are only consciously aware of a small portion of their thoughts and emotions. The rest of our opinions, decisions, emotions, and reactions happen without any conscious input. When we learn a new skill, we need conscious focus at first, but once we fully master the skill and make it a frequent habit, performing requires less and less conscious effort until it is fully subconscious. **The process of mastering a skill to the point that it can be executed subconsciously is called “overlearning."** Think of the new driver compared to the experienced driver—the new driver is actively concentrating, while the experienced driver can safely carry on a conversation or sing along to the radio.

(Overlearning applies to complex skills like driving, walking, and learning a language, but can also apply to factual information. For example, if you’re filling out a form and are asked for your phone number, you’ll most likely be able to answer without much effort. But if you’re asked for the address of the second house you ever lived in, it will take you much longer to come up with the answer.)

Conscious and subconscious processing each have important strengths. Conscious processing is what sets humans apart from animals. It allows us to compare options, predict possible outcomes, and come up with new ideas. **Conscious processing happens when we deliberately choose to learn or consider something new.**

Subconscious processing, on the other hand, happens automatically. This is how we make connections between seemingly unrelated events in our lives, or jump to premature conclusions based on our past experiences. **Subconscious processing works in generalizations** —it automatically predicts that new experiences will follow the same pattern as similar previous experiences.

Both conscious and subconscious processing are tied to emotions. Emotions trigger biochemical reactions that prompt the brain to focus more on one type of processing than the other. Generally speaking, negative emotions like fear shut down conscious processing and divert resources to subconscious survival instincts. On the other hand, positive, calm emotions allow for the use of conscious processes like creativity, since the brain is not responding to a perceived threat. This is why we react to strong feelings of fear with a fight, flight, or freeze response. All three of these possible responses are completely subconscious—we can’t consciously choose one, and we have very little conscious control over them once they appear.

The strength of an emotion also matters: Strong emotions bias the brain toward subconscious processes, while more mild feelings leave room for conscious thought to intervene.

#### Three Levels of Processing

(Shortform note: This section gives a basic overview of Norman’s way of thinking about the ways humans process thoughts and emotions. For a more detailed look at his thoughts on the subject, see his book _Emotional Design_.)

The study of human cognition and emotion is an extremely complex area of neuroscience. A simplified model of this process is helpful for understanding the basic ideas and their implications for design. This model divides emotional and cognitive processing into three distinct levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective. Each of these levels has important implications for design, so understanding them is crucial in order to design technology that is easy to use and to enjoy.

##### The Visceral Level

**The visceral level involves our most primitive reflexes, like startling at a loud noise or flinching when something flies towards us unexpectedly.** This happens in the lowest part of our brains, the same area responsible for basic functions like breathing and balancing upright.

The visceral level controls the fight, flight, and freeze responses by signaling the muscles and heart to behave in particular ways. For example, the bodily signature of a flight response is a racing heartbeat and increased muscle tension. This happens in response to a fearful stimulus, but the process can also work in the opposite direction. If your heart is racing and your muscles are tense from exertion or excitement, you might mistakenly perceive that combination of sensations as a flight response, and become fearful as a result. Our emotions and perceptions influence our bodies, and vice versa.

Processing at the visceral level is completely subconscious. It can’t be influenced by learning, except for basic processes like adaptation (for example, if you work in an environment with frequent bursts of loud noise, your automatic startle response to that stimulus may decrease over time as your brain learns that sudden loud noises don’t always mean danger).

This level of processing is especially important for designers to understand. Visceral reactions can have a powerful influence on how users respond to an object. **An otherwise well-designed product can fail if it provokes a negative visceral response** in the user (like with a sudden, blaring alarm, or an unpleasant odor.)

##### The Behavioral Level

The behavioral level also primarily deals with subconscious processing. This might seem counterintuitive, since we typically choose our behaviors and can observe them consciously. But **the behavioral level of processing is not concerned with _why_ we act the way we do, but _how._**

For example, if you want to speak, you have to control your lips, tongue, and jaw in very specific ways to produce the right sounds. You might consciously choose what you want to say, but most of us don’t actively will our mouths to make certain shapes. The same applies to wiggling your fingers or opening a drawer-- we’re not conscious of the neurological processes involved in those actions. We decide what to do, and our brains subconsciously forward the message to the correct body parts.

(Unlike the visceral level, responses at the behavioral level can be learned and changed. This is where _overlearning_ comes in—when we practice something over and over until it becomes a habit, we’ve moved that skill from a conscious level to the subconscious behavioral level. Now, when the associated trigger pops up, we carry out that action without any conscious thought. Overlearning is an important factor in understanding human error, which is covered more thoroughly in Chapter 5.)

Behavioral processing also has implications for design. **By definition, behavioral responses have a specific expectation attached.** If you open your laptop and press the power button, you expect it to turn on. When you turn a doorknob and push, you expect the door to open. These expectations are crucial for designers to understand because they have such a huge impact on emotional responses. When our expectations are not met, we typically experience frustration or disappointment; when they are met or exceeded, we experience satisfaction and pleasure. In turn, these emotions strongly influence how we think and feel about the experience of interacting with a given object.

We often make these associations without realizing it. If your laptop reliably powers on each time you expect it to, you learn to associate the laptop with satisfaction and confirmed expectations. If the door frequently doesn’t open when you expect it to (perhaps because it lacks the necessary signifiers), you associate that type of door with frustration and annoyance.

**The most important design tool for managing user expectations is feedback.** If an experience defies our expectations, we might feel helpless or confused about how to proceed, ultimately influencing how we think and feel about the experience. Feedback mitigates this damage by explaining what went wrong, allowing users to regain a sense of control. Even better, if feedback gives us information about the problem and how to fix it, we’re much less likely to experience feelings of helplessness or confusion.

##### The Reflective Level

The reflective level is the level of conscious processing. Where visceral and behavioral processing happens instinctively and immediately, **reflective processing is deliberate** and therefore much slower. The reflective level allows us to brainstorm, consider alternatives, exercise logic and creativity, examine a new idea, and, as the name implies, reflect back on past experiences.

Emotion plays an important role at this level as well. Where the visceral and behavioral levels deal with subconscious, automatic emotional responses, **the reflective level provokes emotional responses based on our own interpretation of an experience.** For example, while fear is an automatic visceral response, anxiety about possible future events is a reflective response. Anxiety arises from our ability to predict possible futures based on current trends. But this is the same process that underlies feelings like excitement and anticipation. Our own interpretation of our predictions decides which of these emotions we experience.

Another example of this effect is the difference between guilt and pride. In order for us to feel either of these emotions, we have to believe we’re directly responsible for the outcome of a situation. If we judge the outcome of that situation positively, we’re more likely to feel pride. If we judge the outcome negatively, we’re more likely to feel guilt.

This kind of reflective processing has a strong impact on how we think about design. The act of reflecting involves synthesizing information from the other two levels into a cohesive memory of an experience. While visceral and behavioral processing is concerned only with the present, reflective processing looks back at the past and uses that information to make predictions about the future.

In a practical context, this means that **_memory_ is often the most important factor in determining how a user feels about the experience of interacting with a given object.** If the object provoked pleasant visceral reactions and met our expectations, we’ll remember the experience positively. In cases where visceral and behavioral reactions conflict, reflective processing determines which of these factors we give more weight to and ultimately decides whether we remember the experience as positive or negative.

  * For example, if an alarm clock keeps perfect time and is easy to use, but the alarm sound itself is so loud and jarring that you wake up each morning thinking the house is on fire, the memory of that visceral response might make you view the interaction negatively and avoid that specific clock (or brand) in the future. 



#### Optimizing the Three Levels

The most successful designs address issues at all three of these levels, leaving users with a pleasant memory of the experience and a positive view of the design. Traditionally, designers, artists, and architects are trained to focus on the visceral level, creating aesthetically beautiful projects that provoke an immediate positive response. Engineers, on the other hand, focus on the reflective level, creating projects that function based on logic and higher reasoning.

This is one reason common objects are so often confusing or disappointing to use. The ultramodern, solid glass door described in Chapter 1 might provoke a positive visceral response, but the lack of a clear, logical way to interact with it creates confusion at the reflective level. At the other extreme, medical equipment is often designed purely to perform a specific function. These machines might be incredibly technologically sophisticated, but the confusing or sterile aesthetic can trigger a visceral fear response in patients.

**The three levels of processing also map onto the seven stages of action.** The second and last of the seven stages (“plan” and “compare”) happen at the reflective level, as they involve consciously setting goals and evaluating results. The “specify” and “interpret” stages happen at the behavioral level, involving a mix of conscious and unconscious processing. The “perform” and “perceive” stages happen immediately before and after the action itself, and are processed subconsciously on the visceral level.

##### Example: Flow States

To understand the importance of this overlap, let’s look at the concept of _flow_. The term “flow,” coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, refers to a cognitive and emotional state in which a person is _completely_ absorbed in an activity. When in a state of flow, people are so engrossed in an activity that they completely shut out the outside environment and often lose track of time.

**Flow states are created at the behavioral level of processing**. Remember that the behavioral level involves subconscious expectations—we expect a certain outcome to follow a certain action, and when that doesn’t happen, we tend to get frustrated. People are most likely to be in flow when the task they’re working on is just slightly above their skill level.

When an overly easy task satisfies our expectations immediately, with very little effort, the lack of challenge leaves us feeling bored. On the other hand, an overly difficult task is likely to be so overwhelming that our expectations are repeatedly unmet, so we get frustrated and give up. **Tasks that trigger flow states strike the perfect balance between ease and frustration (or between met and unmet expectations).** The tension between these two emotions powerfully captures our attention and pulls us into a state of flow.

Although flow is a personal experience and no one design can trigger a flow state for every single user, it’s still a powerful force in shaping user experience. Users in a state of flow spend hours at a time engaging with a product and will associate it with a feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment. Those positive experiences are likely to create happy, loyal customers. In other words, helping users get into a state of flow is good for the bottom line.

So, what does this have to do with design? **Since the design of technology has a direct impact on how users engage with it, changing certain design factors can maximize the chance of creating a specific internal response for the user, including a state of flow.** To do this successfully, we need to understand both the three levels of processing and the seven stages of action.

  * First, we need to know which of the three levels is responsible for processing the desired emotion (in this case, the fact that being in flow is determined by _expectations_ tells us we are dealing with the behavioral level). 
  * Next, we need to know which of the stages of action are involved (in this case, “specify” and “interpret”), since these stages tell us what specific activities influence that level of processing. In other words, understanding the levels of processing tells us _where_ design can intervene, and understanding the seven stages of action tells us _how_.
