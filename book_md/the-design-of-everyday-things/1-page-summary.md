## 1-Page Summary

Every man-made object, environment, or program in our world is designed. From doorknobs to smartphone apps, design pervades our lives to the point that it often becomes completely invisible. When we struggle with one of these designs, we assume that our difficulties are our own fault, or that we’re just not smart enough to figure it out. But that blame is misplaced. More often than not, the true culprit in cases of “human error” is actually bad design.

In _The Design of Everyday Things_ (originally released in 1988 under the title _The Psychology of Everyday Things_ and revised in 2013), cognitive psychologist and engineer Don Norman explores the ways people understand and interact with the physical environment (this is sometimes referred to as “user experience”). In doing so, he makes all of us smarter consumers and helps designers create products that work _with_ users, rather than against them.

### Interacting With Objects

At its core, design is any human influence on the physical world. This applies to everything from ancient architectural marvels to the layout of clothes in your closet.

When we interact with design, we’re guided by the principles of _discoverability_ and _understanding_. **Discoverability** refers to whether a user can figure out what an object is and how to use it without considerable effort. Discoverability answers the question, “How do I use this thing?” **Understanding** , in this context, refers to the user’s ability to make meaning out of the discoverable features of the object. Understanding answers the questions, “What is this, and why do I want to use it in the first place?”

Focusing on these factors is a hallmark of human-centered design, which is a design philosophy that flips the traditional design process on its head by **focusing on human needs and behaviors _first_ **and designing products to fit those needs, rather than designing a product and hoping that users figure out how to use it.

#### How Do We Know How to Use an Object?

To design for human needs, we need to understand how people interact with design. There are six design principles that influence how we interact with an object: affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback, models, and the system image.

**Affordances** are the finite number of ways in which a user can possibly interact with a given object. They answer the question, “What is this thing _for_?” For example, chairs typically have a flat surface, which we intuitively recognize as an indicator of support. In other words, the look of a chair suggests that it is _for_ sitting on.

**Signifiers** are signals that draw the user’s attention to an affordance they may not have intuitively discovered, like a “click here” button on a website or a “push” sign on a door. **For designers, signifiers are more important than affordances** : The most sophisticated technology is pretty useless if a user can’t find the “on” button.

**Mapping** uses the position of two objects to communicate the relationship between them. For example, if you see a row of three lights and a panel of three switches, natural mapping would mean the position of the switch corresponds to the position of the light it controls. Mapping is not universal since culture can influence how we think about direction and spatial relationships.

**Feedback** is a sensory signal that alerts the user that what they’re doing to an object is having some effect. Feedback can tell us when something is working as expected, but more importantly, when it’s _not_ working how we want. In a car, a dashboard alert light or the sound of squeaking brakes are both sources of feedback that let us know something is wrong.

**Models** (also called conceptual models or mental models) are mental images of an object and how it works based on affordances, signifiers, mapping, and feedback. Mental models stem from the universal instinct to organize information into cohesive stories. But these stories are not always accurate, and false mental models of a design can cause confusion.

  * For example, many people have an inaccurate model of their home thermostat. They assume the thermostat controls a valve that opens a certain amount based on the setting, and that setting it higher will warm the room faster. In reality, most thermostats are a simple on/off switch, so setting a higher temperature has no effect on how fast the room warms up.



**The System Image** is the sum total of the information we have about an object, including both its physical properties and information from user manuals, product websites, or past experience. The system image is the only way designers can communicate their model of how something works to the user.

### Cognition, Emotion, and Behavior

The way we think clearly influences how we interact with objects, but designers often underestimate the role of psychology in user interaction.

#### The Seven Stages of Action

When we interact with an object, we face two “gulfs” of understanding: **the Gulf of Execution** , (figuring out what an object does and how to use it) and **the Gulf of Evaluation** (evaluating results after using the object). To cross these gulfs, we use a seven stage action cycle. This action cycle happens unconsciously unless we’re interacting with an unfamiliar or confusing object. Each stage answers a particular question.

  1. Goal: What result do I want to achieve?
  2. Plan: What options do I have for achieving my goal?
  3. Specify: Which of these options will I choose?
  4. Perform: How do I execute my plan?
  5. Perceive: What happened when I did that?
  6. Interpret: What does that result mean?
  7. Compare: Did I reach my goal?



Let’s use grocery shopping as an example to see the seven steps in action. In that case, they may look something like this:

  1. Goal: I need to go grocery shopping. 
  2. Plan: Should I drive to the store or take the bus?
  3. Specify: I think I’ll drive. 
  4. Perform: I’ll follow the usual route to the store instead of a new one.
  5. Perceive: Everything went smoothly and I’ve parked at the store.
  6. Interpret: This means I can now go inside and shop.
  7. Compare: I’ve met my goal of going grocery shopping!



This cycle will play out multiple times for any given action because most behaviors have both an overall goal (like “go grocery shopping”) composed of several subgoals (“start the car”). Determining the overall goal is important because it gives designers a better idea of what users really want. To do this, we use **_root cause analysis_ , or continually asking “why?” about a behavior until there is no further answer. **The root cause of a behavior might be internal goal-driven (studying for a test) or external event-driven (putting in earplugs in a noisy environment).

#### Conscious vs. Subconscious Processing

People react to technology in their lives through thoughts and emotions, and good design can capitalize on those reactions. To do that well, designers need an accurate working model of how the brain processes information.

There are two types of cognitive processing: conscious and subconscious. Conscious processing is deliberate: It’s where we compare options, predict possible outcomes, and come up with new ideas. Subconscious processing is automatic and works in generalizations. It’s the home of pattern recognition and snap judgments.

We can think of these differences in terms of three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and reflective.

  * **The visceral level** is subconscious and involves our most primitive reflexes, like startling at a loud noise or flinching when something flies towards us unexpectedly. Visceral reactions can have a powerful influence on how users respond to an object. An otherwise well-designed product can fail if it provokes a negative visceral response in the user (like with a sudden, blaring alarm, or an unpleasant odor.)
  * **The behavioral level** is the home of the subconscious process of turning thought into action. It fills the gap between intention (like speaking) and action (moving your lips, tongue, and jaw in specific ways). This level is important in design because it functions based on expectations—if you flip a light switch, you subconsciously expect a light to turn on. If it doesn’t, your ability to process the action is interrupted by bad design.
  * **The reflective level** is where conscious processing happens. This is where we interpret information from the other levels and use those conclusions to make decisions. If a product “rubs us the wrong way” on the visceral level, the reflective level might evaluate that information and consciously decide not to use that product again.
    * For example, if an alarm clock keeps perfect time and is easy to use, but the alarm sound itself is so loud and jarring that you wake up each morning thinking the house is on fire, the memory of that visceral response might make you view the interaction negatively and avoid that specific clock (or brand) in the future. 



#### Memory

Memory also impacts our interactions with objects. There are two kinds of knowledge: “knowledge in the head” (memory) and “knowledge in the world," which is anything we don’t have to remember because it’s contained in the environment (like the letters printed on keyboard keys). Putting knowledge into the world frees up space in our memories and makes it easier to use an object.

**The knowledge we keep in our heads is only as precise as the environment requires**. Most people won’t notice if you change the silhouette on an American penny because we only need to remember the color and size to tell a penny apart from other coins. We’re more likely to notice changes to the portrait on an American dollar bill, because we’re used to relying on that image to help us tell bills apart (since they are identical in size, shape, and color).

Memories can be stored either short- or long-term. Short-term memory is the automatic storage of recent information. We can store about five to seven items in short-term memory at a time, but if we lose focus, those memories quickly disappear. This is important for design: Any design that requires the user to remember something is likely to cause errors.

Long-term memory isn’t limited by time or number of items, but memories are stored subjectively. Meaningful things are easy to remember; arbitrary things are not. To remember arbitrary things, we need to impose our own meaning through mnemonics or approximate mental models. Designers can make this easier for users by making arbitrary information map onto existing mental models (for example, think of the way Apple has kept the location of the power and volume buttons relatively the same with each new version of the iPhone.)

### The Error of “Human Error”

Industry professionals estimate that between 75 and 95 percent of industrial accidents are attributed to human error. This number is misleading, since what we think of as “human errors” are more likely outcomes of a system that has been unintentionally designed to _create_ error, rather than prevent it.

#### Detecting Errors

Errors can be divided into “slips” (errors of _doing_) and “mistakes” (errors of _thinking_). Accidentally putting salt instead of sugar in your coffee is a slip—your thinking was correct, but the action went awry. Pressing the wrong button on a new remote control is a mistake—you carried out the action fine, but your thought about the button’s function was wrong.

**Most everyday errors are slips,** since they happen during the subconscious transition from thinking to doing. Slips happen more frequently to experts than beginners, since beginners are consciously thinking through each step of a task. On the other hand, mistakes are more likely to happen in brand new scenarios where we have no prior experience to pull from, or even familiar scenarios if we misread the situation.

#### Causes of Error

One major cause of error is that our technology is engineered for “perfect” humans who never lose focus, get tired, forget information, or get interrupted. Unfortunately, these humans don’t exist. Interruptions in particular are a major source of error, especially in high-risk environments like medicine and aviation.

Social and economic pressures also cause error. The larger the system, the more expensive it is to shut down to investigate and fix errors. As a result, people overlook errors and make questionable decisions to save time and money. If conditions line up in a certain way, what starts as a small error can escalate into disastrous consequences.

  * Social and economic pressures played a critical role in the Tenerife airport disaster, when a plane taking off before receiving clearance crashed into another plane taxiing down the runway at the wrong time. The first plane had already been delayed, and the captain decided to take off early to get ahead of a heavy fog rolling in, ignoring the objections of the first officer. The crew of the second plane questioned the unusual order from air traffic control to taxi on the runway, but obeyed anyway. Social hierarchy and economic pressure led _both_ crews to make critical mistakes, ultimately costing 583 lives.



#### Preventing Errors

Good design can minimize errors in many ways. One approach is **resilience engineering** , which focuses on building robust systems where error is expected and prepared for in advance. There are three main tenets of resilience engineering.

  1. Consider _all_ the systems involved in product development (including social systems).
  2. Test under real-life conditions, even if it means shutting down parts of a system.
  3. Test continuously, not as a means to an end, since situations are always changing.



##### Constraints

Designers can also use **constraints** , which limit the ways users can interact with an object. There are four main types of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.

**Physical constraints** are physical qualities of an object that limit the ways it can interact with users or other objects. The shape and size of a key is a physical constraint that determines the types of locks the key can fit into. Childproof caps on medicine bottles are physical constraints that limit the type of users who can open the bottle.

**Cultural constraints** are the “rules” of society that help us understand how to interact with our environment. For example, when we see a traditional doorknob, we expect that whatever surface it’s attached to is a door that can be opened. This isn’t caused by the design of the doorknob, but by the cultural **convention** that says “knobs open doors."

When these agreements about how things are done are codified into law or official literature, they become **standards**. We rely on standards when design alone isn’t enough to make sure everyone knows the “rules” of a situation (for example, the layout of numbers on an analog clock is standardized so that we can read any clock, anywhere in the world).

Although they’re less common, semantic and logical constraints are still important. **Semantic constraints** dictate whether information is meaningful. This is why we can ignore streetlights while driving, but still notice brake lights—we’ve assigned meaning to brake lights (“stop!”), so we know to pay attention and react.

Logical constraints make use of fundamental logic (like process of elimination) to guide behavior. For example, if you take apart the plumbing beneath a sink drain to fix a leak, then discover an extra part leftover after you’ve reassembled the pipes, you know you’ve done something wrong because, logically, all the parts that came out should have gone back in.

### The Design Thinking Process

**“Design thinking”** is the process of examining a situation to discover the root problem, exploring possible solutions to that problem, testing those solutions, and making improvements based on those tests. This process is _iterative_ , which means it is repeated as many times as necessary, each time with slight improvements based on previous iterations.

Design thinking involves two tasks: finding the right problem and finding the right solution. Designers are often hired to solve symptoms, but good designers dig deeper to find the underlying problem before coming up with solutions. To do this, designers run through four stages: **observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing**. This process is repeated as many times as necessary to develop the final product.

The **observation** phase involves gathering information on the people who will use the new design. This is different from market research:**** Designers want to know what people need and how they might use certain products, while marketers want to know which groups of people are most likely to buy the product.

After observation comes the **idea generation** phase, where designers brainstorm solutions to the problem. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible without censoring “silly” ideas, since they might spark valuable discussion. Designers will then create **prototypes** of the most promising ideas using things like sketches and cardboard models.

Once the prototype is refined, the **testing** phase begins, where members of the target user group are asked to try out the prototype and give their feedback. Designers then repeat the entire process based on the feedback from the first round of testing. The iterative design thinking process emphasizes testing in small batches with refinement in between rather than waiting until the final product and testing with a much larger group.

### Design Thinking in the Real World

In reality, the design process often doesn’t live up to the above ideal. Business pressures are the primary culprit here, since a well-designed product will still fail if it’s over budget and past deadlines. Product development team dynamics are also a challenge. The best teams are multidisciplinary, combining unique knowledge from different fields. However, each team member usually thinks their discipline is the most important.

Diversity among users can also impact design. For users with disabilities, designers can turn to a **universal design** approach. Universal design creates products that are usable by the widest range of people by designing for the highest need, not the average need. Adopting a universal design approach changes how designers choose the types of people and environments to observe as well as the features they focus on most in the prototyping and testing phases.

This approach is “universal” because if a product, environment, or service is designed with disability access in mind, it will typically also be usable for those without disabilities. For example, curb cuts were originally designed for wheelchair users but are also enormously helpful for anyone pushing a stroller or lugging a suitcase.

#### Technological Innovation

Economic pressures drive innovation. This can take the form of **“featuritis,"** or the tendency to add more and more features to a product to keep up with competitors. These features ultimately degrade the design quality of the original product. Rather than winning over customers with new features, it’s better to do one thing better than anyone else on the market.

Real quality innovation can be either radical or incremental. Radical innovation involves high-risk, game-changing ideas while incremental innovation makes small improvements to existing products over time. The invention of the automobile was radical—all the small improvements that led to cars as we know them today happened incrementally.

### The Future of Technology

Rapid technological innovation raises questions about the future of user experience. The way we interact with objects around us will certainly change in response to new technologies, and cultural conventions will change to reflect that. But human _needs_ will remain the same. For example, the keyboard has evolved from mechanical typewriters to computer keyboards to touchscreen versions, but the need to record written information has stayed the same. **In other words, human needs won’t change, but the way they’re satisfied will.**

Some people fear that the rise of smart technology is making humans _less_ intelligent because we can delegate even the most basic tasks to machines—and if those machines fail, we are totally helpless. It’s true that some traditional skills are becoming obsolete thanks to new technology, but that process ultimately makes us _smarter_. The energy saved by not having to create a fire every time we need heat or light or rely on long division for simple calculations can be channeled into higher-level pursuits. **Our intelligence hasn’t changed, only the tasks we apply it to.** The key is in using technology to do the jobs technology can and _should_ do.

#### Increased Creation and Consumption

Technological innovation has made it easier than ever for anyone with a computer to create and publish new media. While amateur content creation has gotten easier, creating professional content has gotten harder and more expensive. The accessibility of smart technology levels the playing field, but makes it much harder to find quality, fact-checked content.

For manufacturers, new technologies present a different challenge. The need to entice buyers is a fundamental part of business, because a product that doesn’t sell is a failure, no matter how well designed it is. **But while services like healthcare and food distribution are self-sustaining (because there will always be a need for them), durable physical goods are not.** If everyone who needs a particular product purchases one, there’s no one left to sell it to; If everyone already owns a smartphone, how do you convince them to buy the new and improved model?

One way manufacturers get around this is through _planned obsolescence_ , the practice of designing products that will break down after a certain amount of time and need to be replaced. This creates a cycle of consumption: buy something, use it until it breaks, throw it away, and buy another. While this cycle is good for business, the waste it generates is horrible for the environment. Thankfully, the combination of new technologies and a growing cultural awareness of sustainability issues is creating a new paradigm. The future of technology involves products designed with both the user and the environment in mind.
