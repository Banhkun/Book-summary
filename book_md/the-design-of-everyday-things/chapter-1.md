## Chapter 1: How the Design of Physical Objects Shapes Our Lives

This chapter lays the foundation for the rest of the book by illustrating how the design of physical objects has a much bigger impact on our lives than most people assume. Poorly designed objects can cause frustration, time delays, and even injury.

### What Does “Good Design” Look Like?

At its core, design is any human influence on the physical world. We tend to think of this in terms of buildings, fashion, or products, but design is much broader than just a few fields. **Every object or environment that has been created or modified by humans is designed.** This applies to everything from ancient architectural marvels to the layout of clothes in your closet.

As technology evolves, new fields of design pop up to focus on specific problems. User interaction is important in every subfield, but it’s most often talked about in industrial, interaction, and experience design.

  * Industrial design focuses on the creation and development of physical objects, with a particular focus on function, aesthetics, and value.
  * Interaction design focuses on the interface between user and object, usually in a digital context (think website design). 
  * Experience design focuses on the emotional experience of using a product, service, or environment. 



Each of these fields focuses on redefining “good” design in terms of user experience. Two important principles guiding this definition are _discoverability_ and _understanding_. **Discoverability refers to whether a user can figure out what an object is and how to use it without considerable effort.** Discoverability answers the question, “How do I use this thing?”

  * For example, the style of a door handle and the location of the hinges make it easy to discern what that object is and how it works—it is easily discoverable. But a modern or industrial door with no visible hardware can be almost impossible to figure out. 



**Understanding, in this context, refers to the user’s ability to make meaning out of the discoverable features of the object.** Understanding answers the questions, “What is this, and why do I want to use it in the first place?” On a normal door, handles and hardware indicate where to push or pull—but they also help us understand what this object is (a door) and what it’s used for (opening and closing). In other words, **good design has to consider not only the form and function of a product, but also the experience of interacting with that product**.

### Why Good Designers Make Bad Products

If interactions are such a crucial part of good design, why do designers so often get it so wrong? There are two primary reasons for this.

  1. Traditionally, the objects and technology we interact with on a daily basis are created by engineers, who are typically logical thinkers who have been trained to focus only on function. Their goal is to create a superior product—and because they understand how to use that product, they often assume others will understand, too. In other words, **engineers create products under the false assumption that people perform like machines** —they always act logically, aren’t influenced by emotion, and rarely make errors. 
  2. Engineers and designers typically don’t have the ultimate say in all decisions about a product. They’re limited by the budget set by the company or client, by the logistical capabilities of the manufacturer, and by the needs of the marketing team. **The final product must be not only well-designed, but also possible to produce (at scale and within budget) and easy to sell.**



#### Human-Centered Design

One solution to this problem is human-centered design. Human-centered design is not a subfield like industrial or interaction design. It is a design philosophy that can be applied in any design specialization. **The goal of human-centered design is to flip the traditional design process on its head by focusing on human needs and behaviors _first_ , **and designing products to fit those needs, rather than designing a product and hoping that users figure out how to use it.

Let’s use a simple fork as an example. The traditional design process would most likely begin with a designer thinking, “I’d like to design a new kind of fork.” She would then brainstorm new versions of the fork, create sketches and prototypes of those ideas, and tweak those prototypes until she was happy with the finished product.

Instead of a concrete product idea, a human-centered design approach would begin with a set of questions: “What tools do people use to eat food? What problems do they run into with those tools? How can they be improved?” The designer would then observe different types of people eating different types of food, conduct interviews with people about their preferred cutlery, and research the history of eating utensils. She would identify the main problems in the current technology and only _then_ begin to brainstorm ideas for how to address those needs.

#### The Speed of Technological Development

Modern technology evolves exponentially faster than ever before. While previous generations may have had one phone per household that was only updated after decades of use, we now have personal cell phones, with new and improved models being released twice a year. In contrast, design practices and principles evolve _much_ slower. **This means that technology is outpacing our ability to effectively interact with it.**

This creates a paradox: Technology simplifies our lives, but the more advanced technology becomes, the more difficult it is to learn and operate, which adds complication. We see this when users buy a new, state-of-the-art television, only to be overwhelmed by the endless remote control buttons and ultimately only learning to use one or two features.

### How Do We Know How to Use an Object?

There are six design principles that influence how we interact with an object: affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback, models, and the system image. Each of these principles may be more or less relevant than the others for a specific object, but they are always present to some degree.

#### Affordances

The term “affordance” refers to the relationship between an object and a user. **Affordances are the finite number of ways in which a user can possibly interact with a given object**. They answer the question, “What is this thing _for_?”

For example, think of a chair. Chairs typically have a flat surface, which we intuitively recognize as an indicator of support, either for a person or an object. In other words, the look of a chair suggests that it is _for_ sitting on, or possibly resting objects on.

Some affordances are obvious from the appearance of the object itself, like the flat surface of the chair. Other affordances may be less intuitive or even completely hidden. For example, if the chair were light enough (and the user strong enough), throwing across the room may be another affordance of the chair. Similarly, if the chair had a well-hidden secret compartment, hiding objects __ would be an affordance of the chair, regardless of whether the user discovers the drawer or not. The key is that it is a _possible_ interaction.

Affordances can be deliberately designed—by nature, a chair is designed for sitting, a coat rack is designed to hold coats, and a stair railing is designed to prevent falls. But**affordances can also arise completely by accident.** The chair could also be used as a step stool, the coat rack as a child’s climbing gym, or the railing as a bookshelf. These aren’t the uses the designer had in mind, but they are equally valid affordances.

However, affordances are not merely properties of the object itself. Instead, they describe the _relationship_ between the object and the user. This means that **without a user to interact with, an object has no affordances**. It also means that affordances for the same object can vary between different users. Think back to the chair example. If the user is a toddler, crawling under might be another affordance of the chair. But if the user is a large adult, crawling under is not a possible interaction between the user and the chair. The chair remains the same, but the affordance changes based on the different characteristics of the user.

#### Signifiers

The idea of hidden affordances highlights the need for signifiers. **A signifier is a signal that draws the user’s attention to an affordance they may not have intuitively discovered.** In a digital context, a “click here” button or flashing icon are possible signifiers. In the example below, the “push” sign is a signifier. It contrasts with the perceived affordance of the handles (pulling), which may cause confusion.

![the-design-of-everyday-things-1.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-1.jpg)

Affordances and signifiers are easy to mix up, and even seasoned designers sometimes use one word when they really mean the other. The key difference is that affordances describe the _possible_ interactions between object and user, whereas signifiers are a way of advertising those affordances (for example, if you take the “push” sign off a door, the door will still open when pushed. You've removed the signifier, but not the affordance). **For designers, signifiers are more important than affordances.** The most sophisticated technology is pretty useless if a user can’t find the ‘on’ button.

#### Mapping

For some simple objects or interfaces, signifiers alone will give the user enough information to use the object successfully. However, more complex objects might also require the use of mapping in order to be usable. **Mapping uses the position of two objects to communicate the relationship between them.** It’s the simplest way to show the user which controls correspond to which affordances.

For example, picture the knobs on a stovetop. How do you know which knob operates which burner? If the stove is well-designed, the arrangement of the knobs will map onto the arrangement of the burners (typically a square). In that case, if you want to turn on the bottom left burner, you intuitively reach for the bottom left knob.

This stovetop example is notorious among designers because effective mapping of knobs to burners is so rare. When most of us picture a stovetop and its controls, we picture the burners arranged in a square, but the knobs arranged in a line. In this setup, the user has to invest far more time and mental energy to figure out which knob controls which burner, and may have to resort to trial and error.

#### Feedback

The next clue for interacting with an object is feedback. If you’ve followed signifiers to an affordance and used mapping to figure out which control you need to use, how do you know whether you got it right? **Feedback is a sensory signal that alerts the user that what they’re doing to an object is having some effect.** Information that results from a user’s action is called “feedback”; information that shows a user how to act in the first place is called “feedforward." Feedforward guides users through the execution phase, while feedback guides them through evaluation.

Our sensory systems automatically provide basic feedback about our environment through all of our senses. We automatically process the look, feel, sound, and scent of objects around us. However, for more complex objects, feedback signals may not be automatic. In that case, designers can deliberately add in sources of feedback (like a small green bulb that lights up when a machine is “on”).

Feedback tells us when something works, but more importantly, **feedback tells us when an object is _not_ working how we need it to**. In a car, a dashboard alert light or the sound of squeaking brakes are both sources of feedback that let us know something is wrong. Without these signals, we might not recognize a major problem until it’s too late. This is especially important when the object’s function is hidden from view.

But _too much_ feedback can also cause problems. Think of a GPS system that announces every single cross street. By the time you reach the street you’re looking for, you’ve long tuned out the constant updates and are likely to miss it. The same is true of smoke alarms that can’t be easily turned off—once you’re aware of the emergency, the constant, ear-splitting beeping makes it more difficult to react appropriately.

Even the smallest decisions on the design of feedback can have enormous consequences. One notorious example of this is the Three Mile Island incident, in which a nuclear reactor at a plant in Pennsylvania suffered a partial meltdown and very nearly resulted in a disastrous radiation leak. The cause of the incident was determined to be human error, but further investigation traced the root of the problem to a single indicator light. Counterintuitively, the light would turn on when an important coolant valve was closed, and turn off when the valve was open. The confusion caused by this tiny design decision set off a chain reaction that allowed a small issue to escalate into a full-scale nuclear incident.

Clearly, feedback is important, and too much or too little can cause problems. But **the type of feedback and the way it’s presented is also crucial**. A car’s turn signal flashes on the side of the car that matches the direction the driver intends to turn. If the opposite side flashes, or both at the same time, that gives you no useful information about what the car in front of you is about to do.

#### Models

So far, we know that affordances tell us what an object is for, signifiers tell us what and where those affordances are, mapping helps us find the right controls to engage with those affordances, and feedback tells us whether everything is working right. All of this information produces a model (also called a mental model or conceptual model). **A model is a mental picture of an object and how it works.**

##### Example: Refrigerator Controls

The design of an object itself suggests a certain conceptual model. For example, some refrigerators have two temperature control knobs, one labeled “freezer” and the other “refrigerator." These are two separate knobs, which implies that the temperature of each section is controlled completely independently.

![the-design-of-everyday-things-2.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-2.png)

Seeing this, you’d probably assume that the refrigerator and the freezer each contain an independent temperature sensor that controls an independent cooling mechanism. This mental model would look something like this:

![the-design-of-everyday-things-3.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-3.png)

However, in reality, this fridge contains only one cooling unit. The knobs control a central valve that adjusts how much cold air is blown into each section of the refrigerator. This means that adjusting _one_ knob will change the temperature in _both_ the freezer and the refrigerator. So, if the freezer were too cold, adjusting the freezer knob would warm that section up, but would also funnel more cold air into the refrigerator below, cooling that section even further. This model looks more like this:

![the-design-of-everyday-things-4.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-4.jpg)

In this example, an inaccurate mental model of the cooling system is likely to result in frustration (and possibly some spoiled food). But it’s not the user’s fault that their model is inaccurate—the dual knobs would lead almost anyone to the same faulty conclusion. The design itself is the problem here, not the user’s understanding of it.

#### The System Image

Signifiers, mapping, feedback, and any obvious affordances help us understand how to use an object. But we also have access to even more information that can guide our interactions with that object, like user manuals, product websites, and our own past experience with similar objects. Taken together, **the sum total of the information we have about an object is the system image**. The system image is ultimately what determines how a user interacts with an object. For designers, this means the object must speak for itself—without the designer in the room to teach them, users still need to be able to figure out how to use it.

The system image gives us another way to think about why designers sometimes make confusing or frustrating things. Engineers and designers expect that the user’s mental model of the object will perfectly match their own mental model. But a designer may have spent months working on a particular design, whereas the user has zero previous experience with that object. **The system image is the only way designers can communicate their model of how something works to the user.**
