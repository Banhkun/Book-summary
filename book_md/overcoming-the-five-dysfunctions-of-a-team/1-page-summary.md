## 1-Page Summary

“Teamwork” is one of the most common buzzwords in the modern business world, but what does it actually mean, and how do you foster it? In _Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , renowned business consultant Patrick Lencioni answers those questions and teaches you how to turn a group of individuals into a true team.

This book is a followup to Lencioni’s 2002 business fable _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_. While the earlier work focused on identifying the problems that stop people from working together effectively, _Overcoming_ teaches you how to solve those problems and explains why, according to Lencioni, all teamwork must begin with trust.__

Lencioni is an author, speaker, and consultant specializing in leadership and business management. He’s also co-founder and president of The Table Group, which specializes in executive team development and organizational well-being. Lencioni’s books about business and leadership have sold millions of copies worldwide.

In this guide, we’ll start by briefly explaining Lencioni’s definition of _team_ and why not all groups can or should be teams. We’ll then discuss each of the titular five dysfunctions (which we’ll call impairments)—distrust, lack of healthy disagreements, disunity, fear of accountability, and self-interest—and explore how you can surmount them to build a cohesive, effective team. Although this book is targeted at managers and executives (in other words, people responsible for building and running teams), its insights about teamwork and trust can benefit anyone who works closely with other people.

(Shortform note: Lencioni’s book is arguably organized logically: He begins with an overview of the five impairments, then further explores each in the order in which you should address them (for instance, overcoming the impairment of distrust first, as trust is necessary for addressing the other four impairments). In this guide, we’ve woven his descriptions of the five impairments into their respective sections for clarity and ease of reading.)

In our commentary, we’ll compare and contrast this book’s ideas with those of other popular business and leadership books, such as the business fable _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ and Lencioni’s own _Death By Meeting. _We’ll also provide some additional actionable steps you can take to implement Lencioni’s ideas.

### Introduction: Creating a Team

Lencioni starts by giving his definition of _team_ : a group of**** up to 12 people who **come together and work collectively to meet shared objectives and put the group's needs above their own.** He adds that smaller teams are often the most effective, and you should rarely—if ever—try to make a team larger than a dozen people. Groups larger than that have too many opportunities for interpersonal conflicts, making it exponentially more difficult to arrive at decisions they all agree with.

(Shortform note: In many cases, even 12 people on a team can be too many. Some reports show that the average size of an executive team of a large company is now 10, and even that’s proving to be expensive and cumbersome—team members get paid for attending meetings that often don’t concern them, and those meetings frequently run over time as the large groups try to reach a consensus that satisfies everyone. It’s therefore wise to keep your team as small as possible while making sure that all necessary roles are filled.)

Lencioni notes that it’s very difficult to get people to go against their selfish instincts and work toward collective goals. He suggests tackling this problem by creating a timeline of specific team-building activities and objectives. This team-building process should be designed so team members will get to know each other, learn to trust one another, and (as much as possible) break their habit of focusing on themselves. (We’ll further explore these ideas later in the guide.)

(Shortform note: Some experts disagree with Lencioni’s claim that humans are inherently selfish. For example, in _The Selfish Gene_ , biologist Richard Dawkins explains that most creatures—including people—have a combination of selfish and altruistic (selfless) instincts programmed into their genes. Furthermore, the reason we developed those altruistic instincts hasn’t changed much: While teamwork usually isn’t a matter of life and death anymore, the fact remains that small, cooperative groups of people are much more successful than purely selfish individuals who prioritize their needs over those of the group.)

Lencioni warns that people are likely to resist these team-building activities at first; team members will complain that they’re annoying and a waste of time. **Therefore, explain that team-building exercises are an investment.** Any time and resources you spend now will pay off many times over in the long run because of your improved teamwork.

> **Team-Building Boosts Engagement and Profits**
> 
> Some business leaders say that team-building isn’t just any investment; it’s one of the most important investments you could make. Team-building boosts employee engagement, which is good for both employee morale and the company’s profits—a recent Gallup poll estimated that US companies alone could earn an additional $450 billion to $500 billion annually by boosting engagement.
> 
> One way you can boost your team’s engagement and willingness to join in with team-building activities is to make sure they want to be part of the team in the first place. As noted in the business fable _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ , it’s important to ask people to join your team (assuming it’s something outside of their normal job duties), rather than simply assigning them to it. Your team will be more effective if the team members feel like they chose to be there.

Now that we’ve covered the basics of team-building, let’s explore the five impairments to building a strong team.

### Impairment #1: Distrust

Lencioni says that any great team is grounded in trust. However, in this case,**trust doesn’t just mean trusting your teammates to do their work. It means feeling safe around each other:** Teammates who trust each other aren’t afraid to share unusual ideas or admit to their mistakes and worries. Trust means knowing you can share anything (whether business-related or personal) with your teammates—you _trust_ that they won’t use that information to make fun of you, steal your ideas, or harm your reputation.

(Shortform note: A trusting, psychologically safe environment has numerous benefits beyond fostering teamwork. People who trust their coworkers and leaders are generally happier, more engaged, and more productive at work than those who don’t. The benefits even extend to their personal lives—people who work in trusting environments tend to be less stressed and enjoy higher life satisfaction.)

Lencioni argues that distrust is the first and most important impairment to surmount because if you and your teammates don’t trust each other, then you can’t operate as a team at all. Without trust, your “team” is actually a group of individuals: people who are more concerned about protecting their interests than tackling the problems they’re supposed to be working together to solve.

For example, suppose an insurance agent accidentally sent an email containing personal information to the wrong client. In an environment of trust, that person would**immediately admit the mistake to their teammates, and then the team could work together to minimize the damage;** perhaps by having the company pay for identity theft protection services. On the other hand, in a distrusting environment, the insurance agent would just hide their mistake and hope nothing bad happened because of it—protecting their reputation would be more important than addressing the problem.

(Shortform note: One way to build trust is to be open and transparent about everything that you and other team members are doing. If you _don’t_ share everything, it’s easy to unintentionally create an atmosphere of distrust—people are naturally alert for danger, and if they notice something happening that they haven’t been told about, they tend to feel threatened. For instance, if some team members are collaborating on a project that others aren’t involved in (because it’s not relevant to their skills or duties), the ones left out might think it’s a sign that the rest of the team dislikes or distrusts them. You could ease their worries by briefly explaining what those people are working on and why some team members aren’t needed for it.)

#### How to Build Trust in a Team

Lencioni says that, for teammates to trust each other, they first have to get to know each other. He recommends that you **start by having people share relatively safe information about themselves** —for example, their favorite book, a personal goal (work-related or otherwise), or a fun childhood memory. This will get them used to talking about themselves and will start forming interpersonal bonds between teammates.

(Shortform note: There are many lists of “icebreaker” questions available to help you start the team-building process. If you already know your team members to an extent, consider looking for questions that suit their personalities such as funny questions or thought-provoking questions.)

Lencioni says you can also strengthen people’s understanding of one another—and therefore their trust in each other—by asking everyone to use a personality profiling tool. Lencioni notes that this will give team members an external, impersonal frame of reference for understanding each other’s behavior. For example, if a test shows that someone has an impulsive personality, their teammates will know not to take it personally if that person interrupts or talks over them.

(Shortform note: Some researchers are skeptical of the accuracy of personality profile tests. In part, that’s because some of these tests haven’t been researched thoroughly enough for experts to reach a scientific consensus about them. Researchers have also observed that people’s behavior can change between one day and the next. This means that you might get totally different results from the same personality test depending on your mood.)

Lencioni warns that while trust is necessary for any team, it can be very difficult to cultivate. This is because trust requires vulnerability: **You have to be willing to expose your fears and your weaknesses, which people usually avoid doing at any cost.**

To start overcoming that self-preservation instinct, the team leader should be the first to be vulnerable by sharing something uncomfortable or embarrassing—perhaps a mistake they made as a new employee or a time when they made a minor social faux pas. By doing so, they’ll signal to the rest of the team that it’s safe to share things they normally wouldn’t.

> **Be Genuinely Vulnerable, Not Manipulative**
> 
> While sharing personal details can be an effective way to form connections and build trust, it’s important to recognize the difference between being vulnerable and oversharing. Vulnerability tends to make people admire and empathize with you while oversharing makes them uncomfortable and pushes them away.
> 
> As Brené Brown explains in _Daring Greatly_ , the difference often comes down to your intentions: Are you sharing something because you genuinely want the other person to know more about you, or are you trying to force a connection instead of taking the time to let it develop naturally? People also tend to overshare when they’re looking for attention or trying to evoke sympathy; in some cases, they’re trying to manipulate people into giving them a certain response. So, make sure that you’re sharing information out of a genuine desire to form connections with others and not just as a means to some other end (for instance, being the center of attention or getting others to do your bidding).

### Impairment #2: Lack of Healthy Disagreements

**Once your team trusts each other, they’ll be ready to start working through Lencioni’s second team impairment: a lack of healthy disagreements.** In other words, now that your team members trust each other to act in good faith, you can teach them how to disagree with each other respectfully and productively.

(Shortform note: As Lencioni says, trust is crucial for healthy disagreements because your team members need to understand that their teammates always have good intentions, even when arguments get heated. In _Difficult Conversations, _the authors describe a skill that supports this understanding: separating intent from impact. Team members should recognize that their teammates didn’t _mean_ to make them feel hurt or uncomfortable, even if they ended up feeling that way. This is especially crucial because people often subconsciously associate _bad intentions_ with _bad people_ , and they’re far less willing to cooperate with someone whom they view as a bad person.)

Lencioni notes that ideally, disagreements and disputes get a lot of different ideas out in the open so your team can thoroughly discuss them and choose the best option. **That’s why the ability to have healthy disagreements is crucial for any team.**

(Shortform note: Fostering productive healthy disagreements arguably starts with carefully selecting who’s on the team in the first place. If you’re able to choose who’s on your team, try to include people from as many different backgrounds as possible. The more diversity your team members have in their upbringings, career paths, and skill sets, the wider range of perspectives they’ll bring to the table. In turn, those different perspectives will create more healthy disagreements among the team.)

In this section, we’ll explain how to encourage healthy, constructive debates. Doing so first requires you to understand team members’ different styles of disagreement—aggressive and argumentative versus calm and logical. It often also requires guidance from the team leader during discussions. Let’s look at each of these requirements in detail.

#### Understanding Styles of Disagreement

Lencioni says that just like with building trust, you should begin the process of fostering healthy debates by helping your team members understand each other. Specifically, **have a conversation with the team about how each of them approaches disagreements.**

For example, how comfortable are each of your team members with arguing? What tactics do they tend to use in arguments—passionate appeals to emotion, calm and logical arguments, or somewhere in between? What cultural and familial influences formed the foundations of their disagreement styles?

Once you have an overall idea of how your team handles conflict, Lencioni says to establish what he calls _conflict norms_. **Work with your team to set rules and expectations for debates—** that way, they can handle disagreements in a way that’s effective and comfortable for everyone.

> **Be Aware of People-Pleasing Behavior**
> 
> While tackling Impairment #2, be aware of people-pleasers: people who are afraid of any kind of disagreement and eagerly agree with everyone. People-pleasers also tend to burn themselves out by taking on every task that’s asked of them and taking blame for things that aren’t their fault. These qualities make them very likable but are unhelpful for a team that relies on honest discussion and debate.
> 
> If you have people-pleasers on your team (or are one yourself), one conflict norm you might set is replacing “maybe” with “no.” People-pleasers will often avoid outright disagreement and instead project uncertainty about an idea or a request. If one of your team members (or you) seems afraid to commit to something, ask whether they’re really not sure about it, or if they actually disagree. If it turns out that they do disagree, remind them of the ground rule that they should say “no” with confidence—remember, you’ve already created an environment of trust where it’s safe to do so.

#### Guiding Disagreements

Lencioni says that even after you’ve established that disagreements are expected and desired and have set your conflict ground rules, **you’ll often have to encourage your team to start debates.**

First, start team meetings by telling everyone what you’ll be discussing that day, why it’s important, and what the consequences will be if the team makes a bad decision. This will ensure that your teammates are engaged and energized right from the start.

(Shortform note: In his business parable _Death By Meeting_ , Lencioni provides another tip to make sure your team gives it their all: Make the stakes personal. Don’t just talk about what the team’s decision will mean for the company in general—make sure they understand the impact it will have on them as individuals. For example, a good decision might lead to better profits for the company and therefore better bonuses for the team members.)

**You might also need to help keep the discussion going.** For example, if there’s a team member who tends to be quieter than the others, specifically ask for that person’s input from time to time. Lencioni also says that you should look for potential conflicts and try to bring them out into the open during meetings. If you suspect someone has an objection or argument that they’re holding back, encourage them to speak up.

Finally, Lencioni says that, although it’s important to encourage discussion and disagreements, a team leader also needs to know when to bring a debate to an end. Your team will often be unable to reach a consensus; if the conversation seems to be going in circles or tempers are wearing thin, it’s time for the team leader to step in and make a final decision.

> **How to Be an Effective Moderator**
> 
> In essence, Lencioni is saying that the team leader should act as a moderator during team meetings—someone who guides the debate and keeps people from going off-topic. As such, here are some tips to effectively moderate a discussion:
> 
> **1) Minimize your speaking time.** It’s difficult to both act as a moderator and be a part of the discussion because you won’t have anyone to moderate _you._ Therefore, try to make a point of speaking only when necessary and for as short a time as possible. As Lencioni says, this could mean simply encouraging others to share their concerns and disagreements in order to promote productive conflicts.
> 
> **2) Allow time for discussion.** Remember, the purpose of having a team isn’t just to present ideas—it’s to discuss them. Therefore, make sure to leave plenty of time for people to think about what they’ve heard, ask questions, and debate each other’s ideas. You can do this by having “discussion time” as early as possible in the meeting and saving updates or presentations for the end, where they can be cut and sent via email if you need extra time for debates.
> 
> **3) Keep the meeting on schedule.** You’ve got a limited amount of time for any given meeting. Therefore, set a time limit for how long any one person is allowed to speak or how long the team can spend discussing a particular topic. As a moderator, it will be your job to watch the time and keep things moving along as needed. If a topic is running over time, you might need to stop the debate and come back to it during another meeting, or make a final decision yourself so that the team can move on (as Lencioni notes).

### Impairment #3: Lack of Unity

The ability to disagree with each other respectfully and productively is crucial for a team, but it naturally leads to Lencioni’s third impairment: a lack of unity. **Some team members may resist going along with a decision even after it’s been made.** For example, they might genuinely think the team made a bad decision, or they might simply feel slighted because their ideas weren’t chosen.

(Shortform note: Having team members support a decision they disagree with goes back to trust. If they genuinely trust their teammates’ abilities and judgment, then they can also trust that the decision the team reached was a good one, even if it wasn’t the decision they’d personally have made. By establishing trust—and reminding your team members that they trust each other—you’ve already gone a long way toward overcoming this team impairment.)

In this section, we’ll go over Lencioni’s method for having your team present a united front: 1) ensuring clarity among the team members and 2) requiring them to communicate decisions to their subordinates.

#### Ensuring Clarity

Lencioni’s first tip for achieving team unity is **making sure all team members understand _exactly_ what decision they reached during the meeting.** To support a course of action, they first need to know what that course of action will be.

Therefore, right before ending a meeting, clearly and specifically write down and share what the team has agreed to. This is also an opportunity for team members to share anything they’re confused about and to eliminate any ambiguity.

For example, say your team decided to have the company adopt a new type of software. You could write down that the team decided to phase out whatever software your company is currently using and require all employees to start using this new program. If one of your team members assumed the new software would just be an _option_ for employees rather than a requirement, these last few minutes of the meeting are that person’s chance to clear up their confusion.

(Shortform note: Before you can effectively write down the team decision, you must make sure _you_ understand it. A simple way to do this is by paraphrasing what you’ve heard during the discussion—throughout the meeting, put major points into your own words and repeat them back to the team. This provides an opportunity to clear up _your_ confusion.)

#### Requiring Communication

Lencioni’s second tip for achieving unity is **holding each team member responsible for explaining the decision to everyone who reports to them.** By doing so, you’ll make sure they’re personally invested in team unity: They know there will be consequences if they don’t explain the decision willingly and accurately.

It’s not enough for your team members to send a simple email or voicemail communicating the decision to their staff—they must do so either in person or over a phone call so their employees will have the chance to ask questions and voice concerns. This requirement also helps ensure that team members fully understand the decision before they communicate it; since they’ll have to explain the decision and answer questions about it, they’ll want to make sure they understand it themselves.

> **Requiring “Skin in the Game”**
> 
> By requiring team members to personally communicate the team’s decisions, you’re giving them what risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls _"skin in the game."_ You’re requiring them to take on some risk: If they don’t deliver the news accurately and impartially, they’ll have to face some sort of consequence. This (relatively small) risk ensures that they’ll act ethically—in everyone’s best interests.
> 
> The essence of Taleb’s concept of “skin in the game” __ is creating a situation where harming others also harms you and helping others also helps you. Here’s how it plays out in this particular case.
> 
> **Option #1: The unethical option.** A team member causes harm to the team and to their subordinates by not communicating the team’s decision, communicating it inaccurately, or offering their own negative opinions of the decision. This will also harm the team member in question since they’ll have to face the consequences you’d previously established—perhaps a formal reprimand or (if necessary) removal from the team.
> 
> **Option #2: The ethical option.** The team member carries out their duties by communicating the team’s decision willingly, accurately, and supportively. This benefits the team (who retain the support of that person’s subordinates), the subordinates (who now understand the decision and what it will mean for them), and the team member (who, rather than facing consequences, strengthens their bonds of trust with the rest of the team).

### Impairments #4 and #5: Fear of Accountability and Self-Interest

Discussing unity naturally leads to the last two impairments: fear of accountability and self-interest. These both hinder team unity by keeping people’s attention focused on themselves. This final section will explain these two impairments and discuss ways to keep team members accountable to and intent on meeting the team’s shared goals.

#### Impairment #4: Fear of Accountability

Lencioni argues that accountability involves team members—including the team leader—**holding each other responsible for their behavior and their results.**

Holding people accountable for their results is easy. If there are clear expectations regarding, say, sales numbers or company profits, it’s easy to tell when someone isn’t meeting them. In that case, there needs to be a conversation about why they’re falling short and how to address the problem.

Lencioni says it’s much more uncomfortable to hold people accountable for their day-to-day behavior. **But, it’s just as important because behavior leads directly to results;** by correcting behaviors, you can stop poor results from happening in the first place. For example, if one of your team members seems disengaged or hostile during team meetings, that bad behavior might also come through when they’re talking to customers, thereby harming sales.

> **Accountability Through the “What Happened” Conversation**
> 
> Holding people accountable, whether for their behaviors or their outcomes, often requires uncomfortable and difficult conversations. It may help to have a plan for handling these discussions.
> 
> In _Difficult Conversations_ , the authors call this the “what happened” conversation, and they explain how to approach it productively. The key to a successful “what happened” conversation is to approach it with curiosity instead of judgment. Your goal should be to find out what’s wrong—in this case, to find the cause of the team member’s poor behavior or poor performance—not to accuse or shame the other person.
> 
> To learn what the problem is, start by explaining your perspective: The team member isn’t meeting expectations, or they’re engaging in a concerning behavior. Then, show curiosity by asking for the other person’s perspective on why the issue is happening. For example, they might reveal that a problem in their personal life is distracting them at work or that they’re having problems with another team member. Then, the two of you can work together to figure out the best way to address that problem.

##### How to Overcome the Fear of Accountability

According to Lencioni, to help your team overcome their fear of holding each other accountable, you must first help them realize that it’s really the fear of hurting each other.**** Accountability is personal—as a result, calling out your teammates’ shortcomings often feels judgmental and unkind. This holds true for the team leader and team members alike.

Once you understand where this impairment comes from, you can start taking steps to overcome it. Specifically, change your team’s mindset: Explain that **failing to hold each other accountable is much more harmful than the brief discomfort of a difficult conversation.** Holding back criticism doesn’t just harm the company—it also robs team members of the chance to improve.

Lencioni adds that **the most effective type of accountability is between teammates.** This is because criticism feels more personal and more meaningful when it comes from a peer instead of from “the boss” (the team leader), who’s in a position where giving feedback and criticism is just part of their job. Therefore, overcoming the fear of accountability—empowering team members to give _each other_ feedback—is more effective than any feedback the leader could give personally.

(Shortform note: In _No Rules Rules_ , Netflix co-founder and executive chairman Reed Hastings says that the best way to make sure people feel comfortable giving (and getting) feedback is to create a company culture where anyone can give feedback to anyone else, at any time. This eliminates the uncertainty about whether and when it’s acceptable to give someone negative feedback. It also helps minimize the power dynamic that Lencioni notes, where feedback from “the boss” doesn’t feel as meaningful or as personal as feedback from a peer. In this case, feedback from a peer will be just as common as feedback from the manager or team leader, so one won’t feel any more personal or unusual than the other.)

> **Holding Back Criticism Is a Lie by Omission**
> 
> Another way to help your team push through their fear of accountability is to share that holding back important criticism is the same thing as lying. Specifically, it’s a lie by omission, since you’re pretending everything is OK when it actually isn’t, and that people don’t need to improve when they do. Lies by omission are just as hurtful as actually saying something untrue, even if you’re trying to protect someone else’s feelings by withholding your feedback.
> 
> Furthermore, just like any other type of lie, lies by omission quickly erode trust—teammates need to trust each other to tell the _whole_ truth, not just the positive parts of it. So, even though a person might just be trying to keep their teammate happy, they could be doing serious harm to the team as a whole, and, by extension, the company.

#### Impairment #5: Self-Interest

Fear of accountability hinders teamwork because people are too concerned about hurting their teammates; self-interest hinders teamwork when people go too far in the other direction and aren’t concerned _enough_ about their teammates.

Lencioni says that people are naturally self-centered, and as a result, they lose sight of the big picture: company outcomes. In this section, we’ll briefly examine a few ways that self-interested behavior can harm the team and the company. We’ll then discuss advice on how to keep the team focused on company outcomes.

##### The Problems With Self-Interested Behavior

Self-interested behavior can have several negative impacts on companies and teams. **First, Lencioni notes that people might resist ideas that hinder their personal goals,** even if those ideas are good for the company as a whole. For example, if the team decides to hire an outside expert to fill an advisory role that a less experienced team member was hoping to get, the team member in question would likely oppose that idea.

**Team members may also sometimes suffer from tunnel vision** —focusing too heavily on their own work or their own department—and may not take into account how the company as a whole is performing. For instance, if the manager of a manufacturing team is having the team cut corners to produce vast amounts of a product, that manager's personal metrics might look exceptional. However, their team’s shoddy work will harm the company in the long run when customers realize that their products are of poor quality.

**Finally, self-interest may give rise to egotism,** where one team member thinks they’re more important or more capable than the team as a whole. Lencioni notes that this is especially common with top performers, whose exceptional work often shields them from the consequences of bad behavior and rule-breaking. However, he says that no one person—no matter how good they are at their job—is more important than the team. Therefore, anyone who can’t let go of ego and commit to the group should be removed from it. You’ll find that the team’s improved overall performance more than makes up for the loss of one top performer, leading to better outcomes for the company as a whole.

> **A Company Is All One System**
> 
> You can address all of the problems stemming from self-interest by encouraging your team to understand the big picture: the company as a whole. As systems scientist Peter Senge explains in _The Fifth Discipline_ , self-interested people make the mistake of viewing a company as a collection of disconnected parts: individual departments, or even individual employees. Instead, Senge urges you to see an organization as a single cohesive system where every part influences every other part and to help your coworkers (or teammates, in this case) see it that way as well.
> 
> For the team member who resists hiring an outside expert for a role they hoped to fill themselves, you might point out that a specialist could produce better outcomes—and higher profits—for the company as a whole, which will then be reflected in that team member’s salary or bonus. Alternatively, you could argue that taking on a new role will hinder or eliminate that person’s ability to perform in their _current_ role. That could harm the company, the team, and the team member in question.
> 
> For the team member who’s having their workers cut corners to make products more quickly, point out that it won’t matter how quickly they can produce if their goods gain a bad reputation and nobody wants to buy them. Also, help them to see how one shoddy product harms the company’s reputation—and its bottom line—which will end up hurting everyone who works for that company.
> 
> The egotistical top performer needs to understand that they’re just one tiny part of a much larger system and that their behavior is harming that system, regardless of how good their individual metrics are. To use a metaphor, their selfishness is like sand in the gears of your corporate machine; it slows and irritates everyone around them, making the entire system less efficient. This eventually comes back to hurt the star performer as well.

##### How to Keep the Team Focused on Outcomes

To shift people’s focus off themselves and onto overall outcomes, Lencioni suggests choosing and visibly tracking one or two company metrics related to the team’s overall goal. **You’ll be constantly reminding your team of their big-picture goals and letting them see their progress toward those goals.** For example, you might maintain a shared online document or write the chosen metrics on a whiteboard before each team meeting.

Note that the metrics you choose must be objective and measurable, such as sales numbers or customer reviews. In other words, set a simple and concrete goal for your team to reach, and track appropriate metrics to keep each team member focused on that goal.

> **Also Set Intermediate Goals and Celebrate Meeting Them**

> Lencioni urges you to track your team’s progress to keep people motivated and focused. In _Leading Change_ , leadership expert John P. Kotter says you can make this practice even more effective by setting short-term goals or milestones leading up to that main goal—tracked using the same metrics—and celebrating with your team when you pass each milestone. For example, if your final goal is to sell 1,000 of a certain product each month, you might celebrate when your monthly sales reach 250, 500, and 750.
