## Exercise: Compare the Impact of Images and Words

Early images from racist scientific texts are the precursors to modern racist caricatures. Compare the impact of those images to biased speech and writing.

* * *

This chapter included an image from the book _Types of Mankind_ that compares sketches of a white person’s skull, a black person’s skull, and a chimpanzee skull. What did you first notice about the image? What stuck out to you?

What thoughts or emotions did that image bring up for you? Why do you think you reacted that way?

You may have seen more recent images that are similarly biased (for example, in magazines, on Facebook, or in journalistic cartoons depicting figures like Barack Obama or Serena Williams). What ideas about race do you think the artists were trying to convey? Who is the target audience?

In cases like this, do you think an image really is “worth a thousand words”? Do racist images have a different impact than biased speech or writing? Why or why not?
