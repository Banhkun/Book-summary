## Chapters 1-2: Bias Changes What You See

When you hear the word “bias,” you may think of a conscious form of prejudice. **But Eberhardt argues that the most potent biases are actually unconscious, operating without any conscious input or even awareness.**

These implicit biases are normal neurological responses to the culture you grow up in—they affect everyone. But, specific cultures create biases against different groups of people. In the United States, **everyone encounters and encodes antiblack bias to some degree, even in black communities.** This bias doesn’t just influence how you make decisions—it determines what you notice in your environment and what becomes invisible.

In this chapter, we’ll learn how bias develops through the other-race effect and categorization; then, we’ll discuss how that bias gets transmitted to others through parenting and the media. Understanding how bias spreads will help to clarify why racial bias impacts so many areas of daily life.

### The Other-Race Effect

Have you ever heard someone say, “They all look alike” about people of another race? Those types of comments can be deeply offensive. (Shortform example: In 2018, Hillary Clinton came under fire for saying, “I know, they all look alike” after a reporter mixed up Senator Cory Booker and former attorney general Eric Holder, both of whom are black men.)

However, that sentiment doesn’t typically reflect a _conscious_ prejudice—more often, it’s the natural result of human biology. **Scientists like Eberhardt call this biological process the “other-race effect”: It’s the experience of being able to easily recognize faces of your own race but struggling to identify faces of other races.**

Eberhardt says that the other-race effect is one of the neurological processes underlying bias because**it makes us see people of our own race as individuals worth recognizing and people of other races as just representatives of a group, not individual people.**

The effect is universal: If you’ve spent time around groups of people outside your own race, you may have experienced it yourself. It develops because your brain can’t absorb every detail of the sensory environment around you all at once, so it learns to prioritize whatever it sees most often and focus its attention there.

> **How the Other-Race Effect Develops in Infancy**
> 
> As early as 1975, scientists had confirmed that infants are naturally drawn to faces more than other stimuli. One study even found that newborns less than one hour old prefer images of typical faces over images of scrambled facial features. However, this overall preference for faces tends to decline by the age of three months, which is around the same age that scientists first see evidence of the other-race effect. This suggests that babies begin life with a generalized preference for human faces, which then gets "tuned" by their environment into a preference for faces of a certain race. **By the age of nine months, most infants can only recognize faces of their own race.**
> 
> There are some exceptions to this rule—for example, one study found that Chinese and Vietnamese children who were adopted into white families between the ages of two and 26 months old were equally good at recognizing Asian and Caucasian faces later on. However, another study found that Korean children adopted into white families after the age of three are much better at recognizing Caucasian faces than Asian ones. Scientists think this might mean that being exposed to faces of at least two different races of people during the first two years of life might make it easier to recognize multiple races later on.

#### Racial Experience Changes the Brain

Eberhardt argues that the fact that your ability to recognize others’ faces depends on your experience with people of other races reveals something important about human brain development—**cultural conceptions of race are so powerful, they can change how your brain functions.** This is an example of _neuroplasticity_ , which is your brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience.

(Shortform note: Until the mid-twentieth century, scientists thought that neuroplasticity was impossible in adults because the brain was already fully developed; now, scientific research shows that adult brains _can_ still change and grow new connections between neurons. How well your brain maintains the ability to adapt is partly determined by genetics, but your lifestyle is important, too: Research shows that people who exercise regularly, practice mindfulness, and keep learning new things have an easier time forming new neural connections.)

Scientists can track these changes in the brain using brain scans. However, until recently, there was no scientific evidence that facial recognition abilities (the brain process at the core of the other-race effect) could also change in response to experience with people of different races. Eberhardt and a team of neuroscientists set out to study this question using brain scans of the fusiform face area (FFA), where facial recognition happens in the brain.

In a 2001 study, Eberhardt and her team studied changes in the FFA when participants looked at pictures of people from their own race or other races. They tracked these changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technology that allows researchers to track blood flow to different parts of a person’s brain while that person does a specific task. (Shortform note: Increased blood flow means the brain is routing more oxygen to that area because it’s working harder than usual (just like you breathe heavier when you sprint than when you lie down). Scientists call that increased blood flow “activation.”)

For both black and white participants, the team found that the FFA activated more when people looked at faces of people the same race as themselves. In other words, when you see a person of your own race, your brain automatically works harder to encode their specific features so that you can recognize them later. If you grew up surrounded by white faces, your brain prioritizes recognizing white faces; if you grew up surrounded by black faces, your brain prioritizes recognizing black faces. The conclusion: **Parts of the brain actually change how they function depending on a person’s experience with race.**

> **Positive Interracial Experiences Reduce the Other-Race Effect**
> 
> Eberhardt’s team was the first to find evidence that a person’s experience with people of other races can change how their brain functions. Since then, other scientists have found similar results, even in other areas of the brain. In 2020, a group of researchers studied activation in a broader group of brain structures related to facial recognition in white participants while they looked at images of black and white faces. They found that the more positive interpersonal experiences a white person had with black people, the more the facial recognition areas of their brain lit up when they looked at black faces. In other words, having positive, high-quality contact with people of another race mitigates the other-race effect, making it easier to recognize individual faces of people of that race.

### Categorization

According to Eberhardt, categorization is another factor at the root of racial bias. In the context of racial bias, **categorization is the process of seeing people of other races as representatives of a homogenous category, rather than as individuals** , and automatically making assumptions about people based on your experience with that category. For example, if someone grows up in a culture that associates black people with crime, they’re likely to assume that every individual black person they encounter is a criminal.

#### How Categories Form

**Eberhardt emphasizes that categorization is an automatic neurological process, not a conscious choice. It’s the brain’s way of sorting chaos into order.** Mental categories are a collection of all your beliefs, experiences, feelings, knowledge, and preferences relating to a particular thing. For example, when you think of the category “sports,” your mind automatically calls up images of people playing sports as well as all the information stored in your memory about different sports, their various rules, famous athletes, and so on.

The feelings and memories you associate with the “sports” category are here, too. Maybe you’re an avid basketball player, so thinking about basketball brings up happy memories and a feeling of confidence. On the other hand, if you were bullied in school for not being athletic, thinking about any sport might bring up painful memories. Either way, the moment you see something sports-related, your brain cues up _all_ the thoughts and feelings you have about the entire category, starting with the strongest associations (so if you met your spouse at a college football game, that will come to mind much faster than the name of a famous baseball player).

This same process applies to groups of people. **According to Eberhardt, whether we’re aware of it or not, we all internalize stereotypes and cultural beliefs about groups of people, and that information gets stored in the corresponding category.** When you see an individual member of that group, your brain automatically pulls up the entire category—even parts you don’t consciously agree with or don’t even realize are there. That’s why, regardless of your conscious beliefs, seeing a single black person can bring to mind ingrained messages like “that person is dangerous” or “that person is good at basketball.”

(Shortform note: One way to avoid this mental reflex is to look for more individuating information about the person. In _Superforecasting, _authors Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner argue that _any_ new piece of information we get about a person, no matter how irrelevant it seems, makes it harder for us to categorize that person. This is called the “dilution effect.”)

#### Stereotypes

Our natural impulse to group people into categories sometimes leads us to rely on reductive stereotypes. **Stereotypes are automatic, culturally-instilled beliefs about a group of people that we assume apply to _all_ members of that group, **even when that’s not true (for example, the idea that all black men are violent is a stereotype).

Eberhardt asserts that, just like categorization, stereotyping is an automatic neurological process that serves a functional purpose. There is simply too much information in the world for our brains to process each individual thing separately. But when stereotypes are applied to _people_ , they become a dangerous source of bias.

Relying on stereotypes to inform our understanding of other people leads to **confirmation bias** , where people seek out information that confirms what they already believe and ignore anything that challenges those beliefs. (Shortform note: To avoid confirmation bias, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommends a technique called “negative empiricism” in his book _The Black Swan_. Negative empiricism is the process of seeking out information that _disproves_ your original belief. In the context of racism, if someone believed black people were more likely to commit crimes, they might look for evidence that black people are actually _less_ likely to commit crimes than people of other races.)

For example, when researchers showed people photos of a black person’s face moving gradually from an angry expression to a friendly one, people who were more racially prejudiced against black people labeled the face “angry” for more frames than less prejudiced people. In other words, they interpreted the neutral expressions between angry and friendly as still “angry.” Their prejudice colored their perception in a way that confirmed their existing beliefs. **Seeing what you want to see instead of what’s really there is the heart of bias.**

> **Stop Your Stereotypes by Slowing Down**
> 
> Relying on stereotypes may be a natural cognitive process, but unchecked stereotypes can cause real harm to people of color. One way to minimize your risk of accidentally causing harm is to _slow down._ Eberhardt touches on this idea in Chapter 10, and other writers have also discussed the connection between speed and bias. For example, in _Blink, _Malcolm Gladwell argues that when we make decisions too quickly, we don’t have time to take in all the relevant information, so our brains automatically fill in the gaps with stereotypes and assumptions. However, when you take a moment to stop and think before acting, you have more time to process the specific situation without relying on stereotypes.
> 
> Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman explains why slowing down might help us avoid stereotypes in _Thinking, Fast and Slow_. Kahneman argues that human thinking operates in two different systems: System 1 is automatic, unconscious processing, while System 2 is conscious, effortful thought. System 1 thoughts can be completely involuntary and happen almost instantaneously, which is why System 1 is the home of bias and stereotypes. By slowing down and reminding yourself to apply conscious thought to a situation that invokes bias, you force your brain to switch from System 1 thinking to System 2 thinking, which makes it much easier to avoid relying on stereotypes.

#### Categorization in the Brain

As we’ve noted, like the other-race effect, **categorization is a normal, mostly subconscious brain function that helps us process the enormous amount of information we encounter in everyday life.** Within this process, we automatically prioritize information we use most often and rely on simplistic categories for everything else. Categorization is not a bad thing by default, but it can easily be hijacked into making generalizations based on race and stereotypes (like, “all black men are dangerous”).

According to Eberhardt, the other-race effect plays a role in determining the exact generalizations people make: **People are automatically predisposed to focus on faces they’ve sorted into the “like me” category—even if they’re wrong about that categorization—and block out or ignore everything else.**

Research on the impact of categorization shows just how powerful those in-group and out-group designations are. In one study, researchers showed participants computer-generated faces. The facial features were specifically designed to be racially ambiguous, but each face was shown twice: once with a hairstyle typically worn by Latinos, and once with a typically African American hairstyle. When they saw the same faces later on, Latino participants were significantly better at recognizing faces with the Latino hairstyle than the African American hairstyle—even though it was the exact same face.

Once the participants in this study categorized the face as a member of their own race based on the hairstyle, they automatically focused more on memorizing their features because human brains are primed to focus on in-group faces. **Essentially, your brain sees faces of your own race as _individuals_ —not just members of a reductive category—so it automatically focuses on encoding the unique features of those faces. **

> **Resist Categorizing by Changing Your Focus and Experiences**
> 
> Other authors also warn about the dangers of making assumptions based on categorization instead of looking at people as individuals. In _Factfulness_ , author Hans Rosling refers to categorizing as “the generalization instinct.” He argues that we can overcome the generalization instinct by focusing on differences within groups of people and similarities across groups of people. For example, if your mental category for black men includes “good at sports,” you might challenge that by focusing on the countless black men who aren’t athletic, or by focusing on the number of professional athletes from other races. That way, you’ll remind yourself that not all black men are athletic, and not all athletic people are black men.
> 
> In _Blink_ , Malcolm Gladwell also offers advice for resisting categorizing by spending more time with people from other races and cultures. This works because we unconsciously prioritize information that we use in daily life—so if you’re exclusively surrounded by white people, you’re more likely to slot everyone else into reductive categories instead of seeing them as individuals. However, if you spend more time with people of other races or seek out books and movies that highlight other groups’ experiences, you’ll unconsciously begin to prioritize information about those other groups rather than falling back on categories.

### How Bias Spreads to Others

Now that we know how racial bias develops in individual people, let’s examine how it spreads to others. **It’s important to understand how bias spreads in order to understand why racial bias is so pervasive throughout modern culture.** Specifically, in the United States, antiblack bias isn’t confined to one specific region or type of person—it spreads through parenting and popular media into every corner of the country.

#### Biased Parents Raise Biased Kids

**According to Eberhardt, parents are one of the strongest sources of the generational spread of antiblack bias.** Young children form their understanding of the world by watching the adults in their lives. When those adults show racial bias—even through subtle cues like body language—kids pick up on the message: This person of another race is treated badly, so they must _be_ bad. The more often they hear that message, the deeper they encode it and adopt it as their own belief.

##### The Implicit Association Test

To test the impact of parents’ bias on their children, researchers use the _implicit association test_ (IAT), which is the gold standard for testing the strength of implicit biases. The beauty of the IAT is that it doesn’t rely on self-reporting (which is often inaccurate because most people don’t want to admit to being racially biased). Instead, the IAT tests the power of biases operating below conscious awareness by measuring how quickly people associate black and white faces with good and bad words. (Shortform note: If you’re curious about your own implicit biases, you can take the IAT yourself through Harvard’s “Project Implicit.”)

To administer the test, researchers show participants a series of black and white faces on a computer screen interspersed with good words (like “joy”) and bad words (like “evil”). There are two conditions, both of which use only two buttons. In the first condition, participants push one button if they see a black face or a bad word, and the other button for a white face or a good word; in the second condition, participants push one button for a black face or good word, the other for a white face or bad word.

![biased_IATconditions.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/biased_IATconditions.png)

The idea behind the IAT is that culturally-ingrained bias makes it easier for the brain to associate black faces with bad words (and white faces with good words) than to associate black faces with good words (and white faces with bad words). In the first condition, the task is easy, so response times tend to be quick. But the brain has to work a little bit harder to associate black faces with good words, so the time it takes to push the right button is a little bit longer—the stronger the bias, the harder the brain has to work to associate “black” with “good,” and the longer it takes to respond. The IAT estimates the strength of a person’s implicit biases by measuring the difference between response times for the two conditions. When it comes to parenting, the results of the IAT confirm that **heavily biased parents tend to raise heavily biased kids.**

> **Parents’ Influence on Kids’ Racial Bias Fades Over Time**
> 
> For young children, having a parent with strong implicit bias makes them less sympathetic when they see a black child being teased versus a white child. Interestingly, older children are typically very sympathetic to teasing victims of any race, regardless of how biased their parents may be. That might be because kids begin to form their own views of the world, separate from their parents, as they grow up and interact with more people.)

#### Bias in the Media

Bias also spreads through all forms of media. Growing awareness of media inequality in the early 21st century led to a major rise in the representation of black characters in leading roles in film and television. Eberhardt cautions that media representation is powerful, but seeing black surgeons and superheroes on screen is not enough to eliminate antiblack bias—in fact, it can even reinforce it. This effect is subtle and often subconscious, but still very real.

To test this effect, researchers took clips from shows that have strong, positive portrayals of black characters (including _CSI_ and _Grey’s Anatomy_) and muted the sound. Then they compiled a series of clips of various white characters talking to the same unseen character (sometimes black, sometimes white), who was either offscreen or edited out. They showed these clips to study participants who had never seen that particular show and asked them to rate how much the white characters, as a whole, liked and respected the unseen character, based only on the white characters’ nonverbal cues.

The results of this study were significant: The offscreen characters that participants rated as less liked and well-treated by the other characters were significantly more likely to be black. In other words, **white characters treated other white characters more positively than they treated black characters,** and that difference was big enough that viewers picked up on it even without dialogue.

The perceivable bias in well-meaning TV shows isn’t just unfortunate—it’s dangerous. After viewing the clips, participants took an implicit association test. The more negatively they perceived the show’s white characters’ behavior toward the offscreen black characters, the more antiblack bias they showed on the IAT—even when they didn’t know the poorly-treated unseen characters were black. **These results show that creating more positive roles for black characters isn’t enough to actively combat antiblack bias in the media.**

> **Could Inclusion Riders Solve Popular Media’s Bias Problem?**
> 
> An increase in positively-portrayed black characters on TV is a good first step, but the overall media landscape is still far from equal. A study of the 100 highest-grossing films of each year from 2007-2015 found that black characters made up 12% of speaking roles. While this might seem promising because black people make up roughly 13% of the American population, it’s not the full picture because a few movies with majority-black casts skewed the results. In fact, in 2015, only 10 of the top 100 films were cast in a way that reflects the actual population (meaning they featured black people in roughly 13% of the film’s speaking roles). Even worse, **a full 17% of films featured _zero_ black characters in speaking roles. **
> 
> How can we solve this problem? Inclusion riders are one possibility. Inclusion riders (also called equity riders) are contractual clauses stipulating that the cast and crew of a film must include people from underrepresented groups in the industry, like women, people of color, and people with disabilities. If big-name actors and filmmakers add inclusion riders into their contracts, they can leverage their fame to open doors for talented people and ultimately create a more realistically diverse film industry.
