## Exercise: Think About the Black-Ape Association

The implicit association between black people and apes hasnâ€™t faded with time. Think about why this particular form of bias is so persistent.

* * *

Why do you personally think the black-ape association has persisted for so long? Explain your reasoning.

Do you think that animal association will ever fade for black people the way it did for Irish American immigrants? If so, what needs to change in order for that to happen? If not, why not?
