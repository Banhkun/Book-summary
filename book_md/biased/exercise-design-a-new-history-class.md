## Exercise: Design a New History Class

In schools today, history curricula often gloss over difficult topics like slavery and the Holocaust. Think about the changes you would make to give students a more accurate understanding of history and the way it impacts their current reality.

* * *

Think back to your own history lessons in school. How did your teachers address racially-charged topics like slavery or the Civil Rights Movement?

In this chapter, we learned the importance of teaching history honestly, as well as some ways that teachers can be more sensitive to racial bias when they talk to students. With that in mind, how would you rate the way your own teachers handled difficult topics? Why?

If you were thrown into a high school history class today, how would _you_ approach these sensitive subjects? What would you do differently than your own teachers? (For example, you might include more discussion about the founding fathers being slaveholders or design a lesson connecting slavery to the structural inequalities black people still face today.)

In your opinion, how can teachers discuss difficult topics like slavery and racism without making their black students feel singled out? (For example, maybe they could start by asking _every_ student to write down their own feelings or concerns about discussing racism in the classroom, or provide a trigger warning before showing images or videos that could be re-traumatizing for black students.)
