## Exercise: Imagine a Better System

Eliminating institutional bias in the American criminal justice system is a tall order. Think about what your approach would be to this problem.

* * *

Imagine you’ve been tasked with revamping the criminal justice system so that people of every race are treated fairly. What’s the very first thing you would change? Why?

What other changes do you think would have the biggest positive impact on the system, and why?

What concrete action can you take _today_ to support one of those important changes? (For example, if ending cash bail is important to you, you could research organizations that advocate for bail reform.)
