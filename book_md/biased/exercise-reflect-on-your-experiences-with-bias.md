## Exercise: Reflect on Your Experiences With Bias

Racial bias impacts people of every race. Take a moment to reflect on your experience with bias and your motivation for engaging with this subject.

* * *

When you think of racial bias, what images and associations come to mind? (For example, you may think of a moment in your own life, historical examples of bias, racially segregated neighborhoods, or more recent police shootings.)

When do you remember first becoming aware of racial bias? How old were you, and what experience opened your eyes to the fact that racial bias exists?

Racially biased ideas can lurk in everyone’s mind, regardless of race or conscious beliefs, because we all grow up in a heavily biased culture. When have you noticed biased thoughts or first impressions in yourself? How did you feel when you noticed that implicit bias in yourself?

Finally, what do you most hope to get out of this guide? (For example, maybe you want to better understand how bias works in the brain, or maybe you’re looking for practical tips to reduce the impact of bias in your workplace.)
