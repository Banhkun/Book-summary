## Exercise: Implementing Change

People accept change in the abstract, but are unsettled by change that seems too drastic, or that affects them personally. You can make people more comfortable with change by making it seem less threatening.

* * *

Think of a situation in which you implemented change. What steps did you take, over what time period?

How did people react: Were they accepting or resistant?

How could you have made the change less stressful and more acceptable?
