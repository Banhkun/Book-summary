## Exercise: Dealing With Envy

When someone becomes jealous of you, they often work quietly against you and can cause a lot of harm before you realize it. It’s important to watch for signs and take steps to minimize envy.

* * *

Think of an achievement or honor you received. How did the people around you react? Did anyone’s behavior suggest envy? How?

How did you react to the recognition? Did this have an affect on how people behaved?

How could you have reacted differently? What effect would it have had?
