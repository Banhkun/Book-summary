## Exercise: Rewrite an Unhelpful Thought Pattern to Control Your Emotions

According to Bush, changing your emotions for the better involves rewriting unhelpful thought patterns that trigger unwanted feelings. Practice redirecting thoughts and emotions that don’t serve you.

* * *

Think of a time recently when you experienced an unhelpful emotion. Name the emotion and describe the situation that caused it. (For example, maybe you felt jealous that your friend was spending time with another person.)

What were the thoughts that directly preceded the emotion? (For example, you thought that your friend won’t want to spend as much time with you going forward or that they don’t like you anymore.)

Write a rebuttal that counters the unhelpful thought pattern and soothes the unhelpful emotion. (For example, your relationship with your friend isn’t dependent on their relationship with other people, and they’ve given no indication that they’re upset with you.)
