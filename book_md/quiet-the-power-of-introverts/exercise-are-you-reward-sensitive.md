## Exercise: Are You Reward-Sensitive?

Introverts and extroverts differ in how they view potential rewards or benefits they might get from taking certain actions. Extroverts are often reward-sensitive, meaning they’re highly motivated to seek rewards, such as promotions, money, social status, sex, and influence. In contrast, introverts are less sensitive to potential rewards and better at delaying gratification.

Where do you think you fall on the reward-sensitivity spectrum? Why do you say that?

Have you ever made a risky or off-the-cuff decision you later regretted? What happened?

Knowing the degree to which you’re reward-sensitive, what steps can you take to ensure that you make good decisions in the future?
