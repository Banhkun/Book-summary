## Exercise: Whatâ€™s Your Personality Type?

A half to a third of Americans are introverts, according to studies. They tend to be quiet, thoughtful, and prefer less stimulation than extroverts. They also may prefer to work alone, focusing on one task, while extroverts are multitaskers and thrive in busy environments.

* * *

Where do you fall on the introversion-extroversion scale? Which personality traits, preferences, or behaviors make you believe you're more introverted, more extroverted, or a balance of both?

What are some strengths you have because of your personality type?

Can you point to a situation where these strengths benefited you? In what way?
