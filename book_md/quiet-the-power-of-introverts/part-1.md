## Part 1: The Extrovert Ideal | Chapter 1: A Culture of Personality

U.S. society has not always promoted extroversion as the ideal. Up until the start of the twentieth century, the focus was on character rather than personality. The ideal person was serious, self-disciplined, and moral. How you behaved in private—your virtue—was more important than outward charm or impressing others. (Exceptions were sometimes made in politics, where brashness drew admiration and votes.)

**A shift from a “culture of character” to a “culture of personality” occurred at the turn of the century** in response to a convergence of economic forces, including industrialization; migration from rural areas to cities; and the rise of retail giants such as Woolworths, J.C. Penney, and Sears Roebuck.

In retail, it became important to make a good impression on others with whom you had no past connection, in contrast to interacting with people in small towns whom you’d known all your life. The burgeoning retail sector needed a different kind of employee—a gregarious salesman with the ability to get along with anyone and be comfortable in any situation. Having a “good personality” became paramount. At the same time, Americans developed a fascination with celebrities, further elevating charisma over character.

### A Boom in Self-Help

Self-help advice, advertising, and psychology fueled the transition to a culture of personality. You had to sell yourself, not just products. And to do that, you had to be a performer.

**At the forefront of the personality transformation movement was Dale Carnegie** , founder of the Dale Carnegie Institute and author of best-selling books, including _How to Win Friends and Influence People_. The son of a poor Missouri farmer, Carnegie was impressed in 1902 by a traveling lecturer who had transformed himself by learning public speaking. Later in college, Carnegie entered speaking contests and eventually became such a successful speaker that others began asking him for lessons.

After college, Carnegie offered a public speaking class in New York City, which was an overnight success. Thereafter, in books and seminars, he touted public speaking and developing a winning personality as essential skills for succeeding in the competitive business world.

### Advertising and Psychology Advice

Advertising and magazine advice columns emphasized self-improvement. Men were urged to develop “a masterful personality,” while women were to cultivate an appearance of charm and beauty.

**Advertisements focused on the need to perform well in the glare of the spotlight.** For instance, a shaving cream ad declared, “Critical eyes are sizing you up right now.” A Lux soap ad assured women that by using Lux on lingerie, sofa cushions, and so on, they would enjoy “a sure, deep inner conviction of being charming.”

A 1920 advice manual stressed the need for having “a ready command of manners” sufficient to convince others you are “a mighty likable fellow.” Magazines like the Saturday Evening Post carried columns on the art of manners and conversation.

Psychologists began to weigh in on the importance of projecting self-confidence. Carl Jung, who had defined the introvert and extrovert personality types, recognized that introverts were falling out of favor. Their natural reserve might “arouse all the current prejudices” against those seen as lacking a good personality, he wrote.

**In the 1920s, psychologist Alfred Adler introduced a new term for those who felt insecure and inadequate in comparison to the extrovert ideal: they had an “inferiority complex.”** Adler argued that children felt inferior to adults and older peers, but successful children learned to channel these feelings into the pursuit of their goals as they matured. Children who weren’t successful at this developed an inferiority complex, which would be a huge social and economic disadvantage. Magazines gave mothers advice on how to help their kids avoid this fate.

The inferiority complex soon became a pat explanation for many problems in life. For instance, in 1924, Collier’s magazine published an article about a woman who was reluctant to marry a man whom she thought had an inferiority complex and would thus turn out to be a loser. At the same time, experts advised that an inferiority complex could be overcome. In fact, they claimed, many successful people, including Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Thomas Edison, once had inferiority complexes.

### Schools Get the Message

Parents were exhorted to raise a self-confident child. Experts warned that having a “maladjusted personality” as a child, namely shyness, would lead to alcoholism and suicide later in life; an extroverted personality was key to social and economic success. They advised parents to focus on socialization, while schools should get involved with personality development in addition to children’s learning.

**By the mid-fifties, parents, teachers, and psychologists accepted the extrovert ideal for all children**. They discouraged solitary activities and stressed socialization; they sent children to school earlier to learn to be sociable at younger ages. Quiet and introverted children were singled out for intervention. Most parents felt extroversion was necessary for their children to learn to succeed in the “real world.”

In _The Organization Man_ , William Whyte quoted officials at Harvard and Yale, who declared that their schools were interested only in young men of “the healthy, extrovert kind” and had no use for the “intellectually overstimulated” type. That attitude reflected the prevailing business culture of group camaraderie, which clearly wasn’t designed for introverts. For instance, IBM gathered its sales force every morning to sing company songs.

### Feeling the Pressure

For adults who needed an extra assist, the pharmaceutical companies stepped up in the fifties and sixties to offer the first anti-anxiety drugs. For instance, in introducing the drug Miltown, Carter-Wallace redefined anxiety as a reaction to a highly social and competitive world. It immediately became a best-seller. Others soon followed. By 1960, a third of all prescriptions were for one of two anti-anxiety drugs. One ad claimed, “Anxiety and tension are the commonplace of the age.”

Since then, the pressure to sell yourself has only grown. The number of Americans identifying as shy grew from 40% in the 1970s to 50% in the 1990s, possibly a response to escalating standards for self-promotion. One in five people has “social anxiety disorder” (pathological shyness); psychologists consider fear of public speaking to be a pathology when it undermines job performance.

Dale Carnegie’s books and training continue to be popular, as are organizations like Toastmasters, established in 1924 to practice public speaking. The culture of personality has redefined how we must be. But we may have lost something important in the transition without realizing it.
