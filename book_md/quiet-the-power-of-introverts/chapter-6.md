## Chapter 6: Sensitivity and Introversion

Since 1997, Dr. Elaine Aron, a research psychologist, has further explored the trait of high reactivity, which she has recharacterized as sensitivity. She found that **highly sensitive people, 70% of whom are introverts, share a set of distinct attributes** that, when recognized, can benefit society.

Aron’s list of twenty-seven characteristics, based on interviews and questionnaires with people who described themselves as being introverted or easily overwhelmed by stimulation, dovetailed with Kagan’s findings as well as with other research. The research found that highly sensitive people:

  * Are astute observers who look before they leap
  * Dislike surprises
  * Are sensitive to smells, sounds, sights, pain, and caffeine
  * Don’t like being observed (for instance, at work or performing music) or judged (for instance, in job interviews)
  * Are philosophical or spiritual rather than materialistic
  * Are creative and intuitive
  * Dislike small talk
  * Dream vividly and often recall details of their dreams
  * Love music, nature, art, and beauty
  * Are empathic
  * Have a strong conscience
  * Dislike violent movies and TV shows
  * Feel emotions intensely, especially joy, fear, and sadness
  * Thoroughly process information about their environments and notice subtleties



These attributes suggest that **sensitive people are deep thinkers** , which might be a reason they dislike superficial small talk. Another study found that sensitive people reacted particularly strongly to photos of accidents, pollution, and people who were injured, scarred, or experiencing strong emotions.

> **Life-Changing Empathy**
> 
> Eleanor Roosevelt was a highly sensitive person known for her empathy for others’ suffering. As first lady to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, she was often described as “Franklin’s conscience” for her efforts to raise his awareness of social problems and get him to enact policies to address them.
> 
> For instance, in 1933, she spent three months traveling the country, listening to stories of the people devastated by the Great Depression, which she reported to FDR while urging action. Among other things, she:
> 
>   * Proposed programs to help starving miners in Appalachia
> 
>   * Urged the inclusion of women and African-Americans in government work programs
> 
>   * Arranged for African-American singer Marian Anderson to sing at the Lincoln Memorial after the Daughters of the American Revolution canceled another performance in Washington, D.C., because of her race.
> 
> 

> 
> Later in her career, as a delegate to the United Nations, Eleanor helped secure passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
> 
> Her sensitivity and empathy enabled her to help change the lives of millions of people.

### Sensitivity and Conscience

Studies of highly sensitive toddlers found they had a stronger conscience than other children—they got more upset when they believed they had broken a borrowed and highly valued toy. Later in life, these children were less likely to cheat and break rules; they also had stronger moral traits such as empathy and had fewer behavior problems. The research suggested that having a stronger conscience may promote future altruism, personal responsibility, and better relationships.

Sensitivity may be physical as well as emotional. Researchers found that highly reactive introverts sweated more in reaction to noises, strong emotion, and other stimuli, while low-reactives sweated less. The less reactive you are, the thinner and cooler (less sensitive) your skin is. This may be where the description of being socially “cool” came from.

High-reactives are more prone to blushing as well. While they often find it annoying, it can be a socially useful and positive trait. Because it’s involuntary, blushing is viewed by others as an authentic sign of embarrassment, modesty, or humility—people who blush may be trusted more as a result.

### Survival Traits

Aron theorizes that the trait of extreme sensitivity may have survived the evolutionary process because of other survival enhancing attributes associated with it, such as astute observation, the tendency to look before leaping, and the tendency to thoroughly process information.

In the animal kingdom, those who “watch and wait” and those who like to “just do it” have complementary value. The watchers notice danger, while the doers seize opportunities. The two strategies pay off at different times in different situations, which is known as the trade-off theory of evolution. Scientists have found that about 20% of many species are “slow to warm up,” while the other 80% are “fast” or bold.

The trade-off idea also applies to humans. In the same way that antelope herds depend on their most watchful and sensitive members for survival, so might human society depend on the compassion and empathy of people like Eleanor Roosevelt, who helped the country through the Great Depression and racial tensions.

Former Vice President Al Gore, an introvert, is another example of a leader whose conscience benefited society: long before most people cared about it, he engaged in a decades-long campaign to raise awareness of the danger posed by global warming. The welfare of society and even the planet may depend on the capabilities of highly sensitive people, as much as on those of bold doers.
