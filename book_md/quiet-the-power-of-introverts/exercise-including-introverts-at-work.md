## Exercise: Including Introverts at Work

Many corporate cultures favor extroverts—action-oriented talkers with great presentation styles. Studies have shown that we rate people who talk the most as smarter than those who are quiet. However, ignoring or overlooking input from quiet, thoughtful people can lead to poor decisions.

* * *

Think about your colleagues at work—which do you think are introverts and which are extroverts? Whose voices are listened to most?

Think of a recent group decision. Were contrary voices heard? How did it turn out?

The next time a decision is being made, what can you do to help ensure that a full range of views is taken into consideration?
