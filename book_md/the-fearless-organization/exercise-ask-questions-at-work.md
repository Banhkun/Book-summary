## Exercise: Ask Questions At Work

Edmondson says that companies benefit when they foster a psychologically safe environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up, asking questions, sharing feedback, and making mistakes.

* * *

Think of a time at work when you wanted to ask a question or share a concern but didn’t. What was it, and why didn’t you express it?

Think of a question you’d like to ask or a concern you’d currently like to share at work. What is it, and what benefits could come from you expressing it?

How safe would you feel about sharing your question or concern?? Why?

What can you do to make your workplace’s culture feel safer?
