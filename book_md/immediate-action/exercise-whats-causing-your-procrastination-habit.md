## Exercise: What’s Causing Your Procrastination Habit?

All of us procrastinate. But Meurisse explains that we can build more productive habits (and healthier relationships with our work) by taking a closer look at why we’re putting off a specific task and addressing that cause.

* * *

Think about a task that you’ve been procrastinating on: It might be something you need to get done at work, at home, or in another area of your life. Briefly describe the task and estimate how long you’ve been putting it off.

Next, try to determine why you haven’t been able to complete the task. For example, are you waiting to feel more motivated? Are you afraid of failing? Do you feel overwhelmed or overstimulated every time you think about starting, or are you unclear on exactly what you’re trying to accomplish? Write down the reason(s) you think you’re procrastinating.

Finally, think about how you could address the cause(s) of your procrastination on this particular task. (For example, if you’ve been putting off writing a report because you haven’t felt motivated enough to do it, you could increase your motivation by asking a colleague to collaborate with you.) Note at least one idea that you think might help you get started.
