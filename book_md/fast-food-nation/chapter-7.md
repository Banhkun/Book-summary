## Chapter 7: Contamination Nation

Beyond its exploitative labor practices at every level of the supply chain, fast food has also proven an ideal vector for the spread of foodborne pathogens into America’s food system. Because of the fast food industry’s demands for highly centralized production and enormous scale, tainted meat (particularly the ground beef used in hamburgers) processed at one meatpacking plant can cause a nationwide epidemic of food poisoning—with tragic and deadly consequences.

### Going Viral

**Outbreaks of _E. coli_ , a virulent pathogen primarily found in beef, have become far more common since the rise of fast food.** One 1997 outbreak was traced to a single plant in Nebraska that had been built to supply ground beef to Burger King, resulting in the nationwide recall of 35 million pounds of meat (25 million of which had already been eaten). Most of the other major foodborne pathogens like _Salmonella_ , _Listeria_ , and _Clostridium_ are caused by animal feces making it into the meat we eat.

Foodborne pathogens cause more than just an upset stomach. They can lead to heart disease, neurological disorders, kidney damage, and even death. And they’re becoming more common and more widespread thanks to fast food’s revolutionary changes in how American food is produced. **A centralized system of food production exponentially expands the reach and scope of outbreaks** , where they might have been confined to a particular locality just a few decades ago. The very same system that creates enormous amounts of uniform ground beef for McDonald’s and Burger King is also highly adept at spreading disease. Foodborne illness has truly gone viral.

### Poison Happy Meals

Tragically, some of the worst stories of fast food-related foodborne illness are those involving children. In 1993, doctors in Seattle noticed a sharp spike in the number of local children being admitted to emergency rooms with bloody diarrhea. Health officials traced the source to _E. coli_ in hamburger patties at Jack-in-the-Box that had originated from a California-based meatpacking company. Eventually, more than 700 people across four states were sickened, most of them children. One six-year-old girl died in her mother’s arms after suffering through excruciating pain and three heart attacks. In 1982, _E. coli_ was also found in burgers sold at McDonald’s restaurants in Oregon and Michigan, causing dozens of children to fall ill.

Children under the age of five are especially vulnerable to _E. coli_ , and the pathogen is now the leading cause of kidney failure among American children. And its effects on children are truly horrific. In 1993, one six-year-old boy developed abdominal cramps after eating a tainted hamburger. This progressed to bloody diarrhea, the destruction of internal organs, and the liquifying of his brain before his ultimate death.

**Distressingly, much of this tainted meat is served to children in their school cafeterias through the USDA’s school lunch program**. Some of the meatpackers who provide ground beef for the program have been found to be processing cattle that are already dead when they reach the plant, mixing rotten meat into packages of ground beef, and maintaining facilities infested with rats and cockroaches. Conservative judges have given legal cover to ground beef processors by ruling that they cannot be held responsible for bacteria in their meat, when the bacteria might have come from the slaughterhouses they purchased it from. This novel argument ensures that **meatpackers and fast food chains face little legal incentive to demand better standards from their suppliers**.

### In the Feedlot

_E. coli_ has likely been present in American cattle herds for decades. But until the rise of industrial-scale, centralized meatpacking driven by the demands of the fast food industry, its spread was fairly limited. The disease gets its start in the vast feedlots of today’s slaughterhouses.

**These facilities are marked by appalling sanitary conditions, where the cattle are packed into close quarters, given little exercise, and splash around in pools of manure**. This creates ideal conditions for bacteria to grow and make the animals sick. This is exacerbated by what the cattle are now increasingly being fed: the rendered remains of dead sheep and other cattle, as well as dead dogs and cats purchased from animal shelters. Natural herbivores, cows’ stomachs are not designed to eat other animals. Forcing them to do so is not only inhumane and cruel, but also facilitates the growth of deadly parasites in their bodies that are then passed on to the humans who eventually consume their meat.

Things get even worse after the animals are slaughtered. We’ve already seen how unskilled and poorly trained workers make up a larger and larger share of the meatpacking workforce. When these workers improperly pull out the stomach and intestines of the cattle by hand, they often spill the contents of the digestive system all over the slaughterhouse floor. **With the industry’s relentless focus on speed and scale, much of this finds its way into the meat that’s sold to consumers**. Similarly, these workers are rarely instructed in how to clean and disinfect the knives they use to cut cattle carcasses.

#### Ground Beef

The statistics paint a truly alarming picture. The US Department of Agriculture estimates that about 1 percent of cattle at industrial feedlots carry _E. coli_ in the stomach. At the standard rate of production, this means that three or four infected cattle are processed at a large slaughterhouse _every hour._

The problem is compounded exponentially by ground beef, which is, of course, highly demanded by the fast food industry. Unlike a specific cut of beef, the ground meat in your burger doesn’t just come from one cow. **The meat of one infected cow can find its way into 32,000 pounds of ground beef.**

### The Industry Fights Back

**The meatpacking industry and the fast food giants have fought tooth-and-nail against any regulatory efforts to raise standards in the nation’s food supply**. During the 1980s, they successfully blocked a federal rule that would have required microbial testing, preferring to rely on the far-less reliable (but far-less costly) method of simply looking at and smelling the meat to determine its safety.

At the behest of industry lobbyists, the Reagan Administration cut spending on health initiatives and appointed former meatpacking executives to run the US Department of Agriculture. Truly, the wolves were guarding the henhouse. These officials gave the industry broad latitude to set its own food-safety standards, largely free from federal oversight. The meat of visibly diseased cattle infected with tapeworms and measles, their bodies covered with bloody abscesses, was allowed to be sold to the American public.

The meat industry has indeed achieved an extraordinary level of control over the nation’s food safety watchdog agencies. **Under federal law, the USDA has no legal authority to demand a recall of bad meat**. All it can do is pliantly work with the company in question and _suggest_ that it withdraw its products from the market. Most recalls are thus voluntary on the part of the company, not the result of a government order. The USDA must rely only on statistics voluntarily provided by the company to determine how large the outbreak is, while the company is not required to inform the public when a recall is underway.

There are remedies to the unsanitary conditions in America’s slaughterhouses and feedlots. The technology exists to improve the situation. Moreover, a system of performance-based grading would assign grades to meat produced from every meatpacking plant. The grades would be determined by the frequency of contamination at that plant and would be applied to the label of every product that they sold. This would allow consumers to make informed decisions about where they buy their meat. The industry has vehemently opposed the implementation of such a system. **It’s not that the meatpackers and the fast food giants believe that cleaning up their act would be impossible; it’s that they don’t want to.**
