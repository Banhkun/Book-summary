## Chapter 8: Fast Food World

Fast food began in Southern California as a quintessentially American product, boosted by US postwar prosperity and powered by the nation’s growing rates of automobile ownership, highway construction, and suburban sprawl. From these roots, the industry expanded to take over the rest of the country. But it hasn’t stopped there: **fast food is now available in almost every country on the planet.** Through this global conquest, it has reshaped how the entire world eats and lives.

### Fall of the Iron Curtain, Rise of the Golden Arches

The collapse of the Soviet Union, beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and ending in the final dissolution of the superpower state in 1991, was a dramatic moment in world history. All across Central and Eastern Europe, people took to the streets, refused to obey the orders of Soviet police and military officers, overthrew puppet Communist governments, and participated in free democratic elections for the first time ever. Little did they know that the fall of the Soviet empire would signal the rise of another: that of fast food.

**Just months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, McDonald’s announced that it planned to open a location in East Germany,** the first in the former Soviet Union. Indeed, fast food chains have become a leading indicator of Western economic development in Third World or post-communist states. They are often the first international corporations to arrive after a country has made the decision to open its markets to foreign investment. In the early 1990s, McDonald’s frequently awarded franchises to former Communist officials, thanks to their proven combination of connections and leadership skills.

Fast food has aggressively positioned itself in former Soviet states and even recruited ex-Communist leaders to serve as spokespeople. In 1997, Mikhail Gorbachev, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, appeared in a Pizza Hut commercial. He was hired to serve as a warm and familiar face who could help introduce the Russian people to fast food. In the 1990s, Gorbachev was a frequent figure on the paid-lecture circuit, delivering speeches in which he advertised Russia’s openness to foreign investment to audiences of fast food executives.

**The opening of the first McDonald’s in China, although still nominally a communist state, was met with great enthusiasm by the public** in 1992. Thousands of people waited in line to take their first bite of a Big Mac, as the chain’s mere presence seemed to symbolize the long-awaited arrival of modernity. McDonald’s has shown few qualms about opening for business in culturally or religiously significant places—the golden arches are now in the Muslim holy city of Mecca and in Beijing’s Forbidden City. Perhaps most shockingly, the company even opened up a restaurant on what was once the grounds of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau—and aggressively marketed itself to visitors with flyers announcing, “Welcome to Dachau and welcome to McDonald’s.”

### Global Strategy

**As fast food has planted its flag in nearly every corner of the world, it has developed a truly global supply chain**. The major chains source as many of their supplies as possible from the countries where they do business.

Seven years before opening their first location in India, McDonald’s began cultivating relationships with agricultural vendors in that country, even teaching farmers how to grow the exact right kind of lettuce, using genetically modified seeds uniquely created to survive in India’s climate. The big agribusiness firms have followed suit, with ConAgra, Cargill, J.R. Simplot, and Tyson setting up large-scale factory farming operations in Australia, Canada, China, India, and Turkey.

And as fast food has entered the European, Asian, and Australian markets, so has its aggressive marketing tactics aimed at children. One researcher found that all the children at a school in Beijing recognized Ronald McDonald and that Coca-Cola is the favorite drink among Chinese children.

**Much of the foreign embrace of fast food is closely linked to the global community’s view of postwar America as a beacon of prosperity and freedom**. This was especially true in European countries recovering from the trauma and dislocation of World War Two. In countries like West Germany, kids developed an early fascination with American pop culture—rock and roll music, television, films, and, of course, fast food. With creeping Americanization and the spread of fast food, restaurants serving traditional cuisines are a dying breed: traditional German restaurants serving schnitzel, bratwurst, and sauerbraten account for less than one-third of the German food service market.

### Exporting Obesity

**As fast food has spread throughout the world, so has one of its worst by-products—obesity.** The US already has the highest rate of obesity among industrialized countries, a trend largely driven by growing fast food consumption. In 1991, only four states had obesity rates reaching 15 percent; by the dawn of the 21st century, 37 did.

(Shortform note: This trend has only gotten worse since the publication of _Fast Food Nation_. According to a 2018 report from the Centers for Disease Control, every US state and territory has self-reported adult obesity rates over 20 percent. The worst US state is Mississippi, with an obesity rate of 37.3 percent. Even more alarming is the overseas territory of American Samoa, where a whopping 75 percent of adults identified themselves as obese.)

By 2001, obesity-related healthcare costs had risen to a staggering $240 billion, with Americans spending in excess of $33 billion on weight loss regimens and diet programs. Beyond just the financial cost, the human costs are immense: severely overweight people are four times as likely to die young as people of normal weight.

**These health conditions are now increasingly seen in other parts of the world** , as fast food continues its seemingly unstoppable march of global conquest. Between 1984 and 1993, fast food locations in the United Kingdom doubled, leaving American-style obesity in their wake. The British consume more fast food than any other Western European country; they also claim the continent’s highest rate of obesity. Not to be outdone, China saw its proportion of overweight teenagers triple during the 1990s; meanwhile, at the dawn of the 21st century, one-third of all Japanese men in their 30s are overweight.

### Greenpeace v. McDonald’s

**Labor unions, governments, and activists of various stripes have attempted to push back against the spread of fast food** and the economic and cultural globalization that it represents. Perhaps the most famous of these efforts at resistance was the “McLibel” case, which captured world attention and shook the British legal system.

In 1986, London-based Greenpeace activists distributed a leaflet entitled “What’s Wrong with McDonald’s?” in which they assailed the fast food giant’s record on food safety, labor, and the environment, among other grievances. In 1990, McDonald’s sued members of the group for libel, arguing that every claim in the leaflet was false. In doing this, the McDonald’s Corporation thought it had an advantage: British libel laws are highly favorable to the plaintiff, as the burden of proof lies with the defendant. McDonald’s would only need to clear a very low evidentiary bar for the British courts to convict Greenpeace, which would make an example out of the troublesome group and intimidate others into silence.

**The McDonald’s legal strategy backfired badly when two members of the group decided to fight back.** A network of activists helped fund their legal efforts, and soon, through the legal process of discovery, the pair were able to obtain 40,000 pages of documents, as well as witness statements and transcripts detailing the chain’s labor, marketing, environmental, and animal welfare practices. Through the trial, they were able to turn the table on McDonald’s and bring unprecedented negative media attention to the fast food giant.

Although McDonald’s ultimately won the case, it was a hollow, Pyrrhic victory: the £60,000 in libel damages they were awarded were far outweighed by the lasting damage to their public reputation.
