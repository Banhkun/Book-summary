## Chapter 3: McJobs

The fast food industry has standardized, commodified, and homogenized the skillset of the country’s labor force. Going back to the early days of the McDonald brothers’ “Speedee Service” system, fast food has employed **a low-skill, low-wage system of labor that keeps costs—and therefore, consumer prices—to a minimum**. By minimizing the level of human skill that goes into food preparation, fast food leaders have at their disposal a workforce that is cheap, easy to replace, and easily controlled.

And they are always finding new ways to keep their employees from gaining any leverage in the workplace. Automatic condiment dispensers, robotic sensors at drive-throughs, digitized timers for cooking french fries, and other technological innovations ensure that McDonald’s and other fast food giants get maximum efficiency out of their employees, with paychecks as low as possible.

### Commodified Product, Commodified Workforce

**Anyone who’s been inside a fast food restaurant can’t help but notice that the workers behind the counter are disproportionately young—often teenagers.**

(Shortform note: According to _The Atlantic_ , over 60 percent of the fast-food workforce is under 24).

That’s no coincidence. The industry wants a workforce that is unskilled and willing to accept low pay. From the view of the fast food executives and franchisees, teenagers are the ideal candidates for these jobs. But the teenagers themselves are ill-served by this arrangement. Working long hours at fast-food restaurants has a negative effect on their education and takes away from more meaningful opportunities for enrichment. These teenage fast food workers neglect their schoolwork and eschew after-school sports and activities. Research has shown that **people this age who work more than twenty hours per week are at a higher risk of dropping out of school, permanently stunting their life prospects**.

**Quantity is the key to how McDonald’s and Burger King operate, not quality**. Getting maximum production out of the workforce, maximum speed and volume of product output, is how they make money. With the right technology and system of management, even a small number of unskilled workers can churn out a high level of goods on the cheap.

**The fast food chains have taken almost all skill and talent out of food preparation**. At McDonald’s, nearly all of the buns, patties, and fries arrive at the restaurant frozen. All the employees need to do is thaw it, assemble it, and serve it. Every step of this process is painstakingly laid out in a four-pound manual known as “the bible” that employees are told to follow to the letter, no exceptions. The point is to achieve total uniformity of the product. This level of control and standardization—from where the supplies come from to how the food is prepared to how it is presented—is why a Big Mac tastes and looks the same everywhere, from Boston to Beijing.

Naturally, the employees in such a system are highly interchangeable, mere cogs in a machine. In addition to teenagers, fast food chains are also major hirers of recent immigrants (including many undocumented people), the handicapped, and the elderly. With low skill-sets and little leverage in the labor market (and with undocumented immigrants in particular being at a disadvantage due to their legal status and the language barrier), **these groups make for pliant, reliable, and easily replaceable workers.**

#### Public Funding

**Not only are fast food companies exploiting some of the most vulnerable members of society—they’re doing it with your tax dollars**. These firms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of grants and subsidies from federal programs that were originally created to encourage companies to teach employees valuable job skills. Well-intended programs like the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit now increasingly subsidize low-wage, low-skill jobs at McDonald’s. In effect, the government is _rewarding_ these companies for exploiting their workforce through lucrative tax breaks (in the 1990s, this figure was $2,400 for every new low-income worker hired by the fast food chains).

Adding insult to injury, this federal largesse isn’t even creating net-new employment opportunities—studies have shown that **most of these workers would have been hired anyway,** with or without the subsidies**.** On top of that, all the chains need to do is employ a worker for 400 hours (about 20 weeks for a part-time employee) to claim the money from the government. If that worker quits (as frequently happens in a high-turnover industry like fast food), they can start the process all over again when they hire their replacement. The US taxpayer is bankrolling the industry’s hire-and-quit labor practices.

#### Minimum Wages, Minimum Hours

Unsurprisingly, the fast food chains, through their lobbying groups like the National Restaurant Association, are vehemently opposed to any raising of federal, state, or local minimum wages. This is despite the fact that **a one-dollar minimum raise increase would only translate into a two-cent rise in the cost of a fast food burger**.

Both corporate management and individual franchisees are also very strict about making sure that employees don’t work more than 40 hours per week, which would qualify them for overtime under federal law. They are scheduled only as needed, and sent home early if they start approaching the 40-hour threshold. Sometimes, fast food employers simply have their employees work off-the-clock, without pay, in order to avoid legal overtime pay requirements (as a 1997 court case against Taco Bell showed).

#### Obedience

**The decentralized franchise model of the fast food industry creates ample opportunities for exploitation**. Kitchen and behind-the-counter workers at your local fast food restaurant aren’t hired by McDonald’s or Burger King directly. They’re hired by the local franchise operator, who is given wide latitude by the chain to set wages and working conditions. This absolves the corporation of any legal responsibility for approximately 75 percent of its workforce.

**The industry is also known for being one of the most uncompromisingly anti-union sectors of the economy.** On the rare occasions where employees at an individual McDonald’s have attempted to organize themselves into a labor union, they have been subjected to a barrage of propaganda, spying, surveillance, and threats. When these tactics fail, the company has been known to simply shut down individual restaurants where there has been even a whiff of potential union activity.

#### Dangerous Conditions

**State and federal labor laws that prohibit workers under 18 from working more than eight hours per day or with dangerous machinery are routinely violated by the fast food industry**. Sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds are tasked with operating dangerous food preparation equipment like electric tomato dicers and deep-fryers. Unsurprisingly, given the preponderance of these workers in fast food, the injury rate for American teenage workers is twice that of adults. Burns, cuts, and falls are common occupational hazards in America’s fast food kitchens.

Even more disturbingly, fast food workers face an extraordinarily high risk of being murdered on the job, as these restaurants present an attractive target for armed robbers lured by their late-night hours of operation and convenient getaway locations off the major freeways. In 1998 alone, more fast food workers were killed on the job than police officers.

(Shortform note: According to a 2011 Slate article, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that assaults are twice as frequent at fast food restaurants as they are at full-service restaurants. The latter had 0.8 assaults per 10,000 employees in 2009; fast-food restaurants had 1.8.)

Teenagers are frequently made to work the late shifts, when the vast majority of robberies and assaults occur. The industry has used all of its influence in Washington, DC and in state capitals to fight against any efforts to improve workplace safety.

### Franchisees: Employed Entrepreneurs

What does it mean to become a fast food franchisee? It blends aspects of being an independent, self-employed business owner with elements of being a salaried employee. For many franchisees, it combines the disadvantages of both, with little of the upside.

A franchise is an agreement between a franchisor and a franchisee. The franchisor (the McDonald’s Corporation) provides the brand name, intellectual property, guidance, and access to supplies and equipment; the franchisee puts in the start-up capital and does the day-to-day work of actually running the restaurant. The franchisor sacrifices some degree of control and oversight; the franchisee foregoes much of the independent decision-making that a truly independent business owner would have, as they must adhere to the company’s rules through a signed contract.**Because of their vastly greater wealth and power, franchisors almost always win any disputes that arise between the two parties.**

Franchising was an easy way for fast food companies to expand throughout the US, out of their Southern California home base. McDonald’s, as usual, led the charge. Ray Kroc prioritized volume—he wanted McDonald’s to plant its flag everywhere in America’s rapidly growing suburban postwar landscape. He charged minimal fees for new franchises and was receptive to individual franchisees’ ideas for how to improve the brand. **He wanted to forge a bond between the McDonald’s Corporation and its network of franchisees, one based on unquestioned loyalty to the company.** Franchising eventually became the dominant model of growth for the entire fast food industry.

#### Fast Food Franchising: The Worst of Both Worlds

Under Kroc’s direction, McDonald’s proved adept at profiting off its franchisees. For example, the McDonald’s Corporation made it standard practice to acquire the land on which franchisees would build their restaurants. They would then lease this land back to the franchisees at exorbitant 40 percent markups.**The company was making more money charging rent than they were selling hamburgers.** As landlord, this also gave the corporation the right to evict franchisees that it believed were acting in violation of the lease.

By the early 2000s, it would cost about $500,000 to become a McDonald’s franchisee. Trade groups like the International Franchising Association argue that franchising is the safest, least risky way to go into business for yourself. You get the benefits of a famous brand and a well-known and well-liked product. But some research tells a very different story—**one university study found that 38.1 percent of franchisees failed within their first 4-5 years, a rate of failure 6.2 percent higher than for independent businesses.** In many ways, fast food franchising combines the worst of both worlds: the high risks of independent business ownership and the lack of autonomy that comes with being a salaried employee.

Moreover, the incentives of the franchisee and the franchisor aren’t as aligned as advocates of the arrangement claim they are. Franchisors earn the bulk of the revenue from royalties based on total sales, creating a strong incentive for them to open as many stores as possible. For the individual franchisee, however, other stores mean more competition. If you own one McDonald’s location, you don’t want another one opening just a few blocks away—but this is precisely what the company does all the time. **They frequently pit franchisees against one another and cannibalize each other’s profits.**

Franchisees are also required to purchase their supplies either directly from the franchisor or from an approved list of vendors (regardless of the prices these vendors might charge), although they are not covered by consumer protection laws. Moreover, **the third-party suppliers often pay kickbacks in the form of rebates to the franchisor** —despite the obvious conflict of interest, this is all perfectly legal as well. As part of entering into a franchising agreement, the individual store owner is often forced to forego their legal right to file complaints under state law, leaving them with little recourse to redress the abuses and exploitative practices they are subjected to at the hands of the franchisor. Thus, the franchisee’s freedom is actually highly limited.

#### SBA Loans to Fast Food Giants

As with proposed changes to labor laws, the fast food industry has fought strenuously against any legislative or regulatory changes that would protect franchisees. But the fast food giants are hardly principled adherents of unfettered free market capitalism—they are quite happy to take advantage of federal programs that subsidize their expansion.

Because franchise restaurants technically meet the definition of “small businesses,” **major fast food companies have been able to obtain easy financing from the Small Business Administration (SBA)** to expand into new territory. Thus, a federal program that was created to help small, independent businesses is actually contributing to their demise by subsidizing the growth of McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and other fast food power players. In 1996 alone, the SBA guaranteed almost $1 billion in loans to new franchisees. Not only are fast food companies squeezing their franchisees—they’re doing it with a helping hand from the US government.
