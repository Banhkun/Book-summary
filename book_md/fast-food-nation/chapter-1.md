## Chapter 1: SoCal Origins

The fast food industry has its roots in the risk-taking, unconventional ideas of a handful of entrepreneurs. **A combination of US public policy choices and broader macroeconomic trends fostered an ideal business climate in Southern California** for their success and laid the groundwork for an economic transformation of the region—one that would eventually become the prototype for the rest of the country. Taxpayer-funded irrigation projects and publicly subsidized highways were drawing people to California in droves, laying the groundwork for a mass consumer-driven retail economy (powered by the ease and convenience of the automobile) that California would export to the other 49 states.

**This population explosion was also driven by another stream of federal investment in Southern California—defense spending.** During World War Two and the years immediately following, the US government pumped nearly $20 billion into California, building airplane factories, steel mills, military bases, and naval ports. During the war years alone, federal spending accounted for approximately half of Southern Californians’ personal income.

If the old cities of the East Coast were shaped by the railroad and the trolley car, then **Southern California was defined by the automobile**. LA’s growth happened precisely at the time when mass-produced cars were becoming affordable to the growing middle class—indeed, from 1920 to 1940, the region welcomed 2 million residents from all across the rest of the US. The automobile sculpted the city, giving rise to LA’s famous low-density, detached-home model of growth (with each unit having room for a garage or driveway with one or two family cars). By 1940, LA had roughly one million cars, more than the vast majority of most of the states. Much of this was fueled by federally funded highways, which amounted to a public subsidy of the major automakers.

Local entrepreneurs quickly saw that they needed to adapt their business models to account for the car-driven growth of the region. Zipping by in their cars, **the new consumers placed a premium on speed, convenience, and easy access from the freeways**. Thus, Southern California became home to the world’s first motel and drive-in bank. The lesson was not lost on the region’s restaurateurs—beginning in the 1940s, Southern California saw an explosion of drive-in restaurants offering curbside service to motorists waiting in their cars. **The speed of the automobile made flashy marketing a necessity: drivers needed to be able to see the restaurant signs as they whizzed by**. With a corresponding rise in the population of teenagers in Los Angeles County, the new drive-ins fit in perfectly with the rising youth culture, offering a unique blend of girls, cars, and late-night food.

### Carl Karcher

One entrepreneur who seized the opportunity was Carl Karcher. Born to a hardworking German Catholic family and raised on a farm in the Midwest, Carl moved to the then-small city of Anaheim in the 1930s. While working as a bakery truck driver, Carl took note of the local hot dog vendors and saw how successful they were selling frankfurters to the nearby factory workers. He was deeply impressed by the sheer number of franks and buns that these hot dog carts seemed to go through in just a day.

After taking out a small bank loan, he purchased his _own_ hot dog cart and went into business for himself. It was a success—by 1944, he and his wife owned four hot dog stands, each of them doing a brisk business. In January 1945, he opened his first sit-down restaurant, Carl’s Drive-in Barbeque, featuring a five-pointed star at the top of a neon sign in the parking lot—even at this early stage, **Carl had seen that the automobile was the way of the future**. His business boomed as more and more of Anaheim’s disposable income went into the pockets of keen entrepreneurs like himself.

### The Rise of the Golden Arches

One day, he heard of a restaurant outside of LA that was selling hamburgers for 15 cents each—far less than what he was charging. Determined to know what their secret was, he ventured out to San Bernardino to catch his first glimpse of a restaurant that would eventually change the world: “McDonald’s Famous Hamburgers.”

**The McDonald brothers had implemented a “Speedee Service” system that was designed to increase speed, lower prices, and boost sales volume of their hamburgers**. This was the secret to their success and was the formula that birthed the fast food industry as we know it. Everything was standardized: they would sell only burgers, offer no expensive serving ware with the meals, and divide the food preparation into separate jobs done by different workers. This eliminated the need for skilled (and expensive) short-order cooks, as well as dishwashers. **It was bringing the management principles of the Ford assembly line to the realm of food preparation**. In addition to these advances in the restaurant’s day-to-day operations, the brothers also designed and installed the famous golden arches on the roof, destined to become one of the world’s most recognizable corporate logos. The business model was a runaway success. For the first time, it enabled even working-class families to afford restaurant food.

Inspired by what he saw, Carl Karcher decided to open his _own_ McDonald’s-style restaurant. The timing was perfect. President Eisenhower’s signing of the Interstate Highway Act in 1956 created nearly 50,000 miles of new paved roadways and invested over $130 billion into the American economy. **These new federally subsidized highways promised to lead the new generation of American car-owners right from their suburban homes and into the new fast food restaurants**.

Soon, Carl was at the head of a large and growing empire of self-service restaurants strategically located off California’s new freeways. Scores of imitators across the country did what Carl did and replicated the McDonalds’ idea, giving rise to many fast food chains that are with us today—Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Dunkin’, and Kentucky Fried Chicken, to name just a few. The growth of the industry was explosive—between 1960 and 1973, McDonald’s grew from 250 locations to 3,000.
