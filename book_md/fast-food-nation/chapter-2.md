## Chapter 2: Marketing to Kids

The McDonald brothers may have started the company and given it its famous name, but their vision for it was relatively limited. They were content being regionally successful restaurant entrepreneurs, making approximately $100,000 per year (by no means a small sum in the mid-1950s). They did not see the global potential of what they had created—that vision was Ray Kroc’s.

Kroc was an unlikely individual to emerge as one of the leading figures in a new and rising industry that was largely driven by youth culture. When he first visited the McDonald’s Self-Service Restaurant in 1954, he was already in his fifties, with a largely unremarkable career as a travelling salesman behind him.

Seeing the potential of the McDonald’s system and how it could be replicated on a national (and eventually global) scale, Kroc seized the opportunity.**He bought from the McDonald brothers the right to franchise McDonald’s nationwide**. Taken at face value, this deal was appealing to the brothers—they could stay at home and count their money while Kroc travelled across the country promoting the brand and taking most of the risks. But Kroc would determine the ultimate direction and shape of McDonald’s, not the founding brothers.

Kroc saw that expansion was important to building up the brand: to him, it was more important to have new McDonald’s restaurants opening up than it was to have a uniform set of financial details for each new franchise. He kept the franchise fees low for new franchisees and made a conscious effort to help them be successful. This patient and nurturing strategy paid off and resulted in the successful expansion of McDonald’s. In 1961, Kroc had done well enough in growing the company to secure the financing to buy the brothers out. As a symbol of his total triumph over them, Kroc opened up a McDonald’s across the street from a _new_ restaurant they opened (called “The Big M”) and ran it out of business.

### Kids: The Best Salespeople

**Kroc instituted a philosophy, the core values that would guide McDonald’s—Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value.** He was a dogged believer in McDonald’s, selling franchises with an almost holy zeal. What he understood keenly was the power that young people had over American consumer spending—especially children. Like his contemporary and friend Walt Disney (with whom he has often been compared), **Kroc was a master at marketing to kids**. Once again, the strategy was right for the times. America was experiencing the baby boom of the postwar years, during which birth rates skyrocketed—between 1944 and 1961, over 65 million children were born in the United States. There was now a youth market that, in terms of sheer scale and disposable income, was unlike anything that had ever existed before.

To bring in families with young children, **Kroc knew he needed to create a wholesome, clean, All-American image for McDonald’s.** Even in these early days, there was an emphasis on bright, colorful mascots and an entertaining atmosphere for children. In 1965, McDonald’s unveiled a new mascot who would come to eclipse even Disney’s Mickey Mouse in popularity: Ronald McDonald. Expanding on this idea, Kroc installed mini playgrounds at each McDonald’s location. This, of course, attracted more children, which attracted more parents and grandparents—and more sales.

Under Kroc’s direction, **McDonald’s became a pioneer at marketing to children, a practice that is now widespread across consumer brands**. By the early 2000s, there existed an entire subset of the marketing and advertising industries devoted solely to fostering brand loyalty in children. Indeed, this familiarity and affinity with brands and products can begin in children as young as two.

Marketers recognize that **kids are powerful surrogate salespeople and brand ambassadors**. By bugging and cajoling their parents, children exert a great deal of influence over family spending decisions. Within the marketing industry, this has been distilled down to a science, with advertisers differentiating between the different _types_ of whining and pleading that kids will do to harangue their parents. Marketers have, for example, identified pleading nags (repetition of “please”) and sugar-coated nags (in which kids promise affection in exchange for the product they want) as highly distinct appeals. The goal is always to get kids to feel a natural affection, even _love_ for the brand, a bond as close as that they feel for their own family.

To market to kids, advertisers need to study kids. Today, they survey children at malls and public places, run focus groups on them, and even study their artwork to unlock the elusive (but lucrative) mystery of what exactly it is they want. They have even enlisted child psychologists into their efforts, using a technique called the Character Appeal Quadrant Analysis to help craft characters and mascots that ideally suit their target audience’s level of psychological and emotional development. This is especially effective, as research has consistently shown that children are seldom able to tell the difference between TV shows and TV advertising.

**Efforts to crack down on advertising targeted at children have met with fierce opposition from special-interest groups**. As far back as 1978, the Federal Trade Commission attempted an outright ban on all television ads aimed at kids under seven—but lobbies like the National Association of Broadcasters, the Toy Manufacturers of America, and the Association of National Advertisers used their influence in Congress to stymie the effort.

### A Symbiotic Relationship

The efforts of fast food chains to market to children extend far beyond conventional ad buys. **The industry works hand-in-glove with toy companies and film studios (with whom they share a target audience) to cross-promote their products** across one another’s platforms. The most famous example of this is the Happy Meal, within which McDonald’s packages the hottest children’s toys as a “free” promotion. This drives further sales of both the Happy Meals and the toys—achieving a perfect synergy between McDonald’s and the toy industry.

Major toy crazes like Pokemon cards, Beanie Babies, Tamogotchis, and Cabbage Patch Kids have all been boosted by synergistic fast food tie-ins. In just 10 days in 1997, McDonald’s sold approximately 100 million Happy Meals thanks to its Teenie Beanie Baby cross-promotion with the toy company Ty.

Film studios have also gotten in on the shared cash streams from the fast food giants, forging deals to promote toys and collectibles featuring their movie characters in fast food meals. This has only strengthened the bond between Hollywood and fast food, with top executives frequently moving back and forth between the industries. This symbiotic relationship was epitomized by a historic 1996 global marketing agreement brokered between McDonald’s and Disney, which gives them exclusive rights to cross-promote one another’s products. The two brands, forged by two similar men with a similar vision for the future of American capitalism, were now forever entwined.

(Shortform note: Fast Food Nation was published in 2001, so some of the references in the book are a bit out-of-date. In more recent years, McDonald’s has promoted toys from films such as _Toy Story 4, Incredibles 2,_ and _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_.)

### In the Schools

Fast food chains aggressively market to kids across multiple platforms, as frequently as they can. But for a long time, there was one place they couldn’t reach this target audience, where kids were segregated for 6-8 hours every weekday in a setting free of advertising—schools. Naturally, fast food companies and advertising agencies weren’t content with this state of affairs. They were losing prime hours of potential marketing to their most valuable and loyal customers.

In the 1990s, that all started to change. In 1993, a school district in Colorado Springs, saddled by budget cuts and the anti-tax politics of its voters, decided to turn to an outside source for funds: Burger King.**The fast food giant agreed to pay the district $37,500 per year (in practice, barely more than $1 per student) in exchange for the rights to place its ads in the hallways of the schools and on the sides of buses.**

Schools began hiring marketing and negotiating consultants to help them get the best possible deal from companies all-too-eager to break into this formerly ad-free bastion of American life. In 1997, that same district in Colorado Springs secured a ten-year agreement with Coca-Cola to make the soft drink giant its exclusive beverage provider—bringing the schools $11 million in badly needed revenue and yielding Coca-Cola an unprecedented marketing opportunity in one of America’s fastest-growing cities.

**For advertisers, getting into the schools is a no-brainer** : it’s an opportunity to bombard their most valuable, loyal, and defenseless customers with ads in a setting where they’re _legally required to be._ These marketers also claim to be doing noble, civic-minded work—after all, they’re providing public schools with a much-needed infusion of cash.

Colorado Springs’ idea to work hand-in-hand with fast food set a trend for the future. **By the 2000s, fast food chains like Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway, and Dominos were directly selling their products in thousands of school districts across the country,** with 30 percent of public high schools selling branded fast food.
