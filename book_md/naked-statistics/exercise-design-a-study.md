## Exercise: Design a Study

Now that we've covered the potential and the pitfalls of inferential statistics, think about a question that you are interested in and how you could use statistics to help answer it.

* * *

What are your independent and dependent variables in this study? What are your null and alternative hypotheses?

What data would you collect on your variables, and how would you collect it?

With an emphasis on the central limit theorem, how could you apply the principles of inferential statistics to analyze your data?

Letâ€™s say you were able to reject your null hypothesis. What would your next steps as a researcher be?
