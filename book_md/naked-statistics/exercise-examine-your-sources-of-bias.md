## Exercise: Examine Your Sources of Bias

Consider the following hypothetical research scenario:

Researchers interested in the effect of yoga and meditation on emotional wellbeing set up a booth at a large ashram on the last day of a week-long yoga retreat. (Their null hypothesis is that participating in yoga and meditation every day has no impact on emotional well-being.) As participants leave the retreat, many stop by the booth to fill out the researchers’ questionnaire, where they are asked whether they believe that yoga and meditation have a positive impact on their emotional well-being and to rate their sense of emotional well-being today compared to the first day of the retreat. Using this data, the researchers reject their null hypothesis and publish a paper entitled: “Daily Yoga Practice Universally Improves Emotional Well-Being.”

What sources of selection bias can you identify in this study? (Remember, selection bias happens when our sample is not random, and certain subsets of the population are over- or underrepresented.)

What sources of recall bias can you identify in this study? (Remember, recall bias happens when we ask people to give us data on the effect of a treatment or event retroactively.)

What sources of healthy user/survivorship bias can you identify in this study? (Remember, healthy user bias happens when people who engage in the treatment we’re studying are fundamentally different from other groups. Survivorship bias happens when our sample consists of only those who remain at the end of a “treatment.”)

How could the researchers redesign their study to be less biased?
