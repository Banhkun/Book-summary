## Why Learn Statistics?

The second half of _Naked Statistics’s_ title, _Stripping the Dread From the Data_ , tells readers why Wheelan’s book is a good choice if they are curious about statistics but apprehensive of a math-based book. Wheelan, a New York Times best-selling author, senior lecturer at Dartmouth College, and former senior lecturer at the University of Chicago, uses his skills as a teacher and storyteller to make analyzing data relatable, digestible, and entertaining.

As Wheelan explains, statistics are powerful tools for summarizing information and making inferences from data. He notes that people would have difficulty gleaning meaning from the mountains of data our society generates daily without them. Therefore,**statistics make data meaningful and actionable.**

The insights we generate with statistics help run society as we know it. For example, best practices in medicine and education are established via statistical analyses of data. Lawmakers use data to inform policy. Sports enthusiasts use data to discuss the skill and potential of their favorite players and teams, and the list goes on. We use statistics in so many ways that Wheelan reminds us that they inform our daily lives whether we realize it or not.

Since we live in a statistics-driven society, Wheelan argues that **to be informed citizens who can properly interpret data, we all need a basic understanding of foundational statistics concepts and techniques.** This guide will focus on several of the most basic and commonly used statistics that we're likely to encounter regularly (for example, on the news or in a political debate).

> **Data Literacy**
> 
> Learning statistics to be an informed citizen is part of a larger skill set called “data literacy.” Data literacy refers to the ability to analyze and interpret data correctly. Just as a literate person can understand a story by reading the words on a page, a data-literate person can look at a statistic, chart, graph, and so on and correctly interpret its “story.” That story makes the statistic meaningful, and a data-literate person can then use that meaning to inform their actions.
> 
> Data literacy is a critical yet neglected skill, and the gap between data literacy _skills_ and data literacy _needs_ in the modern workplace is costly. Many jobs require working with and making decisions using data, yet many employees lack the skills to do this effectively. Estimates show that over $109 billion are lost to the US economy every year due to underdeveloped data literacy skills in the workforce. In response, most corporations are adopting data literacy as a critical skill.

### Dishonesty Disguised With Statistics

There is also a “dark side” of statistics that we become vulnerable to if we don't educate ourselves about basic statistics concepts. Wheelan explains **that the purposeful misuse of statistics is more common than we think.**

Even though statistics are math-based, they’re not always objective, and we should interpret them with critical thinking and, in some cases, skepticism. While the values themselves can't lie, **the statistical tests that people choose to use, the data they choose to calculate statistics with, and the choice to include or not include specific statistics from datasets can construct various versions of “the truth.”** For example, consider the following statements based on the same hypothetical dataset:

  * Vote for Mark Smith! His tax cuts have saved the people in this town an average of $1,000 per year!
  * Don’t vote for Mark Smith! His “tax cuts” have saved the wealthiest 1% of town residents tons of money and have saved low-income residents almost nothing!



Neither of these statements is a lie. Instead, different uses of data and statistics construct versions of the truth that best suit differing perspectives. While we can't expect ourselves to dive into the underlying data for every statistic we read or hear, Wheelan explains that**we can better spot incomplete or misleading information with a basic understanding of statistics.**

> **Dishonest Statistics**
> 
> Darell Huff wrote an entire book about how people use statistics for deception. _How to Lie With Statistics_ was published in 1954 and republished in 1993. According to Huff, one common way that people attempt to “lie with statistics” is to confuse their audience with seemingly precise figures that are actually irrelevant.
> 
> For example, say you asked 30 families to survey the number of birds in their yard on a daily basis and send you their results. You tally them up and report that there are an average of 15.643 birds per yard in your neighborhood. This value looks very precise because of the three decimal places, but is virtually meaningless in reality. How did participants collect their data? How big was their yard? Do they live in the woods or the middle of town? The imprecision of the study is masked by the precision of the reported statistic.
> 
> Another way that people use statistics to mislead an audience is to use impressive-looking values that are only tangentially related to the study. For example, say you’re marketing a “revolutionary” toilet bowl cleaning solution. You might truthfully report that “99.9% of users reported cleaner toilet bowls after scrubbing with your product!” Nearly 100% sounds impressive, until you realize that a scrubbed toilet bowl should always be cleaner than an unscrubbed toilet bowl, even with no chemical solution at all! A more useful and relevant statistic would be _how much cleaner_ a toilet cleaned with your product is compared to your competitors’ products.
