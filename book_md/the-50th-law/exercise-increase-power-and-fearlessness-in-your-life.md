## Exercise: Increase Power and Fearlessness in Your Life

Jackson and Greene recommend following the rules and principles in this guide to foster fearlessness and increase your power and success in life. However, with so many recommendations, it can be difficult to pinpoint where to start. In this exercise, weâ€™ll identify which rules you should target first to make the biggest impact on your fearlessness as soon as possible.

* * *

Of the six rules discussed in this guide, which two rules do you currently struggle to implement the most? Why are these rules particular struggles for you? (For example, maybe you have a crippling fear of death (Rule #6) after losing many loved ones, and you struggle to use aggression effectively (Rule #4) due to poor emotional control.)

For the first rule you noted in the previous question, which principle do you think will most help you implement this behavior? Why? (For example, experiencing awe (Principle #1) might most help you overcome the fear of death because currently, your life feels mundane.)

What are some specific habits, behaviors, or exercises you can adopt to help you practice the principle you listed in the previous question? (For example, you might engage in one activity a week that inspires awe, like hiking to a local beauty spot at sunrise.)

Now, for the second rule you listed in the first question, which principle do you think will most help you implement this behavior? Why? (For example, focusing on remaining cool when faced with outward aggression (Principle #1) might be most beneficial for you because right now, you lose control easily.)

What are some specific habits, behaviors, or exercises you can adopt to help you practice the principle you listed in the previous question? (For example, you could practice deep breathing every day to promote calmness.)
