## Chapter 2.2: Interpretations of the Orient

In the last chapter, we explored how Orientalist attitudes and assumptions had deep roots in European history and the experiences of Westerners with the peoples of the East.

In this chapter, we’re going to carry our analysis forward into the 19th century Age of Imperialism, to see how Orientalists wrote about, acted upon, and interpreted the Orient.

Specifically, we’ll explore:

  * How Orientalism positioned itself as the sole gatekeeper to Western knowledge about the Orient
  * How the field of philology came to occupy a dominant position within Orientalist discourse
  * How Orientalists came to see their role as the interpreters of Eastern culture for both Western audiences and for the people of the East themselves
  * How Orientalist tropes shaped the writing and attitudes of Europeans who visited the Orient during this period



### Orientalism as Gatekeeper

**The work of scholars reflects the economic, social, and historical circumstances in which it was produced.**

Orientalism was and remains a powerful framework, which shaped (and constrained) the way in which Western scholars and observers wrote about and experienced the Orient. As an ideology and as an academic discipline, its core assumptions about what constituted and separated “Orient” from “Occident” influenced scholarly and popular works in history, anthropology, sociology, archeology, and journalism.

**This is because Orientalism functioned as a method of interpretation—the only means by which the mysteries of the East could be understood by the Western reader.** Thus, anyone engaged in any work even remotely connected to the area we now call the Middle East could not help but be influenced by Orientalism’s major works, because it positioned itself as the gatekeeper to such knowledge.

#### Romantic Orientalism

We can see this gatekeeping and interpretive function more clearly if we look at Orientalism in the context of the Romantic movement of the first half of the 19th century.

Romanticism emphasized emotion, intuition, subjectivity, and individual experience. It was a reaction against the scientific rationalism of the Industrial Revolution, as European culture-makers looked backed toward what they imagined to be a nobler, more courtly, and picturesque past.

The Orient, in its wildness, antiquity, and timelessness, served as a powerful source of inspiration for Romantic writers and artists. By revealing the ancient mysteries of the East, the Romantics sought to shake the West out of what they saw as its rationalist stupor and reacquaint it with the divine and mysterious. The Orient could revitalize and save Europe.

Figures like the German poet and literary critic Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829) and his countryman Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772-1801), better known by the pseudonym Novalis, saw the study of the culture and religion of the Orient (India, in their case) to be a means by which Europeans could move past what they saw as Europe’s excessive materialism. Importantly, they also approvingly looked upon the traditional, patriarchal societies of the Orient as an example of a society untouched by (in their view) the decadent and vulgar republicanism that had swept Europe in the wake of the French Revolution.

Of course, **this was another manifestation of the Orientalist mindset—treating the Orient as an object to be interpreted and drawn upon for _Western_ benefit and enlightenment.**

The Romantic movement accordingly fixated upon the ancient languages, cultures, and history of Egypt, Assyria, and Sumer. Little thought was given to the lived experiences of contemporary people of the Middle East, or what they might think about the European appropriation of their cultural heritage.

### The Triumph of Philology

This focus on antiquity brings us to **the field of philology, which was to play a crucial role in the development of Orientalism in the 19th century.** Philology is the study of language, primarily using written, ancient textual sources. By studying ancient literary texts and historical documents, philologists hope to gain greater understanding of the historical development of languages over time.

Philology studies the evolution of languages from a scientific perspective, rejecting the idea that God had given language to humanity—an idea that European writers had embraced since the Middle Ages. The discovery of Sanskrit, an ancient written language that greatly predated the Biblical Hebrew, was a major victory for philology as a field and a significant blow to Judeo-Christian ideas about the divine origins of language, because it showed that Hebrew was just one language among many.

We’ve already seen how Orientalism built upon the edifice of a constructed division between East and West that had existed for much of recorded history—from the Greek and Roman antipathy toward the Persians to the medieval Christian hatred and fear of Islam. We’ve also seen how Orientalists derived their knowledge of—and thus, power over—the East from their ability to produce, translate, and disseminate knowledge about it.

**For the philologists, language was _the_ key to understanding Eastern culture, history, and the “Oriental mind.”** Thus, philology became a powerful tool that enabled Orientalists to add a new rationalist and scientific cast to the ancient East/West division. Nineteenth-century philologists were deeply concerned with dividing ancient languages into families (such as Semitic or Indo-European), comparing grammar and morphology between them, and reducing languages to their roots to find connections to others.

#### Language as Destiny

**Philologist scholarship contributed heavily to the racial determinism that was a hallmark of the social sciences during the 19th century**. By studying the origin and evolution of ancient languages, philologists believed that they could glean great insights into the temperament and essential “racial” characteristics of contemporary Asians.

Orientalist philologists like the Frenchman Ernest Renan (1823-1892) believed they could discover the reasons for what they saw as “shortcomings” in contemporary Eastern civilization and culture in the structure of their ancient languages.

Renan and his colleagues saw the supposedly ossified and static Semitic languages (like Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic) as responsible for the languid and desultory development of the Middle East. He contrasted it with the dynamic and organic Indo-European languages to which could be attributed the success of white European civilization—and its inevitable conquest of the East.

Indo-European languages were fluid and adaptable according to this mode of thinking, enabling the cultures that spoke them to adopt new ideas, adapt to changing historical circumstances, and flourish in the modern world. Semitic languages, by contrast, were overly stilted, formulaic, and unable to develop a vocabulary for new technologies and ideas. As a result, the Semitic-speaking peoples (like Arabs and Jews) were doomed to fall into a state of cultural stagnation relative to Europeans.**Language was destiny.**

Renan made the analogy that the Semitic languages (and, in his essentialist thinking, the Semitic _race_) were to the Indo-European languages (and thus, the white race) as a pencil sketch was to a painting.

**The Semitic races may have had glory days in their “youth,” but they had never blossomed into maturity.** Their ability to advance and reach the level of cultural and technological sophistication achieved by Europeans would be forever constrained by their innate ethnic and linguistic limitations. The philologists of this era helped to give these sorts of crude racial and cultural generalizations the cloak of scientific rigor and academic respectability.

#### The Semites and Arrested Development

**These philological ideas are closely related to the Orientalist trope of the “Semites” being in a perpetual state of arrested development**. Their cultural achievements in ancient times could still be acknowledged with reverence and awe, their role as the originators of human civilization fully acknowledged—but they were seen as having fallen behind the times and having failed to develop the technology and political and economic institutions that were the keys to power in the modern world.

This frozen-in-amber quality was what made these peoples fit objects for study and analysis by Europeans. In Orientalist discourse, an Arab acted the way she acted solely _because_ she was an Arab. Thus, every observable feature of Middle Eastern society could be slotted into a preconceived and essentialized category regarding “the Muslim” or “the Arab.” Everything they did or thought was a result of being of the Orient.

**These racist, nationalist, and imperialist attitudes would have near-universal acceptance among both European elites and the general public well into the early 20th century.** The prominence of such ideas cuts against the image of a “liberal” or “enlightened” 20th-century Europe. Instead, colonialism was an ideology inherently rooted in violence, authoritarianism, and repression.

### Orientalist as Interpreter

The philologists’ passion for decoding and organizing the ancient languages of the East speaks to another key pillar of Orientalism. **Orientalists of this era saw it as their mission to order and make sense of the chaotic and unruly fragments of Oriental history, language, and culture.**

Out of the inchoate mass of ancient texts, symbols, artifacts, and architectural ruins, it was the task of the Orientalist to form a coherent and complete narrative—one fit for European understanding.

This role as sole interpreter put Orientalists in the power position, both over the Eastern peoples for whom they claimed to speak and the Western audiences they endeavored to enlighten. The mystery of the Orient could only be understood through their mediation.

#### Example: Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy and the Compilation of Knowledge

One key figure within Orientalism during the early 19th century was the French nobleman Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy (1758-1838).

De Sacy was one of the intellectual patriarchs of Orientalism, widely regarded within European academic circles for his work in translating Arabic as well as his success as a leading Persian scholar. His expertise as an Orientalist made him an important figure within the French imperial state. He served in key posts for the French Empire, advising on France’s interests in the Middle East. De Sacy was an important figure in straddling the gap between academia and public policy—a symbiotic relationship that would become a hallmark of Orientalism as the 19th century wore on.

De Sacy’s students went on to become some of Europe’s leading Orientalists, including figures like Jean-François Champollion (1790-1832), discoverer of Egypt’s famous Rosetta Stone. Through them, de Sacy’s approach to scholarship influenced the study of the Orient across Europe for the next generation and well into the 20th century.

A figure fully within the Orientalist tradition, de Sacy saw his role as an interpreter, compiler, editor, and commentator on the Orient. He, like most Orientalists, saw himself bringing to light and unearthing lost knowledge. He believed that experts like himself existed to transmit knowledge of the Orient to Europeans. As we’ve seen, this knowledge was a symbol and instrument of power. Knowledge gave European Orientalists the ability to define and proscribe the Orient in the collective mind of the West, and justify imperial incursions on the grounds that well-educated, enlightened Europeans were best positioned to save the culture and legacy of the Orient from the barbarism of the modern “Orientals.”

This was why his work focused on compiling vast stores of knowledge into multi-volume compendia for European consumption. Inherent to this compilation process was the scholar’s subjective judgments about which parts of the Orient were important and which weren’t, and what was and wasn’t worthy of inclusion. This Eurocentric approach to scholarship resulted in the erasure of those elements of Eastern culture and religion that the Orientalists deemed unworthy or unimportant.

### Orientalism in Travel Literature

**We shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking that Orientalism was just confined to the ivory tower of academia. It profoundly shaped how _all_ Europeans wrote about and experienced the Orient when they traveled there. **We can see this when we explore the work of European travel writers during the 19th century.

In addition to creators of explicitly scholarly work like Renan (whose influence we explored earlier in the summary), who journeyed to the East for explicitly academic and research-focused purposes, many European writers entered the Orient under less formal pretenses.

These travel writers—novelists, poets, playwrights, diarists—entered the Orient with a set of assumptions and expectations shaped by Orientalist scholarship. Although they wished to learn about the area and record their discoveries, they often traveled to the East to fulfill some deeply felt personal mission, be it emotional or spiritual in nature. **They shared a core assumption: that the Orient existed for the _European_ to experience and interpret.**

#### Example #1: Edward William Lane and the Narrative of Observation

One important European visitor to the Orient was the Englishman Edward William Lane (1801-1876). Lane wrote _Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians_ in 1836, based on his years of extensive travel and observation in Egypt.

The book is an exhaustive account of contemporary Egyptian social, cultural, and family life. But Lane’s narrative is also filled with lurid details about supposed Arab cruelty and barbarism, sexual lasciviousness, harems, and polygamy.

Lane frames his observations and reflections of Egypt as a series of one-way interactions between himself and the locals. For him, Egypt exists as a source of knowledge, study, and fascination that his European readers experience vicariously. The Egyptians themselves are passive in his narrative; they do not comment on Lane or influence him in any way. They are not there to observe; instead, they exist to _be_ observed and studied.

#### Example #2: Chateaubriand and the Pilgrimage of Self-Completion

The French writer and diplomat François-René, Vicomte de Chateaubriand (1768-1848), detailed his journey to the East in _Travels in Greece, Palestine, Egypt, and Barbary, During the Years 1806 and 1807._

Chateaubriand saw his travels as a pilgrimage. He was traveling to the Orient as a devout Catholic on his personal journey of self-completion and religious confirmation. He envisioned himself as following in the footsteps of the French Crusaders.

Just as the Crusaders of the Middle Ages had journeyed East to reclaim Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the barbarous Muslim infidels, Chateaubriand envisioned the Orient as his canvass, onto which he and his fellow Europeans could paint civilization and liberty—concepts that he believed the Arabs knew nothing about. He expressed this quite literally when he had his own name inscribed upon the pyramids.

For Chateaubriand, the mission of the European writer-traveler was to bring the Holy Land back to life from its dead, decrepit state.

#### Example #3: Flaubert and the Sensual Orient

**A recurring theme in Western travel writing about the East is dangerous sex.** In the minds of European writers and observers, the East is a world of sensuality, filled with lascivious women, harems, courtesans, and street prostitutes.

There, a European could escape the bonds of Christian sexual morality and indulge his carnal desires. Writers like the French realist novelist Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880) gave voice and expression to this Western image of the Orient.

In his account of his 1849 journey to Egypt (published as _Flaubert in Egypt: A Sensibility on Tour_), Flaubert described his experiences with an Egyptian courtesan and prostitute named Kuchuk Hanem. Flaubert’s recorded experiences with Kuchuk Hanem (and likely sexual liaisons with her) embody the Orientalist style and outlook.

**He never delves into what _her_ emotions and experiences might be. For Flaubert, she exists solely as an object of sex and desire, or else as a vehicle for his _own_ creativity. **With him, she is emotionally unattached, unreservedly sexual, undemanding, and submissive. In many ways, he sees these as the ideal female attributes, lamenting that the French prostitutes he knew in Paris lacked this unbridled femininity.

Flaubert projects these attributes onto Eastern women _as a whole_ , essentializing them as sensual objects.

#### Example #4: Richard Burton and Orientalist Power

**Even the leading literary figures of the time, men like Chateaubriand and Flaubert, could not stop themselves from automatically reducing the Orient to a series of essentialized archetypes.**

Extraordinarily gifted writers with unique voices found themselves, wittingly or not, creating quasi-propaganda (or at least moral justification) for European imperialism in their writing about the Orient during the 19th century. This shows the power and reach of Orientalist modes of thought.

Some Westerners, however, did enter the Orient with extraordinary knowledge, and genuinely sought to describe Oriental life from the perspective of people actually living there. One such figure was the Englishman Richard Burton (1821-1890). Burton had genuine sympathy for the Arab perspective, spoke Arabic fluently, and was deeply disdainful of the ivory tower Orientalists in Europe who claimed to be experts about a place to which they had never traveled. Burton prided himself on the fact that his knowledge of the Orient was, atypically, not derived from the intensive study of ancient texts. Instead, his knowledge came from actual observations of the Orient and personal relationships with the people who lived there.

Yet even Burton’s writing is clearly suffused with the idea that his position as a European in the Orient by definition puts him in a position of supremacy and power vis-à-vis the people he encounters there. He was deeply conscious of his identity as an Englishman in Egypt and of the privileges that brought, thanks to the growing power of the British Empire in Egyptian affairs. For him, it was a matter of destiny that Great Britain would become master of the Orient, and that an ambitious Briton like himself could fulfill his destiny on the blank canvas of the Orient.

**He could see the East in no other terms—it simply existed _for_ the West. As he put it, “Egypt is a treasure to be won.”**
