## Chapter 3.1: Orientalism and Power

So far, we’ve explored the main intellectual framework of Orientalism and how that framework influenced the ways in which Europeans experienced the East—and, crucially, how they interpreted the East and defined its essential “otherness” with regard to the West.

But Orientalism was more than just scholarship. Ideas influence actions, and Europe was highly active in the Orient throughout the 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between Orientalism as an intellectual discipline and the exercise of European imperial power in the Middle East. Specifically, we’ll examine:

  * How Orientalism both reflected and reinforced a fundamental power relationship between the West and the East
  * How imperialist nations like Great Britain and France marshaled the academic knowledge of the Orientalists in the service of empire during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
  * How Orientalist thinking framed empire-building not merely as an opportunity for Europe—but as necessary for preserving the legacy of Western civilization itself
  * How the notion of the “white man’s burden” followed from these attitudes, convincing Europeans that white people had a moral obligation to dominate the world and, in the context of the Middle East, rescue “Semitic” peoples from their state of cultural and intellectual arrested development



### The Power Imbalance

**Orientalism both reflected and reinforced a fundamental power relationship between Europe and the Orient.** Indeed, the very existence of a field like Orientalism, in which one could lay claim to be an expert in the history, languages, culture, social system, and religion of a vast and diverse region on the basis of having studied ancient texts and artifacts, demonstrated the inequality of the relationship between the Orient and the West.

All things about “the Orient” could be reduced and ultimately mastered as a field of study. Certainly, the reverse wasn’t true. There has never been an equivalent field of “Occidentalism,” in which a non-Westerner could become an expert on everything related to Europe and North America on the basis of having studied and mastered topics like classical Latin and the works of the ancient Roman poet Virgil.

**The Orientalist framework _assumes_ without question that the West is a complex entity, dynamic and constantly reinventing itself. It can never be essentialized or reduced. **A field like Orientalism can only exist if one implicitly accepts the idea that the Orient, however one defines it, is characterized by certain essential, unchanging characteristics, which make it possible to master and ultimately control.

#### Latent and Manifest Orientalism

We see this power imbalance on display when we look closer at the two main forms of Orientalism that took shape—Latent and Manifest Orientalism.

Latent Orientalism is the set of unconscious ideas about what defines the Orient that permeated Western writing on the subject. As we explored earlier in the summary, it is the idea of the Orient as static, unchanging, barbaric, superstitious, and in need of interpretation by Westerners.

You can think of Latent Orientalism as the constant background noise that can be heard in nearly all Western writing about topics such as Islam, the Middle East, and imperialism. Latent Orientalism succeeded in firmly establishing a fixed idea of what the “Orient” and so-called “Orientals” are (and what they are not) such that a certain set of images and tropes are brought to the minds of European and American readers immediately when these terms are used.

**Manifest Orientalism, on the other hand, refers to how Europeans and Americans _acted upon_ the Orient when they had direct contact with it. **If Latent Orientalism is mainly found within the world of academia and discourse, then Manifest Orientalism is found in the realms of public policy, commerce, and empire.

The two strands are related, however; Latent Orientalism formed the set of ideological assumptions about the Orient that informed the actions of Manifest Orientalist adventurers, imperial administrators, businesspeople, and missionaries who exerted their will upon the peoples of the East.

### The Necessity of Empire

**Manifest Orientalism revealed itself to be a potent force in world politics by the late 19th century.** By this time, the British and French governments had come to view the cultivation of experts in Oriental studies as necessary for the survival and expansion of their Middle Eastern empires. This was because, as we’ve seen, Western policymakers viewed the Orient as essential and unchanging. Thus, experts in ancient languages, monuments, and religions could provide valuable insight into the eternal “Oriental mind” that would be of great use in dominating the contemporary peoples of the Orient.

The mobilization of academic knowledge in service of imperialism became a hallmark of Orientalism during this period. Orientalist tropes about Western superiority and Eastern passivity played a major role in justifying and legitimating the imperialist project. As we’ve seen, Orientalist scholarship influenced the actions of key historical figures like Napoleon, who very much saw themselves as modern-day exemplars of an ancient tradition of Western dominance.

The political results of these Orientalism-inspired actions were profound, with Europe coming to fulfill its imagined role as the rightful ruler of the Eastern world. The military, economic, and social upheavals of World War One (1914-18) resulted in the collapse of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires—leaving the victorious French and British (and, to a lesser extent in this era, the Americans), as the only remaining imperial powers.

The destruction of the Ottoman Empire in particular left a great power vacuum in the Middle East, into which the French and British believed they could step without competition. Government leaders and commercial interests on both sides of the English Channel saw the Orient as a distinct political and cultural entity over which they had the right—and duty—to rule. Indeed, by the end of World War One, European powers had conquered a staggering 85 percent of the world’s landmass, including large swathes of the Orientalist heartland of the Middle East. **This was a great triumph of Orientalism. Orientalists were no longer just _analyzing_ history; now, they were actively _making_ it. **

Why did imperial powers like France and Britain feel the need to dominate the East? Certainly, economic and geopolitical opportunities played a significant role, particularly concerning access to the region’s valuable oil reserves. But the logic of imperialism ran deeper than the achievement of concrete, strategic objectives. Ancient Western attitudes and anxieties about the East made empire-building not just an opportunity, but a necessity.

The work of Western writers and commentators of this era like the French Sylvain Lévi (1863-1935) is suffused with a fear and apprehension regarding the Orient, its strangeness (to Europeans), and its potential for violent action if not held in check. Even the famed left-wing British writer George Orwell (1903-1950), anti-fascist and advocate for democratic socialism, wrote of the people of Marrakesh with horror and disgust—in fact, questioning whether people who lived in what he saw as abject material and intellectual poverty could even be considered _people_ at all.

**If they were not subjugated, the unwashed, teeming masses of the Orient could one day overwhelm the West**. Accordingly, to preserve and defend their own culture, Western powers had a positive _duty_ to extract what they could from the Orient, while keeping its people in a perpetual state of political disorganization.

#### Example #1: T.E. Lawrence and Knowledge in Service of Empire

We can see these attitudes in the writings of key Western actors in the Middle East during this time. One such figure was the British diplomat, spy, and intelligence officer T.E. Lawrence (1888-1935), better known to history as Lawrence of Arabia.

In many ways, Lawrence was a typical Orientalist of his time. Before embarking upon a military career, this son of a British nobleman studied history at Oxford. Later, he went on to study Arabic and work in the field of archeology in Syria on behalf of the British Museum.

Lawrence was recruited by the military in 1914 at the outbreak of war, as his background made him a valuable asset for British Army planners who were concerned about a potential Ottoman attack on British-controlled Egypt. They saw men like Lawrence as experts whose knowledge about the Orient could help them win the loyalty and support of the local Arab population. Lawrence secured an assignment in the Arabian peninsula during World War One, where he was tasked with fomenting and aiding the Arab Revolt against the enemy Ottoman Empire.

Of course, Lawrence’s placement in such a role is a clear example of how Orientalist thought shaped the course of world politics. Orientalism’s notion of an essential, unchanging Arab “mind” was what made it possible for an imperial power like Great Britain to treat a man whose background was in language and archeology as an “expert” in contemporary Arabian politics.

**For his part, Lawrence saw his role in Asia exclusively on his own terms. In typical Orientalist fashion, he conceived of himself as midwifing a _new_ Orient**, one imbued with “enlightened” European ideas like republicanism and capitalism.**** But, of course, this expression of Arab self-determination could only be brought about through European intrigue and encouragement. The Oriental mind was incapable of imagining and implementing such a project on its own.

Even when it wore the guise of freedom and liberation, Orientalism still fundamentally saw the Orient as an object to be manipulated and controlled by white Europeans.

#### Example #2: Rudyard Kipling and the White Man’s Burden

**Twentieth-century European imperialism was couched in explicitly racial terms.** One of the most famous promoters of the view that it was Europe’s destiny and duty to dominate Asia and Africa was the British journalist and author Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936).

In his 1899 poem, “The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands," Kipling celebrated the imperial project and exhorted white Europeans to fulfill their mission to civilize and subjugate the non-white peoples of Asia and Africa. He saw the imperial project as an act of “cleaning a land,” making it a civilized, prosperous (in other words, Western) society—including by removing and suppressing native cultures and peoples.

**The “white man’s burden” was adopted in broader European and American culture, with governments, private enterprises, and individuals accepting the notion that white people had a moral obligation to dominate the world.**

As bringers of capitalism, technology, and civilization, imperialist whites expected to be shown a high degree of deference and obedience by the Asian and African peoples they came to dominate. This was closely tied to Orientalism, with its long historical tradition of promoting the notion of a super and enlightened West’s right and responsibility to bring order to the chaotic and backward East.

As we’ve seen, categorical identities like “white men” and “Orientals” were only possible through Orientalism’s successful division of complex reality into simple generalities of race, language, and culture. It speaks to Orientalism’s defining characteristic—the scholarly division of the world into a civilized and dynamic West and a barbarous and unchanging East.
