## Chapter 2.1: The Roots of Orientalism

In the previous chapter, we defined Orientalism and outlined its core ideological assumptions about the East—and how those ideas influenced the exercise of power and control in the Orient by Europeans.

But the European idea of a strange, distant, and static Orient wasn’t simply invented by 18th- and 19th-century colonial powers to justify their imperial project. In fact, these concepts have long existed in Western literature and historical writing. In this chapter, we’ll explore these deep roots of Orientalist thought by looking at:

  * The origins of Western apprehension regarding the Orient in the writing and experiences of the ancient Greeks
  * How opposition to and contrast with “the East” helped to define what we now know as “Western civilization”
  * How Islam came to represent an existential threat in the mind of Christian Europe during the Middle Ages
  * How these ideas found their ultimate political expression in the age of European imperialism, which began its modern phase in 1798 with Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt



### The Ancient Greeks and the East

**Ancient Greek city-states like Athens and Sparta explicitly defined themselves by their contrasts with and opposition to the despotic “Asiatic” Persian Empire.** The Greek city-states may have been bitter rivals, but they were united in their shared identity of _not_ being of the “barbarian” Orient.

This tradition of Greek “othering” of the Orient goes all the way back to the very earliest works of Western literature. In _The Iliad_ , the foundational text of Western literature, Homer presents the antagonistic kingdom of Troy as a stand-in for the Orient—a decadent and dangerous foe to be vanquished by the daring and heroic Greeks.

Later, the ancient Greek tragedies of Aeschylus (c. 525-c. 455 BCE), Sophocles (c. 497-c. 406 BCE), and Euripides (c. 480-c. 406 BCE) presented the Orient in a similar way. In Aeschylus’s _The Persians_ , the Persian emperor Xerxes is presented as the ultimate figure of mourning, loss, and defeat, lamenting the crushing of his forces by the Greeks at the Battle of Salamis (480 BCE). This is the earliest known representation of the supine, submissive East kneeling before the dominant and superior West. For the intended Greek audience, the message is clear—Asian challenges to the Greeks will result only in Asia’s own ruin and lamentation.

In a tradition that would later be picked up by the European Orientalists, these works never present the perspective of the Orient on its own terms. Always, the words and feelings of the Orient are filtered —by Greek writers, for the benefit of Greek audiences. **The Orient does not, and cannot, speak for itself.**

Later Western encounters with the Orient—from the journeys of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-c. 425 BCE), to the conquests of Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), to the Crusades during the Middle Ages, to the journeys of Marco Polo (1254-1324 CE)—only reinforced these themes of strangeness and otherness.

**The very separateness of the Orient was a key element in forging the emerging “Western” or “European” identity.**

#### Islam and Orientalism

**The rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century and its stunning conquest of vast swathes of Asia, Africa, and Europe brought a new dimension to Western apprehensions regarding the Orient.**

For the Christian West, Islam became the great existential menace, threatening the frontiers of Europe while occupying the Christian sites of the Levant. For the next millennium, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War One, Islam would occupy a singular role in the European mind, standing as the only plausible threat to European Christian hegemony.

This was reflected in how Europeans wrote about the East. **In representing and describing the alien entity of Islam, Western writers imposed their _own_ archetypes on it. **Even the name they ascribed to Islam, “Mohammedism,” betrays this attitude. They saw Islam as a bastardization or perversion of the true religion of Christianity, with the prophet Mohammed as the fraudulent Muslim analogue to Christ. As Christ was to Christianity, so was Mohammed to Mohammedanism—a gross misunderstanding of Islam, which celebrates Mohammed as a prophet but does not worship him as God.

The Orientalists inherited this dismissal of Islam. Even with their great monotheistic religion, the “Oriental” mind was only capable of producing an inferior facsimile of the Western original.

### The Dawn of Orientalism

As we’ve seen, there was a long historical tradition of Western antipathy toward the Orient, with Western writers forming a distorted and reductive picture of what was in fact a highly diverse—and quite culturally advanced—region.

(Shortform note: During the Middle Ages, the cultural and scientific achievements of the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled vast stretches of the Middle East and Northern Africa from 750-1258, vastly outpaced those of Christian Europe. It was Muslim scholars, for example, in the great centers of learning at Baghdad and Damascus, who translated the classic works of ancient Greece and Rome into Arabic and Persian—preserving this great legacy of knowledge that would have otherwise been lost to the European Dark Ages.)

Although it drew on this history, **Orientalism truly began its meteoric ascent during the age of European imperialism, which began in earnest at the tail end of the 18th century and became a dominant feature of world politics in the 19th century.**

Advances in technology, administration, and war-making capabilities made the once-mysterious and inscrutable Orient visible and real to the European world in a way that it never had been before. A French consortium’s 1869 completion of Egypt’s Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, was a visible, physical manifestation of Europe’s emerging dominance. The canal stood as a marvel of modern engineering, and, for the West, a powerful demonstration of its superiority. It also held great symbolic significance as a physical link connecting West and East, at last subordinating the once-mysterious and inaccessible Orient—and decisively shifting the power balance in the West’s favor.

Likewise,**the early 19th century witnessed an explosion of interest in the study and acquisition of ancient Egyptian, Persian, and Assyrian texts** within learned European circles, comparable to the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman works that marked the Renaissance in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries.

Leading Orientalist figures like the German Julius von Moh (1800-1876), president of the Société Asiatique, produced lengthy encyclopedic compendia of all things Oriental, encompassing art, literature, religious texts, and architecture.

But for all of their admiration for the ancient civilizations of the Middle East and their unquestionably brilliant scholarship, this first generation of Orientalists could not help but perpetuate and codify the same ancient myths about the Orient that we’ve seen had existed in the European consciousness since antiquity.

**The purpose of Orientalist writing and scholarship was never to inform readers or challenge their preexisting “knowledge” of the Orient—it was to confirm and reinforce it.**

#### The Problem of Textualism

The Orientalists’ singular focus on _ancient_ texts made this all but inevitable—because of their commitment to the idea of an essential, unchanging Orient, they came to believe that rigorous study of the ancient Egyptian _Book of the Dead_ and the Pyramid Texts could provide a scholar with penetrating insight into the society, culture, and politics of modern Middle Eastern societies. As we’ll see later, this mode of thinking enabled a small guild of Orientalist philologists, archeologists, anthropologists, and historians to exert great influence over the public policy of the British and French Empires in the 19th and 20th centuries.

**Orientalism’s textual approach contributed to the dehumanizing tone and attitudes that pervaded much of Orientalist discourse** , treating human beings—indeed, even enormously complex human societies—as reducible to what texts had to say about them. For the Orientalist, the story of the East was fundamentally one of texts, not people.

The _modern_ Orient, meanwhile, held little value for the Orientalist scholar, because of their belief that the essential character of the people and their societies had remained the same since ancient times. As such, there was no need to engage with the actual people of the Orient or to even attempt to understand their daily lived experiences.

Thus, their methodology had real-world consequences, as**Orientalists sought to apply _ancient_ texts to address the problems of the _modern_ Orient, fully consistent with their belief in an unchanging East—and in their unique role as its interpreters.**

This textual approach tended to create a feedback loop in how Westerners described and ultimately acted upon the East:

  * Orientalists' experiences in the actual Orient were inevitably shaped by the books and ancient manuscripts they’d read about it.
  * This, in turn, influenced how they interacted with the Orient when they arrived there, interpreting their own experiences through their Orientalist lens.
  * Those text-influenced experiences, lastly, determined how the Orient would be written about for the _next_ generation of Western scholars and administrators.



Thus, Orientalism was not some musty, ivory-tower academic discipline. It shaped real-world interactions and remade the region and culture it purported to describe through the vehicle of European imperialism. European imperialists and travelers acted upon and wrote about the actual Orient through an explicitly Orientalist lens. In doing so, they defined and categorized their experiences into well-worn Orientalist tropes, forcing reality to bend to their preconceived ideas and even changing how the people of the Orient viewed themselves—in effect, Orientalizing the Orient.

### The Napoleonic Invasion of Egypt

**This power of Orientalism to shape and control the peoples of the East came on vivid display in 1798, with the French invasion of Egypt.**

This military expedition, led by Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), was a watershed moment in the history of East-West relations and in the development of Orientalism, both as an academic discipline and as imperialist ideology.

In many ways, the campaign was an Orientalist venture. Although the (ultimately unsuccessful) military expedition was partly driven by strategic imperatives, Napoleon was also heavily influenced by an Orientalist-inspired vision of the West’s historical relationship with the East—and of his own destiny as heir to that glorious tradition.

Napoleon envisaged himself as following in the footsteps of Alexander the Great, the Greek warrior-king who conquered much of the known world from Greece to India, creating one of the largest (albeit most short-lived) land empires in world history.

**Napoleon wanted to unlock Egypt for the West, not just militarily and economically, but also to mine the country for its ancient artifacts and texts.** Because he saw his role as both conqueror and as re-discoverer of the lost secrets of the ancient Egyptian civilization, Napoleon brought a team of hundreds of scholars along with his army.

Their mission was to document and codify as many of the texts and artifacts of Egypt as they could find. In true Orientalist fashion, Napoleon also hoped that their mastery of ancient Egypt would help him understand “the Oriental” and aid in his conquest and administration of modern Egypt. Orientalist textualism was a tool to crack the code of the mysterious Orient and Orientals—not to understand them as humans on equal terms with Europeans.

Sure enough, the campaign brought a wealth of Egyptian texts, artifacts, and knowledge back to Europe, resulting in a flowering of endowed university chairs in Oriental studies as well as the foundation of numerous learned societies like the Royal Asiatic Society and the aforementioned Société Asiatique.

As we’ve seen, knowledge is power. The wealth of knowledge that France extracted from Egypt excited a frenzy of interest in the ancient cultures, languages, and history of the Orient, further demonstrating to Europeans that their possession of this knowledge was precisely what made them fit to dominate the Orient.

#### The _Description de l’Egypte_

One of the most significant works to come out of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt was the _Description de l’Egypte,_ a 23-volume publication intended to serve as the definitive and comprehensive catalog of ancient Egypt.

It is one of the foundational texts of Orientalism, exerting a powerful influence over a generation of European writers. The _Description_ portrayed Egypt in Eurocentric terms, celebrating it for being the origin point of Western civilization. In the preface to the mammoth work, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) frames Egypt explicitly as the starting point of civilization, its pyramids and sphinxes already ancient by the time of the ancient Greeks. But he also notes that every great power has seen Egypt as a prize to be taken, and the French were following in that tradition. Egypt, descended as it was into barbaric despotism, was in need of a hero like Napoleon to bring true civilization back to the nation from which it had originally sprung.

**In this telling, Egypt and the Orient could not exist on their own terms. They were significant because of their relationship to the West.** Conquering it (as Napoleon attempted to do) was merely the fulfillment of the West’s historic destiny as master of the Orient, a tradition that stretched all the way back to the ancient Greeks.
