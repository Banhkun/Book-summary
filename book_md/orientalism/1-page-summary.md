## 1-Page Summary

**Orientalism is the framework through which Western writers, policymakers, and the general public have interpreted and defined the Islamic societies of the Middle East as “the Orient.”** The central premise of Orientalism is that the Orient is a fundamentally different, exotic, dangerous, unchanging, and “other” place. This concept of a foreign and strange East forms a set of cultural, political, religious, and linguistic contrasts which, in turn, has enabled the “West” to think of itself as a distinct—and superior—entity.

Orientalism served as a key ideological lynchpin of European colonialism; fundamentally, it is a discourse of dominance, superiority, and control**** that continues to have profound implications on today’s geopolitical landscape.

### The Structure and Core Ideas of Orientalism

We first need to define and flesh out Orientalism as a concept by exploring:

  * Its function as a creator of knowledge about the Middle East
  * How the Orientalist framework positioned the East as an entity that was incapable of acting upon its own agency or initiative—and therefore required European guidance and intervention
  * How Orientalism promoted the idea of the peoples and societies of the Middle East as being unchanged since ancient times, contributing to the concept of an essential “Oriental mind”



#### Knowledge as Power

Beginning in the early 18th century, Orientalism began to emerge and diversify as an academic discipline. Its experts and practitioners positioned themselves as the authoritative “interpreters” of the Orient, both for Western audiences and, as the Age of Imperialism dawned, for the people of the region themselves.

Rather than seeing the Orient as a complex and evolving society of people with their own political and economic agency, Orientalists viewed it as a fascinating object to be studied, described, represented, and, ultimately, mastered by Western powers.

**Thus, the knowledge produced and disseminated by the Orientalist tradition was a source of tremendous power for the West in its efforts to subjugate and subordinate the East.**

#### The Myth of the Oriental Mind

**A hallmark of Orientalist thought was the idea that the Orient was a monolithic mass whose people, culture, and society had remained unchanged since the days of the ancient civilizations.**

The idea that the Orient was static and unmoved by the forces of modernity directly fed the myth of the supposed “Oriental mind.”**** Because**** “Orientals” had remained stuck in a stage of intellectual, cultural, religious, and political development essentially unchanged since the days of the pharaohs, Orientalists felt confident in making sweeping pronouncements about how modern-day peoples of the region thought and acted. There was no need to speak to contemporary people living in Egypt, Iran, or Arabia, because all one ever needed to know about them could be found in the treasure of ancient artifacts and manuscripts that Orientalist anthropologists, historians, and philologists eagerly devoured.

Thus, there was an eternal and fixed “Oriental mind.” And, in the Orientalist interpretation, this “Oriental mind” was incapable of the kind of objectivity and rationality that would enable the people of the region to develop enlightened European institutions like science, representative democracy, capitalism, and the rule of law. Instead, it was and would forever be rooted in the subjective and transactional mental structures of the ancient world. Therefore, as a people, “Orientals” were vengeful, emotional, dishonest, and violently obsessed with shame and honor.

#### The Passive Orient

**In Orientalist writings, the Orient is forever in the passive position. It can never _act_ of its own accord; it can only be acted _upon_. **This could be seen in its (perceived) failure to keep up with European political, economic, and technological advances. Even when Orientalists _did_ encounter unmistakable evidence of political agency and will among people of the region (as with, for example, the Egyptian nationalist movement, which gained momentum in the late 19th century) they could comfortably write it off as an anomaly.

#### The Problem of Textualism

**In its methodology, Orientalism was highly textual, relying heavily upon ancient writings and inscriptions as the source of all knowledge about the Orient.** This approach contributed to the dehumanizing tone and attitudes that pervaded so much of Orientalist discourse, treating human beings—indeed, even enormously complex human societies—as reducible to what texts had to say about them. For the Orientalist, the story of the East was fundamentally one of texts—not people.

This methodology had real-world consequences, **as Orientalists sought to apply _ancient_ texts to address the problems of the _modern_ Orient, fully consistent with their belief in an unchanging East—and in their unique role as its interpreters.**

### The Roots of Orientalism

This European idea of a strange, distant, and static Orient had existed in Western literature and historical writing long before the development of Orientalism as a formal academic discipline. We'll explore these deep roots of Orientalist thought by looking at:

  * The writing and experiences of the ancient Greeks
  * How Islam came to represent an existential threat in the mind of Christian Europe during the Middle Ages
  * How these ideas found their modern political expression in the age of European imperialism, which began its modern phase in 1798 with Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt



#### The Ancient Greeks and the East

**Ancient Greek city-states like Athens and Sparta explicitly defined themselves by their contrasts with and opposition to the despotic “Asiatic” Persian Empire.**

This tradition of “othering” the Orient goes all the way back to the very earliest works of Western literature. In _The Iliad_ , the foundational text of Western literature, Homer presents the antagonistic and ultimately doomed kingdom of Troy as a stand-in for the Orient—a decadent and dangerous foe to be vanquished by the daring and heroic Greeks. For the intended Greek audience, the message is clear—Asian challenges to the West will result only in Asia’s own ruin and lamentation.

#### Islam and Orientalism

**The rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century brought a new dimension to Western apprehensions regarding the Orient.**

For the Christian West, Islam became the great existential menace, threatening the frontiers of Europe while occupying the Christian sites of the Levant. For the next millennium, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War One, Islam would occupy a singular role in the European mind, standing as the only plausible threat to European Christian hegemony.

Europeans saw Islam as a bastardization or perversion of the true religion of Christianity, with the prophet Mohammed as the fraudulent Muslim analogue to Christ. The Orientalists later picked up on this theme. Even with their great monotheistic religion, the “Oriental” mind was only capable of producing an inferior facsimile of the Western original.

#### The Napoleonic Invasion of Egypt

**This power of Orientalism to shape and control the Western image of the East—and the influence of that vision on Western actions toward the East—came on vivid display in 1798, with the French invasion of Egypt.**

Although the (ultimately unsuccessful) military expedition was partly driven by France’s strategic imperatives in the region, Napoleon was also heavily influenced by an Orientalist-inspired vision of the West’s historical relationship with the East. He wanted to unlock Egypt for the West, not just militarily and economically, but also to mine the country for its ancient artifacts and texts.**** Accordingly, he brought a team of hundreds of scholars and surveyors along with his army.

One of the most significant works to come out of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt was the _Description de l’Egypte,_ a 23-volume publication the purpose of which was to serve as the definitive and comprehensive catalog of ancient Egypt. It is one of the foundational texts of Orientalism, exerting a powerful influence over a generation of European writers.

The _Description_ portrayed Egypt in Eurocentric terms, celebrating it for being the origin point of Western civilization. **In this telling, Egypt and the Orient could not exist on their own terms. They were significant because of their relationship to the West.**

### Interpretations of the Orient

These historical experiences deeply influenced how Orientalists wrote about, acted upon, and interpreted the Orient during the 19th century Age of Imperialism. To delve deeper into this dynamic, it is important to understand:

  * How Orientalism positioned itself as the sole gatekeeper to Western knowledge about the Orient
  * How Orientalists came to see their role as the interpreters of Eastern culture for both Western audiences and for the people of the East themselves



#### Orientalist Gatekeepers of Knowledge

**Orientalism was and remains a powerful framework, one that shaped (and constrained) the ways in which Western scholars and observers wrote about and experienced the Orient.**

This is because Orientalism functioned as a method of interpretation—the only means by which the mysteries of the East could be understood by the Western reader. Thus, anyone engaged in any work even remotely connected to the area we now know as the Middle East could not help but be influenced by Orientalism’s major works.

#### The Triumph of Philology

**One way that Orientalism positioned itself as the guardian of knowledge about the East was through its dominance of highly esoteric fields like philology.** Philology is the study of language, primarily using written, ancient textual sources. By studying ancient literary texts and historical documents, philologists hope to gain greater understanding of the historical development of languages over time.

**For the philologists, language was _the_ key to understanding Eastern culture, history, and the “Oriental mind.”** By studying the origin and evolution of ancient languages, philologists believed that they could glean great insights into the temperament and essential “racial” characteristics of contemporary Asians.

For instance, Orientalist philologists like the Frenchman Ernest Renan (1823-1892) saw the supposedly ossified and static Semitic languages (like Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic) as responsible for the languid and desultory development of the Orient.

The philologists’ passion for decoding and organizing the ancient languages of the East speaks to another pillar of Orientalism. **Orientalists of this era saw it as their mission to order and make sense of the chaotic and unruly fragments of Oriental history, language, and culture.** They believed that the mysteries of the Orient could only be understood through their mediation. They saw themselves bringing to light and unearthing lost knowledge (and thus, the power to define and proscribe the Orient in the mind of the West).

### Orientalism and Power

**Orientalism was more than just scholarship. Ideas influence actions, and Europe was highly active in the Orient throughout the 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century.** In this section we’ll examine:

  * How Orientalism both reflected and reinforced a fundamental power relationship between the West and the East
  * How imperialist nations like Great Britain and France marshaled the academic knowledge of the Orientalists in the service of empire during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
  * How the notion of the “white man’s burden” followed from these attitudes



#### The Power Imbalance

**Orientalism both reflected and reinforced a fundamental power relationship between Europe and the Orient.** Indeed, the very existence of a field like Orientalism, in which one could claim to be an expert in the history, languages, culture, social system, and religion of a vast and diverse region on the basis of having studied ancient texts and artifacts, demonstrated the inequality of the relationship between the Orient and the West. All things about “the Orient” could be reduced and ultimately mastered as a field of study.

#### The Necessity of Empire

**Orientalism revealed itself to be a potent force in world politics by the late 19th century.** By this time, the British and French governments had come to view the cultivation of experts in Oriental studies as necessary for the survival and expansion of their Middle Eastern empires. This was because, as we’ve seen, Western policymakers viewed the Orient as essential and unchanging. Thus, experts in ancient languages, monuments, and religions could provide valuable insight into the eternal “Oriental mind” that would be of great use in dominating the contemporary peoples of the Orient.

The mobilization of academic knowledge in service of imperialism became a hallmark of Orientalism during this period. Orientalist tropes about Western superiority and Eastern passivity played a major role in justifying and legitimating the imperialist project. Orientalist scholarship was not merely confined to the ivory tower of academia. As we’ve seen, it influenced the actions of key historical figures like Napoleon, who very much saw themselves as modern-day exemplars of an ancient tradition of Western dominance.

The political results of these Orientalism-inspired actions were profound, with Europe coming to fulfill its imagined role as the rightful ruler of the Eastern world. Indeed, by the end of World War One (1914-1918), European powers had conquered a staggering 85 percent of the world’s landmass, including large swathes of the Orientalist heartland of the Middle East.

**This was a great triumph of Orientalism. Orientalists were no longer just _analyzing_ history; now, they were actively _making_ it. **

#### The White Man’s Burden

The work of Western writers and commentators of this era, like the French Sylvain Lévi (1863-1935), is suffused with a fear and apprehension regarding the Orient, its strangeness (to Europeans), and its potential for violent action if not held in check.

**If they were not subjugated, the unwashed, teeming masses of the Orient could one day overwhelm the West**. Accordingly, to preserve and defend their own culture, Western powers had a positive _duty_ to extract what they could from the Orient, while keeping its people in a perpetual state of political disorganization.

One of the most famous promoters of the view that it was Europe’s destiny and duty to dominate Asia and Africa was the British journalist and author Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936). In his 1899 poem, “The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands," Kipling celebrated the imperial project and exhorted white Europeans to fulfill their mission to civilize and subjugate the non-white peoples of Asia and Africa.

**The “white man’s burden” was adopted in broader European and American culture, with governments, private enterprises, and individuals accepting the notion that white people had a moral obligation to dominate the world.**

As bringers of capitalism, technology, and civilization, imperialist whites expected to be shown a high degree of deference and obedience by the Asian and African peoples they came to dominate. Of course, categorical identities like “white men” and “Orientals” were only possible through Orientalism’s successful division of complex reality into simple generalities of race, language, and culture.

### Orientalism in the Modern Age

**Orientalism had to react to historical developments in the 20th and 21st centuries, when the peoples and nations of the Orient began resisting European imperialism** , forging their own political identity, and competing with the West on more equal terms. To understand these developments, it’s crucial to examine:

  * How Orientalist scholars opposed political developments like Arab nationalism
  * How the United States emerged as the preeminent Western power after World War Two and made its own contributions to Orientalism
  * How Western popular images of the Orient in the 20th century built upon centuries-old Orientalist tropes



#### Maintaining the East-West Divide

**The Orientalists strove to maintain the barrier between East and West in the postwar years**. For scholars like H.A.R. Gibb (1895-1971), keeping this wall of separation intact was paramount. The West had defined itself since ancient times in opposition to the East. If these lines were to become blurred, the West might find itself without an identity of its own.

**The growth of national independence movements and organizations like the League of Nationalist Action in Lebanon and the Arab Independence Party in Mandatory Palestine (which was administered by the British) threatened to knock down the barriers between East and West and possibly even put the East on equal footing with the West.** These developments raised the alarming prospect of the Arab world throwing off the shackles of Western political and economic domination and asserting its _own_ right to self-determination. This represented a grave affront to the West’s self-conception, as it envisaged itself as the natural ruler and guardian of the Orient. If the Orient could successfully push back against the West, what else might they be able to do?

Thus, despite the changes taking place within other academic disciplines during this era, Orientalism remained insular and backward-looking in its outlook and core assumptions. It continued to root the region’s complex contemporary conflicts and political problems in ancient, Biblical sources—such as explaining the emerging Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the lens of the Old Testament story of Isaac and Ishmael. 20th-century Orientalists saw these conflicts as manifestations of an “eternal” struggle between East and West.

Thus, as late as 1963, a figure like Gibb could _still_ be found asserting that the politics of the Arab world could not possibly be motivated by modern political ideologies like communism, nationalism, or anti-colonialism. Those were products of the Western tradition; the “Oriental” was forever constrained by his status as an “Oriental.” Any deviation from this preordained role was a betrayal or perversion of his essential character.

Figures like Gibb saw these complex movements toward self-determination as unorganized outbursts of enthusiasm. The Arabs may have been capable of political agitation, but it would typically be short-lived and, ultimately, self-destructive. The Arab temperament was incapable of conceiving, let alone acting upon, a collective political program for the benefit of their nation or society as a whole. Their innate parochialism and loyalty to tribe or clan would inevitably trump the formation of larger political identities or coherent ideologies. These were Western political achievements of which “the Arab” was incapable.

#### The United States: New Colonial Power

**In the postwar world, the United States would emerge as the preeminent Western power,** particularly as the Cold War (1945-1991) began to take shape. This was the beginning of America’s active role in Middle Eastern politics, which it maintains to this day.

The United States also took a leading role in driving Orientalism, which would be inextricably linked to Cold War geopolitics. Think tanks and university cultural relations programs in Islamic or Middle Eastern studies were routinely funded by the United States Department of Defense, the Ford Foundation, and the RAND Corporation, as well as major banks, oil companies, and other pillars of the US national security and business establishment. Under American influence, **the Orient remained an object to be shaped, manipulated, dominated, and _defined_ by Western interests.**

#### Neo-Orientalism

**In the latter decades of the 20th century, Orientalism was recast as “area studies,” but the same assumptions and power dynamics remained.**

Well into the 1960s and 1970s, area studies specialists were publishing papers analyzing the failure of the “Semitic” people to produce great cultural achievements on par with those of the West. This was little more than neo-Orientalism, with crude and reductive analyses of Arabs and Muslims still finding a welcome audience in prestigious academic journals.

#### The “Clash of Civilizations”

**Another manifestation of modern, post-World War Two Orientalism is the “clash of civilizations” theory,** supported by scholars like the American political scientist Samuel Huntington (1927-2008). This theory posits that there is a fundamental and unbridgeable division between the progressive, liberal, secular West and the traditionalist, reactionary, and orthodox Islamic world. Huntington argued in 1993 that these two religious and cultural traditions formed distinct blocs organized around irreconcilable values and worldviews.

The “clash of civilizations” theory held that cultural conflict between the West and Islam would form the main theatre of geopolitical conflict in the years following the Cold War. This view gained many adherents in the West, as it seemed especially prescient following the attacks of September 11 and the subsequent US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

**But the notion of the “clash of civilizations” is rooted in old, false Orientalist assumptions.** Cultures, in fact, influence and shape one another and do not have neat distinctions like “the Muslim world” or “Western civilization.” These are ideological constructions and invented identities.

#### Arabs in Pop Culture

**We also see the lingering effects of Orientalism in the way Arabs are portrayed in Western popular culture.**

Arab and/or Muslim film characters have frequently been shown wearing stereotypical robes and headgear. In political cartoons in American and European newspapers, Arabs have been represented using racist caricatures featuring hooked noses, mustaches, and leering expressions. Disturbingly, these portrayals echo the depictions of Jews in the antisemitic propaganda of the Third Reich—perhaps unsurprising, given the Orientalist tradition of lumping Jews and Arabs together as “Semites.”

### Conclusion

Our discussion of the ideological pitfalls—and real-world consequences—of Orientalism shows that **the role of the scholar should be to _question_ and _scrutinize_ politically motivated myths like the notion of a separate, eternal, and unchanging Orient—not to manufacture and perpetuate them.**

Likewise, we must always remember that knowledge is not inherently neutral or objective:**** As our study of Orientalism teaches, knowledge can always be manipulated to serve the interests of the powerful against the powerless.
