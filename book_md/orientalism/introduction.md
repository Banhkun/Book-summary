## Introduction

Edward Said’s _Orientalism_ is a study of the scholarly, intellectual, political, and ideological phenomenon known as Orientalism. **Orientalism is the framework through which Western writers, policymakers, and the general public have interpreted and defined “the Orient”**(which, in this summary, will primarily refer to the Islamic societies of the Middle East, though these terms also encompass East Asia in some writings).

Said’s key insight is that Orientalism does _not_ reflect objective truth. Instead, it is an invention of the Western mind**. The central premise of Orientalism is that the Orient is a fundamentally different, exotic, dangerous, unchanging, and “other” place.** This concept of a foreign and strange East forms a set of cultural, political, religious, and linguistic contrasts which, in turn, has enabled the “West” to think of itself as a distinct—and superior—entity.

Said (1935-2003) had the intellectual framework of Orientalism impressed upon him from birth. As an Arab Palestinian educated in Palestine and Egypt (both of which were British colonies at the time), who then went on to an academic career in literature and postcolonial studies in the United States, Said always felt himself to be straddling the Eastern and Western parts of his identity. Despite his success, Said always had a keen awareness of his identity as an “Oriental.” _Orientalism_ is his exploration of the origins, development, and implications of this manufactured “otherness” that he experienced so deeply.

“The West” (by which we refer primarily to Europe and North America) in turn forged its historical identity against the foil of the East or Orient. This identity was typically expressed as one of superiority and dominance over the Orient, which Western writers, travelers, and, later, imperialists reduced to a series of crude and reductive stereotypes and generalizations. The West was Christian where the Orient was Islamic; its people were Nordic where those of the Orient were Semitic; it was liberal, democratic, and rational where the Orient was backward, despotic, and emotional.

**Even** **generalized terms like “West,” “East,” “Orient,” and “Occident” are products of Orientalism, artificially separating complex cultures into monolithic, separate, and opposed moral spheres.**(“Occident” is the Latin-derived term for the Western world, the counterpart to the Eastern “Orient.”) These terms reduce the complexity of diverse human societies, languages, cultures, and histories into near-meaningless generalities that ultimately serve to obscure the humanity of the people to whom they refer.

In the end, **Orientalism represents the interpretation and creation of the Orient— _by_ Westerners, _for_ Westerners**. The people of the Orient themselves have had little agency in the creation of Western narratives about them.

Although this picture of the Orient in the Western mind can be found as far back as the Middle Ages, we will primarily concern ourselves with the growth and development of Orientalism beginning in the 18th century. It is no coincidence that this era coincided with the beginning of the age of European imperialism, in which European nations (chiefly Great Britain and France) conquered, subjugated, and exploited the peoples of the Middle East.

**Orientalism served as a key ideological lynchpin of European colonialism; fundamentally, it is a discourse of dominance, superiority, and control over the people of the Orient.** As the centuries wore on, Orientalism became a self-sustaining intellectual force, profoundly impressing itself upon the Western mind and influencing European (and, later, American) art, literature, poetry, economics, science, philosophy, political science, and public policy.

Although _Orientalism_ was originally published in 1978, its lessons are still highly relevant for today’s audience. Recent events such as:

  * The attacks of September 11, 2001
  * The 2001 and 2003 US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively
  * The 2011 Arab Spring
  * The ongoing Syrian Civil War and its resultant global refugee crisis 



All demonstrate the intertwined and often-fraught relationship between Orient and Occident.

**How the West views the East continues to have profound implications on today’s geopolitical landscape.** The continued involvement of the West in the affairs of the Middle East through political interference, economic sanctions, and even military force shows that the legacy of Orientalism and the imperialism it sustained is still very much alive and with us today.

In this summary, we will attempt to break through the simplistic narrative of an eternal and inevitable “clash of civilizations” between East and West by:

  * Defining Orientalism as a concept and identifying its major themes
  * Charting the history and development of Orientalism
  * Analyzing the writings of some of the major figures in the history of Orientalism
  * Exploring the relationship between Orientalism and the exercise of Western imperial power
  * Examining potential alternative frameworks for understanding the people and culture of the Middle East



(Shortform note: In referring to the region primarily covered in this summary, we have chosen to use the more familiar (although admittedly Eurocentric) “Middle East” over the more neutral “Western Asia.” When we are discussing Orientalism and how Orientalists viewed the region, we have used the term “Orient,” for purposes of clarity and to make their outdated terminology and intellectual framework more clear. With some occasional exceptions when referring to how Orientalists viewed the people of the region, however, we have avoided using the adjectival “Oriental” to refer to the peoples of the Middle East, as this term is widely regarded today as pejorative and offensive. Where we have used the term, we have placed it in quotes to signify its racist character.

We have also reorganized some of Said’s ideas for purposes of clarity.)
