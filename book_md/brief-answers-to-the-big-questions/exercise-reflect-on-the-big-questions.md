## Exercise: Reflect on the Big Questions

In this guide, we’ve discussed Hawking’s perspective on a number of “big questions,” such as the existence of God and the future of humankind. Now we’ll give you a chance to consider them for yourself.

* * *

Hawking asserts that science has made the concept of “God” unnecessary by offering better answers to the question of human origins than religion ever did. However, as we also noted, some people contend that religion still offers a more complete answer to the question of human origins. What do you think? What role, if any, do you think a supernatural creator played in the origin of life, humanity, or the universe? Why?

Hawking expects that artificial intelligence algorithms will eventually become better at writing AI algorithms than human programmers are, and that once that happens, AI will grow exponentially beyond human control. In this context, he warns that we, as a society, need to make sure AI works for our good and not our harm, but he doesn’t go into detail about how we should do that. What do you think is the best way to make sure AI doesn’t harm us in the future? (For example, should we make certain types of AI illegal? If so, what should be illegal, and how would the prohibition be enforced?)

Hawking calls for colonization of outer space. Suppose that world leaders heed his call, and a sudden breakthrough in propulsion technology makes it possible to send colonists to neighboring solar systems. Given the opportunity, would you consider immigrating to a different planet? Why or why not?

Now imagine that an all-knowing AI has taken over the earth, and is ramping up the space colonization program. Moreover, the AI has just informed you that it has decided to relocate you to a distant planet. You have to report to the spaceport within 30 days, and there is no possibility of returning to Earth after you leave. How would you spend your last 30 days on Earth?
