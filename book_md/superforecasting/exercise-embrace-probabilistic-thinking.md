## Exercise: Embrace Probabilistic Thinking

Most of us don’t naturally think like superforecasters. This exercise is a chance to examine your own thinking style and practice embracing uncertainty.

* * *

Life is full of uncertainties. Think of a recent time when you made a decision and were unsure what the outcome would be. What was the decision, and what were the two most likely possible results?

How did you go about making that decision in the face of uncertainty? (For example, you may have made a list of pros and cons, weighed the consequences of being wrong against the benefits of being right, or even just taken a shot in the dark.)

Now, imagine taking a probabilistic approach to that same scenario. For each of the possible outcomes you listed, try assigning a probability percentage. Don’t worry too much about the math—think of this just as using a number to describe how confident you are that something will happen.

Would assigning numerical probabilities to each outcome like this have changed the way you made your final decision? Why or why not?
