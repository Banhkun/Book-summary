## Exercise: Identify Psychological Safety

When everyone feels safe enough to speak their mind, the whole group benefits. Learn how you can apply this to your own life.

* * *

Think of a group that you work with frequently (this could be a work team, a social group, or even your family). How does this group usually handle disagreements?

If you disagreed with someone in the group, would you feel comfortable telling them? How do you think they would react?

Would you describe this group as psychologically safe in general? How can you tell?

Suppose you wanted to make this group feel even more psychologically safe. How would you start? What specific actions could you take?
