## 1-Page Summary

_Necessary Endings _by Henry Cloud is about learning to break free from the relationships and situations that are holding you back. Cloud asserts that many people suffer needlessly in both business and their personal lives because of their inability to exit these types of situations. He argues that **by learning to end things, you’ll empower yourself to succeed**.

Cloud is a clinical psychologist and best-selling author who has written multiple books designed to empower readers to take control of their lives. Published in 2010, _Necessary Endings_ aims to help audiences who are struggling to break free from unproductive patterns in both their professional and personal lives.

Our guide will begin by examining the necessary role of endings in our lives, while also considering why we tend to avoid endings. Then we’ll offer strategies for getting mentally and emotionally prepared to enact endings in your life and show you how to identify the situations and relationships that need to end. Finally, we’ll discuss Cloud’s tools to make those endings happen. Along the way, we’ll include perspectives from other business-focused psychologists and authors to supplement and contextualize Cloud’s advice.

### Learn to Accept Endings

According to Cloud, endings are an inevitable and often beneficial part of life—a crucial part of growth and change. For new, healthy patterns to begin, old, unproductive patterns must end. However, Cloud notes that people often avoid breaking things off because it can be difficult and uncomfortable. In some cases, you might avoid ending a relationship because you’re afraid to hurt the other person, or you may be uncertain about your decision. In other cases, you may not have the needed skills to make the ending happen.

(Shortform note: Psychologists note that many people avoid endings because they fear the uncertainty that comes with change. Research has shown that in general, people fear unpredictable outcomes even more than they fear known negative outcomes. In addition to the factors Cloud lists, the natural tendency to fear uncertainty can also contribute to hesitancy around endings.)

Regardless of the reason for your discomfort, the first step in ending something is getting comfortable with endings in general. To get comfortable with endings, Cloud recommends **recognizing that endings are natural, remaining open to unexpected outcomes, and learning to diagnose unrealistic ambitions**.

(Shortform note: As a supplement to Cloud’s methods for getting comfortable with endings, experts suggest you make a list of all the benefits of ending a situation. This can help motivate you to make these difficult but necessary changes. For example, ending a relationship might mean you’ll get to spend more time with family and friends.)

#### Endings Are a Natural Part of Life

According to Cloud, endings are a natural part of life. He notes that in nature, cycles that include both endings and new beginnings are the norm—**often, the end of a particular season or stage of life is what makes the new beginning possible**. He suggests that keeping in mind the role of endings in nature may make it easier for you to accept their role in your life.

For example, consider wildfires. Most often triggered by lightning, wildfires are a natural ending. They’re capable of bringing an end to much of the plant and animal life of large areas. At first glance, wildfires might seem to be wholly destructive. However, areas razed by these fires tend to be especially fertile and hospitable for rare species of plants and animals. In fact, there are some seeds that only germinate in the wake of wildfires—new life that wouldn’t have been possible without an ending coming first.

(Shortform note: While endings are a natural, beneficial part of life, modern society tends to be ending-averse, especially when endings involve death. However, in _Happy_ , Derren Brown argues that it can be liberating to view death in a more positive light. Brown believes that accepting death can help you live a regret-free life—he asserts that maintaining awareness of your mortality can help motivate you to make the most of the present.)

#### Remain Open to Unexpected Outcomes

As you get comfortable with the role of endings in nature, **stay open to unexpected outcomes**. According to Cloud, when we enter a business venture or relationship, we often have a single goal in mind—the success of our original vision for a product, or marriage and 2.4 kids with a new partner. When you focus too intently on a desired outcome, it can make it harder for you to adapt to any other outcome. Instead, Cloud suggests altering your expectations—continue hoping for success, but remain alert to the possibility that new products and relationships may go in unexpected directions.

For instance, suppose you’re the entrepreneur behind a new subscription service. Your service combines two elements: You ship accessories like jewelry and cufflinks, and fancy snacks to go along with them, including caviar and imported cheeses. You receive constant feedback from prospective customers, who complain that a jewelry subscription is too expensive, and that they’d prefer an option to subscribe to just the snack box. If you’re too set on your original vision, you might not be able to make the change. However, if you remain open to other outcomes, you’ll be able to pivot, end your jewelry sales, and make a windfall selling standalone fancy snack subscriptions.

(Shortform note: Experts note that social media can lead us to set unrealistically positive expectations for our experiences. According to these experts, people tend to post about exceptionally positive experiences, but not neutral or negative ones. This tendency can warp your perception, leading you to expect similarly positive results from your own experiences. To avoid falling into this trap, experts recommend that you avoid planning every element of your life, and leave room for spontaneity—unplanned experiences that go well will feel more uplifting, as you won’t have any preconceived notions of what to expect.)

#### Unrealistic Goals Prevent You From Accepting Endings

Along with staying open to unexpected outcomes, consider the role that unrealistic goals play in your thoughts about endings. Unrealistic goals are dreams for a particular project or relationship that are unlikely to occur based on the evidence. Cloud argues that **by setting your sights on unrealistic goals, you blind yourself to the reality of a situation** , making it impossible to determine when it’s time for an ending.

To diagnose unrealistic goals, look at the situation from an objective perspective. If you were a stranger to your business or relationship, would you be able to find reasons to believe in its success? If not, you may have set goals that don’t reflect the reality of the situation.

(Shortform note: In addition to keeping you from accepting endings, unrealistic goals can lead you to devote too much energy to an impossible task. In the long term, this can lead you to burn out or get bored and lose focus. To identify unrealistic goals, experts recommend asking yourself if you have a plan for achieving the goal that includes a set of steps you’ll realistically be able to take. If your goal lacks actionable steps, it likely isn’t realistic. To avoid setting unrealistic goals in the future, make sure that any new goals include both a clearly defined result and a plan of action that will get you there.)

### Determine Where Endings Are Needed

Once you’ve gotten comfortable with endings, it’s time to determine where to implement endings in your life. Cloud offers suggestions for assessing both the difficult situations and relationships in your life.

#### Assess Difficult Situations

When assessing difficult situations in your life, **look out for three types of negative situations: situations that are good but not great, mediocre situations that are unlikely to improve, and lost causes**.

##### End Situations That Are Good but Not Great

Cloud recommends you end situations that are good, but not great. While it may seem counterintuitive to bring an end to a good situation, Cloud argues that you should **only make room in your life for the situations that serve you best**. When you stay in a situation that’s good but not great, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to do something that’s even better for you.

For example, suppose you’ve spent two years working at a job that you like fairly well. While it’s not in your field of interest, it’s stable, easy, and pays the bills. In other words, the job is good but not great. A great job, for you, would relate more closely to your field, pay better, and challenge you more. While that great job might be out there somewhere, you’ll never find it if you’re content to stay at your current OK job.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown refers to good-but-not-great situations as being “trivial.” McKeown argues that by cutting out these trivial situations, you free yourself up to focus on the things that truly matter to you. To cut out trivial things, McKeown asserts that you need to learn to say “no” to others. By developing strategies for saying no, such as offering delayed or gentle rejections, you’ll become more adept at ending trivial situations, giving you more time to focus on more important matters.)

##### End Mediocre Situations That Are Unlikely to Improve

Also aim to end situations that are mediocre and unlikely to improve. Cloud argues that it's easy to stay in mediocre situations, telling yourself that they might someday turn around. To avoid this, **objectively assess whether the situation is likely to improve**. Consider past patterns, as they’re likely to predict future outcomes. As you look to the past to chart the future, take note of any recent changes that may change the outcome of the situation.

Suppose that your company sells a product that has been struggling for months. Sales of the product earn barely enough to cover costs, and you begin to consider ending production. Based on the product’s past performance, you predict that sales are unlikely to improve. As you make these predictions, you make sure to account for new factors that could change sales, such as rising or falling unemployment. However, in the end, you decide that these factors are unlikely to be very influential, and you pull the plug on the product.

(Shortform note: Psychologists note that when dealing with human beings, past patterns only predict future behaviors in certain situations. In particular, past behavior can be predictive only in _identical_ situations that occur within a short period, without the person receiving feedback first. Outside of these criteria, past behavior isn’t a strong predictor of future behavior, as people are prone to change over time.)

##### End Lost Causes

Finally, end situations that are lost causes. According to Cloud, some situations are obviously beyond saving. The best thing you can do in those situations is to **end them immediately, to free up resources that would be better utilized elsewhere**.

For example, imagine you work at a tech company that still devotes a significant chunk of its resources to manufacturing VCRs, despite the fact that they haven’t sold well in over a decade. Your best course of action would be to end VCR production immediately, and use the budget to improve and market your other products.

Cloud notes that to identify the three types of unproductive situations, you must have clear goals in mind. If you don’t set goals and standards for your endeavors, you’ll be unable to measure whether a situation is good, great, mediocre, or a lost cause.

Suppose you open a restaurant that barely manages to break even in its first six months. Depending on your goals, you might view this outcome as either a success or failure. If your goal was for the restaurant to stay open and avoid losing money as so many new restaurants do, you’d consider the situation a great success. However, if your goal was to consistently pay your mortgage with the restaurant’s earnings, the situation is a failure.

Lastly, when assessing any situation, consider whether it depletes resources faster than it brings them in. Situations that require a large investment to produce a minimal return should be ended, as they are unlikely to be productive in the long run.

> **Lost Causes and Sunk Costs**
> 
> The human tendency to continue investing resources into a lost cause is known as the sunk cost fallacy. In _The Voltage Effect_ , John A. List argues that when dealing with a lost cause, it’s in your best interest to give up on the situation as quickly as possible. By giving up quickly, you save the maximum possible amount of your time, money, and energy.
> 
> Along with measuring a situation against your goals for it, as Cloud suggests, List recommends considering alternative uses of the time and resources you’re currently investing in the situation. If there’s another area where those resources would produce a better return, it’s probably time to end the investment.
> 
> Additionally, as you seek to end lost causes in your life, look out for diminishing returns. As List describes, diminishing returns occur when the gains you receive from a situation decrease as you invest more resources into it. Over time, this leads to a situation that depletes more resources than it brings in, as Cloud describes.

#### Assess Difficult Relationships

As opposed to more generalized situations, Cloud offers a separate set of strategies for assessing relationships that may need to end. He recommends that you consider the structural factors around the relationship, use character as a basis for assessment, and put the ball in the other person’s court.

(Shortform note: In addition to the tools Cloud offers for assessing your relationships, experts recommend getting outside perspectives on relationships. Specifically, if your friends and family have a negative view of one of your relationships, it may be a sign that the relationship needs to end. While you may be too close to the relationship to accurately assess it, your loved ones may have the outside perspective necessary to make a more objective judgment.)

##### Consider Structural Factors When Assessing Relationships

When you have an issue with someone’s behavior, you should consider the structural factors that influence that behavior—this is especially relevant in the context of employees. You should first assess whether the person is in the right position. Even the most talented employees will struggle in ill-fitting roles. Then, determine whether the person has the institutional support they need to succeed. **When employees fail, it may often be due to issues beyond their control** , such as a lack of resources or coaching in their work environment.

> **Have Your Employees Been Set Up to Fail?**
> 
> As you assess the structural context of an employee’s performance, consider whether they’ve been set up to fail. Management writers note that in trying to help employees who are perceived to be struggling, managers often do more harm than good. By increasing oversight of these employees, managers begin a vicious cycle in which increased supervision lowers employee confidence and performance, which leads management to continue to increase supervision. Over time, this leads to strained relationships between management and employees and lost productivity.
> 
> To assess whether your employees are being set up to fail, consider the quality of their relationships with management. If these relationships became strained at the same time as performance dropped, it may be a sign that your employees have been set up to fail.

##### Use Character to Assess Relationships

Once you’ve considered the structural factors at play, assess relationships based on your impression of the other person’s character. Cloud claims that **character is predictive of whether or not people will be receptive to change and feedback**.

(Shortform note: According to some psychologists, people tend to overestimate the relationship between another person’s actions and their character. These psychologists suspect that we overestimate our knowledge of others due to an inherent tendency to view ourselves as being more complex than others. These kinds of cognitive biases may complicate the process of judging someone’s character.)

According to Cloud, people can generally be sorted into three categories based on their character. **There are responsible people, irresponsible people, and dangerous people**. Cloud offers different strategies for dealing with each type of person. (Cloud notes that people are too complicated to truly fall into three simple categories; however, these three categories can still be a useful heuristic for determining which relationships to end.)

(Shortform note: Many psychologists have created systems for comparing personality types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which is widely used in the business world, sorts people into 16 types. Supporters of the MBTI argue that it helps companies support employees, but critics note that there’s little scientific evidence that supports the MBTI. Other researchers believe that there are four personality types, though they note that there are numerous other ways to group people.)

**1) Responsible people** (Cloud refers to them as “wise people”): Responsible people are characterized by their ability to take ownership of their actions. They’re able to admit and apologize when their mistakes have hurt others, and they readily incorporate feedback and change unwanted behaviors.

Responsible people are by far the easiest group to deal with. Relationships with responsible people are often improved by open communication—if you tell them what they’re doing wrong, they’re likely to correct it on their own. Responsible people reward your investments in relationships with them. They benefit from coaching and education more than others. If you’re dealing with a responsible person, communicate openly and honestly, and you’re unlikely to have to end the relationship.

> **Help Your Employees Behave Responsibly**
> 
> According to business psychologists, employees with a sense of ownership in the company behave more responsibly and productively. To increase the sense of ownership among your employees, these experts recommend assigning employees projects that affect their roles and allowing them to work on a given project from start to finish. These measures help your employees invest in their day-to-day tasks, encouraging them to act responsibly.
> 
> As you enact measures to help your employees feel a sense of ownership, you should also strengthen your relationships with your employees. Business coaching experts note that employees only respond positively to coaching when managers understand their desires and motivations. As you get to know your employees more personally, request feedback on how best to support them—this information will help you to coach them more effectively in the future.

**2) Irresponsible people** (Cloud refers to them as “fools”): As you might expect, irresponsible people are in many ways the polar opposites of responsible people. Irresponsible people are unable to take responsibility for their actions, instead finding an external factor to blame for any mistakes they make. When pressed about their behaviors, they’ll deflect or become heated and defensive.

(Shortform note: Psychologists note that defensive behavior often coincides with a neurological fight-or-flight response. In other words, people react defensively as a way of protecting themselves when feeling threatened. In these moments, people who get defensive feel that your criticism of their behavior is an attack on them as a person—in response, they use defensive tactics to try to protect themselves.)

When dealing with irresponsible people, it doesn’t always help to communicate directly about problem behaviors. Instead of critiquing specific misbehaviors, Cloud recommends calling out their overall inability to accept responsibility for their action. Point out to irresponsible people that they always find someone or something else to blame when things go wrong—this can sometimes help them change their patterns. **Setting consequences also works well with irresponsible people** , as it forces them to bear the weight of their own mistakes, which encourages them to change their behavior.

For example, suppose you’re struggling with an employee who habitually misses deadlines. Not only is this employee always behind schedule, they always have an excuse, always finding something or someone else to blame for their lateness. According to Cloud, trying to talk to them about their time management will be ineffective, as they’ll only continue to deflect responsibility. Instead, point out to the employee that they’re never accountable for their mistakes, and that their pattern of making excuses makes it difficult to manage them. By making them aware of their cycles of irresponsibility, you may help them begin the process of breaking those cycles.

It may not always be possible to improve relationships with irresponsible people. If you’ve tried communicating and setting consequences to no avail, Cloud recommends putting up boundaries to protect yourself. In some cases, this might mean bringing the relationship to an end.

> **Set Boundaries With Irresponsible People**
> 
> Just as Cloud opines that consequences help irresponsible people change their behavior, in _Set Boundaries, Find Peace_ , Nedra Glover Tawwab argues that you must enforce consequences for others to respect your boundaries.
> 
> According to Tawwab, consequences serve a dual function—they communicate to others that your needs are serious, and they protect you from people who don’t respect your boundaries. Tawwab recommends limiting your time with irresponsible people, as it both protects you by limiting your exposure to them and strongly communicates that a change is needed.
> 
> As you set boundaries with the irresponsible people in your life, be sure to speak up immediately when unwanted behaviors occur. Tawwab argues that communicating your discomfort in the moment helps to end uncomfortable situations as fast as possible, while also preventing resentment from building.

**3) Dangerous people** (Cloud refers to them as “evil people”): Dangerous people are completely unlike the first two groups. Whereas both responsible and irresponsible people may sometimes cause harm by accident, dangerous people intend to harm others with their words and their actions. They are unsafe to be around.

None of the strategies we have listed are effective in dealing with dangerous people. According to Cloud, nothing you can do will change their behavior. Instead, **end any and all relationships with dangerous people, and do your best to keep away from them**. Cloud notes that deterrents, such as legal actions or calls to law enforcement, can be effective in keeping dangerous people away.

(Shortform note: In _Why Does He Do That?_ , Lundy Bancroft describes dangerous people as “abusers.” According to Bancroft, abusers are people who intentionally harm others to get what they want. Like Cloud, Bancroft believes serious deterrents, such as arrests and litigation, can be used to curb abusive behavior. Beyond the individual level, Bancroft argues that to deal with dangerous, abusive people, you have to fight the cultural conditions that enable their actions. According to Bancroft, abusive behavior is often fueled by social imbalances in power due to money, race, gender, disability, or other criteria. Rectifying these power imbalances makes it more difficult for abusers to target vulnerable individuals.)

##### Let the Other Person Decide

If, after assessing someone’s character, you’re still not certain whether to end your relationship with them, it can help to let the other person decide (Cloud refers to this process as “self-selection”). Letting the other person decide entails **communicating your standards to the other person and allowing them to choose** whether they want to live up to those standards.

(Shortform note: Communicate your expectations clearly when you allow the other person to decide. Leadership experts note that people can’t live up to your standards if you don’t clearly communicate them in the first place. In workplace settings, it can be helpful to create a list of “always” and “never” behaviors for employees—for example, communication procedures that must always be followed or interpersonal behaviors that are never acceptable. Creating such clear-cut criteria makes it easier for employees to decide if they want to work with you.)

Cloud points out that allowing the other person to make the decision has benefits for both parties. If you struggle with guilt when imposing consequences in relationships, allowing the other person to make the decision can help alleviate this feeling. This style of decision-making can feel more inclusive to the other person—instead of passing down behavioral mandates, you’re including them in the decision-making process.

For example, suppose you have an employee who does excellent work but is lax about deadlines. You could simply tell them to work harder, or you could let them decide. Let them know that you admire their work and want them to succeed, but in order to stay with the company, they’ll need to meet their next set of deadlines. This clarifies your expectations for the employee and puts the power in their hands. At the same time, it gives you a clear-cut, guilt-free way to decide whether to end the relationship.

(Shortform note: Experts argue that when employees are involved in decision-making processes, they tend to feel more engaged and perform better. Based on these findings, including employees in a mutual decision-making process about their role may help encourage them to rise to your standards.)

### Enact Endings

Once you’ve determined that a change or an ending is needed in a particular situation, create structures that encourage you to act. Then, when it’s time to break things off, prepare carefully for that conversation. Finally, after an ending, take time to grieve, as grieving helps you process the experience and learn from it.

#### Create Structures That Encourage Action

As you move toward ending a situation or relationship, you’ll want to **create structures that keep you engaged in the process**. Cloud notes that it’s easy to lose focus when dealing with difficult situations. Because these situations are painful, we naturally want to focus elsewhere, which can lead us to delay making important changes.

To stay focused on the problem situation, regularly schedule time to work on the problem, and set deadlines for taking action. Regularly scheduling time to work on the problem helps you avoid losing focus, and setting deadlines helps ensure that you don’t delay your endings indefinitely.

It can be helpful to bring other people in to hold you accountable to your decisions. Cloud argues that people who aren’t directly involved are less likely to avoid the problem and can help to keep you motivated.

For example, if you need help ending a dead-end job, you could set a deadline with someone who will keep you accountable, such as a friend, coworker, or family member. While on your own it might be easy to delay putting in your two weeks’ notice, having a friend to call you out can help redirect your focus.

> **Expert Tips for Ending Problem Situations**
> 
> If you’re nervous about approaching a tough situation, it may help to take a direct approach to communication. Psychologists argue that people avoid difficult conversations because they’re a lot of work for the brain to handle. To get over that mental hurdle, experts recommend a direct approach, being candid with everyone involved about your feelings regarding the situation. Immediately and directly addressing the issue opens communication and helps others to engage respectfully, even if they disagree with you.
> 
> In addition to communicating directly, create a schedule that will allow you to handle the situation with maximum productivity. Schedule time early in the day, and allot more time than you think you’ll need. Experts note that you’re more likely to be energized and productive earlier in the day. And, allotting extra time ensures that you’ll have enough time to handle things even if you’re interrupted or experience unexpected complications.
> 
> Once you’ve laid out a schedule for dealing with the problem, you’ll want to bring on another person to keep you accountable to that schedule. However, think carefully before choosing a friend. Your accountability partner should be someone who is ready to push you and call you out when necessary, and sometimes friends are simply too kind to push you as hard as you need. If you’re considering choosing a friend, think carefully about whether that person is willing to be blunt and honest enough to hold you accountable.

##### Focus on What You Can Control to Avoid Losing Motivation

As you take action to end things, take care not to lose your motivation to deal with difficult situations. According to Cloud, it’s easy to lose motivation when a situation includes circumstances outside of your control.**The more you ruminate on unfortunate circumstances, the more you’ll feel that there’s nothing you can do to improve your situation.** This leads to feelings of apathy that can stop you from acting. To avoid falling into this trap, focus on the elements of a situation that are within your control. Cloud argues that focusing on the things you can control helps to convince your brain that you have the power to influence the situation, which in turn empowers you to act.

Suppose that your business is struggling due to rising inflation. If you choose to focus on the negative effects of inflation, you’ll wind up feeling powerless, as there’s nothing you can do to steer the global economy. However, if you instead choose to focus on the things your business can do to cut costs and increase revenue during this time, you’ll likely see that you have many options for dealing with the situation.

(Shortform note: Experts note that it’s important to focus on the things you can control because doing so reduces interference, which refers to distractions that pull you out of a focused, productive state. As you focus on the things you can control, you’ll also want to avoid comparing yourself to others, which is now easier than ever in the age of social media. Comparing yourself to others leads you to focus unduly on the result, instead of the process you need to follow to get there. To avoid this, focus on your individual goals, and don’t adjust those goals or change your trajectory no matter what your peers may be doing.)

#### Prepare for the Ending Conversation

When it comes time to end a relationship, thoroughly prepare for the ending conversation. Cloud contends that people often go into these conversations underprepared, which leads them to make mistakes that make the process more difficult and confusing for everyone involved.

The first step in preparing for an ending conversation is to **set goals for what you’d like to accomplish during the conversation**. According to Cloud, people who enter these kinds of conversations without clear goals in mind often end up waffling or letting the other person convince them to change their mind. For example, if you decide to fire an employee whose role has become obsolete, your goal might be to clearly communicate that the employee is fired, while also thanking them for their time at the company and letting them know that you’re open to being listed as a reference. With these goals in mind, it’ll be easier to stay on task in the heat of the moment.

Once you’ve set goals for the conversation, it can help to rehearse. Endings can be emotional, and you may find it difficult to remember everything you wanted to say when the time comes. While it might sound silly, writing a script and practicing it can help you feel more confident later on.

When writing your script, be sure to focus on the problem in the relationship, not the person. According to Cloud, focusing on the other person’s flaws can make them feel attacked, which may result in a heated and uncomfortable conversation. By focusing on the relationship’s issues, you’ll maintain clarity without upsetting the other person as much.

During the conversation, try to balance empathy with firmness. Cloud says people are more receptive to ending conversations when you approach them gently. However, at the same time, take care not to be too gentle, as this might give the other person the impression that you aren’t serious. Don’t be cold, but don’t leave any wiggle room either.

> **More Advice for Effective Endings**
> 
> There are a variety of perspectives on the best practices for ending personal and business relationships. In _Difficult Conversations_ , Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen argue for the importance of separating impact from intent. Stone, Patton, and Heen note that people who hurt you don’t always intend to and aren’t usually bad people. Separating impact from intent can help you maintain empathy for the other person as you end things.
> 
> Along with separating impact from intent, as you set goals for the conversation, remember that you can’t control the other person’s reaction. No matter how well you prepare or how clearly you communicate, how the other person reacts is up to them. Keep this in mind, and remember that it doesn’t reflect on you if the other person becomes upset or refuses to accept the ending. To avoid being upset if the other person reacts poorly, set goals that focus on your own communication and not on the other person’s reaction.
> 
> Once you’ve set goals for your communication, it’s time to practice communicating. In addition to rehearsing with a friend, experts recommend spending time by yourself to prepare for an imminent ending. During your solo rehearsal, you can coach yourself and prepare mentally for the task ahead. Spending time preparing alone can help you to understand and accept your role in the failed relationship, as well as giving you time to further meditate on why the ending is needed.
> 
> As you rehearse for an ending conversation, write a script that succinctly addresses your issues in the relationship. Take care not to over-explain your reasoning. Getting too detailed when explaining your reasons for ending a relationship creates room to argue, and may bring up hard feelings that can lead to escalation.
> 
> Once you’ve taken all the necessary steps to prepare for the conversation, let your loved ones know what’s about to happen. By letting your loved ones know in advance, you’ll ensure that you have the support you need when you come out of the conversation.

#### Take Time to Process and Reflect

After ending a situation or relationship, take time to process your feelings and reflect on the situation and its ending. Cloud argues that taking time to process your emotions after an ending is an essential part of the process. Processing and reflecting on the situation can help you to learn from it. As you reflect, **make an effort to understand what went wrong**. Doing so will help you avoid similar situations in the future.

(Shortform note: While it’s important to reflect on relationships after they end, experts caution against hashing out the relationship with your ex. It can be tempting to meet up with your ex to discuss exactly what went wrong, but these meetings only lead to more conflict, and in some cases, they may even lead you to reopen a relationship that you worked hard to end.)

By contrast, when you avoid reflecting on your feelings, you’re liable to make the same mistakes again. Not only this, but when you avoid processing your feelings and instead choose to avoid them, you’re also more likely to make impulsive decisions to distract you from your pain.

(Shortform note: To avoid making impulsive decisions after ending a romantic relationship, some experts suggest setting aside a period of time to take a break from dating. Taking a break from dating gives you time to focus on yourself and on unpacking your feelings about the ending. Explicitly deciding to stop dating helps ensure that you don’t allow yourself to be distracted by a sudden rebound fling.)
