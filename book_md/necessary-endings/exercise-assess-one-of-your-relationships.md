## Exercise: Assess One of Your Relationships

According to Cloud, assessing the character of the people in your life can help you determine how to handle your relationships with them.

* * *

Think of a relationship in which you’ve recently felt frustrated. Briefly describe the behavior that has frustrated you. Based on what you know about the other person, sort them into one of Cloud’s three categories—are they responsible, irresponsible, or dangerous?

Based on your assessment of this person’s character, make a plan to address your frustrations in the relationship. If the person is responsible, you might consider communicating with them. If they’re irresponsible, you might want to set consequences for future offenses. If they’re dangerous, you may want to distance yourself from them. Describe your strategy below.
