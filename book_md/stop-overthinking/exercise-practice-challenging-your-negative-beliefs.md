## Exercise: Practice Challenging Your Negative Beliefs

Trenton argues that the key to overcoming a long-term habit of overthinking lies in reshaping your mindset. To form a new positive mindset, let’s practice challenging your negative beliefs.

* * *

The first step to forming a new mindset is to identify what triggers you to overthink. Describe a recent situation or problem that you worried over excessively. What were you overthinking? For example, you might have worried about whether you studied enough for an upcoming exam.

Identify what negative belief caused you to feel this way. For example, you might believe that you’ll fail an exam unless you spend weeks studying for it.

Next, challenge that negative belief by considering evidence you have that supports or disproves it. For example, you might remember that you’d passed all of the other exams in that class and that there’s no evidence you wouldn’t do well if you studied a little less.

Finally, develop a positive belief to focus on instead—when replacing your negative beliefs with positive ones, Trenton suggests you focus on being present, let go of what you can’t control, and concentrate on your needs. For example, you might remind yourself that you studied as much as you could and remember that your most important goal is to learn.
