## Exercise: Learn From a Past Mistake

In _Seeking Wisdom_ , Peter Bevelin emphasizes how rational thinking can help you avoid major errors and improve your life. Take some time to reflect on a past mistake you made and craft a plan to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

* * *

First, describe a major mistake you made in the past due to irrational thinking. (For instance, perhaps you made the impulsive decision to quit your new job after only a week. Now, you regret that decision and wish you’d given the job more of a chance.)

Next, describe the origins of your major error. Was it a result of evolutionary mismatch? (For example, your evolved tendency toward emotional decision-making may have led you to impulsively quit your job after a stressful work week.) Alternatively, is your mistake a result of your failure to apply scientific concepts related to interpreting evidence and systems thinking? (For instance, perhaps you failed to consider how quitting your job too early might have far-reaching repercussions in a larger system, such as making future employers question your commitment.)

Now, describe a future situation that may be similar to the situation in which you made that error (for example, a future job opportunity).

Finally, describe a rational thinking strategy you can use in that future scenario to prevent you from repeating the major error you made in the past. (If your error resulted from an evolutionary mismatch, consider these rational thinking strategies: backward thinking, calming yourself down, creating and consulting pre-established guidelines, or the “front page test.” If your error resulted from your failure to apply scientific concepts, consider these rational thinking strategies: Base your future decisions on causal data or representative evidence, identify and improve limiting factors, or predict and plan for far-reaching consequences.)
