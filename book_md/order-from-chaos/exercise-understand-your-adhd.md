## Exercise: Understand Your ADHD

Getting organized starts with getting to know yourself better. Reflect on your situation as it is now and consider how you could implement Paul’s advice to bring greater order to your life.

* * *

First, identify the ADHD symptoms that have the greatest impact on your life and that interfere the most with what you want to accomplish each day.

How can you better manage these symptoms? Consider whether you’d like to try an ADHD medication, or implement some non-medication tools like exercise or a better sleep schedule.

Now, identify your learning style (auditory, visual, tactile, or reading/writing). You can take a test online or simply reflect on what you know about yourself and how you learn best.

Based on your learning style, what are some aspects of organizational systems that you think will work for you? If you’re a visual learner with “out of sight, out of mind” tendencies, what are some visual cues you can incorporate into your system? If you’re an auditory or tactile learner, what sensory or movement techniques can you use to keep yourself more focused?
