## Exercise: Establish Inboxes and Lists

Once you’re in the later stages of your organizing, begin identifying the best ways to keep track of your items and ideas.

* * *

First, identify the things you struggle to keep track of. These will be items that frequently end up in piles or overflowing containers.

Next, designate some inboxes (as few as you can manage) for those items. Consider options such as physical receptacles for communications like texts and voicemails, digital calendar reminders, or apps to keep track of tasks and projects.

Now, start logging your ongoing or upcoming projects on a list. Create one list for the projects that need to be done soon, and a second list for the things you’d like to do someday but can’t accomplish just yet.

Finally, identify the first step in each of the projects on your list of projects to complete soon. Place these immediate steps on a to-do list so you know exactly what you need to do next to accomplish each of these projects.
