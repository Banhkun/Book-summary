## Exercise: Adopt New Perspectives to List Your Product’s Features and Value

Identify the features, benefits, and value that both you and your customers perceive in your product, and consider how these might differ.

* * *

List what you personally feel are your product’s five best features. Then, determine what benefit (the practical support) and value (the problem-solving ability) each provides the customer. Write these down next to the feature.

Now, note three customer segments that would be interested in your product. Be sure these are narrow segments (for instance, “work-from-home parents” is a narrow segment, while “parents” is too broad).

Put yourself in the shoes of each of these three customer segments, and ask yourself what they would consider to be your product’s best features and those features’ benefits and value. What would they appreciate in your product given their circumstances and needs?

Finally, consider if the features, benefits, and value you see in your product differ from those your customer sees. How might you position your product differently to reflect your customers’ perspectives?
