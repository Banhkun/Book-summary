## Exercise: What Are Your Time-Wasters?

Typically, 75% of your time as an executive is spent on things that don’t produce results but are unavoidable. That leaves only 25% to spend on the things that contribute most to organizational performance.

What are three to five time-wasters that affect your day-to-day work?

What is your single biggest time-waster? How much time do you spend on it?

Why haven’t you felt comfortable eliminating it?

How could you eliminate this time-waster?

What could you do with the freed-up time that would be more productive?
