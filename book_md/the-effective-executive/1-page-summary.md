## 1-Page Summary

While many business books tell you how to manage other people, _The Effective Executive_ , a 1966 classic by management expert Peter F. Drucker, explains how to manage _yourself_ to be effective.

**Drucker defines effectiveness as choosing and doing _the right things_ —that is, the things that significantly improve personal and organizational performance and results.** He argues that effectiveness derives from a set of five practices anyone can learn rather than from unique talents or charisma. This guide examines how Drucker’s ideas on effectiveness hold up today and how others have built on them.

A leader in management theory and practice for over 60 years, Drucker, who died in 2005, authored 39 books and countless articles, including more than 30 essays in the _Harvard Business Review_. He’s credited with being the founder of modern management.

(Shortform note: Drucker’s obituary in the _New York Times_ noted that his ideas on management were so influential that a comment from him could change the way top corporate leaders operated. His thinking has continued to inspire business leaders and authors—for example, the late Jack Welch, Tom Peters, Jim Collins (_Good to Great_), Ken Blanchard, Andrew Grove (_High Output Management)_, Jeff Bezos, Stephen Covey (_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_), and Tim Ferriss (_The 4-Hour Workweek_).)

### Practice #1: Manage Your Time

Drucker’s first practice for effectiveness is managing your time. He argues that you first need to understand what you’re currently doing with your time then take control of it. There are three steps: Analyze your time, cut time wasters, and time block. (Shortform note: Drucker's approach differs from the advice in many time management books such as _Getting Things Done_ and _The One Thing._ These books recommend immediately determining and focusing on what’s most important (prioritizing), rather than first analyzing how you currently spend your time.)

#### 1\. Analyze Your Time

Drucker’s guidelines for tracking and analyzing your time are:

  * **Keep a log as you do things, recording everything you do and how long it takes**. Do this for three or four weeks at a time, twice a year. The specific method or format you use doesn’t matter. (Shortform note: Time tracking apps such as RescueTime may be useful, particularly for automatically tracking what you're doing on-screen—an increasingly large proportion of time use that provides myriad opportunities for distraction. Like this knowledge worker who tracked his time, you may be surprised at how little focused work you’re accomplishing.)
  * After each recorded period, **rethink and revise your schedule** (see Step 2). Many people slide back into a pattern of wasting time in about six months, Drucker says, so it takes constant vigilance and adjustment to prevent this drifting. (Shortform note: _The Happiness Project_ recommends taking daily notes about what worked—what you accomplished, when, and how—in order to identify and replicate your most productive habits and times, so you can make them routine.)



#### 2\. Cut Time Wasters

Once you’ve recorded your time for a few weeks, Drucker advises rooting out your time-wasting activities with these steps:

**1) Identify and eliminate activities that don’t produce results, including things that don’t need to be done in the first place.** For each item on your time record, ask yourself what would happen if you hadn’t done it or don’t do it going forward. If the answer is nothing, stop doing it. Drucker claims that most executives could eliminate about 25% of their activities without anyone noticing; he cites speeches, social events, committee memberships, directorships, and lunch or dinner events as often unnecessary.

(Shortform note: Today, such activities might be considered essential parts of branding, marketing, or networking. A way to evaluate these activities and decide if they’re useful enough to continue is to borrow the lean manufacturing idea of determining which ones are value-added versus non-value-added: Value-added activities add customer value to a business process, product, or service. This aligns with Drucker’s advice to say “no” to doing anything that doesn’t help your organization or enhance your contribution to the organization’s performance.)

**2) Determine which activities could be done by someone else, and delegate them.** While some people view delegating as being lazy or taking advantage of a subordinate, Drucker emphasizes that as an executive, you’re being paid for your unique contribution to the organization’s performance—and when you allow yourself to be distracted from this by tasks someone else can do, you undercut your effectiveness as well as the organization's.

> **How to Delegate Effectively**
> 
> In _High Output Management_ , CEO Andrew Grove identifies the following requirements for effective delegating:
> 
>   * You and the person you’re delegating to need to have the same information and agree on how to do the task.
> 
>   * You can keep the tasks you like doing as long as you’re fully aware of your motivations for not delegating them.
> 
>   * You monitor the person you’re delegating to.
> 
>   * You delegate tasks you’re familiar with, because it’s easier to monitor things you already know how to do.
> 
>   * If you’re delegating decision-making, monitor the decision-making process.
> 
> 


**3) Identify the ways in which you waste others’ time (and therefore your own).** Drucker advises asking**** your employees and colleagues what _you_ do that wastes _their_ time (that doesn’t increase their effectiveness or contribution).

You may be doing something that’s productive for you but that still wastes others’ time—for example, requiring an employee to track weekly data and produce a report that you rarely refer to.

> **Don’t Be a Negative Influence**
> 
> A Stanford study found that leaders often waste others’ time because they don’t notice subordinates’ needs and problems:
> 
>   * They don’t realize how much work their orders entail.
> 
>   * They micromanage instead of delegating.
> 
>   * They make unthinking comments that employees interpret as orders or criticism, triggering unnecessary work.
> 
>   * They constantly announce new initiatives that conflict or compete with prior initiatives (and take time to adopt).
> 
>   * They prompt employees to work hard to please them or tell them what they want to hear, taking time away from these employees’ core tasks.
> 
> 

> 
> The antidote to these issues is to encourage candor and criticism from subordinates and to act on it.

**4) Cut time-wasters resulting from poor management.** Drucker identifies several types of time-wasters resulting from poor management. Chief among them is wasting time with an excessive number of meetings, which keeps executives and others from getting important work done. (Shortform note: A 2017 HBR article noted that executives spend about 23 hours a week in meetings, up from 10 hours in the 1960s. Other surveys and estimates range much higher—for example, 45 hours a week or 72% of their time.)

Drucker says **meetings should be the exception rather than the rule**. They _are_ sometimes needed—people have to cooperate by sharing knowledge and information to get a specific task done. But to avoid wasting time, meetings should be focused.

> **Design an Agenda for an Effective Meeting**
> 
> The key to an effective, focused meeting is arguably having a well-planned and designed agenda. In the _Harvard Business Review,_ Roger Schwarz discusses the steps for designing an effective agenda, including:
> 
>   * Solicit topics from your team and decide which to include in the meeting.
> 
>   * Determine the goal of discussing each topic you include.
> 
>   * Structure the discussion of each topic (time limit, discussion leader, how a decision (if any) will be made).
> 
>   * Share the agenda with participants so they can prepare.
> 
>   * Conduct the meeting by sticking to the agenda.
> 
>   * Debrief at the end of the meeting on what could have gone better.
> 
> 

> 
> Read our summary of the HBR article to see our customized agenda template for an effective meeting.

#### 3\. Time Block

The third step for managing your time (after analyzing it and cutting time-wasters), according to Drucker, is to make the most of the little nonscheduled time you have left (your discretionary time for important tasks that contribute significantly to your company’s performance). He says this typically amounts to only 25% of your total time.

**The way to make the most of this time is to consolidate it into blocks as large as possible.** Drucker contends that small increments of time are useless—you can’t write a report by spending 15 minutes on it a day. If you try, you won’t get anywhere and will have to start over the next time. But if you can get four or five hours of uninterrupted time, you can create a solid draft that you can flesh out later in smaller time increments. (Shortform note: While time blocking (also called time boxing) is widely recommended and practiced today, it was new when Drucker first wrote about it.)

> **A Time Blocking Method**
> 
> In _Deep Work,_ Cal Newport describes one potential time-blocking method:
> 
>   * Plan your day in half-hour blocks.
> 
>   * Make a list of tasks you need to finish in the day. Schedule time for each task to the nearest half-hour.
> 
>   * Schedule time in advance for when you'll use the Internet. Avoid it completely outside these times.
> 
>   * Schedule overrun blocks for tasks you suspect might run overtime.
> 
>   * If you have lots of shallow tasks (more than 30-50% time), consider how you can replace these with deeper work.
> 
>   * At the end of the day, review the accuracy of your time blocks.
> 
> 


### Practice #2: Focus

The second practice for effectiveness is _focus_ , which Drucker defines as **focusing on only a few key things and doing them _one at a time_**. (Shortform note: Drucker actually lists focus as his fourth practice. We’ve moved it to #2 because it encompasses prioritizing, which is closely related to Practice #1, managing your time.)

Drucker says the ability to focus is central to executive performance because:

  * When you focus on one thing at a time, you actually get more done because you get each thing done faster. You also do better work, which strengthens your contribution to organizational performance. (Shortform note: In _Quiet_ , Susan Cain notes that focusing may be easier for introverts than for extroverts, because introverts’ preferred work style is to work methodically on one task at a time and concentrate deeply.)
  * You can’t do more than one thing at a time well. (Shortform note: Drucker was ahead of the research in realizing that multitasking yields poor results. We’ll discuss the myth of multitasking below.)



> **How to Focus**
> 
> While Drucker emphasizes the need for and value of focusing, he doesn’t discuss _how_ to focus beyond simply scheduling “alone” time. However, later authors discuss how to focus or do deep (focused) work.
> 
> For example, in _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport argues that you must **strengthen your ability to focus by working it like a muscle**. He says that after practicing four steps daily for a few months, you’ll increase your ability to do deep work, and raise your level of concentration:
> 
>   * Schedule when you’ll use the Internet. Avoid it completely outside these times.
> 
>   * Set tight deadlines for yourself that require you to concentrate at the limit of your ability to make the deadlines.
> 
>   * Practice productive meditation—think about a problem while you do a low-intensity physical activity, like walking or showering.
> 
>   * Practice memorization techniques.
> 
> 

> 
> **Multitasking**
> 
> The opposite of focus is multitasking, which Drucker recognized as unproductive. Gary Keller writes in _The One Thing_ that people _can_ do two things at once—for instance, walk and talk. But like computers, we alternate our focus. A conflict occurs when a new activity requires a brain channel already in use or when one task demands greater attention—for example, when you’re driving and start focusing on a text message instead of on the road.
> 
> Downsides of multitasking include:
> 
>   * You get less done.
> 
>   * When you bounce between activities, you lose time as your brain reorients.
> 
>   * You make more mistakes and make bad decisions.
> 
>   * You stress yourself.
> 
> 


#### Determine Priorities _and_ Non-Priorities

After eliminating unproductive activities, Drucker’s next step is deciding which productive tasks and opportunities are priorities—the right tasks on which you concentrate one at a time—and which are non-priorities, things you don’t do.

While most people focus on determining priorities, Drucker contends that consciously deciding your _non-priorities_ is equally important, because non-priorities tend to encroach on priorities unless you actively resist or eliminate them. **Non-priorities are tasks you’ve decided you won’t do or opportunities you won’t pursue** now, if at all. These are activities that offer little or no significant long-term value.

> **Identifying Non-Priorities**
> 
> Several authors, especially sales consultant and author Brian Tracy (_Eat That Frog_), have built on Drucker’s idea of priorities and non-priorities. To determine what activities you can drop, Tracy recommends these steps:
> 
>   * List the work activities that take the most of your time.
> 
>   * Ask yourself whether _you’d_ pay someone the equivalent of your salary to do each of them. If not, stop doing them—delegate or eliminate them.
> 
> 


#### Priorities

Drucker doesn’t give any specific advice on how to set priorities—he says **setting priorities requires courage more than analysis**. In his view, courage requires that you:

  * Favor the future over the past. Successful companies are those that innovate rather than build on existing products.
  * **Focus on opportunities, not problems**. It's more valuable to translate an opportunity into results for the future than to solve a current problem.



> **How to Prioritize**
> 
> In _Eat That Frog_ , Brian Tracy proposes the ABCDE method for prioritizing a to-do list. Write down everything you have to do for the next day. Then, rank each item by marking it with an A, B, C, D, or E, as follows:
> 
>   * A—must do
> 
>   * B—should do
> 
>   * C—would be nice to do
> 
>   * D—delegate
> 
>   * E—eliminate
> 
> 


### Practice #3: Make Your Unique Contribution

Drucker’s third practice for effectiveness is determining and applying your unique contribution. This means looking beyond your immediate work or task and being guided by the larger question, **“What unique contribution can I make to significantly increase organizational performance and results?”**

Drucker advises you to take responsibility for your own contribution and results, then request the same from your employees by asking, “What contribution do you intend to make, and what’s our best use of your contribution (knowledge and ability)?” Finally, only hold meetings if their purpose advances your contribution to the organization.

> **Determining Your Contribution**
> 
> In _The Effective Executive_ , Drucker leaves it up to the reader to determine her unique contribution for results. However**,** years later in a 2005 Harvard Business Review article, Drucker listed three questions executives and knowledge workers should ask to determine their contribution. Instead of the typical question, “What do _I_ want to do?”, ask:
> 
>   * What does the situation require?
> 
>   * Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?
> 
>   * What results have to be achieved to make a difference?
> 
> 


### Practice #4: Maximize Strengths—Yours and Others’

The fourth practice for effectiveness is building or leveraging strengths—your own strengths and the strengths of those around you—to achieve results.

Drucker argues that **you can’t accomplish anything significant by focusing on your own or others’ weaknesses**. When you focus on weaknesses, you undermine the purpose of the organization, which is to translate people’s strengths into performance for results. He says that morally, managers owe it to the organization to maximize the strength of every employee, and owe it to employees to enable them to excel to the extent possible.

> **What Is a Strengths-Based Approach?**
> 
> The Gallup organization popularized strengths-based development for performance management and leadership development in 2001, although the idea arose in the 1980s as an approach to social work. Embraced by HR professionals and major companies, strengths-based development launched the trend of strengths coaching.
> 
> Gallup defines strengths as a person’s unique combination of talents, abilities, and motivators. Strengths-based development helps employees understand and leverage their capabilities; it focuses on what they do well rather than what they do poorly.
> 
> Gallup says its research over 40 years shows that when employers focus on workers’ strengths rather than trying to fix weaknesses, they have better employee engagement, performance, retention, customer engagement, and profitability.

### Practice #5: Make Sound Decisions

Drucker’s fifth and final practice for effectiveness is making sound decisions. He lays out a five-step process:

**Step 1: Determine whether the situation requiring a decision is typical or unique.** If it’s typical, it can be solved by applying a principle or rule.

**Step 2:** Determine the objectives the decision must meet, and the limitations or constraints (such as budget) affecting the solution.

**Step 3: In considering options, focus on the _right_ action rather than the _acceptable_ action** (this sets a benchmark before making any compromises or concessions with the decision).

**Step 4:** As part of the decision, determine how it will be implemented (otherwise, it’s just an intention).

**Step 5:** Establish a feedback mechanism for testing whether the decision works.

> **Comparison With Other Decision-Making Processes**
> 
> Although there are variations, many business textbooks and leadership programs teach these typical steps for making decisions:
> 
>   * Identify the decision (the problem you must solve or question you must answer).
> 
>   * Gather the relevant information (from both internal and external sources).
> 
>   * Identify the options.
> 
>   * Weigh the pros and cons of each option.
> 
>   * Choose among the options (make your decision).
> 
>   * Take action (create a plan and assign tasks).
> 
>   * Review your decision (ultimately, what worked and what didn’t).
> 
> 

> 
> This process differs from Drucker’s first two steps of categorizing the decision and determining parameters, and his fourth step of focusing on right versus acceptable. These steps are bigger-picture elements not included in typical decision-making processes.
