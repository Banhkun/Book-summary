## Exercise: How Could You Reduce Your Tech Use?

Reflect on how you could apply digital minimalism to your life.

* * *

Digital minimalism promotes using technology to support your values and interests. What are some of your values and interests (such as family or a musical hobby)?

Name one of the apps or websites that you spend the most time on. How does it add value to your life beyond minor convenience? (For example, perhaps you use Instagram to keep up with work from an artist whose work isnâ€™t displayed publicly anywhere else.)

Is that technology the _best_ way to support your values? Why or why not? What are alternative ways to support your values?

What parameters could you implement to change the way you use this tool so that you maximize the positive aspects and minimize the negative (or merely distracting) ones?
