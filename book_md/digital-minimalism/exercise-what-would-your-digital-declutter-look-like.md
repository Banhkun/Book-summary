## Exercise: What Would Your Digital Declutter Look Like?

If you were to commit to a 30-day digital declutter, what would that entail?

* * *

Think of all the technologies you use, including websites, apps, and other digital tools that you access through your phone or computer. Which of these could you eliminate for a month without damaging your personal or professional life?

If there are technologies that you only need under certain circumstances (for example, to talk to a relative overseas), what rule could you impose so that you only use that tool for that specific need?

Predict which tools you would reintroduce after completing the digital declutter and explain why.

Which tools do you think you would eliminate, and why?
