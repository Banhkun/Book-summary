## Introduction

Many of us are glued to our smartphones, tablets, and laptops. When most people first got smartphones or signed up for social media, they envisioned the benefits they’d reap, from the convenience of having a pocket-sized computer to the connectedness they could feel with friends and family across the globe. But, over time, the urge to slavishly check Facebook updates, refresh email, and scan Twitter has become so strong that many people feel that they’ve lost control of how they spend their time and attention. **Many people feel overpowered and exhausted by the multitude of digital tools at their fingertips, including devices like smartphones and tablets, websites, addictive apps, and social media platforms.** People want to _use_ digital tools, they don’t want to feel _used_ by them.

There are a number of strategies for loosening technology’s grip on your attention, but simple hacks meant to alter your habits aren’t potent enough to overcome technology’s addictive pull. Instead, this book lays out a philosophy of technology use that manages your digital behavior based on your values. **This philosophy is digital minimalism, and it aims to maximize the benefits of technology and avoid the pitfalls by identifying your values and determining how to use technology to support them.** In Part 1, we’ll discuss the principles of digital minimalism and explain why it’s an effective way to improve your digital (and real-world) life. In Part 2, we’ll review practical strategies for implementing digital minimalism.

Cal Newport—an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University—was inspired to write this book after hearing readers’ reactions to his 2016 book, _Deep Work_ , which discussed how modern communication tools like email prevent professionals from having the intense, uninterrupted focus that is critical to performing at their best. After the book was published, many readers responded that this wasn’t just a problem in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives: Their digital habits were eating up all of their leisure time and chipping away at their personal fulfillment.

(Shortform note: Read more from Cal Newport with our summaries of _Deep Work_ and _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_.)

Before we talk about how to break our technology obsession, let’s explore what makes it so addictive in the first place.

(Shortform note: Digital minimalism is an evergreen philosophy, even when you work, learn, and socialize remotely. For example, early in the pandemic, Newport posted a brief blog encouraging readers to sustain their commitment to the tenets of digital minimalism: Be mindful of your values, be intentional about your digital use, and make a point to engage in rewarding and rejuvenating non-digital activities.)
