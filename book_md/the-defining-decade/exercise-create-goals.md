## Exercise: Create Goals

The options you have before you at any given moment are determined by your past—who you are, where you’ve come from, and what identity capital you have—and your vision of the future—where you ultimately want to be.

* * *

Make a list of five realistic options you have based on your experience, education, strengths, interests, and goals. (These could be career options or options related to another major life choice.)

Go through your list and evaluate each one against your vision for yourself in the future. Think through what it will take to accomplish each goal, how much time it would take, and where each will lead.

Of your now-examined list, pick just one or two options. Compare and contrast them. Make note of your emotional response to each and examine that response—is it excitement? Anxiety? A little of both? Write down your reactions and continue to reflect on them over the next few days.
