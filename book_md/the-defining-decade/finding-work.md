## Finding Work

At one point or another, the vast majority of twenty-somethings have been unemployed or underemployed, working at low-skilled jobs they are highly overqualified for. This is sometimes necessary; forces beyond their control might compel them to, and oftentimes these jobs are a means to an end—a source of cash during grad school, for example.

But it is easy to fall into a trap of living day-by-day, spending long periods of time in low-end jobs and delaying meaningful career choices. Unfortunately, this is a poor strategy for long-term happiness. Research shows that chronically underemployed people are more depressed than their peers, and unemployment in a person’s twenties is a strong predictor of future depression and drinking problems, even after that person becomes employed.

Extended periods of voluntary underemployment and unemployment can also do lasting harm to a person’s career prospects and future happiness. **A delay in starting a career can permanently depress long-term wages,** as the majority of lifetime wage growth typically happens during the first ten years of a career, before responsibilities like families and mortgages prevent a person from pursuing opportunities that would increase her salary like higher education or cross-country moves.

To find yourself in a meaningful career in your thirties and beyond, you must make purposeful career choices in your twenties. Do so by approaching your life mindfully and accumulating helpful experiences:

  * Have a productive identity crisis: Reflect on your life but also accumulate experiences.
  * Pursue weak ties: Network to seek opportunities and knowledge you would not otherwise stumble across.
  * Be realistic about your options: Examine what options are realistically available to you. 
  * Create goals; ignore “shoulds”: Ignore what others say you should do. Examine your own objectives.
  * Build uniqueness from common parts: Craft your own unique path by piecing together a life of varied and interesting experiences. 
  * Leverage yourself with a good story: Use the experiences you’ve had to create a compelling narrative about your life in order to overcome a light-on-experience resume. 



We’ll explore each of these ideas below.

### Have a Productive Identity Crisis

All too often, twenty-somethings, feeling lost, retreat into reflection as they try to figure out who they are and by extension, what they should be doing with their lives. This is all part of a classic “identity crisis,” and it’s an important step towards developing your long-term identity. However, reflection is only half the formula for having a successful identity crisis. The other, equally important, piece is experience.

Erik Erickson, a German psychoanalyst, coined the term “identity crisis” in 1950. He encouraged a period of **youthful exploration during which a person could collect experiences and try out different paths in life without risk or obligation.** The concept has evolved since its inception and is today understood very differently from what Erickson intended.

Very often, people misconstrue the idea of “not committing to a path” as “not exploring any path.” They end up then squandering their twenties in a so-called “Starbucks phase,” during which they hold a series of uninspiring dead-ends jobs, or no job at all, while spending their time in unproductive pursuits like partying, when they should be spending these years collecting instructive experiences.

#### How to Develop Your Identity Capital

While having your identity crisis, you need to be not only reflecting on your life but also actively accumulating experiences that will form your “identity capital”: the sum of your personal resources. **Your identity capital is the collection of things you’ve done long enough or well enough that they become part of who you are.** It’s the intangible currency we use to obtain jobs and relationships. It includes quantifiable measurements like your schools, clubs, jobs, hobbies, and degrees. It also includes more unquantifiable things like your temperament, how you approach problems, and how you present yourself to the world through your clothes, your vocabulary, and your personality.

There’s a difference between an entry-level job at a coffee shop and an entry-level job at a film production company, and during your twenties you must actively build your identity capital by seeking out meaningful opportunities rather than place-holding ones. Volunteer with a charity, work as an intern in an industry you’re interested in, or take classes in something you might like to pursue. Avoid unmeaningful experiences that won’t teach you anything and won’t help you build skills.

Twenty-somethings who strike this balance between action and reflection spend their identity crisis accumulating interesting experiences _while_ they are thinking about their path. These people construct stronger identities and end up more satisfied with their lives: better able to manage stress, more in control of their future, and living more original, unique lives.

### Pursue Weak Ties

You don’t exist in a vacuum, and a large piece of your identity, and your identity capital, is determined by the people in your life. Some of your personal ties are stronger than others. You have strong ties to those you spend a lot of time with or have known for many years. In childhood these include family and long-time friends. In your twenties these grow to embrace roommates, partners, and other close friends: your so-called “urban tribe.”

You have weak ties to people you’ve met infrequently or who are connected to you through a mutual friend. These might be a colleague from a different department, a neighbor you rarely see, a former employer, or a friend-of-a-friend you keep meaning to get in touch with.

Though you feel more comfortable around your strong ties, **the people with whom you have weak ties are most likely to help you move forward in your pursuits.** This is because your strong ties are like you: They think like you, have similar life experiences, or are from the same places. Therefore, they have little to add to your journey, either in work or love. They know the same things and the same people you know. Your strong ties can also prevent you from moving forward by lulling you into a sense of behavioral complacency. These people love you as you are and give you no incentive to conduct yourself in a more professional or presentable manner.

**However, your weak ties can give you access to information and people you don’t otherwise know.** Interacting with your weak ties encourages you to behave more professionally: You must organize your thoughts more clearly and use more formal vocabulary than you would around someone with whom you are intimately comfortable. Consequently, you are encouraged to act more mindfully and reflectively. An extraordinary number of jobs are found through a network of weak ties, rather than an ad.

#### How to Cultivate Your Weak Ties: Getting Started

People often feel uncomfortable asking for help from weak ties. They’d prefer to get a job on their own, or they don’t feel “networking” fits with who they are. But because new opportunities almost always come from outside your circle of close contacts, it’s important to reach out. Ignoring the potential of weak ties can only shut you off from opportunities.

Fortunately, you have human nature on your side: People naturally like to help other people.**** Humans have an innate tendency towards altruism. Studies show that acting altruistically leads to health, happiness, and longevity. In short, it feels nice to act nice.

Additionally, when someone does you a favor, she’s far more likely to do you another in the future. This is because of another quirk of human nature: Behavior shapes attitudes. When someone helps you, her brain tells her she likes you and she’s inclined to help you again.

**A great way to approach a weak tie is to ask her for a small, interesting, specific, and easy-to-accomplish favor.** Ben Franklin outlined this idea in his autobiography. He wanted to foster a connection with a certain politician. Instead of trying to win him over by acting servile or overly complimentary, he asked him if he could borrow a specific book he’d discovered the politician owned. The politician sent it over, and after that, took Franklin under his wing and helped his career for years afterwards.

The important elements of Franklin’s request were:

  * He researched his target.
  * He made himself relevant: He matched his request to his target’s area of expertise.
  * He made himself interesting: His request was unusual.
  * He asked for a specific, clearly-defined, and easy-to-execute favor. 
  * He came across as a serious, professional person.



When approaching your weak tie, whether it be for a letter of recommendation, introduction, or informational interview, follow Franklin’s structure:

  * **Research your target:** Find out any relevant information that might connect you.
  * **Make yourself relevant:** Find a connection to your target’s expertise.
  * **Make yourself interesting:** Show some personality. 
  * **Make your request specific:** Don’t approach someone with a vague, “Can we meet for coffee?” Instead, let her know what exactly you’d like to discuss. 
  * **Make your request easy to execute:** Don’t ask for advice that would require lengthy, thoughtful responses on a broad subject like what you should do with your life. Ask instead for advice on a specific aspect of one particular industry you’re interested in. 



Cultivating weak ties is a great way to expand the set of potential options available to you. As we’ll explore in the next section, you can’t make choices if you don’t have options.

### Look Realistically at Your Options

As a child, you’ve probably been told you can do “anything you want” with your life. Whether or not that was true when you were a kid, it’s most definitely not true when you’re an adult. Your choices are actually quite limited. **The options you have before you are determined by your past—who you are, where you’ve come from, and what identity capital you have—and your vision of the future—where you ultimately want to be.**

But this shouldn’t upset you; it's actually a good thing. It is far easier to choose among a few options than infinite options. Having too many options often leads to anxiety. When faced with infinite choices, the pressure to make the best choice over all the others is overwhelming and results in paralysis. In the face of excessive options, it can feel safer not to make _any_ decision, so that you don’t risk missing out on something better.

In one revealing study, researchers set up sampling tables in two grocery stores. The first offered samples of six different jams, and the second offered twenty four. While the twenty-four-sample table attracted more attention, the six-flavor table resulted in far more sales (30 percent as opposed to only three percent).

The best way to move beyond decision-making paralysis is to think honestly about what options are available to you. Make a list of the realistic options you have based on your experience, education, strengths, interests, and goals. Maybe you decide you could either continue working at the coffee shop, go to art school, take a job as an administrative assistant, or travel through South America until your savings are exhausted. Examine these options rationally. Which will lead you to a place you’d like to see yourself in ten or twenty years? Which are maybe just another excuse to put off committing to adulthood?

Making yourself aware of your true options is the first step towards setting realistic, workable goals: the building blocks of future happiness.

### Create Goals; Ignore “Shoulds”

The goals you set today will structure your life in the years to come.**** In your twenties, it can be hard to chart a path forward because there are no ready-made maps outlining what you should do with your life as there were in college.

In college you had a limited set of classes you could take and you knew exactly what you needed to do to succeed in them. Once you leave college, the map disappears and you need to start thinking about what you “should” be doing with your life. College had easy benchmarks that you could measure yourself against to see if you were doing what you “should” be doing. After college, though, those benchmarks disappear and it’s difficult to know what standards to judge yourself against.

Because your life is so wide open during these years, you’ll likely get significant pressure from friends, family, or social media as to what you should do with it. These are “shoulds,” and they can push you in one of two ways:

  1. **You should be more successful by now:** Seeing other people’s successes, you may feel pressured to catch up, and to find a big, deep purpose that makes you look good. You may even consider taking on projects that wouldn’t otherwise appeal to you, only because of how you think it might reflect well on you on social media. For example, you might think about going to work for a well-known charity when in truth, you never envisioned devoting your life to humanitarian causes. 
  2. **You should stay free and uncommitted:** Or, you’ll feel pressure in the opposite direction: pressure to stay free and unencumbered, when in fact, you may be ready to leave the party circuit, find a steady job and a steady partner, and settle down. 



It’s easy to mistake other people’s “shoulds” for your goals, but resist the urge. “Goals” are not “shoulds.” Goals come from inside us; shoulds are pressures from others. Goals feel like dreams that would truly make us happy; shoulds feel like obligations. Goals can be worked toward and can evolve as we gain more understanding; shoulds are a cut-and-dried choice between perfection and failure.

Instead of getting caught up in what others think you should do, set practical, workable goals that make sense for you. Then move toward achieving them in realistic steps. Keep in mind a few guidelines:

  * Don’t worry about whether or not an opportunity is below you. Look for opportunities that might lead somewhere you’d feel proud of. 
  * Keep seeking out learning opportunities. 
  * Don’t stress about reaching your potential as early as some of your peers. The truth is, most people don’t reach their potential until their thirties—or fifties. Your twenties are where you’re laying the groundwork, not where you’re fulfilling your life’s purpose. 



When crafting your goals, focus on these three essential elements; these are what lead to a fulfilling adult life:

  1. People (who we spend time with)
  2. Places (where we live)
  3. Things (what we do for work)



Start with whichever element you are certain of, or whichever you know you have a specific goal regarding. From there, create goals addressing the other areas that can accommodate your first priority. For example, maybe you know you’d like to move back to your hometown but you’re not as clear on the other pieces. Start with the hometown piece, then figure out how you can adjust your career to fit, leaving room for a potential relationship.

### Build Uniqueness From Common Parts

Many twenty-somethings get caught up in a particular “should” of their own, namely, that their life should be as unique, original, and interesting as is humanly possible. When you have such a lofty goal but no specific plan to achieve it, you are likely to resist choosing any career out of the fear that doing so would mean giving up your potential uniqueness. Building a career isn’t original, after all. It’s something everyone is expected to do, and doing it can feel like selling out to convention.

However, while committing to a path might feel like a surrender of your specialness, the reality is the opposite: **If you don’t commit to something, your life will end up unexceptional and unoriginal.** Fortunately, you can build yourself a unique and fascinating life out of the same building blocks of experience that everyone else does. Treat the process as you would building a custom-made bike: The parts might be the same ones everyone uses, but the result is an expression of you alone.

Your particular life will be original because of the specific set of experiences you choose to piece together. But until you start collecting the pieces, you can’t form the path.

### Leverage Yourself With a Good Story

Once you’ve committed to the idea of getting some practical experience, another problem emerges. **How do you get a job with no experience to sell yourself with?** How do you set yourself apart from all the other twenty-somethings looking for the same opportunities and sporting the same education-filled, experience-shy resumés? _How do you leverage yourself with no leverage?_

Coming out of college, your resumé is going to look very much like everyone else’s: emphasizing your educational credentials while short on experience. **Fortunately, you can stand out with a good story.** A story is a narrative about your interests and talents. When you’re in your twenties, and life is more about potential than experience, a good story is weighted far more than it will be later in life.

Your story must not be too simple or too complex. Stories that are too simple make you seem inexperienced and immature, but too complex and you seem disorganized. A story shows interviewers a link between your past, present, and future. Prospective employers want to know:

  * What did you do before?
  * How does that relate to what you want to do now?
  * How might both of those elements get you to what you want to do next?



For example, if you worked for your school’s newspaper, examine what you loved about that and how it relates to the position you’re going for now. What was a specific aspect of that project or a unique skill you mastered that will help you achieve your five-year goal?

Interviewers know that a person’s goals for the future will change, and they don’t expect you to have an exact, definite plan. Nor do they expect you to gush that you plan to work at that particular company for the next twenty years because they know that’s unlikely. But they do want to see that you can connect your past to a reasonable vision for the future.
