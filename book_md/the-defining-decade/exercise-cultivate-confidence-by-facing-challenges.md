## Exercise: Cultivate Confidence by Facing Challenges

Real confidence comes from the mastery of skills. You will not feel authentically confident until you’ve overcome challenges and accumulated successes. You’ll become a master of your skills only after devoting about 10,000 hours to practicing them.

* * *

Think of a skill you’ve either already started or would like to start. It can be anything you’re interested in: artistic talent or a business skill, a medical pursuit or a legal endeavor. What challenges might it present to you that will leave you feeling accomplished once you’ve resolved them?

Calculate how long it will take you to reach the 10,000-hour mark of mastery at the rate you currently practice this skill. Figure out how many hours you’ve already dedicated to it. Subtract the second from the first: How much longer do you need to invest in this to become a master of it? Is it a reasonable goal?

If it’s not a reasonable goal, think about why not. How could you alter either the skill or the process to make your goal achievable?

What are some steps you could take to begin mastering this skill?
