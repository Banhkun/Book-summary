## Introduction

Baby Boomers and the generations preceding them often started their adult lives around age 20 by getting married, starting families, establishing careers, and building a home life. The subsequent generations brought with them enormous cultural changes. As birth control became common and women went to work in much greater numbers, people began to put off marriage. Then, a cultural fascination with the youthfulness of the twenties, along with a misunderstanding of the process of “finding oneself,” encouraged people to put off starting a meaningful career.

**People began to think of their twenties as a “free period” between childhood and adulthood, where choices, or the lack thereof, have no lasting impact on a person’s long-term happiness.** The idea that “thirty-is-the-new-twenty” became popular, convincing generations of young adults that they don’t need to start making serious decisions until age thirty, and that their twenties are a time for unencumbered fun.

Unfortunately, this idea is a myth, and its widespread acceptance has led generations of young adults to trivialize and squander their twenties, which, it turns out, is a critical decade for establishing future success and happiness both professionally and personally. As a result, we are now seeing many twenty-somethings who feel lost, as well as thirty- and forty-somethings who regret the time they wasted and now feel left behind.

**The truth is, a good career and a good relationship don’t magically appear at age thirty. To ensure they will happen for you in your thirties and forties, when you finally feel ready for them, you need to set the groundwork in your twenties.**

Meg Jay is a clinical psychologist who specializes in helping twenty-somethings figure out their lives. In _The Defining Decade_ , she offers insights to help you take control of your life and pave the way for future happiness in both work and love. Your decisions today can greatly affect your options tomorrow, and she encourages all twenty-somethings to take these years seriously—even while having fun. She walks the reader through how to find success in work and in love, and discusses why twenty-somethings are uniquely positioned to establish their adulthood because of both timing and biology.
