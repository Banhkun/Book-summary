## Exercise: Create a Timeline

The attitude that life-begins-at-thirty might lead you to postpone getting started on major milestones, and might then lead to a very stressful thirties decade in which you need to do everything at once.

* * *

Brainstorm the important milestones you envision for your future. Include goals from both your professional and personal life. What are the major events you want to happen in the next decade? Grad school? Job? Marriage? Kids?

From your list, pick the three to five goals that are most important to you. Examine them and think about how much lead time you’d need to accomplish each one. Be aware of any that you would prefer not to do simultaneously (for example, would you be comfortable starting a new job while also starting a family?).

Create a timeline. Start with the end: Decide when you’d like to hit your prioritized milestones and work backwards from there to plot out the path to achieving them.
