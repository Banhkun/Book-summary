## Exercise: Make a Scoreboard

There are four steps to creating a player’s scoreboard.

* * *

Recall the WIG and lead measures you came up with in the previous two exercises. Think about what scoreboard format would be most appropriate. Remember, some of the options are trend lines, bar charts, gauges, and andon charts.

Test your scoreboard. Is it simple, visible, complete, and quick to read? What makes it so? Where will you display it?

Imagine you’ve asked your team to physically create the scoreboard. What materials can you give them to build and personalize it?

Consider your team members, and which of them would make good scorekeepers. Remember that the board _must_ be updated at least weekly to be effective. What individual or group do you trust with this responsibility?
