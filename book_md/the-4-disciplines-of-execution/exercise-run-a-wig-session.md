## Exercise: Run a WIG Session

The WIG session has a very specific agenda. Imagine you’re leading a WIG session. Recall your WIG, lead measures, and scoreboard from the previous exercises.

* * *

The first step of a WIG session is to review the scoreboard. Picture your scoreboard—how will you summarize it for your team? (Consider if your lead measures are moving your lag measures, and if the team or individuals are meeting or exceeding the performance standard on the lag measures.) How will you celebrate top performance?

The second step of a WIG session is to report on last week’s commitments. Recall one of the commitments you made in the exercise after Discipline 4 (or invent a new one). Assume you completed it. What did you learn? How do you feel about successful completion?

The third step is to make new commitments for next week. As the leader, you can make a commitment that moves the lead measure, or a commitment to helping the team improve their execution. What is your new commitment? How did you choose it?

What will you do if a team member tells you that they weren’t able to complete their commitment from last week?
