## Ancillary Benefits of 4DX

In addition to helping you execute a wildly important goal, **4DX also increases engagement and creates permanent behavioral change in your team.**

### Engagement

All four of the disciplines increase engagement and morale, not only Discipline 3:

Discipline 1 improves morale because once there’s a WIG, even though people still have to deal with the whirlwind—the daily responsibilities necessary for running an organization—and the WIG’s challenges,**they have clarity and a finish line.**

Discipline 2 improves engagement because looking only at lag measures can be a frustrating end goal with no roadmap. Even if employees understand the WIG and think it’s important, if they don't understand their own contribution, two things keep them from engaging: they don’t know what to do or they don’t think they’re capable. However,**lead measures are concrete, doable, and measurable.**

Discipline 4 helps overcome Patrick Lencioni’s three major reasons for disengagement:

  * **Namelessness.** When people feel like they’re not individually important, they disengage. In a WIG session, every single person speaks. No one is anonymous.
  * **Lack of relevance.** When people feel that their work doesn’t contribute to anything, they disengage. In a WIG session, every person assesses how keeping their commitments moves the lead and lag measures—everyone’s individual contribution is obvious
  * **Lack of quantification.** When people can’t measure their helpfulness, they disengage. In a WIG session, one of the agenda items is a review of the scoreboard.



(Shortform note: To learn more about how to keep your team engaged, read our summaries of Patrick Lencioni’s _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ and _The Ideal Team Player_.)

### Behavioral Changes

There are five stages of this behavioral change:

#### Stage 1: **All aboard**

With the help of your team, complete the following to-dos:

  * Choose the WIG.
  * Choose the lead measures.
  * Create a scoreboard.
  * Ask everyone to reserve a time for the weekly WIG session.



Shortform Example: Tamar leads a team of sailboat riggers. Her team’s WIG is to reduce the number of dropped items by 10% by the end May. Her team’s lead measure is that each team member must make sure 100% of their tools are tied to their harness before climbing aloft. Everyone agrees to meet Monday mornings at 7 a.m.

#### Stage 2: **Go time**

Announce the start of 4DX with a meeting or huddle. As the leader, you have to be very involved at this stage and have some specific to-dos:

  * **Remember that the launch is hard.** It’ll take focus and energy, especially from the leader.
  * **Keep following the 4DX processes** , even if initially, things are rough.
  * **Assess how everyone is reacting to the implementation and manage resistance**. Some people will embrace 4DX more willingly than others and there are three categories:
    * Models—these are your most engaged, highest performers. They immediately get on board with 4DX.
    * Potentials—these people have the ability to become models, but aren’t there yet. They might lack focus, knowledge, or ability to get things done without outside pressure.
    * Resisters—these people try not participate in 4DX, or think 4DX is extra, unnecessary work that won’t have any effect. To manage resisters, the first step is to figure out why they’re resisting. It may because they don’t feel listened to (in which case, hear their concerns), or because they don’t like change or new ideas, are independent, or see 4DX as extra bureaucracy. To get them on board, make 4DX about the team—they are part of a team that’s larger than themselves as an individual, and the team needs them. They’ll also be more on board once they see results.



For example, Tamar’s models were doing the 4DX processes, but she also had potentials who struggled with the change, and resisters who actively disliked it.

#### Stage 3: It’s working

Team members get on board with the 4DX process and change their behavior. As people start to see results from 4DX, they’ll become less resistant and more enthusiastic about the process, and they’ll become accountable.

It will take time to get to this stage, and you’ll spend a while plateauing here. To make sure you progress further, here are some to-dos:

  * At first, don’t worry about seeing results, just focus on achieving your lead measures.
  * In the WIG sessions, strictly follow the agenda—make commitments and be accountable for them.
  * Use the scoreboard.
  * Adjust things if you need to.
  * Give the early adopters extra training and mentoring.
  * Be direct and honest with the resisters and help them if needed.



For example, after a while, Tamar’s team figured out the new routine and dropped objects decreased. As Tamar’s team saw that they were improving the lead measure, they became more excited about the process. The resisters were less resistant.

#### Stage 4: It’s working even better

The team starts actively contributing to improving 4DX and brainstorming performance improvements. They’ve seen results and now they’re more engaged.

To take advantage of this stage, there are some to-dos for the leader specifically:

  * Be open to creative ideas for improving the lead measures (though not all of them may be appropriate).
  * Celebrate successes.
  * Encourage everyone to help each other.
  * Note when the potential’s performance starts to get close to the models’.



For example, Tamar’s team followed the 4DX disciplines for eight weeks and their percentage of dropped items decreased, but not quickly enough to meet the WIG. Tamar was out of ideas, but when she brought up the problem in the WIG meeting, her team members had ideas, such as using particular knots for particular types of tools.

#### Stage 5: **Second nature**

At this point, your team should have achieved the WIG, and as a result, the behaviors it took to get there are now a habit. Everyone’s performance has improved and your team will have a better starting point for the next WIG.

To-dos:

  * Celebrate achieving the WIG.
  * Immediately choose a new WIG.
  * Emphasize that the 4DX process is now the new behavioral standard.
  * Help the middle achievers become top performers.



For example, Tamar’s team achieved their WIG and the behavioral changes that 4DX forced were now habits—now part of the whirlwind. They had a pizza party to celebrate and chose a new WIG.

### Improving Performance at a Team Level

**Typically 20% of your team will be resisters, 60% will be potentials, and 20% will be models** (a “left and loose” normal curve). The potentials, as their name implies, could be better if they were more motivated, more knowledgeable, etc.

**To improve your team’s performance, you want to shift the entire curve to the right** (“right and tight”) by getting the potentials to perform more like the models. Otherwise, you’ll only ever achieve normal, acceptable performance, not greatness. To move the curve, you change and improve your team’s behavior (a result of 4DX).

Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands is a good example. This hospital, like all hospitals, was struggling with an increase in hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). **There is an acceptable limit for HAIs, but Erasmus wasn’t content to be acceptable—they didn’t want anyone to acquire an infection in their hospital.** They moved their curve right and after succeeding, others copied their methods.
