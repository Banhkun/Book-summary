## Exercise: Find Lead Measures

There are four steps to finding lead measures.

* * *

Recall the team WIG you came up with in the previous exercise. Brainstorm a list of possible lead measures that will affect the WIG’s lag measures (X and Y). Remember, lead measures must be both predictable and influenceable.

Think about how the lead measures you came up with above will influence your team WIG. You probably came up with several good ideas—narrow the list down to the most impactful two or three.

Test your top lead measure ideas. Are they maintainable, measurable, impactful? What makes them so? Do team members move the measures, instead of the leader? How do you know?

Write your lead measure in its final form. Start with a simple verb and keep the wording concise and concrete. Consider: are your tracking individual or team performance? Is the timeline daily or weekly? How much and how well should the measure be executed?
