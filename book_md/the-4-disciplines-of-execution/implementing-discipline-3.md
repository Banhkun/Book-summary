## Implementing Discipline 3: Engagement

There are three steps to implementing Discipline 3:

### Step 1: Choose a Scoreboard Format

There are several options for format:

  * **Trend line.** Trend lines are most effective for lag measures. You can see where you’re supposed to be and where you are.
  * **Common gauges** (speedometer, thermometer, and so on). This is most effective for time measures (for example, process speed).
  * **Bar chart.** This is most effective for comparing performance of individuals or teams.
  * **Andon chart.** An andon chart shows symbols that represent the status of measures, such as a smiley face when something is on target, or a sad face when it's not. This type of chart is most useful for displaying lead measures.



**The goal is to get team members invested in the scoreboard, so let them personalize it** by adding details such as photos or other elements that represent the team. For example, engineers might set up flashing lights on their scoreboard. Personalization helps a team take ownership and makes winning about personal pride.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Formatting

Maria and her team used a trend line to show the difference between their goal costs and their current costs:

They added a chart for lead measure 1 (renaming book files) that tracked weekly individual performance:

Lead Measure: Each team member renames files for two books per week.

**Team Member** | **Week 1** | **Week 2** | **Week 3** | **Week 4**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Craig  | 2  | 2  | 4  |   
Emiko  | 2  | 2  | 4  |   
Harriet  | 1  | 2  | 2  |   
May  | 2  | 1  | 2  |   
Raoul  | 1  | 3  | 3  |   
Fred  | 2  | 2  | 3  |   
  
They added a bar graph for lead measure 2 (completing the checklist):

### Step 2: Test the Scoreboard Against the Criteria

Test the scoreboard. If the answers to all of the following questions are yes, the scoreboard passes. Is it:

  * Simple?
  * Visible?
  * Complete?
  * Quick to read?



#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Testing

Maria and her team evaluated the board against the criteria. The board is simple—it has only three parts. The design is visible—the graphs are visually clear and well-labeled. The board is complete—it shows the WIG, lag, and lead measures, and it’s obvious at a glance if the team is winning or losing.

### Step 3: Physically Create the Scoreboard

Ideally, get the team to create the board themselves. The more they work on it, the more engaged they will be. However, if they don’t have discretionary time, you as the leader might need to do the actual creation.

It doesn’t matter what you make the scoreboard from as long as it meets all the criteria in step 2. Poster Board, whiteboard, digital, and so on are all fine.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Creation

Maria’s team made their scoreboard using book design software and printed it poster-size. They decorated it with images from their favorite books.

### Step 4: Update the Scoreboard

**The board must be updated at least weekly.** Choose someone (or multiple people) to be the scorekeeper and make sure they understand it’s an important responsibility. Make sure everyone on the team knows when and how often updates will be posted.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Scorekeeping

Each team member records the number of files they rename per week. Maria trusts them, but periodically audits them to make sure the scores they write on the board match what they’re actually doing. The team only wins if everyone performs.

### Yield

After implementing Discipline 3, you and your team will have created **a player’s scoreboard that meets all the criteria and inspires your people to win.**
