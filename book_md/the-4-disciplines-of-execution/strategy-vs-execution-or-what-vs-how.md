## Strategy vs. Execution—Or What Vs. How

There are two parts to getting results, strategy and execution. **Strategy covers _what_ to do to achieve change (the plan) and execution covers _how_ to actually do it.**

Strategy is the easier of the two and traditional business education (such as MBAs) focuses on it. To learn strategy, you study a single organization in depth. You look at “photographs” (single moments in time) of the company or executive. Then you copy what’s working.

Execution is more like a movie. You have to study it over time, and you have to study many different companies. You look at why things happen. **Execution, at its most powerful, involves behavioral change, and not just your own.** Execution is hard because you have to change the behavior of _other people_. Sometimes this is the behavior of certain people in the organization, sometimes it’s _everyone_ in the organization. And a grudging agreement to temporarily change won’t work—you need people’s commitment and engagement.

### Types of Strategies

There are two main types of strategies, stroke-of-the-pen strategies and behavioral-change strategies:

  * **Stroke-of-the-pen.** These strategies are executed by an order or authorization. They use resources such as planning, money, and so on, and they are almost guaranteed to execute. They sometimes evolve into strategies that require behavioral change
    * For example, they are things like a major investment, adding new staff, or changing a product mix.
  * **Behavioral change.** These strategies are executed by getting people to do something different. The resources are people, and these strategies often fail to execute.
    * For example, they are things like getting a department to use a new software system, getting two teams to collaborate, or reducing costs.



**A study from consulting firm Bain & Company found that about 65% of initiatives required major behavioral changes from front-line staff**, and the managers often fail to consider or plan for this. You’re more likely to hear a manager complaining about the specific employees than how hard it is to get people to change their behavior. Specific employees aren’t the reason strategy fails to execute. The system is the reason, and as a leader, the system is your responsibility.

### Why Execution Fails

There are many reasons you and your company fail to effectively execute your strategies, including “the whirlwind.”

#### The Whirlwind

**The main reason execution fails is because of the _whirlwind_ —day-to-day operations urgently required to keep the organization running.** The whirlwind takes up so much energy and focus that people don’t have energy or time left over to do new things. Urgency (the whirlwind) will beat out importance (new goals) every time. This is why most strategic goals fizzle out rather than blow up.

You’ve probably seen the effects of the whirlwind on your staff. For example, have you ever been explaining a new goal to someone and found them not really listening? While you’re talking, they’re thinking about the day-to-day tasks the conversation is taking them away from, what they might call “their actual work.” A teacher buried under essays to grade and swamped by parent-teacher conferences doesn’t have time to think about long-term goals like improving test scores.

#### Other Factors

Besides the whirlwind, there are some other more goal-specific reasons execution fails:

  * **People don’t know or understand the organization’s goal.**
    * For example, in one of the authors’ initial surveys, they discovered that only 1/7 of employees could successfully name even one of their organization’s top goals. The other 6/7 named a goal that didn’t exist. The lower the person was in the company’s hierarchy, the worse their understanding of the goal.
  * **Lack of passion.**
    * For example, in the same study, the authors learned that only 51% of people were passionate about the goal.
  * **Accountability.**
    * For example, the study found that only 19% of people were held accountable for their work on the organization’s goals.
  * **Lack of actionables.**
    * For example, the study found that 87% of people didn’t know what they were actually supposed to be doing to achieve the goal.



There are more subtle reasons too, such as lack of trust, bad compensation, bad processes, and bad decision making.

### 4DX—A Path to Execution

4DX stands for the **4 d** isciplines of e**x** ecution. 4DX is an operational system containing the disciplines: **focus, leverage, engagement, accountability.** They are principles (not guidelines or practices) that help you not only achieve a particular strategy, but that **create lasting behavioral change, therefore permanently amping up the performance of your team**. 4DX has some ancillary benefits as well, mainly that your employees will become more engaged, and they can apply what they’ve learned from 4DX in the workplace to their personal lives.

**The four disciplines aren’t new ideas or rocket science—they’re natural laws.** Companies such as Weight Watchers have been successfully using similar methods for years. You’re probably already goal-setting, collecting data, creating scoreboards, and holding meetings. However, 4DX takes you beyond _understanding_ principles to actually _implementing_ them. 4DX prescribes a specific, particular way of applying the four disciplines that should earn you the kind of results you’ve never been able to achieve before.

The authors researched the disciplines, experienced trial and error, and have offered the following list of research to assure you that 4DX is well-tested and will work in any country or field:

  * Surveyed 13,000 people internationally
  * Surveyed 17 different industry groups
  * Internal assessments of 500 companies
  * Survey almost 300,000 leaders and team members
  * Worked with people in 1,500+ implementations



Remember that the disciplines are laws of nature. **It doesn’t matter if you like them or even think they’re necessary—they will act on you.** You may as well learn to use them.

**4DX is _not_ designed for calming the whirlwind—it is designed to help you execute strategic goals while still _maintaining_ the whirlwind.**

There are 3 things to keep in mind while reading this book:

  * **The disciplines are easy to understand but hard to put into practice.** They take a lot of effort over a long period of time. The end goal has to be wildly important to merit the commitment. **When you achieve the end goal though, you’re not just achieving that specific goal; you’re training your organization to achieve more goals using the same methods.**
  * **The disciplines are counterintuitive.** Some of the things you’ll be asked to do will feel unnatural, or run against your instincts or what you’ve always believed about execution.
  * **The disciplines work in tandem.** Using only one might help, but they’re most powerful when used together as they’re interrelated. You must do them in the order they appear.



(Shortform note: _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ is organized into three parts. Part 1 defines the disciplines, Part 2 describes team implementation, and Part 3 describes organization implementation and some miscellany. For clarity and concision, we have rearranged the information so that the definition of a discipline is followed by the team implementation. We have omitted a section about 4DX software—learn more about it here.)
