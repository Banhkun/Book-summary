## Implementing Discipline 4: Accountability

This chapter illustrates the implementation of Discipline 4 by taking us through the agenda of an example WIG session.

### Agenda Item 1: Review the Scoreboard

The leader starts the WIG session by reviewing the scoreboard. This includes:

  * Stating whether the team is above or below the target for the team WIG.
  * Stating whether the team is above or below the targets on the lead measures.
  * Congratulating the team.
  * Congratulating the top performers.
  * Emphasizing the need to consistently meet and maintain the targets, even if everything’s already on track



#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Scoreboard Review

Maria might say something like, “Congratulations to Craig and Emiko, who both exceeded this week’s lead measures by renaming four book’s files this week.”

### Agenda Items 2 & 3—Leaders

The leader completes both steps 2 and 3 before the team members.

**Agenda Item 2: Account for Last Week’s Commitments**

The leader reports on her own commitments, in first person, by:

  * Reminding everyone of her commitments.
  * Stating whether she completed, exceeded, or failed to meet her target. 
  * Sharing anything she learned that might help her team members.



**Agenda Item 3: New Commitments**

Immediately after the leader has reported on her commitments (don’t switch people yet), she states her commitments for next week.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Leader

Maria might say something like, “Last week I committed to getting approval to purchase preflight software. I got the approval. Next week, I commit to running two 20-minute training sessions on the software.”

### Agenda Items 2 & 3—Team Members

**Agenda Item 2: Account for Last Week’s Commitments**

The leader then gives each of her team members a chance to report on their commitments. They cover the same material:

  * Reminding everyone of her commitments.
  * Stating whether she completed, exceeded, or failed to meet her target. 
  * Sharing anything she learned that might help her team members.



If someone hasn’t fulfilled a commitment, the leader addresses it. She follows these steps:

  * Demonstrates respect for both the team members and the whirlwind.
  * Reminds the team member that commitments have to be fulfilled, no matter what else is going on, because their actions affect the whole team.
  * Asks the team member to complete both the missed commitment and whatever they choose for next week’s commitment in the next week. This gives the team member the opportunity to recover, and Maria an opportunity to demonstrate her commitment to 4DX.



**Agenda Item 3: New Commitments**

Team members state what their commitments will be for the next week. Anyone who missed last week’s commitment must do both that commitment and new commitments before the next WIG session.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Team Members

Emiko might say something like, “Last week I committed to having a 15-minute phone conversation with the color specialist at our printer in Malaysia. I learned some photoshop tips that will help us improve the brightness of our images, so we won’t have to make changes to dull-looking photos at press. This week, I’ll have a 15-minute conversation with the greyscale expert at our printer in India.”

#### How to Choose Commitments

As the leader, you have two roles at the commitment-choosing stage—you need to choose your own commitments and guide your team members in choosing theirs.

**To come up with commitments, brainstorm _one or two_ specific things that affect the lead measures.** Don’t ask yourself what the most important thing you can do that week is, because you’ll come up with something in the whirlwind.

The commitments don’t have to address anything urgent. They don’t have to be new ideas—they might be things you’re well aware you should be doing; you only haven’t been able to do them because of the whirlwind. Here are some things to consider when deciding on commitments:

  * **Focus.** Everyone should choose only one to two commitments.
  * **Importance.** Commitments should be high impact and make a big difference
  * **Personal.** Commitments are things _you_ will do, not things you will commit other people to do. When working with others, commit only to the parts you will be doing yourself.
  * **Timeliness.** Commitments must be short enough to be completed within the following week. If a multiweek commitment is necessary, commit only to the parts that you can do in the next week. The week timeline is very important—it creates urgency that can’t be eaten by the whirlwind. Additionally, the commitment must also produce results within a short period of time. If you’re not going to see the impact of the commitment on the lag measure in the near future, it doesn’t fit the weekly schedule.
    * For example, don’t accept “I’m making progress” as a result in a WIG session.
  * **Effect on the WIG.** The commitments must directly move the lead and lag measures. No whirlwind commitments!
  * **Specificity.** It’s hard to be accountable for something vague. Commitments should contain what you’ll do, when you’ll do it, and what the outcome should be.



As the leader, you have an additional source for commitment ideas—the “system.” **The most effective commitments for leaders tend to be things that improve the _team’s_ execution** (versus commitments that directly influence the lead measure). Leaders should always consider commitments around:

  * **Training.** You’ll always have a team member who needs training or to be reengaged. When coming up with a commitment to training, be specific: who and what skill
  * **Engagement.** Talk to team members about their performance and ways to improve it. They probably have good ideas you can implement, and in addition to the team doing better, the person who came up with the idea feels valued
  * **Recognition and leading by example.** Figure out who your top performers are and celebrate them in front of their colleagues. Ask your top performers to help the other people on the team.
  * **“Clearing the path.”** As a leader you should always be offering help. Often you have the authority to help in a way no one else can.
