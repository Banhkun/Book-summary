## Exercise: Focus a Conversation With Questions

We’ve learned that asking questions can help us differentiate between a distracting issue and a primary challenge. Now, we can practice applying Stanier’s questions to difficult conversations.

* * *

Think about a recent time when you had an unproductive conversation with someone. What was the situation? Describe what obstacle(s) made that conversation confusing or even irritating. (For example, was the conversation focused on blaming someone who wasn’t present?)

Which of Stanier’s questions could you have asked to have gotten the conversation back on track? (For example, “What’s the main challenge you’re dealing with?”)

How do you think asking those questions might have changed the outcome of your conversation?
