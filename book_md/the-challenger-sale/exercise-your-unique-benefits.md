## Exercise: Your Unique Benefits

In Commercial Teaching as a sales rep, you must connect the unique insights you’re giving the customer to the things your company does better than any other (your solutions). Yet many companies have trouble naming their unique benefits.

* * *

Identify your company’s unique benefits by answering the question, “Why should our customers buy from us over anyone else?”

Ask a coworker the same question and compare lists. Where do you agree and disagree?

Think about the words you used to describe the unique benefits. If you used common buzzwords like “industry leader, solutions-oriented, innovative, top, and unique,” then you’re not describing unique benefits. What more specific words could you use to differentiate your company?
