## Exercise: Taking Control

Many sales reps, especially Relationship Builders, hesitate to challenge customers’ thinking or push back when they demand price concessions because they don’t want to seem aggressive or hurt the relationship. However, taking control is an essential Challenger behavior.

* * *

Think about a recent sales conversation in which you felt an uncomfortable tension. How did you respond? Why did you respond that way?

Who controlled the conversation from that point and what was the outcome?

Have you had a situation where you conceded more than you wanted to, and then felt bad about it afterward? What was the situation? Why did you concede in the moment?

How could you prepare differently for your next sales conversation so that you feel confident and in control?
