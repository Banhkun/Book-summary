## Principle 2: Be Inspirational

The second principle of outstanding leadership is to _be inspirational_. When you inspire people, you ignite their passion, which motivates and excites them. People are naturally drawn to leaders who have a vision of a better world because they want to feel like they are a part of something important.

These two guidelines will help you inspire your team:

  * Guideline 3: Envision a positive version of the future that includes exciting and bold possibilities.
  * Guideline 4: Get others on board. Help them see the possibilities and opportunities of your vision. 



### Guideline 3: Envision a Positive Future

As we mentioned earlier, people expect a leader to be forward-thinking. A forward-thinking leader creates a positive vision—one that engages people’s imaginations and emotions—and then works to make it happen.

You must have a specific, purposeful vision of where you're going in order to move forward: **You can’t judge what path to take if you don’t know your destination.**

#### See the Potential of the Future

Envisioning a positive future starts by seeing the _potential_ of the future. A specific vision of the future gives you a theme for your career or life: a guiding principle on which you can base your decisions.

Often, visionary leaders have difficulty pinpointing where their visionary thinking comes from, chalking it up to intuition or a gut feeling. While these sources of inspiration are vague and hard to quantify, fortunately, there are specific steps you can take to prompt visionary thinking:

  * Examine your past.
  * Mind the present.
  * Scout the future.
  * Connect with your passion.



##### Examine Your Past

To properly see the future, first reflect on your history. When you look to the past, you better understand how you arrived at where you are now, and that in turn can inform your future decisions.

  * If you’ve made mistakes in the past, studying them will prevent you from repeating them. 
  * If you made wise choices, reflecting on them will help you know what to do in similar situations. 



Examining your past also helps you see how your _values_ have shaped your life—either how your actions have been influenced by your values or have run counter to them. This can help you reassess whether you're acting in accordance with those values or whether you need to change your behavior to honor them better.

##### Mind the Present

In order to envision a better future, be fully aware of your present—of trends, patterns, strengths and weaknesses in your organization, and challenges and conditions outside your organization. When you pay attention to your current world, you can better anticipate what’s to come.

Strive to notice things outside of your immediate reach of attention:

  * **Examine your workplace and community:** Notice what people are doing that they weren’t doing five years ago: what they’re using or no longer using, how they’re working, what looks different today in your workplace or community. 
  * **Listen to your team members:** Notice their topics of conversation: what they say they need, what’s preventing them from doing their jobs, what they want to see changed. 



It can be difficult to be consciously mindful of your surroundings because it’s easy to get caught up in the details and pressures of daily life. To prevent this, be proactive about becoming mindful: Set aside time every day to pause your activities and take stock of the world around you. This will allow you to spot larger trends and see opportunities you might otherwise have missed.

##### Scout the Future

As a leader, your job is to think about the next project and the one after that (and after that).

  * Be on the lookout for developments in your workplace, industry, or the wider world around you. Changes in technology, economics, arts, demographics, and politics, as well as changes within your organization, can affect your vision.
  * Seek out information about trends and innovations through news feeds, podcasts, documentaries, and the like. 



In scouting the future,**look for opportunities and threats.** Being aware of both will allow you to lead your organization more successfully and will encourage people to follow you more enthusiastically.

##### Connect With Your Passion

To envision the future, connect with your deepest passions. Your passion will drive your vision because it will point you in the direction you want to go and influence **what vision of the future you're willing to work for, suffer for, and sacrifice for.**

No one else can tell you what your passion is—your passion and purpose are unique to you. Therefore, just as you spent time clarifying your values, also take time to clarify your passions. Once you have a clear idea of what will give your life meaning, you can effectively pass along your enthusiasm to others.

#### Case Study: Andrew Rzepa and Trainee Solicitors Group

Andrew Rzepa was the committee chair of lawyer trainees in Manchester, England, when a close affiliate group, Trainee Solicitors Group, arranged to hold a conference in his city. Even though he was not an official organizer for the event, he decided to make the conference a success and took the initiative to get others on board.

When enrollment for the event plateaued at 75 people, Andrew appealed to his colleagues to help boost attendance. He spoke to them passionately about what it would mean for their local organization to have this event be successful, and how good it would feel if they made that happen. He saw a specific possibility: He set a goal of increasing attendance to 300 and asked the other committee members if they were willing to personally commit to helping realize this goal. In the end, he successfully energized his colleagues and the final event attendance was 316 trainees.

### Guideline 4: Get Others on Board

Once you’ve created a solid, specific, and inspiring vision, inspire your teammates to be equally excited. If you engage team members in your vision, **not only will they be more excited, but they’ll also feel more secure in you and your organization, especially during times of change.**

  * Change can be unnerving, but your team members will have more confidence in your ability to navigate challenges if they feel you have a clear vision. 
  * It’s analogous to driving through fog versus driving on a clear day: The drive is less scary for your passengers when they can see down the road. 



To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Seek input.
  2. Be unique.
  3. Emphasize meaningfulness.
  4. Illustrate your vision.
  5. Appeal to emotions.
  6. Be energetic.
  7. Be positive.



#### 1\. Seek Input

To engage your team in your vision, you need more than _your_ vision: You need to incorporate _their_ visions as well.

  * **No one wants to merely be told what to do—people are excited and energized when they’re able to contribute to the _development_ of a strategy,** as well as its implementation. 
  * When people feel like they’re participating, they feel ownership of the strategy, which makes them more invested in its outcome. 
  * When people feel _heard_ , they feel _valued_. 



By fully listening to others, you can learn what drives them, and what you can incorporate into your shared vision.

  * Allow your people to voice their thoughts, desires, and concerns so they feel heard. 
  * Ask probing questions and make it clear that you’re open to ideas other than your own. 
  * Be prepared to lose arguments in pursuit of the common good. 



#### 2\. Be Unique

To engage your team in your vision, **help them to see how their efforts will make a _uniquely_ positive difference in the world. **A compelling vision shows people how they can be different from others, which translates into higher levels of commitment and enthusiasm.

  * When people feel they’re following a unique vision, they have a sense of pride. 
  * They feel more enthusiastic than they would if following an ordinary vision—no one gets excited about doing the same thing as everyone else. 
  * Emphasizing uniqueness also allows people to feel they can express their own unique vision or purpose within that larger purpose. 



#### 3\. Emphasize Meaningfulness

**People want, more than anything else, to feel a sense of purpose and for their lives to have meaning.** This is ultimately more important than making money. Therefore, focus others’ attention on the _greater cause_ behind your vision. People commit more readily and wholeheartedly to _causes_ than to _strategies_.

Show your team how their actions in your organization matter outside the organization. For example, emphasize how your company or division helps your customers live their best lives, or solves problems for clients that resonate throughout the industry.

#### 4\. Illustrate Your Vision

People are visual and respond to image-based words more strongly than to abstract concepts. Images evoke feelings, and image-based words inspire. For example, a study found that when researchers described a line of toys with visual descriptions such as, “will make wide-eyed kids laugh,” participants reacted more strongly than to the more abstract “will be enjoyed by all of our customers.”

Translate your vision into tangible, actionable, visual, and specific terms that your team members can readily recognize and visually imagine. **Use image-based concepts to paint a clear picture of what your vision will look, feel, and sound like.** By seeing it in their mind’s eye, your team members will be able to generate their own enthusiasm for your vision, which will mirror yours.

For example, when the Australian branch of tool manufacturer Hilti Corporation wanted to excite its workforce, its management came up with a slogan that allowed workers to picture their common purpose: “We’re Painting Australia Red.” This was a simple and effective way to envision every worksite and garage in the country equipped with items in Hilti’s signature color, and it increased employees’ enthusiasm.

##### Use Symbolic Words

Additionally, to bring your vision to life, **use metaphors, symbols, stories, and quotes that allow your team members to hear, see, and recognize what you’re envisioning.** Using a metaphor to frame your vision can help others understand it better.

People use metaphors all the time in their everyday language—sports metaphors, war metaphors, machine metaphors, and so on. You can use a common metaphor like these to emphasize your point. For instance, you might compare your organization to a farmer’s market, offering fresh items that change according to the seasons or demand, if that fits with the purpose of your organization, even if your organization has nothing to do with food.

##### Avoid Loaded Words

Be aware also of the connotations of your words, in addition to their official definitions. **Certain words evoke images that can associate your organization or concept with specific things, whether or not you mean to.**

For example, in one study, researchers had two groups of people play a game. Both played the same game using the same rules, but one group was told the name of the game was “The Community Game,” while the other group was told the name was “The Wall Street Game.” The results were striking: Of those playing the Community Game, 70% played cooperatively. Of those playing the Wall Street Game, only 30% played cooperatively, and even then, only at first—once they saw others weren’t playing cooperatively, they stopped cooperating as well. This illustrates the power specific words can have over people’s interpretations of their world.

#### 4\. Appeal to Emotions

If you can get other people to feel emotions about your vision, you’ll have much greater success bringing them on board. **Emotions inspire excitement and also help with memory.** If people connect emotionally with your vision, they’ll remember it in more detail for a longer period of time.

You can create an emotional connection in several ways:

  * **Use stories,** as we discussed above. Additionally, use examples to illustrate your stories. Concrete examples have been shown to elicit stronger emotions than general statements. For example, showing people a picture of a starving child from a poor country will prompt many more people to donate to charity than will the statement “food shortages are affecting more than three million children.”
  * **Use physical props to demonstrate your message.** Physically involving people in your message will connect with their emotions much more directly. In one example, trainers who were helping volunteers understand how hospice patients and their families deal with loss asked the volunteers to write down on index cards things that meant a lot to them and that they’d be upset to lose—anything from family members to pets to experiences like taking a hike. The trainers then randomly took cards from some of the volunteers, symbolizing a loss of those things. The effect was striking: Some volunteers even started crying, and they understood on a deeper level what their patients were experiencing. 



#### 5\. Be Energetic

People won’t follow a leader who’s only mildly enthusiastic about their vision. **Leaders need to radiate vast amounts of energy in order to inspire energy in their team.**

You can portray energy through the way you talk and move. People who are perceived as _charismatic_ behave more animatedly than others. They:

  * Smile more.
  * Speak faster.
  * Pronounce words clearly.
  * Move their heads and hands more.



#### 6\. Be Positive

You’ll be more likely to engage others with a positive attitude. As a leader, you’ll need to bring your constituents through difficult times with optimism—to inspire hope when your team faces obstacles or setbacks. A large part of this will come from making it clear you believe in the abilities of others, so that difficulties can make them feel empowered rather than discouraged.

All projects and organizations will face challenges, and if you help your people approach these challenges with a confident attitude, they’ll meet them better. If you instead, have a negative attitude or convey anger, disappointment, or exasperation when your team has difficulties, people will be less willing to seek you out in times of trouble. The resulting disconnect between you and your team can allow problems to worsen before they start to be addressed.

#### Case Study: Martin Luther King, Jr.

Martin Luther King, Jr.’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech is an example of how to successfully appeal to people’s values, emphasize meaningfulness, appeal to emotions, use symbolic words, and paint a positive vision of the future. In doing so, King got people behind his message, moving his vision from “my vision” to “our vision.”

  * He appealed to common interests and shared values like family, religion, and country.
  * He spoke of specific elements that he envisioned in a potential future.
  * He spoke with emotion and passion.
  * He used uplifting, inspirational words and phrases.
