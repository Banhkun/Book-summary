## Introduction to Leadership

_The Leadership Challenge_ is a field guide for becoming the kind of leader that other people want to follow. International bestselling authors and longtime research partners James Kouzes and Barry Posner have compiled thousands of case studies and millions of responses to surveys over decades and used them to distill leadership into five overall principles. Each principle is supported by two guidelines (for 10 guidelines in total) that offer concrete steps for how to achieve outstanding leadership.

The five principles of leadership and their associated guidelines are based on two primary understandings:

**1\. Leadership is a relationship** between those who lead and those who follow. A leader isn't a leader without a team, and even the greatest leaders don’t achieve their goals by themselves, but instead must enlist the help of a team. **Therefore, when you work to develop your leadership, focus primarily on developing your relationships with your team members.**

A relationship between a leader and a constituent must be a positive, respectful, and mutually beneficial one. You can’t force people to follow you; they must do so willingly. An employee who doesn’t believe in your mission or your leadership might work for you for a while, but if they don’t truly want to, they’ll eventually move on to another organization. Additionally, while they’re working for you, if they don’t truly want to be there, they're unlikely to put in a great effort.

**2\. Leadership is a skill** —one that can be learned, practiced, and mastered by anyone willing to put in the effort. People sometimes mistakenly believe that a person is either born with leadership skills or isn’t. However, **leadership is a set of behaviors, beliefs, and processes that can be learned and practiced by anyone.**

To explore these concepts in more depth:

  * We’ll begin our discussion with an overview of leadership and what makes a great leader. 
  * We’ll introduce the Five Principles of Outstanding Leadership.
  * We’ll explore each principle and its associated guidelines in detail.
  * We’ll conclude our discussion with an examination of how you can apply these principles to your own life.



(Shortform note: Because we’ve moved through each principle and guideline in order, we’ve eliminated chapter numbers in our summary because they were redundant.)

### Four Characteristics of a Great Leader

Since the mid-1980s, the authors of this book have conducted studies asking people in both business and government what qualities they value in a leader, and what would make them willing to follow someone’s leadership. They’ve found that consistently, over time and around the globe, people most often name four specific characteristics. People want leaders who are:

**1\. Honest:** More than any other characteristic, people list honesty as an important quality of a leader. Other words they use to describe honesty include “truthful,” “ethical,” and “authentic.” Honesty is considered a personal quality more than a professional one, and its importance illustrates that people want to follow leaders they can personally respect and identify with (if you follow a leader who’s viewed as dishonest, your own reputation gets associated with dishonesty).

**2\. Competent:** The second-most-often cited quality is competence. People want their leader to be capable, effective, and experienced; no one wants to follow someone who may lead them into failure. Leaders aren’t expected to be experts in everything, but they should have a solid understanding of their business and their organization—its structure, procedures, culture, and people.

**3\. Inspiring:** The emotional energy that a leader puts forward will infect her whole team. A leader must be able to communicate her vision in such a way that other people understand her passion and believe that it will improve lives. If she is positive, excited, and energetic, her team will be too. If she shows little emotion, or displays anxiety, uncertainty, or discouragement, her team won’t feel enthusiastic.

**4\. Forward-thinking:** People want their leaders to have a clear idea of where they’re headed. They want them to envision a better future and work toward it, rather than merely living with the current status quo. Leaders are not expected to be able to predict the future, but rather, should have a meaningful vision and plan for where they want their organization to head.

**In general, then, people want to feel their leaders are truthful, know what they’re doing, have a positive attitude, and have a sense of direction.**

#### It Adds Up to Credibility

These characteristics correspond closely with another measure: what makes people feel an information source is _credible_ , whether that’s a newspaper, doctor, business leader, or politician. Researchers have found that people will judge a source to be credible if it has these qualities:

  * Trustworthiness
  * Expertise
  * Dynamism



Notice how closely these terms hew to the top three characteristics listed above of good leaders: honesty, competence, and inspiration. In other words, when people see these qualities of leadership, they judge that leader to be _credible_.

**Credibility is crucial to leadership because if people don’t believe in you, they won’t believe in your mission, message, or strategy.** Leaders therefore must protect their credibility so that they can inspire loyalty, enthusiasm, and effort from their employees, customers, and investors.

When researchers ask people what exactly it means for a leader to be credible, the responses vary in wording but typically are some version of “Leaders do what they say they’ll do.” Therefore, as a leader, when you promise something, you must follow through on it or risk losing your credibility.

#### Secondary Leadership Qualities

Other qualities of leadership that study respondents listed included being supportive, fair-minded, courageous, cooperative, and imaginative. The differences between what people prioritized in a leader were often dependent on who those people were, and what leadership skills their particular jobs called for. For example:

  * People in health care organizations more often listed _caring_ than did people in other industries.
  * Military personnel more often listed _loyalty_ than others. 
  * Academics valued _intelligence_ more highly. 
  * Older respondents named _self-controlled_ more often than younger respondents did.



### Five Principles of Outstanding Leadership

This brings us to the Five Principles of Outstanding Leadership, which will enable you to develop the qualities of leadership that create success. The five principles of outstanding leadership are:

  1. **Set an example:** Take personal responsibility, and set an example of the behavior you expect of others.
  2. **Be inspirational:** Provide an inspiring vision, and see that your vision is shared among your team so that everyone is on board and motivated.
  3. **Challenge the status quo:** Challenge the way things are done, meet adversity head on, and take advantage of opportunities to lead your organization to new places. 
  4. **Empower others to act:** Engage other people to join you on your quest. Foster collaboration and trust. 
  5. **Lead with heart:** Genuinely care about your team, and let them know it. 



Leaders who consistently employ these principles are more effective than those who don’t. Studies show that of people working under leaders who use these practices, 96% self-report feeling highly engaged with their work and the organization. In contrast, of those working under leaders who rarely use these practices, less than 5% report feeling highly engaged.

Leaders using these principles find not only that their team members are more engaged and committed, but that they also lead their organizations to greater financial success. Researchers found that over a five-year period, companies led according to these five principles had 18 times the net income growth and three times the stock price increase as companies whose leaders didn’t subscribe to these principles.

We’ll review each of these principles one by one, and their accompanying guidelines.
