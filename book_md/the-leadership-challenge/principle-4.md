## Principle 4: Empower Others to Act

Now that we’ve discussed how to challenge the status quo, we’ll move on to how to encourage, enable, and empower others to act as well. There are two overall guidelines to achieve this:

  * Guideline 7: Foster collaboration.
  * Guideline 8: Strengthen others’ sense of self-determination and competence.



### Guideline 7: Foster Collaboration

The success of your project and your leadership depends on a sense of shared creation and shared responsibility. Consistently, research shows that leaders who cultivate cooperative relationships in their team are viewed as highly effective and inspire the highest levels of engagement.

To foster collaboration among your team:

  1. Build a climate of trust.
  2. Promote relationships.



#### 1\. Build a Climate of Trust

Trust is integral to human relationships and to leadership. Trust is needed in every type of relationship within a team:

  * **From leader to team:** You must trust the efforts of other people or you’ll end up as merely a manager or supervisor, micromanaging everyone’s work, instead of a leader. 
  * **From team to leader:** If your team doesn’t trust you, they won’t follow you. They won’t believe in your vision or put in extra effort to make it come true. 
  * **Among team members:** Your team members must trust that they can express their thoughts openly and honestly and if they fail at a task, their teammates won’t judge them.



Studies show that people who are trusting are happier and more psychologically well-adjusted than those who see the world with suspicion. **Higher levels of trust strongly predict higher organizational performance across a range of markers, including customer loyalty, market share, ethical behavior, and profit growth** —for example, the stock performance of companies considered trustworthy is routinely 1.8 times higher than the S&P 500. Therefore, building a trusting team is a foundational step in your success.

Create a climate of trust by following these practices:

  * Be the first to trust.
  * Show empathy.
  * Share knowledge. 



##### Be the First to Trust

Trust must be reciprocal; your team won’t trust in you if you don’t trust in them, and as the leader, you must be the first to demonstrate trust. Trust is contagious, so once you demonstrate it, others are likely to reciprocate. Distrust is contagious, too, so the reverse is also true: If you show that you don’t trust others, they’re unlikely to trust you.

You can’t force others to trust you, but you can earn their trust by respecting them and their abilities.

  * Allow your team to do the work you assigned them without close oversight. 
  * Encourage them to solve problems on their own. 
  * Empower them to make decisions and to use their expertise in the way they feel best. 



Also demonstrate trust by being open and honest about your goals, concerns, and values. When you reveal this kind of internal information about yourself, people usually view your motivations as more sincere, and they’re likely to respond with similar openness. For example, if you're working on a new project, you might let your team know that this is the first time you’re leading something like this, and that you’ll need their efforts and expertise to help you. This kind of honesty will encourage them to trust your motives and leadership.

##### Show Empathy

**As jobs become more automated, the real competitive advantage of workers—especially leaders—will be their ability to foster strong relationships.** The best leaders will be the ones people see as a partner with whom they want to work, instead of as someone merely issuing orders.

To show empathy for others, treat them respectfully.

  * When you treat people respectfully, you show them that you accept them for who they are. In doing so, you allow them to feel valued, which motivates them to work harder for you. 
  * It also encourages them to speak freely to you about challenges, with an understanding that you'll be constructive in your responses. This ensures that they deal with problems proactively.



**One of the best ways to show respect for someone is to actively listen to them**. Active listening is more than just hearing—it’s engaging in a conversation centered around their thoughts and concerns that makes them feel valued. When you listen actively, you:

  * Ask questions that probe and result in insights.
  * Offer suggestions.
  * Listen to ideas nonjudgmentally so people feel comfortable bouncing thoughts off of you. 



##### Share Knowledge

When you share your knowledge and insights with your team, you reassure them of your competence, which increases their trust in you. Conversely, if you keep information to yourself, they’ll feel you’re protecting your “turf” and looking out for your own interests over their interests, which decreases their trust in you.

Encourage your team members to share information with each other, as well, as this will similarly increase their trust in each other.

#### 2\. Facilitate Relationships

Because people work together best when they trust each other, encourage and foster healthy, trusting relationships among your team members. To do this, follow these practices:

  * Develop common goals and roles.
  * Encourage reciprocity.
  * Reward joint effort.
  * Encourage face-to-face interactions.



##### Develop Common Goals

The first step to encouraging strong bonds is to enlist your team in a common purpose. Shared goals unite people in cooperative efforts, in which everyone feels that their success contributes to everyone else’s success, and that no one can be successful unless everyone works together.

Structure your team’s roles and responsibilities so that their individual objectives contribute to a larger objective, and make sure they see how the two are connected. This can also be effective in reconciling people who don’t particularly like each other: Assigning two people who don’t get along to work together can help them get past their distrust once they’re working toward a common purpose.

##### Encourage Reciprocity

Reciprocity is the basis of trusting relationships: the belief that others will treat you as you treat them. People like to think that if they help someone, that person will return the favor at some point in the future. **This belief in reciprocity is so fundamental to our expectations of relationships that all moral and ethical codes, religious or otherwise, contain some version of it.**

If people don’t reciprocate someone else’s efforts, they end up in an unbalanced relationship where one person feels taken advantage of and the other feels superior. Cooperation is difficult in such relationships. This dynamic has been demonstrated in studies where two parties faced a series of challenges that allowed them to either cooperate or compete with one another. Researchers found that the participants who were most successful were the ones who chose to cooperate because their willingness to do so encouraged others to cooperate in return.

Encourage your team members to be available to each other to help whenever any of them needs it. Additionally, model reciprocity by going out of your way to repay favors for those who have helped you.

##### Reward Joint Effort

Large, ambitious goals can’t be accomplished by one person alone, and cooperative teams produce better results than competitive teams, so **when talking about the success of any project your team is working on, emphasize the collective results rather than individual results.** This will encourage your team to see that there’s a greater payoff in working together than working alone.

The importance of collaboration was demonstrated in a series of studies that looked at what happened when teams were rewarded either for being the highest-performing team or for having the highest-performing individuals. The teams who were rewarded for their collective effort finished their tasks more slowly but more accurately, while the teams rewarded for having high-performing individuals finished more quickly but made more mistakes **because team members withheld information from one another.**

##### Encourage Face-to-Face Interactions

Getting to know other people is important in establishing trusting and collaborative relationships. Having in-person face time is an essential part of this process. People don’t feel they truly know each other until they’ve seen each other—without a face to put a name to, they don’t seem real.

Therefore, encourage in-person meetings whenever feasible. You can accomplish this through online webcams if your workforce is dispersed, as happens in global companies. In virtual meetings, encourage participants to turn their cameras on, so others have more than just a name and a voice to go by. This will make people feel more comfortable with each other and more ready to express their ideas.

Face time also encourages collaboration because it makes people feel that their interactions with the other person will be ongoing. When people expect to interact with another person again in the future, they’re more likely to cooperate in the present. When they actually see or meet someone, as opposed to merely communicating electronically, like through email, they regard that relationship as one they’ll encounter again, and they’ll put more effort into the relationship.

### Guideline 8: Strengthen Your Team Members

**The real job of a leader isn't to seek power for themselves but to empower others to lead themselves.** When you go beyond leading and show people how to lead themselves, you become more than a leader—you become a coach, helping others to help themselves. Too often, people mistakenly assume that the mark of a leader is wielding power over others, but paradoxically, when you give your power away, you actually become a more powerful leader yourself.

Leaders who empower people end up with a stronger team:

  * Team members who feel more accountable for their success or failure feel more invested in the project.
  * Sharing your power with others increases trust in the group, as team members feel respected and valued.



To strengthen your team:

  1. Build a sense of self-determination.
  2. Develop competence and confidence.



#### 1\. Build a Sense of Self-Determination

People who feel strong and capable under your leadership will perform well. People who feel empowered feel that:

  * They’re in control of their jobs and their futures. 
  * They have discretion as to how to handle situations. 
  * They’re involved in key planning decisions.
  * Important information is shared with them.
  * Their supervisors encourage them, coach them, and invest resources in them. 



Conversely, people who feel weak and incompetent will underperform, feel disengaged, and might even be looking for opportunities to leave an organization. When people feel powerless, they feel that:

  * No one listens to their ideas or opinions.
  * They have no input into important decisions.
  * Their managers argue or correct them in front of others. 
  * Their managers don’t support them with resources, time, information, training, or encouragement.
  * They’re held accountable for others’ mistakes but have no authority to hold those others accountable. 



To empower your team, foster a culture where you expect input. Make every team member feel they’re expected to contribute to projects in a meaningful way by giving ideas and helping with strategy. This will help them see themselves as integral and valued parts of the team and will give them confidence to take initiative.

In addition:

  * Allow for choices.
  * Increase accountability.



##### Allow for Choices

**People feel in control of their own lives when they have the power to make choices about how to solve problems.** In contrast, they feel trapped when they feel their choices are made for them.

This has a significant effect on how people feel about working for an organization: Studies show that when people feel their leaders frequently give them freedom to decide how to do their own work, 80% report feeling proud to work for that organization. However, at even slightly lower levels of autonomy, that feeling of pride goes away—of those reporting their leaders “fairly often” allowed them freedom to make decisions, only 16% reported pride in the organization.

While there is some risk in allowing people to make important decisions, the benefits typically outweigh the potential drawbacks, because your team will end up consisting of stronger individuals.

  * When people are able to make choices, they feel more personally responsible for a project and are less likely to blame their supervisors or teammates if things go wrong. 
  * Further, they’re more likely to take initiative to fix a problem if things do go wrong, not only because they’ll feel empowered to, but also because they’ll feel the project reflects on them more directly, and will therefore want it to succeed. 



One example of a company that empowered employees was the Bay Club Santa Clara, a gym in California. After a reorganization, it allowed its trainers to set their own monthly goals for hours worked, which allowed them to take responsibility for recruiting clients and structuring their own work. As a result, trainers felt they were each running their own businesses within the larger organization, increasing their sense of control. As a result, they put more effort into their positions: Billable hours increased and the trainers reported feeling more committed to the organization.

##### Increase Accountability

To increase your team members’ sense of accountability—their feeling of responsibility and their desire to proactively take care of their tasks—**foster a sense of ownership.** This doesn’t mean physical or legal ownership, but rather, psychological ownership, **whereby a person feels invested in a project so that they want to go beyond their defined roles to ensure the project’s success.**

Increased accountability has benefits for both you and your team:

  * When you lead people who are taking responsibility for their roles, you're free to focus on other aspects of leadership, such as expanding your influence or securing resources to help your team. 
  * When people feel that their teammates are competently taking care of their areas of expertise and are accountable for them, they don’t feel the need to infringe on anyone else’s role; they feel secure in the progress of the project and trusting of their team. 



You can increase your team members’ accountability and sense of ownership by giving them something concrete to control. For example:

  * Ensure that everyone has a customer—someone they answer to, no matter what the task.
  * Increase signature authority.
  * Remove unnecessary approval steps, so that people don’t have to check with superiors unless it’s needed.
  * Provide vertical and horizontal access to information and resources both inside and outside the organization—make sure that when you assign responsibility for a task, that person has the resources necessary to complete it. 



#### 2\. Develop Competence and Confidence

To truly empower your team, go beyond just providing them choices and fostering accountability. Help them to feel competent and confident in their roles. To do this, ensure that everyone has the knowledge, skills, and resources to do their jobs, or instead of feeling competent and confident, they’ll feel overwhelmed and discouraged.

Most people realize that competence is important, but confidence is just as crucial. In fact, studies have shown that self-confidence is an even stronger predictor of performance than skill level or training.

To strengthen the competence and confidence of your team:

  * Challenge their skills.
  * Share information.
  * Educate about key company metrics.
  * Foster a growth mindset.
  * Coach.



##### Challenge Their Skills

People do their best work when their task is slightly more challenging than their skill level. That’s when they feel neither overwhelmed nor bored. It’s also when they report feeling “in the flow,” **which is the sense that they’re performing expertly even if the challenge is difficult.** When people are performing at this level, they’re gaining competence by stretching their skills and confidence by seeing their progress, and they’re most satisfied with their work.

As a leader, aim to provide the conditions that make flow possible. This means periodically assessing your team members’ skill levels and the difficulties of the challenges they face, to make sure that their skills and challenges don’t become unbalanced.

(Shortform note: For more about what flow is, how it affects happiness, and how to cultivate it, read our guide to _Flow_ by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.)

##### Share Information

Your team won’t be able to make decisions without adequate information and training, and they’ll be hesitant to exercise their judgment for fear of making mistakes. Therefore, when guiding your team to become more self-sufficient, increase your investment in training and development.

Employees value skills training highly and are more likely to stick with a company that provides it. In fact, studies show that 40% of employees who report little or no skills training leave their positions within the first year, citing the lack of training as the reason.

Another reason to invest in training and development is that in today’s world, industries and technologies change very quickly, and **it benefits you and your organization to have team members who can adapt to changing needs.** An adaptable and flexible workforce will lessen the need for you to hire from the outside or lose market opportunities.

An example of a manager who successfully encouraged his team members to learn and share information was Jeff Allison of PW Enterprises. When a reorganization required him to be off-site and away from his team for much of the workweek, he knew he’d have to empower them to solve problems without his oversight. He spent a month walking them through a few dozen recent problems he’d faced, making sure they had the information and skills needed to resolve similar situations. Additionally, he gave each employee a hypothetical problem, challenged them to solve it, and had them each present their process to the rest of the team. This allowed them to not only learn from him but also from each other, which accelerated the learning process.

##### Educate About Key Company Metrics

Make sure your team members understand the fundamentals of how your organization works, so they’re able to make critical decisions about key issues when needed. If your team members don’t understand how your organization works, they won’t have a sense of ownership and can’t step up into leadership roles. Educate them about important elements of your organization, including its:

  * Most important customers, clients, suppliers, and stakeholders
  * Goals and how you measure progress toward them
  * Track record of performance
  * Pipeline of products, services, or ideas



##### Foster a Growth Mindset

When a person has a _growth mindset_ as opposed to a _fixed mindset_ , which we discussed under Guideline 6r, they’re more likely to develop confidence and competence. Research shows that people who are told that decision-making is a skill that can improve through practice (a characteristic of growth mindsets) have more confidence and better results than people who are told that decision-making is a reflection of innate intelligence (a characteristic of fixed mindsets).

When people believe in themselves in this way, messages of self-confidence can mold their thinking. Research shows that people are also susceptible to messages regarding whether or not they have the ability to effect change in other people (in addition to change in themselves), and their confidence is shaped by those messages. Studies show that groups who are told they can influence their colleagues’ decisions are more confident—and also perform better—than groups who are told that they’re unlikely to influence their colleagues’ behavior.

##### Coach

**Coaching is the process of giving constructive feedback, asking probing questions, and actively teaching important concepts.** Coaching is different from training; in fact, job training must be accompanied by coaching for it to improve job performance. In a three-year study, employees who had ongoing coaching conversations with their managers after receiving training were four times as likely to be recognized as “high improvement learners” than were employees who received training but no coaching afterward.

As a coach, your role is to help your team member to achieve her goals not by showing her what to do, but by showing her how to figure it out for herself. When you help another person grow, that person tends to reciprocate by helping you grow—by helping you achieve your organizational goals. This is why consistently, employees who receive coaching report feeling strongly supported by their company and committed to the company in turn.

One of the most effective ways to coach someone is to ask lots of questions, which:

  * Allows the other person to think about a situation from their perspective
  * Indicates trust in the other person’s opinions and abilities
  * Creates buy-in for whatever decision you ultimately reach, since you involved the other person



### Case Study: Sara Balducci at Management Services Company

Sara Balducci demonstrated how to successfully empower a team by encouraging joint efforts, cultivating common goals, and fostering self-determination and competence when her division of an international management services provider doubled in headcount. With the larger number of employees, Sara suddenly found herself leading a department full of people who didn’t know each other or how other people’s jobs contributed to the whole picture. Her team members were confused and demoralized.

To foster interconnectedness throughout the division, she split the division’s tasks into segments and assigned team members to different crews, based on their areas of expertise, to address the task segments. For example, some addressed international customers, some worked on shipping concerns, and some managed customer refunds. By dividing the larger team into smaller teams, each of which could focus on a single goal, she created a feeling within each small team of a common goal, and between the teams, of a larger common goal to which each crew could clearly see they contributed.
