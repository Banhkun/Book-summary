## Exercise: Produce Small Wins

While your dreams and goals may be big, think small when working toward them. You’ll have more success achieving a goal little by little than trying to accomplish the whole thing at once. Aim to accumulate small wins—measurable accomplishments of moderate importance—as you progress.

* * *

Think of a project you're working on or a goal you're working toward. Write down the ultimate outcome you're hoping to achieve.

Think of one small thing you can do in working toward that goal that would generate a small win. For example, if your goal is better customer service, how can you help a customer in a minor but unexpected way that would give you and your team something to celebrate?
