## Principle 1: Set an Example

The first principle of outstanding leadership is to set an example. Do this by ensuring that your team members understand what you stand for and believe, and then by demonstrating how your values can increase the success of your organization and the overall happiness of your team.

These two guidelines will help you effectively set an example:

  * Guideline 1: Establish your values.
  * Guideline 2: Model your values.



### Guideline 1: Establish Your Values

**Effective teams are built on shared values, so as a leader, your first job is to establish a set of values that will guide you and your team.** As your team’s leader, it’s important that when you say, “This is what I believe in,” you're really saying, “This is what _we_ believe in.”

Establishing your values is a two-part process:

  * Figuring out your values
  * Affirming shared values



#### Figure Out Your Values

Your values are the enduring beliefs underpinning your actions—the principles that will guide your decisions. Clear values help guide your behaviors and choices so that you stay on the path toward your goal. Your values:

  * Influence your moral judgments, your goals, and how you interact with others
  * Justify how and why you accomplish things
  * Determine how you react to adversity



For example, if you value diversity and believe innovation comes from a collaboration of different views and mindsets, then you’ll know how to react if people with different viewpoints keep getting shut down in meetings. If you value collaboration, you’ll know how to react when your salespeople aren’t sharing information with each other.

Studies show that having a clear leadership philosophy has several benefits:

  * **Benefits for you:** When leaders are clear about their values, they score highly on measures of confidence, pride in their job, and dedication to their organization’s success. Leaders who are not clear about their values score lower on these benchmarks. 
  * **Benefits for your team:** People who work under leaders with clear leadership philosophies report far more job satisfaction, team spirit, pride, and willingness to work hard than those who don’t. 
  * **Benefits for your organization:** A landmark study of more than 100 CEOs and 8,000 employees found that organizations run by leaders with clear values enjoyed five times greater returns than organizations run by less-clear leaders. 



##### Make Sure Your Values Are Your Own

Before you can effectively communicate your values to others, you must clearly understand them yourself. Take time to think carefully about what you stand for and what priorities will drive your actions, because having a solid understanding of your own core principles will give you and your team confidence when making decisions.

Your values must be a sincere expression of your own heart, and not merely a parroting of someone else’s values, if you want your constituents to feel properly engaged with them.

  * When your mission is fully your own, in your own voice, you won’t lose sight of it or fail to see how it should affect your behavior. 
  * Your team members will also far more readily adopt your values if they know that you're speaking from your heart, and not someone else’s. 
  * **Further, if you merely parrot your boss’s values without charting a way forward for your own values as well, you’re not _leading_ , you’re _managing_.** Your team members will pick up on this and won’t afford you the credibility of a true leader. 



#### Affirm Your Shared Values

Once you’ve properly communicated your values, help your team members align their values with the values of your organization. This is important for the long-term health of an organization:

  * Through shared values, you create an understanding of shared expectations.
  * Your constituents will be far more committed to and engaged in an organization they feel matches their beliefs. They have more energy, work harder, and stick around longer. 
  * When your constituents agree on a common cause, their energy accumulates: Each one catches the others’ enthusiasm. 



**Strong teams are built on shared values.** If team members have differing values and priorities, they often stop coordinating their efforts and instead work separately toward individual goals. When a team works disjointedly like this, they can cross wires and duplicate efforts. For this reason, companies with a strong set of shared values far outperform other companies. Research confirms that such companies have faster rates of profit growth, higher stock prices, stronger rates of job creation, and lower levels of turnover.

This does not mean that everyone on your team must hold the exact same values—such a standard would allow for no diversity of opinion or disagreements, both of which are essential in a healthy organization. However, leaders should aim to ensure that their constituents agree on some basic, overall, core values.

##### Proactively Start Conversations

To affirm your values with your team, **proactively engage in conversations that talk about these values**. Explicitly naming and discussing your values:

  * Aligns and clarifies expectations between you and your constituents
  * Reminds people why they are involved with your organization, prompting a renewal of energy and enthusiasm 
  * Encourages people to find more meaning in their work by helping them see how their work connects with their sense of identity
  * Fosters a sense of ownership of the organization’s mission, which encourages greater commitment



There are many ways you can spark conversations about values. For example, you might:

  * Meet with people individually and then discuss the team’s opinions at a group meeting. 
  * Relate a personal story at a staff meeting, that illustrates how you used your values in either your personal or professional life, and allow your team to respond and share similar experiences. 
  * Have your team fill out a questionnaire about their background, hobbies, what kind of work they like, what role they hope to play on the team, and what they respect in coworkers, and then have everyone share at a staff meeting. 



**If your team has gone off track or stopped working effectively together, you can bring them back together by discussing your values.** For example, say you're hired to replace an ineffective department head, and you find that your new team members are combative, competitive, and disrespectful because of the culture the former department head fostered. You might approach the problem not by telling your constituents what you expect of them, but instead, letting them know what you expect of yourself. When you take initiative and establish which values you aspire to, you’ll likely find that others follow suit, sharing their own values and consciously recognizing how their actions do or don’t live up to them.

Be prepared to have more than one conversation. Establishing a shared set of values is a process—it can’t be accomplished after a single heart-to-heart. The process will take time and will evolve. At first, team members may be focused on their own individual goals or reluctant to share their thoughts. However, if you're consistent in your efforts, people typically start to open up, resulting in an increased feeling of shared purpose.

##### Don’t Impose Your Own Values

Be sure that your conversations are dialogues in which you ask about your constituents’ values as much as you explain your own. Allow them to talk freely and explain their own beliefs and the reasons behind them—you won’t arrive at a consensus by demanding it or proclaiming that “These are our values.” Everyone must contribute to the conversation or they won’t feel authentic buy-in. You can, however, guide the conversation by emphasizing certain values that you want to start a dialogue about.

#### Case Study: Andrew Levine at Young Storytellers

Andrew Levine demonstrated how to appeal to shared values in order to increase the effectiveness of his team members. Andrew was the head mentor at Young Storytellers, an organization that works with school children, developing their imaginations through narrative. He oversaw a group of volunteers who were each assigned a specific child to work with. When he noticed that some of his volunteers were having trouble connecting to their assigned kids, and that they were also showing low signs of commitment to the program as a whole (failing to show up for sessions), he decided to reset the program by focusing his volunteers’ minds on their shared values.

He initiated a conversation with them to explore the organization’s purpose and how it intersected with their own:

  * He asked them to reflect on why they had joined Storytellers in the first place.
  * He discussed his own reasons for joining, and why it was still so important to him.
  * He asked them to look at the program from a fifth grader’s perspective, and think about what the kids wanted from a mentor. 
  * He got them to focus on the most important aspect of the program, which was the connection to the children, and to stop thinking about other concerns, such as whether they felt qualified to impart expertise on storytelling. In other words, he got them to agree on a _core value_ , even if they might hold different beliefs in other areas, and then empowered them to _find their own voice_ in how to express that value.
  * He asked them to make the program a priority, and either commit to showing up for classes or drop out. 



In having this conversation, Andrew asked his volunteers to affirm their shared values, while allowing them room to lead with their own values. His volunteers were re-energized and excited about the mission he reminded them of.

You don’t have to lay down an ultimatum like he did, asking people to either fully commit or leave. However, you can remind people that they can willingly choose to belong to whichever organization they connect to, and they should make it a priority to find one that resonates, whether it’s yours or not. They often will respond positively and with renewed energy.

### Guideline 2: Model Your Values

Once you’ve established and clearly articulated your values, model them in your behavior. When you live your values, others will know you’re serious, and you expect them to live them, too. It's easy to _say_ you believe in certain values, but harder to follow through and _live_ them, so when others see you doing just that—practicing what you preach—you gain credibility, and people will more enthusiastically follow your lead.

Further, when you model your values, you educate people; you guide, teach, and coach them on how to align _their_ values with those of your organization. People learn better by seeing an example than by merely hearing the words. To model your values:

  1. Live the shared values of your organization.
  2. Show others how to live the shared values.



#### 1\. Live the Shared Values of Your Organization

As a leader, you're the face of your organization to the public, and this means you represent its shared values. Other people associate you with your organization and will judge it by the actions you take.

You're also the face of your organization to your constituents (employees, volunteers, or other members). As such, you set the tone for your organization and how it—and everyone within it—will operate. **Research shows that direct reports mimic the behavior of their leader**. Leaders who are visible to their direct reports and who demonstrate positive attitudes, work conscientiously toward their goals, and make constructive changes when needed are likely to have direct reports who do the same.

You broadcast your values in many ways, some of which are:

  * Where you devote your time and attention
  * How you use words and phrases
  * How you pose questions
  * Your openness to feedback and how you handle criticism



##### Your Time and Attention

**People will judge your sincerity by what you pay attention to, and whether it matches what you say you value.** People will respect a leader who lives by the principle of, “don’t ask others to do what you yourself aren’t willing to do.”

Schedule your calendar and structure your agenda to match your stated values. For example:

  * If you say you value your clients, patients, students, and so on, make yourself available to them.
  * If you say you value sales performance, attend sales meetings.
  * If you say you value innovation, visit your labs and meet with your researchers.



An example of a leader exemplifying these principles was a senior client engagement manager at Accenture, whose team ran into trouble on a project and needed to spend New Year’s Eve and Day working in order to complete it. The manager canceled his own vacation plans to join them. His presence sent a strong message to both his team members and the client that he was committed to getting the project completed. Consequently, his team’s levels of morale and engagement soared.

##### How You Use Words and Phrases

Your language reflects your values, showing how you think about roles and relationships. Words provide a framework for how you see the world and what you want others to focus on. Therefore, ensure your language uplifts, motivates, and empowers your team members, rather than makes them feel restricted and disempowered.

When speaking about the roles and positions of you and your team members, avoid words and phrases that focus on hierarchy, and instead **use words that focus on relationships.** For example:

  * Words like _boss_ , _employee_ , _top-down_ , _supervisor_ , _rank-and-file_ , and _subordinate_ frame your work around hierarchy.
  * In contrast, words like _associates_ , _colleagues_ , _team members_ , _partners_ , and _constituents_ frame your work around collaboration. 



Additionally, when speaking of goals and strategy, use words that invoke ideals that go beyond mere functionality. While terms like _efficiency_ , _differentiation_ , and _superiority_ are often accurate descriptions of objectives, they don’t rouse the spirit in the same way words like _honor_ , _justice_ , and _truth_ do.

##### How You Pose Questions

Your language conveys your priorities. When you ask questions, you indicate what you’re concerned about and direct attention to a specific aspect of the issue. Therefore, **ask purposeful questions designed to inform, guide, and emphasize your values.**

For example, if you ask someone, “What do you need that we can provide so you can finish the project?” you’re emphasizing collaboration and support. In contrast, if you ask, “Why haven’t you finished the project?” you’re emphasizing personal accountability and implying blame. With this question, you’ll likely prompt a feeling of defensiveness, and the other person will probably feel the need to give excuses rather than to reflect constructively on solutions.

When you ask purposeful, well-framed questions, you can:

  * Show that you’re genuinely interested in others’ points of view
  * Encourage participation in decision-making, which increases support for whatever decision is ultimately made
  * Encourage people to fully understand their own positions by exploring the reasons behind them
  * Help people get a broader understanding of the circumstances
  * Clarify and emphasize your shared values



You can also use questions to find ways to improve your business or organizational purpose. Ask your constituents for input, and follow up with additional questions. Never criticize suggestions, but instead, ask for clarification. Use questions to reframe viewpoints and inspire new ideas—for example, get your team members to see your business from your customers’ point of view by asking how the customer might feel using your products.

##### Your Openness to Feedback

You broadcast how you feel about others’ opinions with whether or not you're open to feedback.

You can’t truly evaluate your own job performance without knowing what others think about you—and to find out, you have to ask them. So **to grow in your leadership role, regularly seek feedback.**

It’s hard to receive feedback; no one likes to be criticized. Though everyone wants to improve themselves, they also want to feel accepted just as they are. Feedback speaks to both of these basic human desires, and therefore it comes with an inherent tension. Because of this, many people, leaders included, react to feedback negatively, and don’t often seek it out.

Leaders also resist feedback because they fear it will expose their flaws, convince their constituents they aren’t up to their task of leadership, and thus make them less successful. However, research shows that leaders who are open to feedback are far more likely to be successful.

(Shortform note: For a more in-depth discussion of how to constructively accept feedback, read our guide to Thanks for the Feedback.)

#### 2\. Show Others How to Live the Shared Values

When you model your values, you show others how to live the shared values of your organization. This is crucial because your role as a leader is not only to personally represent the values of your organization, but also to ensure that your constituents represent them as well—your constituents are the face of your organization to the public just as you are, and the public will judge your organization’s values based on how they observe your team members acting.

In addition, your own team members will watch what you expect of their peers—or what you let slide. If they see that you consistently hold other team members up to your stated values, they’ll feel more committed to them. If they see you accepting behavior that you have verbally discouraged, they won't judge your commitment to your values as sincere.

There are many ways you can guide and coach your team to live your shared values. Some specific ways are:

  * Face unplanned complications.
  * Tell stories.
  * Use systems and processes.



##### Face Unplanned Incidents

You can effectively demonstrate how your values can be put into action when unplanned emergencies arise. **Unplanned problems are an opportunity to focus your team members on what’s critical and to show them how your values can create solutions.**

For example, if a colleague has to take a leave of absence during an important phase of a project in which she plays an integral part, you can demonstrate how your stated values of, say, teamwork and flexibility can help the project stick to its timeline if you step in to help manage it.

##### Tell Stories

**Another way to demonstrate how your values can be put into action is to tell a story.** Stories teach people how the world works—what to do, what to avoid, what’s important, and what’s possible—and the human brain has evolved to pay close attention to them. Your team members will better understand the rules if they hear a story about them—what happened when someone broke them or how someone was rewarded for following them—than they will if they just read a list of rules.

Use stories to support major changes in policy or strategy, as people will understand more clearly the reasons behind the changes and what the changes are aiming for. If possible, include people in your stories that your listeners will recognize: People love to hear stories about themselves or people they know, so if you can illustrate a point with a story filled with familiar elements, you’ll grab your listeners’ attention.

##### Use Systems and Processes

As a leader, ensure that your team can follow your values even when you're not physically present. This will allow your team members to take initiative without needing to follow your lead. To do this, establish clear and practical procedures that stand in for your decision-making when you're not around. These might include:

  * **Key performance measures:** Encourage departments to share information to encourage collaboration over competition.
  * **Reward systems:** Dispense benefits, perks, and promotions according to when team members live your values.
  * **Recruitment:** Make clear what you stand for when you seek new members, so that potential team members both understand your values and take themselves out of the running if they don’t agree with those values.
  * **Training:** Emphasize your values in your onboarding materials.



#### Case Study: Steve Skarke at Kaneka Texas Corporation

Steve Skarke of Kaneka Texas Corporation demonstrated how to effectively model his values. When Steve stepped into the role of plant manager at the company, he had a vision for the company, shared by management, of becoming a “World Class Plant.” However, he noticed immediately that the physical condition of the plant grounds didn’t hold up this value; the plant was untidy. In fact, whenever a customer was scheduled to visit, Steve had to assign people to clean up trash around the plant, parking lot, and surrounding roads.

To model the values he wanted his team to adopt, Steve picked up a large plastic bucket, labeled it “World Class Plant,” and walked around picking up trash. He took his trash bucket with him wherever he went around the plant. Soon, other managers and workers started carrying buckets too.

Further, now that everyone’s attention was on the trash problem, they began talking about how to address the issue over the longer term. They added trash cans and came up with ways to organize their workspaces better. The company even expanded the program, delegating responsibility for the maintenance of certain pieces of machinery to the floor operators.

Because of Steve’s decision to personally live up to the values he wanted others to live up to, he created a culture based on those values.
