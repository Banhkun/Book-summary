## Exercise: Empower Others

People do their best work when their task is slightly more challenging than their skill level. That’s when they feel neither overwhelmed nor bored. This is also when they report feeling “in the flow,” which is the sense that they’re performing expertly even if the challenge is difficult.

* * *

Think about some tasks for which you're currently the primary (or only) decision-maker. In which of these might you be able to involve other people in the decision-making process?

Are there any upcoming projects in which you can involve team members who wouldn’t normally expect to be included? What responsibilities can you give to those team members that will stretch their skills?
