## 1-Page Summary

In _What Happened to You?_ , Bruce D. Perry and Oprah Winfrey discuss how trauma affects the brain. In particular, they explain how **traumatic events suffered in childhood have a lasting impact on development, behavior, and relationships.** They maintain that by understanding this impact, trauma survivors can begin to heal and move forward.

For more than three decades, Perry and Winfrey have worked together on the topic of childhood trauma. Perry is an internationally renowned expert on how trauma affects the developing brain, and Winfrey has used her platform as a talk show host, actress, and author to increase awareness of the issue. Their partnership helped lead to the passage of the National Child Protection Act in 1991 (also known as “The Oprah Bill”), which created a national database to track child abusers. Perry and Winfrey wrote _What Happened to You?_ as a way of sharing their thoughts and research to help people who suffer from trauma.

In this guide, we’ve reorganized the authors’ points into three main parts. In Part 1, we’ll discuss what trauma is and how it impacts the brain. In Part 2, we’ll turn our focus to childhood trauma in particular, exploring its short-term and long-term impacts. Finally, in Part 3, we’ll share the authors’ advice on healing from trauma.

Throughout the guide, we’ll connect Perry and Winfrey’s ideas to those in other popular books on trauma, such as Bessel van der Kolk’s _The Body Keeps the Score_. We’ll also elaborate on the authors’ main themes, such as trauma’s impact and the healing process. Finally, we’ll provide information and resources to help those struggling with trauma find high-quality care.

### Part 1: Understanding Trauma

Before discussing how trauma impacts the brain, we first need to talk about what trauma _is_. Perry and Winfrey note that our society uses the term “trauma” very broadly. We sometimes refer to misfortunes as “traumatic,” such as failing an exam or receiving a negative review at work. We also might use the word to refer to an uncomfortable situation, such as watching violent news footage. The authors acknowledge that these types of events can cause distress and can even be traumatic for some people. But they urge us to use the word “trauma” carefully.

Perry explains that in psychology, trauma is difficult to define. **This is because people can experience and react to the same event in different ways.** For example, an earthquake might destroy one child’s home, causing severe trauma. But in a different part of the city, another child might experience only a slight shaking, which causes alarm but not lasting trauma.

Because of these difficulties, Perry and Winfrey stop short of defining trauma. Instead, they suggest that all trauma has two factors: a _stress response**,**_ or the body’s reaction to a difficult event; and the _lasting impact****_ of that event. The extent and details of the stress response and the lasting impact vary based on the person. But Perry maintains that these two factors are crucial to understanding trauma.

> **Trauma Is Difficult to Define…and Difficult to Share**
> 
> Trauma’s relative nature and unclear definition can make it difficult for survivors to share their experiences. This is particularly true in the case of “individual trauma,” or trauma that happens to just one person as opposed to a group of people. Because that person was the only one to experience the event, they can’t compare their reaction to that of anyone else. Therefore, they might think that the event was “not that bad” and feel shame that they still have trauma from it. They also might worry that others won't understand or believe them when they discuss the trauma.
> 
> Therefore, if a trauma survivor shares their story with you, the most important thing you can do is believe them. Use phrases like, “It’s not your fault,” “I believe you,” “Thank you for telling me,” and “This shouldn’t have happened to you” to validate their experience.

Let’s take a look at each of these two factors of trauma: the stress response and the lasting impact.

#### Understanding Stress Responses

When you’re in a potentially dangerous or stressful situation, your body protects you by producing a _stress response_. According to Perry and Winfrey, this can take one of two forms:

**1) Fight or flight:** Perry and Winfrey explain that your fight-or-flight response prepares you to either confront the danger or run away. You become alert and ready for action: Blood rushes to your muscles, your heart rate increases, and your body produces adrenaline.

(Shortform note: Your fight-or-flight response happens instantly, often without you even realizing it. When you see something that your brain interprets as dangerous, it immediately sends a signal to your adrenal glands (which are in charge of producing adrenaline) through your sympathetic nervous system. This is why people can react to danger instinctively, like jumping out of the way of an oncoming truck. Before you have time to fully process what you see, your body has already kicked into gear.)

**2) Dissociation:** Perry and Winfrey note that in some dangerous situations, our brains calculate that we can’t fight or flee. In these cases, we react by dissociating. Dissociation prepares us to get hurt: The brain tells the body to start producing natural painkillers and redirects blood away from the muscles to protect the vital organs in the trunk. We sometimes feel as though time slows down or that we’re observing ourselves from afar.

> **Dissociative Disorders Can Serve as Coping Mechanisms**
> 
> Dissociation can happen not only in the moment of a traumatic event but also afterward as a coping mechanism. There are four types of dissociative disorders**** common in trauma survivors:
> 
> _Dissociative amnesia****_ consists of memory loss, either of a specific event or time period or (more rarely) of a person’s entire life. As a coping mechanism, this allows the trauma survivor to forget negative events, preventing them from reliving their trauma.
> 
> _Dissociative fugue_ is a type of dissociative amnesia. The main symptom is that the person frequently wanders away from home for hours, days, or even months, with no later memory of the trip. Scientists theorize that dissociative fugue allows the trauma survivor to physically escape their everyday life to avoid reliving trauma.
> 
> _Dissociative identity disorder (DID)_ occurs when a person has two or more identities that each control their behavior at different times. These multiple identities each have their own background and personality traits. As a coping mechanism, DID allows the trauma survivor to distance themself from a traumatic memory by escaping into a different identity.
> 
> _Depersonalization disorder****_ occurs when a person suddenly feels as though they don’t belong to their body. As a coping mechanism, this allows the trauma survivor to detach themself from negative events, as though the events happened to someone else.
> 
> For each of these disorders, mental health professionals can help patients address underlying trauma and develop strategies for dealing with symptoms.

##### Traumatic Events Create a Heightened Stress Response

Perry and Winfrey explain that a stress response by itself isn't necessarily a bad thing: Stress responses protect us from harm. For example, if you’re hiking and come across a rattlesnake, having a fight-or-flight response is beneficial because it’ll make you more alert and prepare you to run away. Stress responses can also help you overcome challenges and develop resiliency. For example, having minor nerves before playing in a big sports game can make you perform better by sharpening your senses and your mind.

However, one of the common elements of trauma is that **it creates an especially severe or prolonged stress response.** This can occur due to a single moment of trauma or over the course of several events. Perry notes that there are no universal criteria for what counts as an “especially severe or prolonged stress response.” He acknowledges that this can make it difficult to classify trauma. But he also maintains that psychologists should understand stress responses on a case-by-case basis to provide better care to trauma survivors.

> **Single-Incident Trauma Versus Complex Trauma**
> 
> Trauma that occurs over the course of several events is also called _complex trauma**.**_ Research suggests that in general, complex trauma leads to more severe long-term effects than single-incident trauma. This is due to a number of factors.
> 
> First, complex trauma often leaves little time for the person to recover between traumatic events, leading to sustained stress that’s bad for their health. Second, complex trauma frequently occurs in private and in relationships that are supposed to be loving, such as the parent-child relationship. Experiencing trauma in this kind of relationship can be especially confusing and difficult, and it can make trauma survivors feel like it was _their_ fault that the trauma occurred. These feelings of guilt or shame can prevent trauma survivors from seeking help, leading to more severe long-term effects.

> **Visualizing the Stress Response: “The Window of Tolerance”**
> 
> “The Window of Tolerance” theory offers a useful way of visualizing Perry and Winfrey’s discussion of the stress response. Psychologist Daniel Siegel first proposed this theory in his 1999 book _The Developing Mind_. Since then, it’s helped inform how doctors and scientists view trauma and help survivors heal.
> 
> Like Perry and Winfrey, Siegel suggests that when we’re within a certain healthy range of stress, we’re grounded, flexible, and relate well to others. He calls this range the Window of Tolerance and notes that it can vary from person to person. However, when our stress levels become too high or low, we leave the Window of Tolerance and can no longer regulate our emotions. When stress levels rise, we can become _hyper-aroused_ , which can cause anxiety, anger, and hypervigilance (this is what Perry and Winfrey call fight-or-flight mode). On the other hand, when stress levels decrease, we can become _hypo-aroused_ , which causes numbness, depression, and passivity (what Perry and Winfrey call dissociation).
> 
> Similarly to Perry and Winfrey, Siegel theorizes that trauma creates so much stress that it forces a person out of their Window of Tolerance. Furthermore, he suggests that trauma narrows the Window of Tolerance in the future, making trauma survivors more susceptible to small triggers. (We’ll discuss this in more detail shortly.) Siegel also maintains that we can widen our Window of Tolerance through mindfulness practices, therapy, and stress-reducing activities like exercise.

#### Trauma’s Lasting Impact

Perry and Winfrey explain that another common element of trauma is its _lasting impact_. Once again, they don’t offer a one-size-fits-all definition of what this lasting impact looks like. They explain that it depends on a range of factors, including the survivor’s genetic susceptibility to trauma, the strength of her community support network, and her body’s stress response to the original traumatic event. (A more severe stress response typically leads to more severe long-term effects.)

(Shortform note: In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk agrees that genetics, community, and the stress response are all factors that can influence the severity of trauma’s long-term effects. Furthermore, he extends Perry and Winfrey’s claim by adding another influencing factor: a survivor’s actions during the traumatic event. According to van der Kolk, if the survivor lashed out in rage or didn't fight back, they may repeatedly feel an overwhelming sense of shame or guilt that they didn't act differently, even if they had no choice.)

However, Perry and Winfrey do list several common long-term effects of trauma, including flashbacks, memory loss, physical health problems, and mental health issues like depression and anxiety. We’ll discuss these lasting impacts in more depth later in the guide.

### Part 2: Childhood Trauma

In the last section, we discussed the two basic elements of trauma: a heightened stress response and a lasting impact. These elements are common for trauma experienced at any age. However, in _What Happened to You?_ , Perry and Winfrey are particularly interested in childhood trauma—trauma experienced during the formative years of development. In this section, we’ll discuss this type of trauma, including how it impacts the brain and its consequences in the short and long term.

#### Childhood Trauma’s Impact on the Developing Brain

While experiencing trauma at any stage of life can impact our wellbeing and mental health, Perry and Winfrey explain that childhood trauma has especially severe and long-lasting effects. This is because**** so much of our brain development happens during the first few years of life. As a result, **our childhood experiences are foundational to our worldview, personality, and behavior.**

(Shortform note: Scientists disagree on whether our worldview, personality, and behavior depend more on nature (the genetic material in our DNA) or nurture (our childhood experiences), as Perry and Winfrey suggest. However, recent research suggests that personality comes from the interplay between your genes and your environment. You’re born with a certain temperament—for example, you may be quiet or loud, timid or outgoing. But your environment and upbringing also help determine your personality traits and can even change your basic temperament.)

When you’re born, Perry explains, your brain isn't fully developed. As you grow up, it grows with you. It rapidly forms new synapses—connections between brain cells, or neurons. These synapses make up complex chains, called neural networks, that send information to each other through electrical signals. As this happens, you begin to use new areas of the brain that control language, rational thought, and motor skills.

(Shortform note: Research confirms Perry’s claim that the brain grows rapidly in the first few years of a child’s life. Brain size doubles in the first year alone, and the number of neural networks skyrockets. Recent estimates suggest that as infants and toddlers, we develop one million new synapses every second.)

**However, when a child experiences trauma, it can disrupt the brain’s normal development.** Think of the adult brain as a city—a complex system of interwoven parts. The early years of childhood development are like the ground that the city is built on. If it is sturdy ground, the city will be structurally sound. But if it is unstable or swampy, the city will develop problems: Its buildings and roads might begin to collapse. If it experiences a severe event like an earthquake, it’ll be more susceptible to damage.

Similarly, if a child experiences trauma, the brain’s foundation will be weaker. Perry and Winfrey explain that as the child grows up and the brain grows in complexity, this weak foundation can cause problems. For example, children who experience trauma often struggle with speech, motor-control issues, and problem-solving skills.

> **How to Encourage Healthy Brain Development**
> 
> Perry and Winfrey mention that when children experience love and care, their brains develop in healthy ways. But what does “love and care” look like in practice? What are some concrete ways that parents can encourage healthy brain development and avoid the issues the authors describe?
> 
> As a parent, there are four key areas of brain development to keep in mind when raising an infant. These areas are: motor skills (including jumping, balancing, and fine motor skills like drawing); speech and language; cognitive skills (such as problem-solving and counting); and social skills (including the ability to connect with others).
> 
> Ideally, parents should show love and care by helping the child develop all four of these areas through different activities. For example, talking and reading to your child helps her begin to learn language; playing games such as peek-a-boo can help develop her cognitive and social skills; and singing songs that incorporate actions—such as “If You’re Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands”—can help her develop motor and language skills.

#### The Short-Term Effects of Childhood Trauma

The developmental issues we’ve just discussed can lead to both short-term and long-term problems for survivors of childhood trauma. According to Perry and Winfrey, two of the most common short-term effects of childhood trauma are 1) an inability to love and be loved, and 2) an overactive stress response, which can lead to increased anxiety and difficulty concentrating. Let’s explore both in detail.

##### 1) An Inability to Love and Be Loved

Perry and Winfrey maintain that one of the most important skills we develop as infants is the ability to experience love. At this stage of development, we wholly rely on our caregivers to meet our needs (for example, food, soothing, or a diaper change). If caregivers consistently and lovingly respond to our needs and make us feel better, we begin to form positive associations between human contact and comfort. In other words, we learn that being around people and experiencing love makes us feel good.

However, if a child needs something and the caregiver isn't there, is only there at certain times, or meets the need with an abusive reaction, the child doesn't associate human contact with comfort and love. **Instead, human contact is scary and unpredictable.**

According to Perry and Winfrey, this negative view of human contact can hinder the child’s ability to form healthy relationships. Because she doesn’t experience love at home, she might have a harder time giving and receiving it in situations outside the home—for example, at daycare.**** She might not show affection to her classmates and teachers, or she might not know how to react when someone shows her love.

Perry and Winfrey suggest that this can create a vicious cycle. When the child doesn’t have a loving home, she struggles to connect with others and develop loving relationships. Without these relationships, she doesn’t experience love in other places and continues to drift further from others. She therefore becomes more isolated and never experiences the love needed to break the cycle.

> **Attachment Theory: The Importance of Loving Caregivers**
> 
> Perry and Winfrey’s assertion that the caregiver-child relationship impacts brain development aligns with the basic tenets of attachment theory. Attachment theory suggests that to develop healthy social, emotional, and cognitive skills, an infant must receive consistent love and care from at least one caregiver.
> 
> Attachment theory started with a basic observation, first noted by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s. Bowlby noticed that when babies can’t see their caregivers, they have a common set of behaviors, including crying, screaming, and searching. He called these _attachment behaviors_. According to Bowlby, the evolutionary purpose of attachment behaviors was to make sure that an infant’s _attachment figure_ , or caregiver, paid attention to the infant. Bowlby theorized that babies who exhibited these behaviors received more care and were therefore more likely to survive.
> 
> Over the next two decades, psychologist Mary Ainsworth challenged and extended Bowlby’s theory. Like Perry and Winfrey, Ainsworth suggested that if a caregiver consistently responds to an infant’s attachment behaviors with love, the infant’s brain develops in a normal, healthy way. On the other hand, infants who experience abuse or neglect struggle to develop more advanced brain functions such as cognition and social skills.
> 
> Using this basic idea, Ainsworth suggested that infants can have one of two _attachment styles_. Infants who receive consistent, loving care (and as a result experience normal brain development) are _securely attached_. Infants who receive inconsistent or abusive care (and as a result have impeded brain development) are _insecurely attached_. She further divided insecurely attached babies into two categories:
> 
>   * _Anxiously attached_ babies experience high anxiety when separated from their parents. When reunited with their caregivers, they’re difficult to soothe.
> 
>   * _Avoidantly attached_ babies don’t experience stress when separated from their caregivers. Furthermore, when they’re reunited, they often ignore the caregivers.
> 
> 

> 
> Like Perry and Winfrey, Ainsworth believed that your attachment style has long-term effects on cognition and social skills, including your ability to develop healthy relationships. However, it wasn’t until the 1980s that researchers began to explore the connection between infant attachment and adult relationships. In _Attached_ ,__ Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explain this research, suggesting that there are three adult attachment styles:
> 
>   * _Secure attachers_ are confident in their partner’s affection for them and are caring, nurturing, and compassionate.
> 
>   * _Anxious attachers_ worry that their partner will leave them and seek constant reassurance.
> 
>   * _Avoidant attachers_ distance themselves from their partners.
> 
> 

> 
> Researchers once thought that your attachment style as an infant directly led to your attachment style as an adult. Today, however, scientists such as Levine and Heller suggest that infant attachment style is just one of several factors that influence adult attachment. Other factors include your temperament, your parents’ stress levels, and whether you spent time with caregivers other than your parents.

##### 2) An Overactive Stress Response

Childhood trauma can also **overactivate a child’s stress response** , making them hypervigilant and anxious. Perry and Winfrey explain that children who live in an abusive home must always be alert for signs of abuse. This means that their stress responses are very sensitive—more often than not, they’re in a fight-or-flight or dissociative state.

While this overly active stress response helps a child survive at home, in other settings, it isn't so helpful. Perry and Winfrey suggest that a heightened stress response can make it hard for the child to focus in school, make friends, and trust adults. Children who experience trauma are often misdiagnosed with ADHD because they have trouble sitting still and concentrating.

Like the inability to love, a heightened stress response can create a vicious cycle. Perry and Winfrey suggest that if teachers, coaches, and other students aren’t aware of the child’s traumatic experiences, they’ll view the child’s behavior as disruptive. They’ll probably get frustrated, which will further isolate the child, making them less likely to reach out for help and less motivated to follow the rules.

> **How to Recognize and Respond to Trauma: Advice for Teachers, Coaches, and Mentors**
> 
> As the authors suggest, if adult mentors don’t notice that a child has an overactive stress response and is experiencing trauma, the child can become even more isolated. So how can adults recognize the signs of stress and trauma and respond in a supportive way? Keep these three things in mind:
> 
> **1) Recognize:** The first step is to know the common indicators of childhood trauma. In addition to the anxiety and concentration problems mentioned by Perry and Winfrey, these indicators include forgetfulness, constant complaints of feeling sick, aggression, extreme perfectionism, and general depression or lack of effort.
> 
> **2) Respond:** If you do suspect that a child is experiencing trauma, questioning her about it may not be the best strategy. This could make the child feel like she is under pressure or in trouble, which could cause her to recede further. Instead, be aware of the ways that trauma might contribute to her behavior, and respond to this behavior patiently and compassionately.
> 
> **3) Report:** If you believe a child is suffering from trauma, you should report it. In the US, educators such as teachers and school counselors are mandatory reporters, which means that they must report child abuse. But anyone in the US can report abuse by calling the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at +1 (800) 4ACHILD, or +1 (800) 422-4453.

#### The Long-Term Effects of Childhood Trauma

For children who suffer abuse, trauma’s impact on the developing brain tends to create long-term issues. Perry and Winfrey mention three broad ways that childhood trauma can impact people in the long-term: 1) mental and physical health issues, 2) flashbacks and triggers, and 3) unrecognized behavioral patterns.

Let’s take a look at each of these.

##### 1) Mental and Physical Health Issues

According to Perry and Winfrey, suffering a traumatic event in childhood increases the risk of a range of mental and physical health issues later in life. People who experienced trauma as children often experience depression and anxiety, as well as physical symptoms such as chronic pain and increased risk of heart disease.

(Shortform note: Research confirms Perry and Winfrey’s assertion that trauma often causes long-lasting mental and physical health issues. Studies suggest that between 40% and 50% of trauma survivors experience anxiety and depression after a traumatic injury, and that these symptoms can last up to 20 years after the injury. In one study, 68% of trauma survivors reported experiencing physical health problems five years after the traumatic event.)

Perry and Winfrey note that doctors sometimes dismiss the physical manifestations of trauma. These doctors might tell patients that the pain is imagined or “psychological,” implying that it isn't actually happening in the body. However, the authors maintain that the mind and body are connected. Physical pain from trauma is real, and addressing that pain is an important part of any care plan.

(Shortform note: The authors’ emphasis on the mind-body connection is part of a broader movement in Western medicine: In the past several decades, Western doctors and scientists have found direct links between mental health and physical health. However, this movement isn't new—studying the mind and body together was a common practice in Western medicine until the 17th century. Furthermore, non-Western medical practices, such as Chinese medicine, have always been highly aware of the mind-body connection.)

##### 2) Flashbacks and Triggers

Another common long-term effect of trauma is flashbacks, in which a trauma survivor relives a traumatic moment. Perry and Winfrey explain that flashbacks occur when the brain creates long-lasting associations between the circumstances surrounding a traumatic event and the stress response. For example, if a drunk father hits his child, the child’s brain may create an association between the smell of alcohol and a state of fear. The brain learns that when that smell is present, bad things happen.

Our brains create these associations to protect us from similar situations in the future. For example, the next time the child smells alcohol, his brain will recognize the situation and tell him to hide or run away. However, the brain can sometimes do its job _too_ well, **triggering our stress response even if we aren’t in danger.**

For example, when the child grows up, he might suddenly experience a stress response when a middle-aged man smelling of alcohol approaches him. Even if he isn’t in any immediate danger, he might feel suddenly anxious and uneasy. As we discussed above, this type of sustained stress response can have negative impacts on our mental and physical health.

> **The Positive Side of Mental Associations**
> 
> While Perry and Winfrey talk about mental associations in a negative sense due to their role in perpetuating trauma, other authors claim that we can use these associations to create positive change in our lives. Here are two examples of how to use mental associations to your advantage:
> 
> 1) Evidence suggests that you can use associations to help improve memory, by linking emotions and images to the thing you want to remember. For example, if you want to remember someone’s name, you could connect it to the lyrics from one of your favorite songs. By connecting their name to the positive emotion that you associate with the song, you’ll be able to recall it more easily.
> 
> 2) Evidence also suggests that associations can help increase productivity by creating positive associations between your workspace and your efficiency. For example, working on your bed will make you less productive because you associate your bed with relaxation and sleep. Meanwhile, working at a desk you solely designate for work will make you more productive, as you’re in a space clearly linked to productivity.

##### 3) Unrecognized Behavioral Patterns

In addition to creating health problems and triggering flashbacks, trauma can influence behavior in more subtle ways. According to Perry and Winfrey, trauma survivors often develop negative habits and ways of seeing the world, sometimes without realizing it.

As we’ve mentioned, experiencing love and care as an infant allows us to develop healthy relationships later in life. Childhood trauma can create a vicious cycle in which the child doesn't know how to receive love and becomes more and more isolated.

Perry and Winfrey explain that these behavioral patterns continue to influence us as adults, even though we might not be aware of them. **When someone experiences trauma, they come to expect the same patterns of abuse that they suffered as children.** This can inhibit our ability to form healthy relationships, especially if we’re unaware of how our childhood trauma is influencing us.

For example, if a person is abandoned by her parents when she’s young, she might later struggle to develop trust in intimate relationships. Because of her childhood trauma, she might mistakenly come to expect that _anyone_ who says they love her will leave. However, if she isn’t aware of her childhood trauma or the effect that it has on her, she might think her feelings are based in reality. This could make it difficult for her to form a trusting relationship.

> **How to Change Behavioral Patterns**
> 
> Behavioral patterns can be hard to break, especially ones formed in childhood and rooted in trauma like those the authors describe. However, behavioral psychologists have identified several strategies for changing behavior:
> 
> **1) Self-reflect:** Before changing a behavior, you must first figure out what it is that you want to change and how it’s impacting your well-being. You can do this individually through mindfulness practices or by talking with someone you trust.
> 
> **2) Keep motivation in mind:** We’re more likely to achieve our goals when we have the motivation to do so. Before beginning the process of changing behavior, write down your motivating reasons for changing. These could be related to how your behavior impacts you or your loved ones.
> 
> **3) Start small:** When thinking about your goals, start by identifying small situations where you can change your behavior or thoughts. For example, if you want to practice self-love, commit to writing down one nice thing about yourself every day.
> 
> **4) View setbacks as learning opportunities:** Patterns are hard to change for a reason. If you have a setback and lapse into old behaviors, don’t give up or get angry with yourself. Instead, think about what you can learn from the experience and how you might react differently in the future.
> 
> It’s important to note that these strategies won't work for everyone. As we’ll shortly explore, trauma-related behavioral patterns often require more processing than regular patterns. However, this advice could be helpful for those who’ve already made progress in working through trauma.

### Part 3: The Healing Process

In the previous section, we discussed how trauma can have short-term and long-term impacts on our worldview, behavior, and relationships. Fortunately, **there are ways of addressing and working through trauma to help us heal and develop healthy relationships.**

Perry and Winfrey maintain that every person going through trauma has a different background and different needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to trauma.

(Shortform note: While doctors agree that there is no one-size-fits-all care plan for trauma, there _are_ common guidelines that care providers can follow. For example, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network uses the Psychological First Aid model, which outlines several “core actions” that doctors should perform. These include speaking to the patient with compassion and understanding, stabilizing symptoms, connecting the patient to support networks, and offering practical assistance to the patient and their family. While the details of each case will be different, these “core actions” help doctors make sure that they’re providing positive care.)

Still, the authors mention several important pieces of advice for anyone struggling with trauma: Lean on your community, ease your stress response in small doses, and have compassion for yourself and others. Let’s explore each strategy in detail.

#### 1) Lean on Your Community

According to Perry and Winfrey, the most important factor in dealing with trauma is experiencing love and support from your community. They note that even for people without trauma, having meaningful social connections is an excellent indicator of mental health.

However, when healing from trauma, the authors maintain that these social connections become even more important. To process traumatic events, survivors need to share their thoughts and feelings with a supportive community. Trauma often makes its victims feel unloved and unworthy. But healthy, communicative relationships can help people feel listened to, cared for, and validated.

(Shortform note: While healthy, meaningful connections improve our mental health and can help trauma survivors heal, _unhealthy_ relationships can make people feel unsafe and unloved. So, how can you tell whether your relationships are healthy? Mutual respect, trust, honesty, and compassion are just a few key elements of a healthy relationship. When developing a connection with someone, think about whether you feel safe with them and can be yourself.)

Perry and Winfrey suggest that ideally, a therapist can be a part of this community. But they also note that not everyone has access to a therapist, and Perry maintains that a supportive community of family and friends can be just as valuable.

> **Cost-Effective Trauma Care Resources**
> 
> As Perry and Winfrey note, not everyone has the resources to get help from a therapist. Moreover, while family and friends can sometimes support trauma recovery, in other cases, they can actively hinder it. In _The Body Keeps the Score_ ,__ van der Kolk maintains that many people don’t know how to respond when someone shares their trauma. Nonprofessionals might not want to listen, or they might react in a way that causes further harm, such as not believing the survivor’s story.
> 
> Fortunately, there are many free or low-cost ways to get help with trauma. Here are some services dedicated to providing high-quality and affordable care:
> 
>   * In the US, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) is an organization devoted to helping victims of sexual violence. They operate the national sexual violence hotline, which can be reached at +1 (800) 656-HOPE. Their website also has a live chat feature and information on sexual assault prevention and awareness.

#### 2) Ease Your Stress Response in Small Doses

As we mentioned earlier, trauma creates associations in the brain that can retrigger the stress response even years after the event. When this happens, it becomes difficult or impossible to think rationally. According to Perry and Winfrey, this makes it hard to work through trauma.

(Shortform note: In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , van der Kolk elaborates on the authors’ point that flashbacks make it hard to work through trauma by noting that flashbacks often shut down specific areas of the brain: in particular, those related to speech and language. This can make it impossible for the trauma survivor to speak about her experience. To combat this, van der Kolk suggests several strategies that can help the victim express and process their trauma, including free-association writing and developing bodily awareness through meditation.)

Therefore, according to the authors,**the first step in working through trauma is to ease your stress response.** This retrains the brain’s neural pathways to recognize that it isn't actually in danger, allowing you to think rationally and process traumatic memories. Perry and Winfrey offer two concrete tips for beginning this process:

**1) Use rhythm:__** Rhythmic activities such as walking, dancing, and coloring can help regulate the body and brain when processing traumatic memories. According to Perry and Winfrey, rhythmic motions have a therapeutic effect on us, a connection that goes back to the womb, when we hear our mother’s heartbeat and associate it with safety.

(Shortform note: While Perry and Winfrey claim that rhythm is therapeutic because it connects us to our time in the womb, another theory suggests that rhythm is beneficial because it can change our brainwaves. Scientists have found that listening to rhythmic music causes our brainwaves to resonate with the rhythm. This increases blood flow and activity in the brain, which can improve concentration and reduce anxiety.)

**2) Address trauma little by little:** Perry suggests that on a biological level, we can’t think or talk about a traumatic memory for more than a few seconds before our brain tries to protect us and our stress response kicks in. Because of this, Perry and Winfrey recommend addressing trauma in small doses. Thinking about a traumatic memory for only a few seconds (as opposed to forcing yourself to think about it for longer) will make it easier to regulate your stress response.

The need to process trauma bit by bit also helps explain why having a large, healthy, and robust community is so important. According to the authors, having a long conversation with one person won't be as helpful as having many shorter conversations with different people.

> **_The Body Keeps the Score_ : Advice on How to Ease the Stress Response**
> 
> The authors’ advice on easing the stress response complements van der Kolk’s advice in _The Body Keeps the Score_. Like Perry and Winfrey, van der Kolk recommends using rhythm in the healing process. He extends the authors’ point by recommending pairing rhythmic activities with deep breathing (for example, while practicing yoga) to help with regulation and centering.
> 
> Furthermore, while van der Kolk doesn't explicitly mention healing in small doses, he does maintain that trauma treatments shouldn't seek to overwhelm the patient. This is why he argues against Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT addresses trauma by exposing trauma survivors to triggers for extended periods of time, in an attempt to desensitize the patient. Van der Kolk believes that this overtaxes the body’s stress response and could make the patient _more_ susceptible to flashbacks.
> 
> Lastly, van der Kolk agrees with Perry and Winfrey on the importance of engaging with a broad community of people. He notes that trauma can make survivors feel alone and out of sync with others, and having a strong community can help reestablish a sense of connectedness. In particular, he recommends pairing community with physical movement. Group activities such as exercise classes can make trauma survivors feel physically in sync with others, providing a sense of connection.

#### 3) Have Compassion for Yourself and Others

According to Perry and Winfrey, another important element of healing from trauma is having compassion. When a person experiences trauma, they can often feel like something is wrong with them. They might feel that it’s _their_ fault that they can’t sustain a healthy relationship or that seemingly random triggers create anxiety or dissociation. However, Perry and Winfrey emphasize that**having trauma doesn't mean that something is wrong with you**.

This is where the title of the book comes from. Instead of asking ourselves and others “What’s wrong with you?”, Perry and Winfrey say, we should ask, “What happened to you?” This question, which they borrow from the work of psychiatrist Sandra Bloom, shifts the focus from blaming the trauma survivor to understanding their past. It introduces compassion into the healing process and helps the survivor understand that it isn’t their fault.

> **Sandra Bloom and “What Happened to You?”**
> 
> Sandra Bloom is an internationally renowned psychiatrist and author. In her work, she advocates for communication and compassion in trauma care, particularly in institutions such as schools and hospitals. Bloom’s philosophy of asking “What happened to you?” grew out of this work. She explains that well into the 20th century, doctors sent trauma survivors to large institutions that didn't treat the underlying causes of trauma or offer personalized care. Instead, these institutions saw trauma survivors as dangerous and focused on keeping them away from the rest of society.
> 
> Bloom began her work to change the stigma around trauma in the 1970s, inspired by the work of Quaker trauma care centers. These centers, which began in the 19th century, emphasized “moral treatment,” and they created a peaceful community in which trauma survivors could heal. Bloom drew on this theory to develop her own care plans and shift the focus to “What happened to you?” instead of “What’s wrong with you?”
> 
> While people like Bloom are working to reform trauma care, the stigma that trauma survivors are dangerous and should be removed from society continues today. For example, stereotypes depict trauma survivors as “crazy” or as a danger to themselves and to others. These stereotypes and stigmas can make trauma survivors feel like there is something wrong with them, leading to the shame and guilt that Perry and Winfrey mention.

> **_The Body Keeps the Score_ : Other Treatments for Trauma**
> 
> While van der Kolk __ agrees with Perry and Winfrey on the importance of community, regulation, and compassion in treating trauma, he also refers to several other treatments that Perry and Winfrey don’t mention. These include:
> 
> **Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS):** This method of therapy is based on the idea that everyone has different “parts,” or aspects, of their personality—one part of you is more closed-off and private, while another is more childlike and joyful. Together, these parts form an internal “family,” each with different needs.
> 
> The theory of IFS is that trauma disrupts the balance of these different parts, causing some to do more work and others to be locked away. For example, a traumatic event may cause you to be more closed-off to protect yourself from reliving traumatic memories. The closed-off part of your personality therefore takes over, while the childlike, joyful side is hard to access. IFS uses mindfulness and talk therapy to reconcile the different parts of the “family.” This allows the trauma survivor to access all the different parts of her personality, leading to a healthy, whole self.
> 
> **Using touch as a way of healing:** Touch therapy includes massage, hugs, and rocking. This method helps patients become more aware of the sensations in their bodies, including pressure points and tension. It then releases these tensions, helping patients become more comfortable and relieving physical symptoms of trauma.
