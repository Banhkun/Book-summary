## Exercise: Explore Your Childhood Memories

Perry and Winfrey maintain that our early childhood memories have a formative impact on our worldview, behavior, and personality. In this exercise, weâ€™ll explore how your own childhood memories and associations have influenced the way you see the world.

* * *

Think about a difficult memory from your childhood. Describe the memory in detail: What happened? What sensory information (smells, sights, tastes, and sounds) do you remember?

How did the moment make you feel at the time? How do you feel when you remember this moment now?

How do you think that this moment has shaped your perception of yourself and/or the world? (For instance, has the moment changed the way you view and interact with people? Has it led you to perceive the world more negatively? Has it led you to perceive _yourself_ more negatively?)

Perry and Winfrey offer several strategies for processing painful memories, including engaging in a rhythmic activity such as walking or coloring, or talking to a member of your community. Which one to two of these strategies most appeal to you, and why? How might you work them into your daily life? (For instance, you might plan to go on a 15-minute walk every morning.)
