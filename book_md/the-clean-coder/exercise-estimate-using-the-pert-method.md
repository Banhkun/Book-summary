## Exercise: Estimate Using the PERT Method

Program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a method for estimating how long a task will take as a range.

* * *

Think of a task youâ€™re currently working on. What are your best-case, nominal, and worst-case estimates for how long it will take you to do the task?

Describe the probability distribution using the following formula: (Best + (nominal*4) + worst)/6

Calculate the standard deviation (how much uncertainty there is) using this formula: (Worst - best)/6

What is your estimate, given as a range? (Add and subtract the standard deviation to the probability distribution. For example, if the probability distribution is 10 days and the standard deviation is 2 days, the range is 8 (10-2) to 12 (10+2) days.)
