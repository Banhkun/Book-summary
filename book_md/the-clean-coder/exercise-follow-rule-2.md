## Exercise: Follow Rule #2

Martin gives suggested rules for professional conduct, and rule #2 is to avoid coding when worried or tired.

* * *

If you start to feel tired at work, Martin advises you to take a break and recharge. What recharging activities appeal to you and why? (Walk, nap, listen to a podcast, and so on.)

If you’re worried, Martin advises you to spend some addressing the worry to quiet your anxiety so it becomes less distracting. Think of a recent worry. What might you have done to address it? (For example, if you discovered someone had stolen your wallet, you might take a few minutes to call your credit card company and cancel your cards so you don’t spend the day worrying about identity theft.)
