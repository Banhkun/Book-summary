## Exercise: Reflect on Meetings

Meetings can be critical or time-wasting, so you must be strategic about how you approach them.

* * *

Think of an upcoming meeting you’ve been invited to. Does it meet the criteria for being worth your time? (It will give you important information; it’s about an interesting topic; it will allow you to help someone; it has an agenda, schedule, and goal?) How do you know?

Think of a meeting you attended that initially met the criteria but then devolved into a waste of time. Would it have been most appropriate to ask to change the agenda, to ask to speed things up, or to leave? Why?

Think of a meeting you attended that included an argument. What would have been the most effective way to address the argument, gather more data, or vote? Why?
