## Exercise: Is Your Mind Lost?

If our mind is trapped in a negative mindset we can feel lost in our own lives. Even if our circumstances are objectively pretty good, a negative mindset can make us feel miserable, frustrated, and hopeless. It might take a thorough inventory of our thought processes to realize that a negative mindset, rather than our circumstances, is causing our problems.

* * *

Is there an area where you have felt “trapped” or “stuck” in your life?

How have your circumstances impacted that feeling? (Has the feeling remained constant despite changing circumstances? Have you felt like the feeling would go away if your circumstances changed, only to find that it did not?)

Can you identify any thought patterns that might be contributing to that feeling?

What might be some different ways you can think about your situation? How might you change your thought patterns?
