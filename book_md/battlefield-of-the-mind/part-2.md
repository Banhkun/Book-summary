## Part 2: Signs That Our Mind Is Under Attack

We’ve reviewed Meyer’s imagery of our mind as a battlefield between positive and negative forces. We’ve discussed how the Devil makes it his job to attack our minds with negative thoughts while our job is to align our minds with the Holy Spirit and the power of God’s positivity. Part 2 of our summary will mirror Part 2 of Battlefield of the Mind, in which Meyer outlines “conditions” (we’ll call them _signs_) indicating that our mind is out of balance with the Holy Spirit and under attack from the Devil.

### Sign 1: Our Mind Is Unfocused

The devil attacks our minds by preventing us from focusing and by causing our minds to wander. **When our minds can’t focus, we can miss what is happening around us** and lose opportunities to connect with God and other people in a positive way. For example,**** we may miss important messages from God during a sermon or scripture reading if our mind wanders off, or we may lose an opportunity for meaningful conversation if we can’t focus on what the other person is saying.

Meyer gives three main reasons why our mind may wander when we want it to focus. (Shortform note: it's unclear whether these three reasons are how the Devil attacks us or additional factors that affect focus. Meyer seems to be saying that these three factors can make our minds more susceptible to attack.)

  * **Vitamin deficiency:** Meyer notes that B vitamins aid in focus and suggests examining our diet if we have difficulty concentrating. 
  * **Fatigue:** Meyer notes that being extremely tired can prevent us from focusing. 
  * **Lack of discipline:** Meyer suggests that a lack of focus results from failing to discipline our minds. She notes we need to practice controlling our thoughts to develop the skill of focus. 



(Shortform note: Meyer groups these factors together but doesn’t acknowledge a crucial difference between them: The first two indicate _physical_ weaknesses, while the third, a lack of discipline, implies a _character_ weakness. Her inclusion of a character weakness here indicates that she lacks empathy for, and even ignores, the many additional physical or neurological factors that may contribute to a lack of focus. For example, ADHD, dementia, depression, anxiety, OCD, and many other physiological conditions can all impede focus, and although they each have physical or neurological roots, might be interpreted as a lack of discipline, calling into question Meyer’s conclusion in this section.)

A specific way that Meyer warns that the Devil lures our minds away from the present moment is by causing us to “wonder” to excess. Meyer describes a “wondering mind” as one that spends too much time ruminating about future possibilities. **Wondering can be unproductive if we simply waffle between decisions and become indecisive and confused**. For example, we may wonder whether we should send our child to one school over the other. While this is a worthwhile question, once we have all of the information, we would do well to make the best decision we can and move on. Meyer notes that questioning our decisions robs us of the opportunity to experience the present moment in a positive way.

(Shortform note: Meyer seems to be equating “wonder” and worry. Switching the terms may make her meaning more clear, as the word “wonder” does not necessarily carry the negative connotation that she is implying. For example, a Christian may look at nature with a sense of “wonder” and admiration for God’s creation.)

> **Focusing on the Present Moment**
> 
> The idea of being fully engaged in the present moment has gained traction with many people looking to slow down and reclaim joy and fulfillment in their lives. In his self-help book, _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle argues that learning to let go of extraneous thoughts and focusing on the “now” can help us lead more positive lives.
> 
> According to Tolle, one reason that we often find ourselves unhappy and preoccupied is that we focus on the past and future rather than the present. Focusing on the past is unproductive if it brings up negative emotions about something we cannot change. For example, we may become overwhelmed with guilt, regret, and resentment, none of which are conducive to a healthy, happy present. Likewise, focusing on the future can make us anxious and stressed if we simply worry about what might happen rather than planning and taking action in the “now.”
> 
> Since we can’t change the past and we can’t fully control the future, Tolle suggests that we should focus on the only thing we can control: the present.
> 
> Both Meyer and Tolle propose that minding our thoughts can help us find inner peace and reclaim the present moment. Meyer argues that losing the present moment to distraction keeps our minds off our relationship with God. Tolle argues that it keeps our minds off our relationship with our true selves or our “being.” When we train our minds to focus on the “now,” both authors suggest that we can enjoy more positive lives and better relationships with those around us.

### Sign 2: Our Mind Is Full of Uncertainty

Meyer explains that Satan uses “reasoning” to sow seeds of uncertainty in our minds. When our mind is engaged in reasoning, it looks for the logic, or the “why,” behind what we experience. While this curiosity is part of human nature, Meyer cautions that reasoning that leads to confusion has gone “too far.”**If we find ourselves reasoning to the point where we're questioning God’s teachings or our faith, Meyer explains that our search for logic has become a tool for the Devil.**

Reasoning is dangerous, Meyer explains, because if there is a disagreement between our mind and our spirit, **we may reason our way into believing that our rational mind is right and our spirit is wrong.** In doing so, we may talk ourselves out of following God’s will. For example, we might talk ourselves out of volunteering at a charity event because we convince ourselves that we have more important things to do and the event will be fine without us.**** Meyer reminds us that reasoning is subordinate to the spirit in a balanced mind. If logic and reasoning tell us one thing and our spirit tells us another, we should always follow our spirit.

Reasoning can also be dangerous when it makes us question God’s plan for us. This can happen when we have experiences that are difficult for our rational minds to digest—like if we lose our job unexpectedly or a storm damages our property. At such times, we might get caught up asking “why” these things happened, and may end up in a place of confusion and negativity. Meyer advises us to instead turn to our faith, which can help us be at peace with the unanswered “why” behind our experiences more than reasoning can. She explains that **God uses unanswered questions in our lives as a way to solidify our faith, helping us focus less on our worldly issues and more on our spirit**.

Meyer uses her own experiences to propose that letting go of reasoning brings us closer to God and helps us have a more positive life. She explains that pursuing “head knowledge,” or knowledge from reasoning and logic, can make us unhappy and confused. Instead, she advocates for “revelation knowledge,” which she describes as knowledge that comes from God into our spirit. Revelation knowledge, she explains, has allowed her mind to rest.

(Shortform note: Meyer’s discussion of “head knowledge” versus “revelation knowledge” does not go into depth on the limitations or applicability of either. As written, the section suggests that she has “given up” logic and reasoning in general, which seems unrealistic. Her larger message seems to be that logic and reasoning are never-ending pursuits and, as such, if our happiness and peace of mind are contingent upon them, we won’t end up with a positive life.)

> **Science Versus Religion?**
> 
> Meyer’s discussion of the pursuit of “head knowledge” as something to be overcome rather than celebrated can easily be interpreted as anti-science, as she casts the pursuit of logic and reasoning as antithetical to faith. Her portrayal of logic seems to diverge from the ideas proposed by the Vatican and other leading institutions of the Christian faith, which view science (or “head knowledge”) and religion as complementary rather than at odds with each other.
> 
> Some observers point out that some of the most celebrated scientists throughout history have also been Catholics: Descartes, Pascal, Mendel, Pasteur, and Copernicus are just a few examples. In fact, Georges Lemaitre, the cosmologist and Nobel Prize in Physics winner credited with proposing the Big Bang Theory, was a Roman Catholic Priest. Additionally, the Catholic Church has funded institutes of scientific learning (including the Pontifical Academy of Sciences) since the 17th century, and many famous cathedrals worldwide were built not only as places of worship but also as solar observatories.
> 
> Pope John Paul ll explained that science and religion complement each other by saying, "Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish." Therefore, the Church does not ask us to eschew science and reason based on faith but to use our intelligence and curiosity to develop a deeper relationship with God, since, as Christians believe that the universe was created by God, studying God’s creation through science is a way to celebrate His creation.

### Sign 3: Our Mind Is Full of Doubt

Meyer explains that the Devil attacks our minds by sowing seeds of doubt, which is when we believe in God but lack strong faith. **Doubt can make us question our relationship with God and our ability to accomplish our goals.** It can make us feel trapped between knowing what our spirit wants to do and what our rational mind believes is possible. For example, we may feel called by God to fulfill a specific purpose in life, but doubt can make us feel like we lack the ability, talent, or strength to see it through.

Meyer uses Peter walking on water to illustrate the relationship between faith and doubt. She says that God called Peter out of a boat and onto the water during a storm. Because he believed in Jesus, Peter got out of the boat and was able to walk on water. But when he looked around at the power of the storm and began to think rationally about what he was doing, doubt crept into his mind. As soon as he began to doubt, he sank.

Meyer uses this story to remind us that **God will never give us a challenge that we cannot accomplish so long as our faith in Him is strong**. Peter did the impossible until his rational mind made him question his ability. In this way, **faith is our antidote to doubt** —it can offer us mental and spiritual rest because it helps us reject doubt and the discomfort that comes with it.

Meyer warns that if our faith isn’t strong enough, **seeds of doubt can grow deep enough that** **they can lead to _unbelief_** , which is when we’re unwilling or unable to follow God’s word and therefore can’t live a positive life. Meyer suggests that scripture can be a powerful tool in combating unbelief because it contains advice, stories, and lessons that we can apply to our lives. The better we know the written word, the better we can identify passages of scripture that apply to what we're experiencing. Meyer explains that reading or meditating on an applicable passage from scripture may be the exact tool we need to see the path out of unbelief.

> **Doubt and Faith**
> 
> While doubt may be painful for a believer, Christianity recognizes that it's an important component of faith and, in fact, that there can be no true faith without doubt, for if we never encounter doubt, it may mean our spiritual life isn’t deep enough.
> 
> The idea that doubt and faith go hand in hand is well established in the Christian tradition. Sixteenth-century priest St. John of the Cross is perhaps most famous for his poem Dark Night of the Soul, which describes the painful experience of a doubt so deep that it forces an emptying of the soul (which can then be refilled by faith). “Dark night of the soul” has become a colloquialism for a crisis of faith.
> 
> Doubt can and does affect even the most devoted followers of God. Mother Theresa wrote letters to her spiritual advisor admitting that she had deep feelings of doubt despite her devotion to her work. In _Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light: The Private Writings of The Saint of Calcutta, _we see that Mother Teresa felt that the place in her soul where God belonged felt blank, leaving her with a sense of loss, darkness, and longing. While she asked that her letters be kept private, after her death, the Vatican determined that they should be made public, in part, to provide an example of how even saints (she was canonized in 2016) can experience doubt.

### Sign 4: Our Mind Is Full of Anxiety

Meyer argues that if our minds are full of**anxiety and worry, it’s a sign we’re under attack from the Devil, who uses anxiety and worry to torment us and consume our thoughts with negativity**. According to Meyer, worry and anxiety are unproductive emotions that rob us of the present moment, which is a gift from God. She explains that worry and anxiety may begin with seeds planted by the Devil, but they are habit-forming. People can get so accustomed to worrying that their minds are constantly looking for something to worry about. Of course, if we're looking for something to worry about, we’ll certainly find it, even if it means worrying about someone else’s problems.

> **Can Worry Sometimes Help Us?**
> 
> Meyer’s characterization of worry as a “useless” emotion may be too narrow. Dan Harris provides a different view of the utility of worrying in his book _10% Happier._ He proposes that worry can be productive if it alerts us to something we need to address or prepare for. However, like Meyer, Harris cautions that if worrying causes us to ruminate about the same thought over and over, it becomes unhelpful and a waste of energy.
> 
> Similarly to Meyer, Harris suggests policing our thoughts to avoid wasting the present moment worrying. When we catch ourselves worrying, he advises asking ourselves whether the mental energy we're spending is helpful—is it moving us closer to our goal? If it's not, it's time to move on.

Meyer explains that worry can sometimes be a symptom of pride, which also originates from the Devil. Pride can make us feel like we have to solve our own problems without help. **When we feel like we have to (or should be able to) deal with insurmountable problems by ourselves, our minds can quickly become negative.** In contrast, a humble person doesn’t worry because she trusts that God will never give her a problem that she cannot handle with His help. Because of this faith, a humble person can maintain a positive mindset in situations where others succumb to negativity.

> **Our Ego in Our Way**
> 
> Another way that worry can work with pride to hold us back from a positive life is that, as Ryan Holiday discusses in his book _Ego Is the Enemy_ , when we experience setbacks, our egos, fueled by pride, worry that those setbacks reflect a personal character failure that will lead to permanent and complete failure. This worry can occupy us, filling us with negative emotions, making it difficult for us to think with calm, clear minds, and preventing us from seeking solutions to our problems. This can lead to a negative life not only because we are filled with negative, pride-induced worry, but also because our problems then become permanent.
> 
> Like Meyer, Holiday suggests that humility is an antidote to pride. Successful people, he notes, can control their pride so that they don’t get in their own way. One way he suggests keeping pride in check is to stop thinking so much about ourselves. If we can get our mind off of how great we think we are, he argues that we will have more time to actually _do_ the things that will make us successful.

Meyer suggests engaging with the natural world to help manage our worry and anxiety. She explains that if we observe nature, we’ll see how well God cares for His creation. For example, she notes that birds don’t know where their next meal is coming from, but they don’t seem to be filled with worry about it. Like the birds, she says **we should not be consumed with worry about what our future holds or what we have or don't have because God will provide everything we need** to live the life that He intends for us.

> **Nature as an Antidote to Stress**
> 
> Meyer’s suggestion of engaging with nature to help manage worry is backed by a growing body of research. Enjoying nature can lower blood pressure, stress hormones, anxiety, and aggression. It can also calm overactive nervous systems, improve immune system function and self-esteem, and even reduce the time it takes to heal from illness or injury.
> 
> A recent development in this area of research suggests that two hours per week is the minimum amount of time that it takes to experience measurable benefits from immersion in nature.

### Sign 5: Our Mind Is Overly Critical

If we find ourselves feeling lonely and unhappy, it may be because Satan is attacking our minds and leading us to sabotage our relationships. Meyer explains that **Satan tries to convince us to judge and criticize others, thus alienating people and hurting our relationships.**

No one is perfect, and since we're all imperfect, Meyer urges us not to worry so much about what is wrong with other people. God can work on our faults with us, and He can work on others’ faults with them. By “minding our own business” when it comes to others’ faults, we can make more progress on our journey with God and leave ourselves less open to the Devil’s attacks.

Meyer reminds us that judging people is God’s job, not ours. When we judge and criticize, we cast ourselves into the role of God in another person’s life and set ourselves up to receive judgment later. Meyer urges us to remember that God calls us to love each other, not to judge. **When we love people, we automatically look for the _good_ in them, which is the opposite of judgment. **Seeing the good rather than the “bad” in others keeps us in a positive mindset and sets us up to have more positive relationships.

> **The “Pygmalion Effect”: Another Reason to Look for the Good in Others**
> 
> Looking for the good in others not only helps keep our mind positive, but it can also benefit the people we think positive thoughts about. Research shows that when we expect positive results from another person, they often behave more positively. This self-fulfilling prophecy is called the Pygmalion Effect, a term based on the work of psychiatrist Robert Rosenthal.
> 
> One of Rosenthal's studies looked at the performance of a group of elementary students over an academic year. At the beginning of the year, the researchers told teachers that a group of randomly chosen students were on the verge of an “intellectual growth spurt.” At the end of the year, the researchers found that those students actually did perform better than their peers.
> 
> The researchers concluded that the teachers’ positive expectations of the “growth spurt” students accounted for the difference in performance. Since they believed that a specific group of students would succeed, the teachers spent more time with that group and challenged them more than the other students. These results illustrate how our thoughts about someone else shape our actions towards them and, ultimately, their behavior.

### Sign 6: Our Mind Is Complacent

One of the more subtle ways that the Devil can attack our minds and rob us of a positive life is by suppressing our motivation. **If we don’t feel like we are achieving our true potential, it may be because the Devil has caused our mind to become passive.** Meyer describes a passive mind as one that is “lazy” and “apathetic” about its relationship with God, taking that relationship for granted and paying it little attention. She contrasts this with an active mind, which purposefully and effortfully works to cultivate a positive spiritual life.

When our minds are passive rather than active in our approach to spirituality, we may make negative choices simply by not choosing to do anything at all. (Meyer calls these “sins of omission.”) For example, imagine a friend who is having a difficult time in her life. If we have a passive mind, we might not give her situation enough thought to check in, call, or perform an act of kindness for her. While we don't have selfish intentions in this scenario, we’ve failed to be a good (positive) friend by failing to act.

**A passive mind is also dangerous because it leaves empty space for the Devil to move in.** Meyer cautions by not actively thinking of God, we allow the Devil to fill the empty space in our minds with fantasies and daydreams. He can use these fantasies to make us less engaged and less satisfied with reality. Meyer notes that we often experiment with “sinful” thoughts which precede sinful actions through fantasy.

> **The Benefits of a “Passive Mind”**
> 
> Some experts argue that an “idle” mind (what Meyer might term “lazy” or “passive” because it’s not actively involved in conscious, purposeful thought) is not necessarily a negative thing, so long as it doesn’t become a permanent condition. In fact, research suggests that having an “idle” mind in moderation can actually improve our productivity and memory, increase feelings of happiness, strengthen our immune system, and improve our physical health. Additionally, “idle” moments that allow our minds to be still serve as a way to pump the brakes of our lives, helping us to recharge physically and mentally so that we don't “burn out” and can lead happier lives.
> 
> Additionally, allowing our minds to practice “free association and mind wandering” can help us be more creative and innovative. Our minds can become stuck in unproductive thought patterns when we focus too hard on something. People often find that their best ideas come to them when their minds are freer to wander—in the shower, for example.
> 
> Thus, if taken too far, Meyer’s caution against allowing our minds to be “passive” may be _detrimental_ to our spirituality, if it doesn’t allow us to process that spirituality on an unconscious level. The important thing is that a person is generally, overall active in their relationship with God—in this situation, occasionally allowing that relationship to take a back seat might allow them to more spontaneously come up with new and unique ways to be attentive to Jesus (such as coming up with a truly original way to help that friend in need).

#### Competence Can Lead to Complacency

Meyer cautions that sometimes, our talents and capabilities can make us complacent—when we feel as though we’ve mastered something, be it something ‘worldly’ like a sport or spiritual like prayer, we may feel like we have no work left to do, and, as such, we stop working. However, when we stop working on a skill, she explains that that skill will atrophy. Over time, **we can end up in a situation where we think that we're competent in an area when we're simply passive and lazy.**

Meyer uses fitness as an example of complacency. We may think that we're in great shape and become complacent about our exercise routine. Over time, our muscles will atrophy, and should we decide to go for a run, we may be in for a rude awakening.

Likewise, if we have a complacent attitude about our relationship with God, Meyer warns that it too will atrophy. Meyer reminds us that a positive spiritual life takes work. **By keeping our minds active and engaged with God and His teachings daily, we can ensure that we're actively cultivating a positive, God-centered mind.**

> **Engagement to Combat Atrophy**
> 
> Meyer uses a physical analogy to illustrate how complacency can cause something (be it our spirituality or our bodies) to atrophy, but we can also look to neurology for another analogy, for just as our relationship with God and our physical fitness will atrophy if not actively cultivated, so will our mental sharpness if we don’t actively engage it.
> 
> While a decline in certain aspects of cognitive function is normal as we age, research has shown that some atrophy is avoidable, as adults can continue to build new neurons well into their later years. However, sticking with the activities that we're already good at is not the best way to keep our brains sharp. Research shows that participating in novel, mentally-challenging skills is the best way to improve cognitive function as we age.
