## Part 3: Common Negative Mindsets

We’ve discussed Meyer’s ideas about how Satan attacks our minds with negative thoughts and have reviewed signs that he is succeeding. Part 3 will cover Meyer’s ideas about what a mind that succumbs to negative thoughts looks like.

Meyer describes a mind lost in negativity as lost in the “wilderness.” **If we're trapped in a negative mindset, our lives can feel chaotic and unnavigable, even if our circumstances aren’t actually terrible**. She uses the term “wilderness mentality” as a reference to the Israelites, who wandered in the wilderness for 40 years on what should have been an 11 day trip to the promised land (we’ll call “wilderness mentalities” _negative mindsets_).

**Meyer argues that if the Devil can lure us into a negative mindset, he can keep us lost in a cycle of negativity indefinitely** , impeding our ability to move forward in our relationship with God, relationships with other people, and our goals in life. She outlines 10 common negative mindsets that can trap people and some insights on how to escape them.

> **A Negative Thought, or Negative Thinking?**
> 
> There’s a difference between having negative thoughts and becoming trapped in a cycle of negative thinking. Instead of viewing every negative thought as an attack from the Devil, experts urge us to remember that negative thoughts are a normal part of the human experience. In fact, some negative thoughts are justified and can help us process our experiences. However, if we realize that most of our thoughts are negative or that being positive is starting to become difficult, we may be entering a _cycle_ of negativity (what Meyer would call a “wilderness mentality”).
> 
> The following strategies can help us break a cycle of negativity:
> 
>   * Accept negative thoughts (don’t tell yourself that having them is wrong) and then let them go. (We can use the analogy of a thought as a balloon that floats away once we’ve acknowledged it.)
> 
>   * Practice being grateful.
> 
>   * Avoid thinking in absolute terms like “never” and “always.”
> 
>   * Have realistic (and flexible) expectations. If we have unrealistic expectations about something we cannot control, we set ourselves up for disappointment. Keeping a flexible mindset about the future can help us take successes and setbacks as they come.
> 
> 


### Negative Mindset 1: Allowing the Past and Present to Determine the Future

Meyer writes that **Satan can trap us in a negative mindset if he can convince us that a better future is impossible.** Satan can do this by prompting us to see the world through what Meyer calls our "natural eyes," which focus on the physical world. When we focus on the physical world, we can get caught up thinking about negative things that we see in our lives today, that we've seen in the past, that we tell ourselves, and that other people may tell us about our future. **Focusing exclusively on these negative experiences is a self-defeating way to think about our future potential** and can cause us to adopt what Meyer calls a “failure attitude.”

To escape a “failure attitude,” Meyer explains that we must choose to look at the world through “spiritual eyes” as opposed to “natural” eyes. **When we look at the world through “spiritual eyes,” our future is not determined by past or present circumstances but by God’s plan for us**. When we let the Holy Spirit guide our eyes and shape our view of the future, we can be free from negative preconceptions and open to the idea of a future that does not look like our present or our past. Of course, seeing the future with “spiritual eyes” does not mean that our path will be easy, but for a mind lost in negativity, “spiritual eyes” can show us that there is indeed a way out.

> **Using Our “Natural Eyes” to Collect Data**
> 
> In her best-selling book _Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts,_ Annie Duke takes a secular approach in her advice on crafting a more positive future. While Meyer advocates eschewing our “natural eyes” and envisioning the future with “spiritual” ones, Duke argues that we should use what we can observe with our “natural eyes” as data to make smarter choices.
> 
> Duke explains that viewing every decision as a bet can help us be more objective in our reasoning. Like Meyer, Duke acknowledges that wrong beliefs can trap us in a mindset where we're prone to making bad decisions. She uses the term “motivated reasoning” to describe our tendency to continue to believe things even when it's clear that our belief is incorrect. (Meyer might call this a mental stronghold.)
> 
> While Meyer urges readers to use “spiritual eyes” to look past wrong beliefs, Duke urges her readers to imagine forcing themselves to place a bet on that wrong belief. Doing this can help us make choices based on probability and facts rather than emotions. It also forces us to acknowledge that some of our beliefs may be misconceptions. In Duke’s model, everything that we can observe with our “natural eyes” and everything we’ve learned through past experiences become useful pieces of data in casting these bets.

### Negative Mindset 2: Avoiding Responsibility

If we want to live the positive life that God intends for us, we have to be willing to work for it. Meyer refers to this as _taking responsibility for our lives_. **She defines responsibility as our duty to “respond” to the “ability” that God has given us.** She reminds us that God has a plan for each of our lives and has given us each unique abilities, talents, and opportunities. Taking responsibility means using these attributes to build the positive life that God has planned for us. Therefore, responsibility will look different for everyone.

(Shortform note: While Meyer assures us that God has a plan for our lives, it’s unclear how we are meant to know what that plan is.)

Satan tries to stop us from taking responsibility for our future by convincing us that the opportunities that God puts in our path are not right for us. He may tell us that they are too hard, that it’s not the right time to take on a new project, or that a particular role is not the right fit. If we listen to him, Meyer cautions that we may pass up a chance for a better life that will not come around again.

_Accountability_ and _motivation_ can help us ignore Satan’s suggestions. Meyer explains that all responsible people share a feeling of accountability to God, and this accountability fuels an intrinsic motivation to use their gifts to serve Him. Therefore, **even when no one else is watching, a responsible person will continue to seize opportunities for self-improvement.**

> **The Prosperity Gospel**
> 
> * * *
> 
> Meyer’s discussion of responsibility is informed by her involvement in a popular Christian movement referred to as the Prosperity Gospel, which teaches that God wants His followers to be happy, healthy, and wealthy (Meyer is considered to be one of the modern-day leaders of the movement). According to the Prosperity Gospel, so long as we are faithful (responsible), we can expect success to follow. Indeed, in _Battlefield of the Mind_ Meyer does not address the possibility that we might do all the “right” things and still not achieve success in life.
> 
> An article from the Vatican Journal _La Civilta Cattolica_ critiquing the Prosperity Gospel movement (and Meyer in particular) helps to explain why this view is problematic:
> 
>   * The Prosperity Gospel puts the individual, rather than God, at its center. Rather than needing God’s salvation, in this doctrine, we're owed something by God and are rewarded for our efforts with health and wealth. As Pope Francis wrote on the subject: “The result is a self-centered and elitist complacency, bereft of true love.”
> 

>   * The Prosperity Gospel can make followers less empathetic. If God rewards the faithful with wealth and health, then those who are poor and suffering must, by extension, not be as “worthy” as the rich. The idea that “worthy” people are doing well can make people less inclined to help others.
> 

> 
> In 2019, Meyer herself acknowledged that her views on the Bible’s promise of wealth and health “got out of balance,” and conceded that her views on faith and prosperity lacked empathy for the misfortunes of others. Therefore, a revised edition of _Battlefield of the Mind_ might include some discussion of the possibility that our efforts to take responsibility for our lives might not always be successful.

### Negative Mindset 3: A Self-Defeating Attitude

Meyer writes that **Satan tries to keep our minds negative by convincing us to use negative language when things get hard, which can trap us in a negative mindset**. Statements such as “this is too hard” or “I can’t do this” lead to more negative thoughts and can actually make difficult things more difficult. Therefore, Meyer urges us to stop talking about how hard things are because it only makes us more likely to fail.

In contrast, keeping our language positive when encountering adversity makes us more likely to succeed. But this does not mean that we have to pretend that difficult things are easy. **We can acknowledge our suffering while keeping our language, and by extension, our attitude, focused on the positive**. For example, instead of saying “this is too hard” in response to a challenge, we could say, “yes, this is difficult, but I know that I will be stronger for having gone through it.” Meyer encourages us to stay positive through adversity by reminding us that the Holy Spirit will always lead us out of the wilderness so long as we have faith, but our route will not always be easy.

Framing challenging circumstances in light of our spiritual growth is a powerful tool in maintaining a positive mind and a positive life. Meyer explains that **experiencing hardship teaches us to rely on God rather than ourselves.** To reap the full benefits of weathering adversity, we have to trust that there is utility in difficulty and that it's part of God’s plan.

> **Physical Benefits of a Positive Emotional Style**
> 
> Meyer’s suggestion that a negative mindset causes negative outcomes is supported by two widely cited studies from the medical field.
> 
> In one, researchers found that people with a more “negative emotional style” (more prone to hostility, anxiety, and depression) were more likely to both contract and report negative symptoms from the common cold than people with a more positive emotional style. The results even showed that people with a more negative style reported more “unfounded” symptoms than those who were more positive. These results suggest both physiological and emotional benefits to being positive.
> 
> A follow-up study corroborated these results with an additional level of scientific rigor. The researchers found that a positive emotional style was protective against both the common cold and the flu. Once again, the more positive personalities reported fewer symptoms of illness. The authors concluded that having a positive outlook is likely an important factor in overall health and wellness.

### Negative Mindset 4: Being Indignant

Having the wrong attitude about suffering can keep us in a negative mindset. Meyer explains that **too often, we approach suffering with indignation**. When we suffer, we feel wronged and become unhappy and unsatisfied with our circumstances. But Meyer explains that this is unproductive. She notes that God expects us to endure some suffering in our lives. Rather than seeing suffering as an injustice, Meyer suggests that we view**suffering as a crucible through which we strengthen our faith.**

Meyer explains that gratitude is an antidote to indignation. The key to becoming closer to God through our suffering is finding a way to give thanks no matter the circumstances. Meyer suggests making our prayers about thanks instead of complaints. She clarifies that it's ok to ask God for the things we want or need, but the **spirit of our prayers should be one of gratitude and optimism rather than one of discontent.**

Focusing on gratitude rather than indignation will allow us to enjoy a more positive mind and thus a more positive life. This positivity won’t just benefit us but will radiate to those around us. Meyer explains that when we approach suffering with grace and optimism, we give other people an example of how to live.

> **Accepting Negative Emotions**
> 
> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson also suggests that there is utility in suffering. According to Manson, humans are biologically hardwired for suffering and dissatisfaction, and these feelings can actually be useful because they fuel a desire for self-improvement. However, Manson’s view of how we should handle the emotions that accompany suffering is different from Meyer’s. While Meyer suggests that we need to find a way to be positive and grateful even in the worst of circumstances, Manson suggests that the idea that we have to stay positive all the time is unrealistic.
> 
> Manson blames the media-driven self-help movement (of which Meyer is a part) for popularizing unhelpful ideas about negative thoughts. He argues that the push for relentless positivity can make people feel like they are failing when they are not able to immediately banish negative thoughts from their minds. While he does not suggest that people allow themselves to wallow in self-pity when things go wrong (he also stresses the importance of taking responsibility for our lives and making the best of our situation) he does remind us that negative emotions are normal, and in fact, that they can be useful because they serve as a signal that we need to make a change in our life.

### Negative Mindset 5: Being Impatient

Meyer proposes that we need to be patient to enjoy a positive life. Having patience means being positive while waiting for things in our lives. When we’re impatient for our lives to get better, we can end up trapped in a negative mindset because we have an excuse to not be positive _right now_. Meyer explains that we spend most of our lives waiting for something to happen. Many of us live in a pattern of expectantly waiting for something, briefly rejoicing when we get it, and then going right back to waiting for the next thing. While it's human nature to always have a goal to work towards, **if we don't know how to be patient between our successes, we can easily be consumed with impatience and the negativity that comes with it**.

> **Impatience as a Universal Experience**
> 
> Meyer portrays impatience as an inherently negative experience. But, psychologist Jim Stone explains that impatience is a more complicated emotion than its colloquial use suggests and is in itself neither positive nor negative. Stone explains that impatience is our natural reaction when we realize that it will be more difficult to reach our goals than we initially thought. We respond to this realization by looking for alternative ways of accomplishing our goal. Together, our mental and physical reaction to a setback produces the experience of impatience.
> 
> Impatience can be useful at times. Stone points out that impatience likely served an evolutionary purpose. If hunter-gatherers realized that it took too long to find food using a particular method or location, their impatience would have prompted them to switch strategies. Today, impatience can help us realize when something in our life (something as small as a traffic jam or as significant as a relationship) takes more effort than it should, which can lead us to seek alternatives.
> 
> Like Meyer, Stone acknowledges that impatience can also be detrimental and potentially dangerous, citing a person trying to get out of a traffic jam and causing an accident as an example. Similar to Meyer’s argument, he notes that impatience and indignation combined can be a particularly destructive force in our lives. He explains that when we experience a setback that feels unfair (what Meyer might describe as pride), we're particularly prone to making rash, self-destructive decisions. Humility can help us avoid a negative mindset and poor choices in such a situation.

Meyer explains that trials in our life help us learn patience and humility because they force us to work through our negative tendencies like pride, anger, and self-pity. Once we’ve worked through these emotions, Meyer explains that **we’ll accept that God’s plan for us might not involve getting what we want right now.**

The humility and patience that we gain through trials also make us less vulnerable to Satan’s attacks on our minds. Meyer explains that Satan uses impatience and pride to make our minds overly idealistic. If he can convince us to have unrealistic expectations, Satan can bombard our minds with constant feelings of discontent, suggesting that things are not happening fast enough, that what we have is not good enough, or that we're not getting what we deserve. However, a patient and humble mind expects setbacks and does not expect perfection, and as such, can be both optimistic and realistic.

> **“Realistic Optimism”**
> 
> Being overly idealistic and expecting things to work in our favor ‘right now' makes our mind vulnerable to negativity and, according to the authors of a paper on our brains’ response to uncertainty, is a predictor of failure.
> 
> The authors explain that when we're unrealistically optimistic, we're not mentally or emotionally prepared when success doesn’t come easily. Being unprepared means that setbacks can send us into a self-defeating negative spiral. They use the term “realistic optimism” to describe a belief that we’ll succeed, paired with the expectation that success will not be easy. This “realistic optimism” is a healthier and more sustainable mindset because it trains our minds to be mostly positive while leaving space for things not to go our way.

### Negative Mindset 6: Making Excuses

Satan tries to keep us in a negative mindset by impeding our self-awareness. He does this by **convincing us to blame other people or difficult circumstances for our flaws and bad decisions.** “If” and “but” are two words that Satan plants in our minds so that we keep making excuses for our problems. Meyer writes that we should be wary of thoughts such as “I could be positive _if_ …” or “I would be positive _but_..”. Satan uses phrases like these to keep us from acknowledging our role in our problems and prevent us from developing the self-awareness needed for a positive life.

**It can be painful to realize that we're the reason for our problems, but Meyer writes that we're free to change for the better once we do.** She explains that God is always ready to forgive us our sins, so long as we take full responsibility for them. But when we outsource blame, we also outsource agency in our life. Once we can ask for God’s forgiveness without accompanying excuses, we’ll be ready to internalize His unconditional love and assume full responsibility for a positive life.

> **Blame as Avoidance**
> 
> While Meyer argues that blame stems from an attack by the Devil, psychologist Bernard Golden argues that blame comes from our desire to avoid painful feelings such as shame and regret.
> 
> Like Meyer, Golden explains that we often use “ _If_ …” statements to deflect responsibility for our reaction to a situation. For example, “If he hadn’t been so mean to me, I wouldn’t have yelled at him.” Golden notes that while statements like this can preserve our self-esteem in the moment, they ultimately interfere with self-awareness and self-worth.
> 
> Golden explains that when we blame others, we rob ourselves of the chance to become more resilient, happier people. While blame may make us feel temporarily justified in our wrongness, **it ultimately reinforces the idea that we're not in control of our lives.** If we accept that we're victims of our circumstances, we're unlikely to take the time to reflect on our choices. If blaming rather than reflecting becomes our default mentality, we can end up feeling powerless and anxious.
> 
> Like Meyer, Golden suggests compassion as the antidote to blame. While Meyer urges readers to ask God’s forgiveness for bad choices, Golden proposes that we can live happier lives by simply accepting rather than judging ourselves. The takeaway message from both authors is that we can break the negative mindset that causes us to default to blame by coming to terms with our imperfections.

### Negative Mindset 7: Self-Pity

Meyer explains that **Satan tries to trap us in a negative mindset by fueling an addiction to self-pity.** While indulging in self-pity may make us feel better when things don’t go our way, it's destructive because it traps our minds in negative past experiences.

Self-pity also robs us of a sense of agency in our lives. When we feel sorry for ourselves, we cast ourselves as the victims of our stories, which means we lack the power to change our circumstances. **Meyer explains that we cannot be both pitiful and powerful.** If we hope to have a positive mind, we need to stop thinking about what has been done _to_ us and start thinking about what _we_ can do through our faith in God.

Because self-pity is an inherently selfish emotion, Meyer suggests that **the best way to defeat it's to look at a situation from someone else’s perspective**. Not only will this help us focus less on our problems (which is what Satan wants us to do), but it can help us to be a positive presence in the lives of others. If we can cast our attention off ourselves and onto someone else even during difficult times, Meyer explains that we’ll no longer feel like victims and have a more positive outlook.

> **Training Our Mind Away From Self-Pity**
> 
> We can learn to break the habit of self-pity by practicing thought exercises that build mental strength. Best-selling author and psychotherapist Amy Morin explains that “throwing a pity-party” when things don’t go our way is a self-destructive habit that we can train ourselves to break.
> 
> She argues that negative feelings are natural, but dwelling on them is a choice. The key, she claims, is to accept any negative feelings we may have and then promptly move on without allowing them to rob us of our valuable time.
> 
> Morin lists several ways that “mentally strong people” avoid self-pity's “downward spiral,” including:
> 
>   * Recognizing when our mind is at risk of spiraling into self-pity
> 
>   * Taking negative thoughts as a challenge (for example, if we think we could never run a 10-minute mile, then a 10-minute mile would become our goal)
> 
>   * Practicing gratitude instead of complaining (mirroring Meyer’s earlier recommendation to direct your prayers toward thanks, not complaints)
> 
>   * Questioning whether our pitiful thoughts are rational (which you can do by following Meyer’s advice to look at your situation from someone else’s perspective)
> 
> 

> 
> In addition to the strategies listed above, Morin, like Meyer, suggests that helping other people can be an antidote to self-pity. Helping others can remind us of how fortunate we are and can take our minds off our problems.

### Negative Mindset 8: Feeling Unworthy

Meyer argues that Satan tries to keep us in a negative mindset by making us feel unworthy of a positive life. She explains that **most of our problems are the product of negative feelings we have about _ourselves_.** Satan tries to make us feel bad for all of our missteps and failures. He uses any opportunity to convince us that we're unworthy, unlikeable, or unloveable. We’ll always find something to feel bad about if we listen to him.

Feelings of unworthiness will impact our relationships, goals, and outlook. We may lower our expectations, sabotage relationships, and expect failure from life because we believe that is what we deserve. At the extreme, our self-worth may sink so low that we stop envisioning a positive life altogether.

The biggest problem with listening to Satan’s attacks on our self-worth is that **we can convince ourselves that we're unworthy of God’s love and forgiveness.** Meyer explains that feelings of disgrace, blame, and shame make us unable to forgive ourselves for our flaws and mistakes. If we cannot forgive ourselves, we may feel like we're so terrible that God won’t forgive us either.

Contrary to what Satan tries to tell us, Meyer reminds us that we don’t need to earn God’s forgiveness, because God’s forgiveness is unconditional, as long as we ask for it with our whole mind and spirit. She argues that **if we wait until we're “good enough” to be forgiven by God, we’ll never get there, because we’ll always be imperfect**. Instead, we should accept that God loves us in our imperfect state and move forward.

> **Self-Worth Versus Self-Esteem**
> 
> Licensed clinical psychologist Adia Gooden also discusses the importance of accepting ourselves as we are. Like Meyer, Gooden explains that feeling like we need to change something about ourselves before we can feel “worthy” is an exercise in futility.
> 
> But Gooden goes more in-depth than Meyer, explaining that, unlike self-esteem, which is based on external factors like our appearance, performance at work, and so on, our _self-worth_ concerns our perception of our _existential value_. Basically, **our self-worth is a measure of how entitled we feel to “take up space” in the world.** While self-esteem can fluctuate based on external metrics of success, our self-worth is more deeply rooted and thus more constant.
> 
> Gooden lays out three ways, in addition to self-acceptance, to improve our self-worth by changing our thinking:
> 
>   * We can forgive ourselves for mistakes we’ve made in the past. We can’t feel worthy if we're angry and disappointed with ourselves.
> 
>   * We can have compassion for ourselves when we're feeling our worst.
> 
>   * We can foster and strengthen interpersonal connections to have a strong support system.
> 
> 

> 
> Gooden’s advice is similar to Meyer’s, except that according to Gooden, our ultimate source of love and forgiveness comes from deep within ourselves rather than from God.

### Negative Mindset 9: Being Jealous

Meyer contends that Satan tries to trap us in a negative mindset by convincing us that our life is worse than everyone else’s, thus stoking jealousy. If we become jealous of everyone else’s life, we’ll stop enjoying our own. Meyer explains that **Satan uses our insecurities to fuel our jealousy.** When we feel insecure, seeing other people succeed can make us unhappy because we focus on what _we_ haven’t accomplished or what _we_ don't have. If Satan can keep us focused on the things our life lacks, he can blind us to the fact that God has set each of us on a unique and valuable path.

Meyer recognizes that comparing ourselves to others is a tough habit to change. Many of us live in a culture of constant competition, where our value as a person is measured by how “successful” we are. But while **beating someone else may increase our value in _our_ eyes, it doesn’t increase our value to God**. Meyer urges us to remember that this culture of competition is man-made, not God-made, and that buying into the idea that we need to be at the top of our field to have value causes us to miss opportunities to enjoy our lives as they are.

In addition to preventing us from enjoying our lives, Meyer notes that jealousy signifies that we may not be ready to receive God’s blessings. She explains that God wants to bless us, but he will not give us blessings that we're not mature enough to handle. If our minds are trapped in a place of jealousy, it may be part of God’s plan to make us wait for blessings.

> **The Role of Social Media in Fueling Jealousy**
> 
> Studies show that technology and social media exacerbate our insecurity and jealousy. This happens because people generally only post the very best moments and details of their lives online so that when we scroll through social media, it looks like everyone else’s lives are better than ours.
> 
> Research shows that looking at social media leads to negative emotions because seeing something we want but don’t have can be an emotional trigger. This can even happen when we see our own lives posted on social media because when we look at our idealized version of ourselves, we may feel inauthentic and like we're failing.
> 
> Psychologists agree with Meyer that constantly comparing ourselves to other people can trap us in a negative mindset. They note that unfortunately, this problem can be hard to avoid as a great deal of modern life takes place online. Experts advise that to prevent negative emotions, you first remind yourself that social media is not “real life,” but that you also consider using feelings of envy for self-improvement. They suggest that if we see a post or photo that triggers our envy and insecurity, we try to understand what elements of that post we think are lacking in our lives. We can use these triggers as clues to areas we may want to focus on cultivating ourselves. Meyer might add that we can similarly use jealousy triggers to show us where we need to strengthen our relationship with God.

### Negative Mindset 10: Being Disobedient

Meyer suggests that obedience to God is necessary for a happy life. However, as Meyer points out, many people choose to seek God only when they are going through difficult times or are in particular need of His help but talk themselves out of following His will when things are going well. **When we feel secure in our worldly success, it can be difficult to deviate from our plan to follow God’s plan instead.**

Meyer argues that a lack of obedience to God shows a lack of respect. She emphasizes that God has a plan for each of our lives, but we cannot be tools for His will if we're stubborn and rebellious. To lead a truly positive life, she explains that we need to be willing to follow God’s will at all times and without excuses.

Meyer urges us to remember that our obedience to God affects those around us. If we follow His will, we’ll be a positive influence in the lives of others. She notes that our lives would be better today if all of the people we’ve been affected by were obedient to God. Parents, she argues, would do well to keep this in mind because a parent’s disobedience today can impact their child’s future. She explains that if parents choose not to follow the will of God, they are not giving their children the best start on their path toward a positive life.

> **Believing in God’s Plan for Us**
> 
> In the Christian theological tradition, obedience to God does not mean following a specific, predetermined plan for our lives the way Meyer describes it. In fact, Baptist minister Mark Woods proposes that believing that God has a specific plan for our lives is “theologically flawed." He explains that two problematic views of God can lead to such a belief.
> 
> Woods explains that some people ascribe to a “deterministic” view of God, where everything that happens, good and bad, is part of His divine plan. In this view, we accept all of the bad things that happen in the world as part of the “greater good,” trusting that everything happens for a reason, thus encouraging us not to question the plan and instead to be blindly obedient.
> 
> Woods highlights two problems with this view:
> 
>   * The idea that there is an ultimate plan for the world and that our lives are part of that plan precludes the existence of free will and negates moral agency. If God has everything planned out, then our choices don’t matter.
> 
>   * For the “deterministic” view to be true, God would need to be cruel. Woods points out that truly terrible things happen in the world that a loving God would never plan.
> 
> 

> 
> The other view that Woods critiques is that God, as Meyer proposes, has laid out a “roadmap” for each of our lives that will lead to us being satisfied and content. In this view, we expect good things to happen to us, and we accept them easily as part of God’s plan when they do. When they don’t, we assume that we’ve failed God or that He is testing us. Woods calls this view of God and life “materialist and consumerist” because it frames faith as a transaction. When we do the “right” thing, we get a reward.
> 
> Woods explains that neither of these views is a healthy conceptualization of God and His role in our lives. He suggests that instead of thinking of God as _planning_ our lives, we think of Him as _wanting_ the best for us. In this view, God is akin to a loving parent. He wants a good life for us, He has given us the tools to mature as His children, and he is always there to support us. But He does not make our choices or lay out our path for us.
