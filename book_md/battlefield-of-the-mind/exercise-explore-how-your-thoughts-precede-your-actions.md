## Exercise: Explore How Your Thoughts Precede Your Actions

Meyer explains that negative thoughts precede negative words and actions. Other people use those words and actions to form their opinions about us.

* * *

Think about the last time you were disappointed with your choice of words and actions while interacting with another person. What did you say or do that you wish you hadnâ€™t?

Now think about the thoughts that preceded those words and actions. How would you characterize them?

How do you think your thoughts impacted your interaction?

How can you apply this insight to future interactions?
