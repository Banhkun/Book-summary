## Part 4: Cultivating a Positive Mind

We’ve reviewed Meyer’s ideas about how Satan tries to corrupt our minds with negative thoughts. We’ve explored her 10 common mindsets indicative of a mind trapped in Satan’s negativity. Part 4 will explore Meyer’s ideas about how we can fight off Satan’s attacks and cultivate a positive mind aligned with God’s way of thinking.

### Our Weapons Against Negativity

Meyer explains that **the word of God is our primary weapon against Satan’s negativity**. We use it in three main forms: the written word (scripture), praise, and prayer.

#### Scripture

Meyer argues that**the written word of God provides us with an arsenal of positive messages that we can use when our mind is under attack from the Devil**. She explains that consequently, the more time we spend thinking about and studying the written word, the easier it will be for us to fight off Satan—when we know scripture well, we can easily recall helpful passages from the Bible to apply to any situation where Satan tries to corrupt our thoughts.

In addition to helping us recall God’s messages when we need them, Meyer proposes**that when we can apply the _meaning_ of scripture to our lives, our protection from negativity becomes more powerful. **She explains that there are “treasures” and “secrets” hidden in the written word that we can reveal only by taking the time to think deeply about its meaning. The more time we spend studying scripture, the more we’ll get out of it. She explains that when she reads and meditates on a familiar passage of scripture, she often finds new meaning in it that she had never seen before.

> **Finding Meaning in Scripture**
> 
> Meyer’s discussion of gleaning deeper meaning from scripture downplays the academic rigor required to interpret the Bible correctly, and therefore weakens her argument that we can rely on scripture to fight Satan. Most readers don't have the theological training or expertise to reliably uncover personal meaning from the Bible that is consistent with the text's original meaning, and thus, simply reading the Bible is often not enough to properly interpret it. 
> 
> Jason DeRouchie, a professor of biblical theology, explains that the role of scripture is not to create meaning for readers but to convey meaning. Our job as readers is not to use scripture to generate meaning for our lives. Rather, our job is to read scripture as scholars of a historical text, compiled over generations, written by many authors, in many languages, and rich in political and cultural history. Just as we would be met with raised eyebrows if we gave “our version” of World War 2 in history class, we are not each academically invited to have “our version” of scripture.
> 
> DeRouchie outlines specific instructions for how to interpret scripture accurately. These include studying its grammar, the translation of keywords, and its historical and literary context, among others. From this, we can see that to get the deeper meaning of scripture takes active academic study. We can enjoy reading scripture independently and are free to interpret it as we choose. But to understand the Bible in the Christian tradition and to claim the authority to interpret it accurately is a rigorous undertaking.

#### Praise

Meyer writes that**the quickest way to defeat the Devil is with praise for God that comes from the heart**. Praise is the expression of gratitude and appreciation for all God has done for us. It’s powerful because it represents true thankfulness for God’s blessings in our life, given without reservation, and coming from a place of peace and contentment. **If we're truly thankful and content regardless of our circumstances, there will be no place where the devil can penetrate our minds.**

> **The Power of Words**
> 
> Not only do our thoughts shape our reality, as Meyer proposes, but the specific words we choose have generative power—that is, they create our circumstances. When we talk to other people, we do this carefully and consciously, because we know what sort of relationship we're trying to cultivate with them and we choose words that reflect that desire. However, the way we talk to ourselves often lacks the same care. While this may not seem like a big deal, psychologists believe that the way we talk (and think) to ourselves has an impact on our mental health.
> 
> Experts propose that making even subtle shifts in our self-talk can change our life. For example, if we substitute the phrase “I _have_ to” with “I _get_ to,” we’ll emphasize opportunity over obligation. And instead of saying (or thinking) that we're “ _going”_ through something difficult, we might say we’re “ _growing_ ” through something difficult. In this way, we can feel empowered rather than victimized and grateful rather than discontented.
> 
> Psychologists thus argue that by using more optimistic language, we can lead happier lives, mirroring Meyer’s view that simply changing our language may make us better able to praise God for the positives we have in life. By speaking positively, even if our circumstances haven’t changed, we’ll be less susceptible to negativity.

#### Prayer

Meyer also writes that we can grow our relationship with God through prayer, a third form of the word of God. Meyer explains that **prayer can take multiple forms**. We can pray with our mind, with our spirit, and with our mind and spirit simultaneously.

##### Praying With Our Mind

Meyer explains that praying with our mind starts with rational thoughts. For example, we may hear about something on the news and decide to pray for those involved. This type of prayer is valuable because it directly connects our prayer life to everyday life. But, Meyer explains that it can sometimes be overly rational and emotionless.

(Shortform note: While Christian tradition does not divide prayer into the same categories as Meyer, her description of praying with her mind most closely parallels the types of prayer that Catholics would call “petition” (which is asking God for the things we need) and “intercession” (which is praying on behalf of others).)

##### Praying With Our Spirit

In contrast to rational prayer from our mind, Meyer explains that prayer that comes from our spirit is all about our feelings. **When we pray with our spirit, emotions too deep or abstract to put into words flow out of us.** Sometimes these feelings are our own; for example, we may pray with our spirit about a deep sense of longing that we cannot rationally explain.

Meyer explains that the feelings our spirits pray about sometimes come directly from the Holy Spirit. She explains that the **Holy Spirit can guide us to pray about something God wants us to focus on, but our rational mind has yet to understand**. Meyer refers to this as praying “in tongues”.

(Shortform note: The practice of speaking in tongues is often referred to as _glossolalia_ (from the Greek for tongue). It is most common in the Pentecostal Christian tradition, which Meyer represents. Some followers of this tradition (including Meyer) maintain that speaking in tongues is a “supernatural outpouring” from the Holy Spirit, which can then be interpreted by oneself or another member of the congregation for the benefit of the larger group.)

##### Praying With Our Mind and Spirit Together

**When we accept the Holy Spirit as our guide, we can pray with our mind and spirit united.** Meyer explains that this type of prayer is particularly powerful because it allows our thoughts and feelings to work together. For example, a prayer that starts as rational thought, say, “God, please help the victims of the hurricane,” can turn into a more profound prayer when we feel connected to the issue through our spirit.

The Holy Spirit can also help our rational mind make sense of prayers from our spirit. For example, Meyer explains that the Holy Spirit may call us to pray about something we don't fully understand. If our minds and spirits work together, the Holy Spirit’s message may take a more coherent shape.

(Shortform note: In her discussion of prayer, Meyer does not mention the Our Father (The Lord’s Prayer). Christian understanding of prayer comes from this prayer in particular. For Christians, it serves as a model for how people “should” speak to God, inviting them to pray with both their minds and their spirits. It is _the_ foundational Christian prayer and is the only prayer that Jesus actually taught His followers to pray. Readers who, after reading Meyer’s description of prayer, might not know where to start in their own prayer life, can start there.)

> **Meditation and Prayer**
> 
> Both Meyer and the Catholic Church caution against equating prayer with eastern non-Christian meditation. Meyer explains that many Christians are “fearful” of the term “meditation” because they associate it with “pagan” and “occult” religions. She casts meditation in this context in a firmly negative light, calling it a “perversion” by Satan for the purposes of evil.
> 
> The Catholic church takes a more diplomatic view of the desire of many modern Christians to incorporate meditation into their lives. Some Catholic scholars attribute the increased popularity of meditation and eastern religions to people’s desire for connection in our largely technologically-based culture. However, while it has many benefits, meditation in the context of eastern religions does not foster a connection to God in the Christian tradition for multiple reasons.
> 
>   * The Christian faith is based on a relationship with God. For Christians, prayer is a way of tapping into and strengthening that relationship. As such, prayer requires two entities (us and God). Many forms of meditation invite practitioners to focus on themselves, their physical bodies, their breath, and so on as a means of connecting with divinity. Leaving God out of the equation means that mediation, by definition, cannot be a Christian prayer. 
> 

>   * Meditation often focuses on transcending this worldly plane to tap into the divine. But Christians believe that God’s love (the Holy Spirit) and his literal presence (Jesus) are/were here on Earth. Therefore, Christians don't need to transcend daily life to find God, and to suggest that they do would be to reject a central tenet of the Christian faith.
> 

> 
> The authors do note that the increased interest in meditation and eastern religions has had the benefit of making more people realize that the position of their body influences their prayers. They explain that we can use body positions to add meaning and depth to our prayer life. For example, breathing practices can promote relaxation and overall engagement during prayer, and our body position during a prayer can act as a symbol of its meaning. However, they caution that feelings of relaxation or other physical sensations resulting from a physical component of prayer should not be interpreted as a literal connection with the Holy Spirit.

### Thinking Like Jesus

Meyer explains that Jesus is the paragon of maintaining a positive mind in the face of suffering. Therefore, as we try to live a positive life ourselves, we should try to emulate his mindset. While this may seem like an impossible task, Meyer reminds us that **God invites** **all Christians to share the mind of Christ through the Holy Spirit**. She outlines steps that can help us think like Jesus. Following these steps will keep our minds positive no matter the circumstances.

(Shortform note: Meyer outlined six separate steps, but some of them mirror each other or repeat previous discussions, so we’ve condensed them into three.)

#### Step 1: Be positive

To think like Jesus, we should always look for something positive to think, do, or say. Meyer explains that Jesus was always positive in the face of suffering and adversity. She argues that in every situation, we can choose to follow a path of “death” (which we’ll continue to call negative thoughts and actions) or “life” (which we’ll continue to call positive thoughts and actions). Meyer argues that **if we’ve aligned our mind with the mind of Jesus, we’ll find a way to see and do things from a place of positivity, even when we face situations that seem hopeless or joyless.**

Thinking like Jesus means **looking for the _good_ in those around us.** As Meyer has mentioned earlier, we all get a positive lift when we think kind and encouraging thoughts about other people because those kind thoughts become kind words and actions.

> **Balancing Positive and Negative Thoughts**
> 
> In her bestselling book _The Secret_ , Rhonda Byrne proposes a math-based reason for why we should always look for a reason to be positive about ourselves, about others, and about our lives. In contrast to Meyer, Byrne writes that it's unrealistic to expect ourselves to be exclusively positive in every situation. The key, she explains, is to make sure that our ratio of positive to negative thoughts remains tipped in the positive direction.
> 
> Byrne explains that each time we think a positive thought, we add “weight” to the positive side of the scale. Byrne explains that as these positive thoughts accumulate, living a positive life becomes easier and easier. If we start the day positively, that momentum will carry us into a happier day. If we start the day on a negative note, we’ll only make it more difficult to be positive later because we’ll have added weight to the negative side of the scale.
> 
> Thinking about positivity as a ratio is helpful because it effectively shows why taking every opportunity to be positive matters. One negative thought in a sea of positive thoughts is unlikely to derail a positive mind. But if we're negative as much as we're positive, then any additional negative thought could be the tipping point into a negative day.

Meyer explains that aligning our minds with Jesus’s mind lifts us up not only mentally and spiritually but physically. When we allow God to guide us in a positive life, we can stand taller and hold our heads higher. Meyer adds that her physical appearance has improved since cultivating a positive mind because her positivity radiates from the inside out.

In contrast, Meyer argues that Satan’s attacks can physically bring us down. She notes that attacks from the Devil can cause us to hang our heads and slump our shoulders and even feel like we need to lay down. At the extreme, we may become clinically depressed by Satan’s attacks.

> **Stress and Posture**
> 
> Research has shown that maintaining upright posture when we feel stressed can actually have measurable physiological benefits. A study of the effect of posture on participants’ response to emotional stress showed that sitting up straight helped people maintain their self-esteem and positive mood during an emotionally stressful situation. Sitting upright also helped people focus less on themselves (which Meyer has argued is an effective strategy in combating a negative mindset). Researchers concluded that proper posture may be an easy way for people to combat the effects of stress. In light of this study, Meyer might add posture as a weapon in our arsenal against Satan’s attacks.

##### Overcoming Depression

Meyer notes that modeling ourselves on Jesus's mindset can help overcome depression. She outlines several steps to overcoming depression and regaining a positive life:

(Shortform note: We’ve merged Meyer’s eight steps to overcoming depression into four to avoid repetition.)

**Step 1:** Recognize Satan as the source of the problem.

**Step 2:** Take early action. Meyer notes that the longer Satan’s seeds of negativity are allowed to grow, the more difficult it will be to get rid of them. If we start to feel powerless in our lives, we should use that feeling as a warning sign that Satan may be driving us towards depression.

**Step 3:** Focus on the positives. Meyer explains that remembering good times in our lives can lift us up and give us a frame of reference for what we're fighting for.

**Step 4:** Look for relief in God. Meyer explains that if we feel depressed, we should not look for ‘worldly’ fixes to our problems but instead focus on our relationship with God. She explains people who are depressed often look for relief in the wrong places, but anything other than a positive relationship with God will be a bandaid, not a cure. Therefore, if we're feeling depressed, Meyer explains that we need to open our minds and spirits to God, ask for His help, and allow Him to guide us out of negativity.

> **Battlefield of the Mind Is _Not_ Clinical Advice**
> 
> In outlining steps to overcome depression, Meyer opens herself to criticism by giving what can be considered unfounded clinical advice. Meyer recognizes the seriousness of depression in her discussion of suicide as a worst-case outcome of the disease, yet does not suggest that people struggling with depression seek professional help.
> 
> A paper from the University of Leicester providing a “psychoanalytically informed” discussion of Meyer discusses why her foray into providing clinical advice may be ill-advised. The authors of the paper note that Meyer’s teachings employ therapeutic language when discussing their followers’ mental problems but then fail to employ appropriate clinical approaches to address them. The authors note that Meyer consistently fails to acknowledge the “biological, social, and experiential causes” of psychological disorders and, as such, does not suggest medication or professional help as a treatment option. In fact, her admonition to avoid “worldly” fixes seems to specifically advise _against_ seeking help from sources like professional psychologists or medication—advice that might cause people to delay getting meaningful help.
> 
> While her advice to seek help early and to focus on positives echoes some aspects of more traditional advice, her teachings depart from mainstream psychological recommendations in that it encourages people to see their issues as stemming from “supernatural” causes. Outsourcing our negative thoughts and feelings to Satan fails to acknowledge the complexity of human emotions and runs counter to psychotherapy, which encourages people to better understand and work through their thoughts and feelings. The authors note that for people who suffer from certain disorders such as bipolar and manic depression, Meyer’s use of supernatural imagery can actually make manic symptoms worse.

#### Step 2: Keep Your Mind on God

**To think like Jesus, we need to make our relationship with God part of our daily lives.** Meyer reminds us that we cannot have a strong relationship with someone when they are not on our minds. Jesus, she notes, was in constant communion with God. Since He is our example for leading a positive life, we should strive to do the same.

Meyer suggests finding places throughout the day to focus our thoughts on God. **Taking opportunities to think about and appreciate God every day will strengthen our relationship with Him and help our minds stay positive.** She gives the following suggestions of simple ways to incorporate God into our daily lives:

  * Carve out moments to meditate on the word of God.
  * Take time to appreciate God’s work in the world around us. For example, appreciate the beauty of the natural world. 
  * Begin every morning with a prayer to make sure we start the day on a positive note. 



> **Tending to Important Relationships**
> 
> Many people would describe their relationship with God as one of, if not _the_ more important relationship in their lives. Therefore, it's not surprising that Meyer’s advice for cultivating a healthy relationship with God parallels advice on maintaining a healthy relationship with our significant other.
> 
> Psychologist Abigail Brenner adds that a relationship we don’t prioritize will not continue to add positivity to our lives. She writes that relationships need “constant attention and constant tending” to stay healthy.
> 
> Like Meyer, Brenner proposes that simply taking moments throughout the day to prioritize thinking about and appreciating our partner will strengthen our relationship. Her suggestions include:
> 
>   * Taking moments to check in with our partner throughout the day via phone call, text, and so on (mirroring Meyer’s advice to carve out moments to connect with God by meditating and reflecting on His word).
> 
>   * Making sure that we set aside time each day to show affection for one another (Meyer’s take on this recommendation is to start each day with a prayer).
> 
>   * Complimenting our partner to show that we don't take their good qualities for granted (echoing Meyer’s guidance to notice and appreciate the positive qualities of the world around us).
> 
> 

> 
> With busy schedules and hectic lives, pulling our thoughts back to our closest relationships throughout the day every day can help remind us what’s important.

#### Step 3: Trust in God’s Love

Meyer says that many people don't realize the power of believing in God’s unconditional love. **When we believe in and internalize God’s love for us we feel worthy** —worthy of His blessings, worthy of His love and love from others, and worthy of the positive life that He intends for us. **Internalizing God’s love stops us from wasting time feeling guilty for things we’ve done in the past or feeling bad about ourselves and allows us to embrace positivity in our lives.** Therefore, while it may seem elementary, Meyer suggests that people should spend more time appreciating what it means to be loved, as we are, by God.

In addition to celebrating God’s love for us, if we want to think like Jesus, we should also express our love and appreciation for others. Jesus was a positive force in the lives of so many people because he always shared a message of love. Meyer explains that **we’ll bring more positivity into our lives and the lives of those we care about if we make it a point to tell people how much we appreciate them.**

> **Receiving Love**
> 
> Internalizing love can be difficult if we have low self-esteem. Psychologist Marissa Franco explains that people often have a harder time receiving love than giving it. She proposes that receiving love from someone else can make us uncomfortable if we don't share the same love for ourselves.
> 
> Hearing loving things about ourselves that we don’t feel we “deserve” can make us feel confused about who we are. Are we the person we see or the person other people see? Franco explains that we may worry that we’ll let people down when we don’t live up to the standards others’ love has set for us.
> 
> We can get better at receiving love if we practice giving it. Therapist Barton Goldsmith explains that when we give love to others, we simultaneously increase our capacity to receive love. In this sense, the more love we give, the more we can get. Goldsmith explains that it's important to build our capacity to receive love because feeling loved and loveable will help us live a happier life.
> 
> One way to add deeper meaning to the love we show to others is by sharing the reason we love them. For example, instead of saying “I love you,” we can say, “I love you because you are so thoughtful.” Goldsmith explains that hearing a specific reason we're loved helps remind us of our good qualities. It's especially beneficial to hear love in this format when we feel unloveable or bad about ourselves. Meyer would likely urge us to use this advice when we respond to God’s call to share His love with others.
