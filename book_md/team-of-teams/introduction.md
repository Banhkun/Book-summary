## Introduction

In 2004 in Iraq, the U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force was struggling to counter Al Qaeda, which was spreading sectarian discord and violence to undermine the shaky Iraqi government.

The U.S. task force—consisting of elite special forces units, strategists, and analysts from every branch of the U.S. military—was charged with conducting raids, gathering intelligence, and killing or capturing terrorist leaders. However, despite its enormous resources and expertise, the task force soon found its conventional approach—including a rigid command structure and lengthy planning processes—failing against an unconventional enemy. The task force couldn’t keep up with Al Qaeda, which functioned as a decentralized network of agile teams that could strike quickly, reconfigure immediately, and integrate their actions globally.

The task force also found itself in a complex environment different from what the military was organized and trained for, characterized by rapid, interconnected events, rather than predictable events that military organizers could plan for.

When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the task force, he realized he must transform it to operate in an entirely new way. Contrary to his West Point training as an engineer, McChrystal had to accept that he couldn’t defeat Al Qaeda with a centrally planned and controlled solution. **Instead, the task force had to shift to adaptability**.

Agility and adaptability are key features of small “mission-critical” teams such as commando units, but they’re not typically features of large organizations like the task force. However, McChrystal learned how to scale up small-team success to the organizational level by creating a “team of teams,” in which units collaborated the same way individual members do on small teams. It required replicating on a large scale the trust and purpose that bond teams, decentralizing decision-making, and creating a single “shared consciousness,” or common understanding and mindset across the organization.

_Team of Teams_ is the story of how McChrystal transformed the task force in the middle of a war— a task he likened to a sports team switching from football to basketball in the middle of a game—requiring it to discard familiar equipment as well as every preconception about winning a war. Drawing on both military history and management theory, McChrystal suggests that the task force’s experiences in reinventing itself can apply to many organizations facing unconventional challenges.

This summary is divided into five parts that link the task force’s practical experience with management theory and the experiences of other large organizations:

  * Part 1 describes the new and challenging environment the tradition-bound U.S. task force faced in Iraq and discusses theories of organizational management and change. 
  * Part 2 examines the strengths of adaptable teams and the challenges of scaling them up in a large organization. 
  * Part 3 describes how the task force transformed itself into an interconnected network of adaptable teams.
  * Part 4 examines how the role of leaders must change in an adaptable organization.
  * Part 5 puts the pieces together, showing how the reinvented task force’s structure and new way of operating enabled a successful strike against terrorist leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi.
