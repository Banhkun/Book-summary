## Chapter 2: Managing for Efficiency

  * In Iraq, task force operations initially struggled against AQI because they used an inflexible organizational model rooted in both military tradition and concepts of efficiency from the industrial age. 



This chapter explores the development and impact of the efficiency mindset—or **doctrine of scientific management, in which processes are standardized and optimized for predictable results** —and its pitfalls in the 21st century. For the last 150 years, this doctrine has shaped organizations of all kinds, including, initially, the joint task force in Iraq.

### Efficiency on the Factory Floor

The efficiency model took root in the early factories of the 19th century, when Frederick Winslow Taylor introduced “scientific management.” It has influenced how we do things ever since—from running businesses to designing our kitchens—as well as how we think about solving problems.

In early factories prior to Taylor’s management system, workers produced items the way artisans and craftsmen had done in the small shops that preceded factories—they employed their own methods and workflows and took breaks as they desired.

In contrast, Taylor was obsessed with finding the _one best way_ to do everything. Even as a boy walking around town, he tried to determine the optimum stride length, the one that got him the farthest with the least expenditure of energy.

When he was hired as a young man to manage a factory floor at a steelworks, he brought the same mindset: There had to be one optimally efficient way of producing pieces of steel. To find the best way, **he applied the concept of reductionism, or breaking processes down into sequences of steps.** He broke down steel production into steps, timed every step, then optimized each step as well as the work area involved—for example, determining the optimum height of the work surface, the distance between tools and machines that allowed employees to work the fastest, and so on. He wrote step-by-step instructions for workers, including the time each step should take.

Taylor’s methods, while not popular with factory workers, resulted in enormous time and cost savings for factory owners (small savings at each step added up). Factories produced more faster with less waste and fewer people.

Taylor introduced his assembly-line metal production system at the 1900 Paris Exposition. His small line of a few lathes and workers could cut 50 feet of steel per minute compared to the normal nine feet. He had determined the optimal temperature for cutting steel, the best way for using water to cool the lathe, and the best speed for running the equipment. Taylor’s demonstration created quite a buzz, with one engineer even hailing it as a landmark in human history.

### Far-Reaching Impacts

**Taylor believed achieving optimum efficiency could be applied to anything** —from cutting steel to cooking eggs for breakfast. It wasn’t long before this thinking affected nearly every corner of society, white-collar work included: There was a best way to sit at a desk, assemble papers, and put a sheet into a typewriter. Waste was decried and efficiency became the greatest good.

The new drive for efficiency had two profound effects on organizations:

  1. **It transformed management into a discipline** —a manager’s role was to increase efficiency, not to worry about workers’ morale. 
  2. **It separated thinking and doing** —managers did the planning and thinking while workers followed orders.



Today, we still believe in finding and implementing _the_ best way to do things:

  * We structure our organizations as hierarchies to accomplish this. Leaders strategize, plan, and coordinate; lower-level people execute according to instructions. 
  * In an effort to be more efficient, we replicate others’ best practices.
  * We’re obsessed with productivity. We even structure what used to be “free” time into organized activities with a purpose.



### Taylorism in the Military

Even before Taylor introduced scientific management, armies sought to create order, efficiency, and predictability by turning individuals into identical parts of a military machine through conformity, standardization, and discipline.

Soldiers have always followed defined processes (standard operating procedures or SOPs) for doing everything, down to the exact order for packing a backpack and attaching tools to the outside—each process proven to optimize efficiency and minimize errors. Such standardization attempts to impose predictability and order in a chaotic environment (war).

In the industrialization era, military planners found many ways to apply Taylor’s methods by:

  * Further separating planning and execution
  * Further standardizing
  * Focusing on efficiency



In military operations, those tasked with following the orders of higher-ups got instruction cards like Taylor’s factory workers did. Taylor’s principles also played an important role in the world wars: U.S. factories were known for the efficient production of war materials. They turned out ships, warplanes, and tanks at amazing speeds.

### Task Force Efficiency

In Iraq, the Joint Special Operations Task Force ran with assembly-line efficiency. For example, gear was organized in the order it was to be used; troops and equipment arrived and departed in a synchronized fashion.

Raids followed a prescribed process. The sequence was F3EA, which meant find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze:

  * Find and fix the position of the targeted individual.
  * Finish the target (by capturing or killing him).
  * Gather intelligence from the operation (search the house, interrogate others, and so on), which can be exploited.
  * Analyze the information.



Initially, AQI’s escalating attacks convinced task force leaders they needed to ratchet up their processes. So they searched for ways to conduct more operations faster, and they managed to build an impressively efficient counterterrorism machine. But AQI innovated with tactics like propane bombs, and it outflanked the task force with agility and the technology of global communication.

While the military doctrine of efficiency was effective at confronting past predictable threats, it proved too inflexible against 21st-century complexity and chaos.
