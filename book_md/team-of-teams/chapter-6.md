## Chapter 6: Breaking Down Silos

  * Although the task force’s special forces teams were adaptable and effective, its command-oriented overall structure (a “command of teams”) limited the adaptability of the organization as a whole. Teams functioned in silos, coordinating with their commands but not with other teams. This created disconnects that hindered the overall mission.



While the task force in Iraq brought together elite forces and strategists from all branches of the military, they operated as separate teams under a joint command, or a “command of teams.” It was less rigid than a total command structure, but had serious weaknesses endemic to many large organizations that similarly try to incorporate teams without changing the overall organizational structure to coordinate and scale up teams’ capabilities.

### The MECE Structure

While incorporating teams, the task force and many organizations operate within a framework that management consultants refer to as MECE, which stands for Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. This structure divides an organization into functions or units that don’t overlap but collectively cover everything. The idea is that a leader assigns tasks and if each unit or department does its job well without worrying about any other unit or about understanding the whole (that is, stays in its box), the organization will function effectively.

The task force’s teams and departments initially functioned this way in Iraq, but the result was often _in_ effectiveness. For example:

#### 1) Joint Task Force Drills

The task force had regular training exercises bringing together SEALs, Army Rangers, and Army Special Forces in joint operations—for example, they practiced a terrorist scenario that simulated the capture and rescue of a group of American diplomats at an airport in East Asia. SEALs and Rangers attacked assigned targets and killed “terrorists,” and special forces rescued the “hostages.” Overall, the exercise worked flawlessly, but each team operated vertically, staying in its silo and connecting with its own command, but not connecting with other teams. Each was concerned only with its specific objective.

While this type of carefully planned, intricate operation worked for addressing a focused and predictably unfolding crisis, the situation in Iraq was different. Teams in Iraq needed to be able to communicate and work together in fluid, unpredictable operations against AQI.

#### 2) An Intelligence Disconnect

The MECE structure also impeded operations at the headquarters level. On an inspection tour of the task force intelligence facility at the Baghdad airport, McChrystal found bags of unopened intelligence material (documents, computers, and cell phones) seized during commando raids, which had never been analyzed. By the time the backlog of intelligence was likely to be analyzed, it would be useless.

Because the teams collecting the material had no contact with the people analyzing it, the analysts didn’t know how to prioritize or organize it. While the teams could each come up with better individual procedures for handling the intelligence material, what they really needed was to communicate with each other so that the most important information could be quickly examined.

McChrystal found such chokepoints or disconnects between all teams. Instead of living and functioning parallel to each other, **the teams needed horizontal connections rather than more top-down planning before the task force could function effectively as a whole.** Chokepoints also existed among the task force and the large organizations it needed to work with, including the CIA, FBI, and NSA.

Imagine playing a sport like soccer within an MECE structure, where players ignored each other and the ball, while watching and waiting for orders from the coach. The coach couldn’t communicate plans to all the players as the game continually changed; the players needed to be able to work together and improvise.

### The Challenges of Scaling Teamwork

While a MECE structure limits teams’ and the overall organization’s ability to be fully adaptive and effective, the solution isn’t simple: Scaling up the strengths of teams, done in the wrong way, could lead to chaos.

As noted in Chapter 5 on Navy SEAL teamwork, small teams’ effectiveness stems from their size—they’re small enough that members know and trust each other from working hundreds of hours side by side in challenging situations.

**When you enlarge teams, you run into the economic principle of diminishing marginal returns** , which states that with goods and services, each unit you add brings less value than the previous one. For example, if you start eating a succession of sandwiches when you’re hungry, you’ll greatly enjoy your first sandwich, but each one you eat after that will bring less satisfaction than the one before.

In terms of manpower, the phenomenon of diminishing returns is sometimes described as having too many cooks in the kitchen. Beyond a certain number, teams lose their essential cohesiveness. The threshold number of additional members adding value before setting off diminishing returns varies. For an intimate conversation it would be a small number of people, while for producing something on a manufacturing assembly line it could be large. In many sports, teams have 15 or fewer players playing at a time. In the military, SEAL teams have 16-20 and Army Ranger platoons have 42.

Further, teams with strong internal bonds tend to compete with other teams in a unit or even beyond it (for example, with other branches of the service). The view is that everyone outside the team “sucks,” as a SEAL described it. With the task force, a team’s goal of performing its mission better than another team might not align with the task force’s definition of victory (winning the war). So managing teams gets more complex as teams and organizations grow.

To transition from being a MECE-structured “command of teams,” the task force needed to create communication and trusting, team-like bonds _between_ teams—that is, to create a “team of teams.”
