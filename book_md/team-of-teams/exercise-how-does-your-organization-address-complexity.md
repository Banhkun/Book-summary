## Exercise: How Does Your Organization Address Complexity?

Many organizations are used to operating in a _complicated_ environment, in which they can foresee and adjust for change. But their responses, such as planning efforts, may no longer work because the environments in which many organizations operate today are actually _complex_ (changing quickly in infinite, unpredictable ways).

* * *

Describe the environment your business or organization operates in. Is it complicated or complex? Why do you think so?

The first key element of complexity is interdependence. How do key aspects of your organization’s environment interact (when one thing changes, it affects something else)?

The second key element of complexity is speed of change. What is changing the most quickly in your organization’s working environment and how?

How does your organization handle the speed at which things change and their interactions—with greater planning or with adaptability? How effective is this approach?
