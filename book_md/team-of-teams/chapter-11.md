## Chapter 11: A ‘Gardener’ Model of Leadership

  * McChrystal’s final lesson from his task force experience in Iraq was that speed and interconnectedness have rendered the old leadership model obsolete. Instead of controllers, organizations need leaders who act as gardeners or enablers who cultivate and maintain the ecosystem in which the organization functions.



### From Chess Master to Gardener

When he took command of the task force, McChrystal had a traditional military leader’s mindset, in which he expected to know all the answers and, like a chess master, make all the right moves with his units against Al Qaeda. The task force’s extraordinary technological capability, which gave it eyes everywhere, encouraged this view of being in control of the “game.” However, AQI played a different game, moving multiple “pieces” at speeds the task force initially couldn’t match.

As he realized the way to defeat AQI was to create an agile, adaptable organization, McChrystal changed his idea of leadership from chess master to gardener. **He came to view his role as creating an ecosystem—a framework, processes, and culture in which the task force could flourish.**

He sought to make fewer decisions and instead focus on creating the conditions for teamwork on an organizational scale: shared consciousness, trust, cooperation, and empowerment. Further, he nurtured this ecosystem by ensuring that silos and competition didn’t hinder its functioning and that transparency gave it oxygen.

#### Communicating Expectations

Besides creating the right environment, leading as a gardener also required communicating priorities and new cultural expectations, as well as leading by example. McChrystal’s steps and actions included:

  * Writing brief, carefully crafted daily memos that focused on a few key themes (rather than many) and used repetition to get points across. Although his words competed for attention with a daily deluge of information, he knew they were effective when he heard others echoing them.
  * Setting an example by practicing his policies, such as information sharing and frank conversation, particularly in the O&I videoconference. He also wore his combat uniform during the briefings to reinforce his commitment and focus to conference participants in Washington.
  * At the O&I briefing, maintaining a balance among sharing, reporting, and Q&As. He also remembered and used the names of presenters to put them at ease, asked questions to show interest, and complimented them to build their confidence and investment in the work.
  * Thinking out loud, summarizing what he heard, giving his analysis, and asking the presenter what action he planned to take to demonstrate empowerment.
  * Avoiding anger and sarcasm, and saying “thank you” frequently to create an atmosphere that encouraged participation.
  * Conveying the message that all problems could be understood and solved together.



The ongoing watering, raking, and fertilizing aspects of gardening are comparable to a commander’s visits (called battlefield circulation) to units. While typical visits are intimidating to the host unit, McChrystal tried to use them instead to nurture rather than control.

He viewed the visits as an opportunity to:

  * Increase his understanding of the unit and its situation
  * Gain new insight beyond what’s conveyed in reports
  * Communicate information and guidance
  * Listen to problems and concerns



As the world becomes increasingly complex, the only way for organizations to function successfully will be as networks of teams nurtured by gardener-leaders, like the joint operations task force in Iraq. Part 5 shows how this kind of team-of-teams operating structure came together enabling the task force to strike successfully against terrorist leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi.
