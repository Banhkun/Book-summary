## Chapter 4: Restructuring for Resilience and Adaptability

  * The key to confronting threats in a complex environment is pursuing resilience rather than predictability, and pursuing adaptability rather than efficiency. For the task force, this would require adopting a new structure that allowed it to reconfigure (adapt) to chaos in Iraq with agility and resilience.



Since AQI couldn’t match U.S. capabilities (strength and efficiency), they studied task force tactics and adapted—they were agile and resilient and could thus thrive in the complex environment where the task force struggled for the upper hand.

For example, AQI adjusted constantly to U.S. tactics rather than depending on a single best process. After learning that U.S. commandos used night-vision equipment to implement nighttime raids, AQI operatives began leaving their safe houses at dusk and sleeping in the surrounding fields to avoid being caught in an attack. To defeat the enemy in this complex environment, U.S. forces needed to develop resilience and adaptability.

### What Is Resilience?

In the book _Resilience Thinking,_ authors Brian Walker and David Salt define **resilience as a system’s ability to withstand disruption or shock while remaining intact and continuing to perform.**

Another way to describe resilient systems is _antifragile_ —they not only withstand shocks but also may _benefit_ from them, like immune systems that can grow stronger with exposure to infectious agents. In contrast, _fragile_ systems are damaged or destroyed by shocks.

In an increasingly complex and challenging world, being able to withstand shock is so important that it’s drawn the interest of researchers and planners in a variety of disciplines from psychology to engineering. Resilience thinking has also become a trend in management theory and practice as organizations confront complex challenges. Resilient managers accept the inevitability of unpredictable threats. Rather than developing complicated plans to counter specific threats, they work to design systems that can take a hit and adapt.

For example, in recent years, Dutch engineers have made resilience instead of flood-proofing their objective in handling water.

  * After a massive 1953 storm and tide overwhelmed dikes, authorities at first tried to predict and control where water would go with a huge containment project completed in 1997. But the system’s channels actually caused water to flow higher and faster, making sea flooding worse. Also, the system couldn’t handle heavy rainfall and snowmelt in the Alps that created flooding from the opposite direction (rivers couldn’t absorb the extra water).
  * So engineers shifted their goal from control and containment to resilience—withstanding flooding. They lowered dikes to allow rivers to spread out, and they used farmland as floodplains to handle extra water until the rivers could absorb it.



When it comes to environmental issues like flood control, resilience thinking is actually a reversion to the past when humans coexisted with nature more than they tried to control it. Since we instead became optimizers and created specialized systems to increase efficiency for the greatest return, we’ve undermined adaptability and thus resilience.

#### Resilient _and_ Robust

The ideal system for functioning in a complex environment where there are many types of unforeseen disruptions is one that’s both resilient _and_ robust—that is, one that’s both adaptable and strong.

For example, a coral reef is _resilient but not robust_. If a reef is large enough, it can survive being partially destroyed by a hurricane by regrowing (resilience). But a reef isn’t robust or strong enough to regrow if it suffers too much damage too fast. In contrast, the Egyptian pyramids are _robust, but not resilient_. For thousands of years, they’ve withstood the weather, retaining their basic form. However, the pyramids couldn’t remain standing if struck by a bomb.

Making a system robust (like the pyramids) involves strengthening its parts, while making it resilient (like a coral reef) comes from linking the parts so they can reconfigure and adapt. Though you can’t control the behavior of storms at sea, you can build a boat that’s robust, and train a resilient crew to adapt to the conditions.

### Efficiency Versus Adaptability

The U.S. task force in Iraq was strong (robust) and efficient, but not resilient, because it wasn’t adaptable or effective.

Management guru Peter Drucker differentiated between efficiency and effectiveness. He defined efficiency as doing things right and effectiveness as doing the right things. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Drucker’s The Effective Executive.)

The task force was efficient at what it did, but not effective because it wasn’t adapting to do the right things. Instead of strengthening its processes or deploying more resources, the U.S. needed a structure that could reconfigure to respond quickly to unpredictable situations. To put it another way, instead of a factory-like system of known inputs producing predictable outputs, the task force needed a system that could convert unpredictable inputs into unknown but ultimately desirable outputs.
