## Part 5: Putting the Pieces Together | Chapter 12: A New Organizational Model

  * The Task Force’s team-of-teams organizational model, incorporating the transformational concepts of trust, purpose, shared consciousness, and empowered execution, finally brought down the terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi. In our connected, complex world, all organizations need to apply the same concepts as a matter of survival.



### Success: The Search for Zarqawi

By the spring of 2006, the playing field had changed: In several years, the task force had 1) learned a great deal more about Zarqawi and his organization, and 2) dramatically increased its effectiveness in gathering intelligence and disrupting the terrorist network.

McChrystal was increasingly confident the task force would soon capture or kill Zarqawi. A sign of the task force’s growing efficacy was its capture and use of some raw video of Zarqawi, which AQI had intended to turn into propaganda. The video showed the terrorist leader shooting weapons and looking tough. But before AQI could edit and post it, the task force posted humiliating outtakes showing Zarqawi handling his weapon amateurishly while another fighter inadvertently grabbed a searing hot gun barrel. In addition, thanks to the task force’s new ability to network its expertise, U.S. analysts in Washington, D.C. were able to determine where the scenes were shot, bringing the task force closer to its target.

Another break came when task force units captured a dozen AQI fighters in a raid on a farmhouse—U.S. intelligence analysts soon identified several of them as not merely fighters but mid-level AQI operatives potentially connected to terrorist leadership.

#### Crucial Information

Interrogators homed in on one particular operative, Allawi (not his real name), and brought the vast, now-networked task force resources to bear on determining what he knew. A hive mind consisting of teams across Iraq, intelligence agencies in the U.S. and United Kingdom, partners across the region, and more than 70 task force liaison officers coordinated questions to ask the detainee and offered insights on his answers.

Finally, in mid-May, Allawi revealed the name of Zarqawi’s spiritual adviser, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman, with whom the terrorist leader had regular in-person contact. While this information was a critical breakthrough, finding Rahman wasn’t easy. He lived in chaotic Baghdad, where AQI-driven violence made surveillance difficult. Further, “black swans” (unexpected events) could arise at any time and derail task force monitoring.

When they located and identified Rahman, the task force faced another challenge that, in the past, would have hindered its efforts: Maintaining constant surveillance diverted resources from other task force operations, which could have prompted “tribal” competitiveness among units also operating against AQI targets. However, thanks to shared consciousness, trust, and transparency, everyone understood and united around the common purpose of taking down Zarqawi.

#### Patient Surveillance

After 17 days of 24/7 surveillance, the task force observed Rahman relocating his family to another residence, which (Allawi had told them) meant he was planning to leave the city to meet with Zarqawi.

With air surveillance, task force members in eight time zones watched Rahman leave Baghdad; they saw him being dropped off outside Baghdad and picked up by a blue truck. Arriving in the nearby province capital, he entered a small restaurant through one door and left through another door to get into a white pickup. The task force monitored both vehicles to ensure one wasn’t a decoy, and they also continued to watch the restaurant.

They could watch multiple locations, thanks to the task force teams’ willingness to share resources. Meanwhile, the task force plotted strikes on these and other locations, after hopefully picking up Zarqawi, before other terrorists could flee.

The white pickup with Rahman inside drove to a small house and entered a driveway connected to the main road. A grove of palm trees behind the house presented a possible escape route for the terrorists.

A man in black robes came out and escorted Rahman inside. The man then came back outside and walked to the end of the driveway, where he checked for traffic on the road, then returned into the house. Analysts observing the scene confirmed the man was Zarqawi.

#### Moving Into Position

At the task force headquarters at the former Baghdad airport, McChrystal spoke with his commander of Baghdad operations, who was monitoring events with him. The commander (not named in the book) dispatched a commando force to the house from Baghdad. As a backup plan, he also ordered F-16s to prepare to bomb the location.

He didn’t ask McChrystal for permission and McChrystal didn’t intervene because he trusted and had empowered the commander to act, under the task force’s new method of operating.

As is typical, there were a few glitches. The commando force was delayed by helicopter maintenance issues. Time was of the essence—the task force needed to move before darkness descended, potentially allowing Zarqawi to escape into the trees where it would take hundreds of troops to find him.

#### A Successful Strike

The commander quickly switched to Plan B—the F-16s—but one was offline for refueling. Finally, a second F-16 reached the house and blew it up. When the commando force arrived a half-hour later, they found medical personnel with a still-alive Zarqawi on a stretcher. An American medic, understanding Zarqawi’s value to interrogators, tried to save his life, but the terrorist leader soon died on the scene.

Task force operators brought his body back to the Baghdad headquarters, photographed it, and took fingerprints, which were sent to the FBI in the U.S. to confirm Zarqawi’s identity. Meanwhile, the task force continued to collect intelligence on the follow-up targets identified during the chase. They also had a global farewell party for then-Rear-Admiral Bill McRaven at Ft. Bragg, who was leaving his role with the task force. During the video-conferenced party, a staff officer walked in and whispered to McChrystal that the body had been confirmed as Zarqawi.

Task force units across Iraq immediately struck multiple targets including 14 in Baghdad, in an effort to hit each one before word of Zarqawi’s death spread to AQI operatives and caused them to flee. These strikes yielded intelligence revealing further connections among terrorist groups and leading to new raids.

#### A Culmination of Effort

By the time of the successful strike against Zarqawi, the task force had begun taking for granted the network of relationships, trust, and shared consciousness that enabled the huge success. These elements had become part of their everyday operations.

It had taken time, but by 2007, the task force was winning the fight against AQI because they were learning and adapting more quickly than the enemy. They were striking unpredictably, day and night, more quickly than AQI could regroup—enabled by the networking and trust between analysts and field operators. They continued to disrupt the terrorist network by decimating its middle ranks so that it couldn’t easily replace eliminated leaders. Detainees who had been smug and cocky with U.S. interrogators a few years earlier were now awed by U.S. intelligence, asking interrogators, “How did you know that?”

**It was all the result of a management transformation.** Now, instead of being an industrial-era well-oiled machine, the task force was an interconnected network constantly learning and adapting to defeat the enemy.

### Postscript: The Challenge Is Ongoing

Less than 10 years after McChrystal’s success in transforming the Joint Special Operations Task Force and killing Zarqawi, a new terrorist organization, ISIS, and a new terrorist leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, arose.

This development underscored two key truths about change:

  1. There’s no permanent fix in a constantly and rapidly changing complex environment.
  2. Transforming organizations is an ongoing, uphill battle because backsliding is common. 



When facing challenges, there’s a temptation in organizations to revert to the planning and efficiency-oriented processes they’re comfortable with and that have worked in the past. But results are what count—and getting results in a new environment requires transforming how organizations do things for the long term.
