## Part 5.2: Additional Strategies for the Ideal Man | Chapters 7-9

This final section covers Glover’s remaining strategies for loving and living as an Ideal Man.

### Love and Career

Many of the strategies discussed throughout this guide—such as practicing self-care, sharing your feelings, and facing your fears—will help you find satisfaction in your love life and career. But Glover has a few more tips to put you on the right path:

#### Take a New Approach the Next Time Around

When entering into new relationships, Glover has one strategy: **Shake things up.** Instead of falling back on bad habits (like not setting boundaries) or unproductive mindsets (that your needs don’t matter, for example), start from a place of integrity, self-confidence, and vulnerability from the get-go. This will save you from having to “fix” a relationship that’s gone south (or keep you from entering into a toxic one in the first place).

**Starting fresh gives you the unique opportunity to look for a different caliber of partner**(one who embodies your values). Glover says if you accept yourself and embrace your power, you’re more likely to seek out (and be sought by) those who exude the same self-confidence and energy as you do.

Just as the unconfident, never-changing mindset compels Nice Guys to remain in toxic environments (be it their romantic relationship or career), this do-something-different approach can also be applied to finding and beginning a new job.

(Shortform note: When you do leave a toxic work environment, try your best to have some time to recover before jumping into another job. Take this time to reflect—not only on yourself, your skills, and your worth, but also on the negative experiences you had in the toxic environment. Were your former boss or coworkers abusive? Or was your job toxic at a systemic level? Learning from bad experiences can help you better understand what industries or company cultures will support you in the way that you need.)

> **Starting Over After a Toxic Relationship**
> 
> Following Glover’s advice and getting a fresh start after a bad relationship can be a bit daunting, but The Good Men Project has some tips for starting things off on the right foot this time around:
> 
>   * **Remind yourself you’re worthy.** You deserve happiness and a partner that treats you well as much as anyone else. But you must believe in your own self-worth as an individual person before you can begin a new, healthy relationship.
> 
>   * **Write down any green and/or red flags you notice.** It’s easy to ignore someone’s flaws when you’re just getting to know them, but do your best to recognize and take note of any concerning behaviors. Don’t forget to look out for the positive signs as well—what makes this person seem like they’ll be trustworthy and supportive?
> 
>   * **Talk to your friends and family.** If you find yourself over-romanticizing your new beau, ask your loved ones what they think—do they notice any red flags? Or better yet, ask these safe people to set you up with someone they think highly of. This way, you’re meeting someone who’s already been vetted by someone you trust.
> 
>   * **Don’t overthink it.** Resist the urge to self-sabotage if your new relationship is running smoothly. Let yourself feel joy and excitement in your new, healthy relationship. Don’t be afraid to lean into someone who is expressing genuine care for you.
> 
> 


#### Ask for Help

No one can do everything alone, so Glover stresses that Nice Guys **learn to ask for help.** Taking control of your life includes utilizing the people and resources at your disposal. First, you must recognize that others are there for you and _want to help_. Then, you must ask for help in a clear, direct manner.

> **How to Effectively Ask for Help**
> 
> Asking for help can be intimidating, especially if you’re a Nice Guy who’s not used to acknowledging when he needs help in the first place. And there’s nothing more discouraging than asking for help and not receiving it. But according to business professor Wayne Baker, the most effective way to get help is by making a SMART request. When you ask someone else to help you, make sure what you’re requesting fits the following criteria:
> 
>   * **Specific:** Vague requests are less likely to be acted upon, so keep it concise and to the point.
> 
>   * **Meaningful:** Explain to whoever you’re asking _why_ you need the help you do.
> 
>   * **Action:** Tell the other person what tasks they can do to help, which will only make your request more specific.
> 
>   * **Realistic:** Make sure you’re not asking someone to do the impossible.
> 
>   * **Time:** Give the other person a deadline or timeframe for your request.
> 
> 


### Sex

As we’ve discussed, overcoming feelings of fear and shame is integral to having a satisfying sex life. However, this isn’t the only way to improve your sexual experiences. Here are some additional sex-related strategies from Glover:

#### Don’t Accept Bad Sex

According to Glover, Nice Guys who settle for bad (incongruous, passionless) sex will likely keep having bad sex. If a Nice Guy continues to accept lazy, passive lovemaking, it will become the default.

**Nice Guys won’t have good sex until they can say “no” to bad sex.** But what does “good sex” look like to Glover?

  * Both partners are responsible for ensuring their own needs are met.
  * There are no prior expectations or objectives (no “She has to orgasm 3 times or I’ve failed”).
  * It’s a natural, intimate, and vulnerable expression of sexual energy with unpredictable potential— _not a reenacted performance_. 



To start having good sex, **reset with a temporary freeze on sex.** This may sound counterintuitive, but Glover challenges Nice Guys to stop seeking out sex for a set amount of time. This will allow you to learn how you use sex (as a distraction, ego-boost) and how you go about getting it from others so you can develop a healthier relationship with your sexuality.

> **Tips for Good Sex**
> 
> What can you do to have better sex? In addition to Glover’s sex ban, some other experts weigh in:
> 
>   * **Communicate with your partner.** Mental health journalist Beth McColl encourages you to discuss your sexual likes, dislikes, fantasies, and fears with your partner before, during, and after sex. Open communication is key to understanding each other’s needs and desires.
> 
>   * **Try something new.** Social psychologist Dr. Justin Lehmiller encourages you to experiment (with positions, boundaries, location, and more) so you keep things exciting and don’t get stuck in the same routines.
> 
>   * **Get out of your head.** According to the Good Men Project, distractions take you out of intimate moments and away from your woman. So, don’t think too hard about orgasms, chores, or impending deadlines while you’re seeking pleasure. Instead, let yourself be fully present and connect with your partner.
> 
> 


#### Practice Healthy Masturbation

Finally, Glover encourages _healthy masturbation_. **Nice Guys must learn to pleasure themselves without shame, discomfort, and distraction before they can seek pleasure from others without shame, discomfort, and distraction.** It’s easier to learn about your sexual likes and dislikes without the pressure of another person.

Like good sex, Glover says healthy masturbation is a natural, intimate, and vulnerable expression of sexual energy with unpredictable potential. It’s about doing what feels good and accepting responsibility for your needs and pleasure.

(Shortform note: Not only is masturbation good for your mental and sexual well-being, but it may also be good for your physical health. According to one comprehensive, 18-year-long Harvard study, men who orgasmed 21 times or more each month decreased their chances of prostate cancer by 33%. The reason _why_ is still unknown, although doctors speculate you clear out harmful toxins and bacteria that might otherwise build up in your prostate when you ejaculate. Orgasms with a partner produce the same outcome, so prioritizing both masturbation and partner sex can help you reach these ejaculation goals.)

Masturbation is a generally sensitive topic for Nice Guys, especially if they live in a repressive environment (due to religion or family) or have dealt with compulsive sexual habits in the past. However, Glover wants you to remember **there’s nothing shameful about healthy masturbation.** He even stresses that with a focus on pleasure (without porn or fantasy), it’s almost impossible for healthy masturbation to become compulsive.

> **How to Practice Healthy Masturbation**
> 
> Many sexual and mental health professionals agree that there are _healthy_ and _unhealthy_ ways to masturbate. In addition to Glover’s tips about refraining from porn and fantasy, here are some more ways to help you practice healthy masturbation:
> 
>   * **Take it slow:** Good masturbation is a process—not a race to the finish line. Don’t rush through your pleasure. Take your time by experimenting with other parts of your body or changing the speed of your stroke. This will help you practice taking things slow with a partner as well.
> 
>   * **Prep your environment:** Set the mood for yourself. Make your environment comfortable and distraction free. Light candles, put on some music, dim the lights—whatever you need to do to feel good and in the moment.
> 
>   * **Pay attention:** Be aware of your bodily responses as you pleasure yourself—your breath, your heartbeat, and any tension you might be holding. How does your body react before you orgasm? Understanding your body and its physical responses will only help you control your sexual functions with yourself or with a partner.
> 
>   * **Engage your fantasies:** Although Glover feels fantasy is not a part of healthy masturbation, many sex therapists—including those at the Between Us Clinic—disagree. Due to mirror neurons (or visuospatial brain cells that fire whether we perform an action, picture the action, or see someone else performing the action), using your imagination to picture yourself having satisfying sex can lead to better sexual performance. (However, these therapists agree that porn doesn’t engage the brain in the same way our imagination does and therefore should not be relied on when masturbating.)
> 
>   * **Try edging:** This sexual control technique requires masturbating to the point of orgasm but stopping before ejaculation. Take a break for a minute or two, then begin again and repeat as many times as you’d like (or are able). This exercise helps build stamina and prevent premature ejaculation.

##### Glover on Porn

Glover isn’t opposed to pornography in theory, but believes it negatively affects men by creating unrealistic expectations and increasing feelings of shame (especially when consumed in secret).

**If you are going to consume porn, Glover says you must do so openly and _without shame_.** This ensures it won’t become a compulsive, guilt-inducing habit.

> **Things to Consider When Consuming Porn**
> 
> Like Glover, sex educator Laci Green agrees that porn is ok to consume as long you reflect on your relationship with it and ask yourself the following questions:
> 
>   * **Can I masturbate without porn?** Glover and Green both caution against pleasuring yourself to porn. While Glover believes it should never be used in this context, Green encourages you to shake up your routine and method of arousal when masturbating so that your body doesn’t become conditioned to _only_ respond to porn.
> 
>   * **Am I using porn as a coping mechanism?** While Green acknowledges that porn can be used for entertainment or arousal purposes, you should recognize when you’re using it to distract from negative feelings. If you start to lean on porn in times of distress, she suggests finding a different outlet, such as journaling, opening up to a friend, or seeking therapy.
> 
>   * **Do I recognize porn isn’t realistic?** Green explains that although porn may be fun to watch, it’s in no way a representation of what _real sex_ looks like. From the actors’ “perfect” bodies to an imbalanced focus on male pleasure and penetration, porn is a fantasy. Green encourages you to remember that _porn sex_ does not necessarily reflect _good sex_.
> 
>   * **Is the porn I’m consuming ethical?** The porn industry is huge and unfortunately, exploitation is not uncommon. Green urges you to consider where your porn is coming from and if all parties have consented to being filmed. She says the best way to reduce exploitation is to _pay for your porn_ (preferably from a reputable source).
