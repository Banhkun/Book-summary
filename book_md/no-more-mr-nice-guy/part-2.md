## Part 2: What Causes Men to Be Nice Guys? | Chapter 2

According to Glover, becoming an Ideal Man requires a serious shift in thinking. **Before we can understand how to overcome the Nice Guy mindset, we must first examine how such a mindset forms.**

This chapter will define the Nice Guy “paradigm” before diving into how this mindset is developed in childhood.

### The Nice Guy Paradigm

**Paradigms are the models through which we approach the world, but we’re rarely aware of their influence.**

We process our experiences through established paradigms. Glover reminds us that this means we’re more likely to accept information that aligns with a set paradigm and reject or ignore information that challenges it. As our experiences reinforce our paradigms, they become more difficult to change because they _appear_ infallible.

(Shortform note: This tendency is also known as _confirmation bias_ : seeking and prioritizing information that fits our prior assumptions. In his book _The Black Swan_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb discusses how to combat this bias with _negative empiricism_. By deliberately searching for evidence that contradicts our beliefs, we can come to more objective conclusions.)

According to Glover, the Nice Guy mindset stems from this unproductive roadmap:

**Conceal your true self → Be who others want you to be → Have a perfect, fulfilling life**

If this plan sounds misguided,_it’s because it is_. Glover noticed that Nice Guys—like most people—ignore holes in their paradigm and continue to enforce it despite evidence suggesting its ineffectiveness.

> **Paradigms vs Self-Limiting Beliefs**
> 
> Since publishing his second book, _Dating Essentials for Men_ , **Glover now refers to these unproductive assumptions as “self-limiting beliefs” (or “SLBs”) rather than “paradigms.”**
> 
> Why the change? The term “paradigm” is somewhat vague and can mean something different depending on the discipline in question. In the 1960s, Thomas Kuhn popularized the term in reference to hard scientific research. In this context, “paradigm” refers to widely held scientific models that affect how research is conducted and interpreted—when enough anomalies are brought against a paradigm, the model changes, and a “paradigm shift” occurs (think the shift from Newton’s theory of gravity to Einstein’s theory of relativity).
> 
> Since then, the word has been adopted to generally mean “a change in thinking” by those in the social sciences, business, tech, and more. Science historian Darin Hayton argues that this is a misuse of the term, as Kuhn’s original definition requires more than an individual’s _personal_ reinterpretation of already existing evidence to constitute a “paradigm shift.” It requires _evidence_ to prove that the paradigm is true (or false).
> 
> With Hayton’s assertion in mind, we can see how the Nice Guy roadmap isn’t actually a true “paradigm.” No hard evidence exists to “prove” a Nice Guy must be someone other than himself to be happy. Rather, that is his own _misguided interpretation_ of the evidence he is presented with.
> 
> For Glover’s purposes, the concept of “self-limiting beliefs” is more appropriate because of its precise definition and targeted use in psychology, self-help, and coaching spheres. According to Mark Manson (author of _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_), SLBs are all the self-imposed falsehoods that keep us from pursuing what we want in life. He further specifies that these beliefs can be about ourselves (“I’m not smart enough for that opportunity”), the world (“No one will ever understand me”), or life itself (“True love is a myth, so why bother”). Through this more specific lens, **we can interpret the Nice Guy roadmap as an SLB that says, “No one will ever accept me as I am.”**

### Familial Influence on the Nice Guy Paradigm

**Glover argues the Nice Guy mindset originates in childhood when a boy learns—explicitly or implicitly from his parents—that he must be “good” to be loved.** How does this belief form? It’s a vicious sequence of abandonment, shame, and self-doubt:

**Abandonment:** Glover begins with the fact that a child is completely dependent on his parents. This—along with the childish belief that the world revolves around him—causes the boy to interpret all forms of inattention or neglect as _abandonment_. Due to his helplessness, he fears abandonment. And, Glover says, due to his immature ego, **he’s likely to __ blame _himself_ for his abandonment.**

> **Childhood Abandonment and Insecure Attachment**
> 
> Is childhood abandonment a crucial factor in Nice Guys' later development of unhealthy relationships with others? Psychological research on childhood attachment may suggest so.
> 
> According to attachment theory in developmental psychology, children form a specific “attachment style”—or behaviors as they relate to our emotional bonds—largely based on parent-child interactions. The theory also asserts that we carry these attachment styles into our adult relationships.
> 
> In their book _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller note this theory assumes children who were raised by responsive caregivers tend to develop a “secure” attachment style, while those who felt abandoned by unresponsive caregivers develop “insecure” attachment styles. They describe two insecure styles: “anxious attachment”—defined by a constant need for reassurance from your partner—and “avoidant attachment”—defined by a desire to keep your partner at arm’s length.
> 
> Glover recognized similar behaviors among Nice Guys in relationships: many of his patients struggled to be fully intimate with their partner, either smothering them with attention or neglecting them altogether. Thus, we might assume these men were abandoned and developed attachment issues in childhood.
> 
> However, Levine and Heller note that since its inception, attachment theory has developed in nuance. They acknowledge that _many_ factors in addition to the child-parent relationship play into the development of our attachment style. Additionally, they assert that our attachment style is not written in stone, so Nice Guys who experienced abandonment in childhood are in no way “doomed” to be insecure attachers (just as those raised with attentive parents aren’t “safe” from becoming them either).

**Shame:** Glover continues by noting that if a boy feels he’s at fault for his abandonment, he’ll eventually believe there’s something wrong with him. From there, he’ll try to change himself to gain his parents’ attention. These self-loathing beliefs are called _toxic shame_.

(Shortform note: In _The Power Of Vulnerability, _Brené Brown differentiates between shame and guilt. **While _guilt_ arises when we feel bad about our actions, _shame_ comes from feeling bad about _ourselves_**. And unlike guilt, shame is something we tie to our identity. So when a boy experiences _shame_ following abandonment, he’s not under the belief that his actions are bad, but that _he himself is inherently bad_. Therefore, to be “good,” he must repress his true, bad self.)

**Self-Doubt:** Finally, Glover discusses what happens when a child internalizes his toxic shame: He experiences self-doubt and adopts defense strategies to ward it off. Some children act out in an antagonistic manner for attention, but Glover says **budding Nice Guys center their coping mechanisms around gaining approval.** If a boy can only convince his parents how “good” he is—through deception and repression—surely he’ll gain their love.

> **Can Self-Doubt Be a Good Thing?**
> 
> Although self-doubt can be paralyzing, it can also be helpful; a topic Melody Wilding explores in her Ted Talk on using negative thoughts to your advantage.
> 
> Wilding says that instead of approaching self-doubt as an enemy meant to be obliterated with positivity, you’d be more productive to make it your ally. **To do this, she says to employ the _name it and reframe it_ strategy:** When you “name” the doubtful stories you tell yourself (for example, “I won’t be able to maintain this relationship because I’m not good enough”), you start to notice patterns across them. It’s then easier to stop yourself from spiraling because what you’re dealing with is familiar.
> 
> From there, it’s your job to _reframe_ your self-doubt: Instead of fighting it, respond to it honestly and answer its concerns. According to Wilding, this will help you to mentally prepare for the worst if it _does_ happen. It also reaffirms your ability to handle that worst-case scenario.

#### Bringing Up Nice Guys: Examples

Glover noticed that although each Nice Guy he worked with came from a different background, each one arrived at the same conclusion: **“I’m not acceptable as I am.”**

In _NMMNG_ , Glover delves into a handful of his patients’ childhoods. In order to pinpoint some of the environments that can ingrain the Nice Guy mindset early on, we’ve extracted some of the common situations found across the anecdotes:

  1. **Controlling, distant, or abusive fathers:** Whether their fathers were demanding, not present, alcoholics, or violent, many Nice Guys lack a healthy paternal relationship and develop negative opinions of other men.
  2. **Lonely, clingy mothers:** In this case,**** even if both parents were present, they likely weren’t affectionate with each other. Emotionally starved mothers often lean heavily on their children for support, which can lead to Nice Guys developing a codependent relationship with their mothers. 
  3. **Strict or overprotective parents:** Nice Guys who grew up in rigid or sheltered environments—including fundamental religious households that instill a fear of messing up or “sinning”—often took calculated action to avoid angering their parents.
  4. **Pressure to be the family anchor:** Some Nice Guys are assigned the role of “family problem solver” and grow up believing it’s their job to fix everything. In adulthood, these Nice Guys may find themselves drawn to chaotic situations they can repair.



> **Do Narcissistic Parents Produce _Nice Guys_?**
> 
> Although Glover doesn’t explicitly mention narcissism in _NMMNG_ , some readers have noted how **the typical Nice Guy upbringing closely resembles their experience growing up with narcissistic parents.** For instance, narcissistic mothers are often “clingy” and rely on their children for emotional support.
> 
> Therapist Kathy Caprino notes that narcissistic parents—with their sense of self-importance and lack of empathy—often raise people-pleasing children with low self-esteem and an inability to set boundaries. She further explains that adult children of narcissists are so used to experiencing _conditional love_ from their parents—love that’s dependent on a child meeting certain standards—that they rarely recognize **their concept of a healthy relationship involves repression, manipulation, and unrealistic expectations.**
> 
> As self-doubting, approval-seeking, manipulative individuals, Nice Guys appear to have reached a similar outcome as those raised by narcissistic parents. In fact, The Awareness Centre’s resource for adult children of narcissists states the primary belief held by those raised under such circumstances is: “I’m not good enough.” As this way of thinking reflects the Nice Guy mindset, **we could add narcissistic parents as one of the many environments that could shape Nice Guys.**
