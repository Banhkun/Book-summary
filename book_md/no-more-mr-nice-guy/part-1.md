## Part 1: What Is a Nice Guy? | Introduction, Chapter 1

This first section of the guide defines both Nice Guys and the Ideal Man. We’ll also examine the ways Nice Guys _aren’t actually nice_.

### The Nice Guy vs. The Ideal Man

Overall, **the main distinction between the Nice Guy and the Ideal Man is self-acceptance.** Glover notes that while the Ideal Man is secure in his self-image, masculinity, and sexuality, the Nice Guy represses his true self (including his masculinity and sexuality).

Glover further defines these types of men via the following traits:

**NICE GUY** | **Ideal Man**  
---|---  
Avoids conflict and struggles with boundaries  | Handles conflict and establishes boundaries   
Prioritizes other’s needs and desires over his own  | Holds himself accountable for his own needs and desires   
Ignores his flaws and mistakes  | Addresses and learns from his flaws and mistakes   
Fixes people and situations without prompting  | Takes charge and genuinely cares for his loved ones   
Withholds his thoughts and emotions out of a fear of disapproval  | Communicates his thoughts and emotions openly and honestly   
Isolated and lonely, even among family and friends  | Builds healthy, worthwhile relationships with everyone (women _and_ men)   
  
> **The Ideal Man and The Superior Man**
> 
> When it comes to Glover’s Ideal Man and Deida’s Superior Man, both authors end up at similar conclusions: **To be a real man, you must wholeheartedly accept yourself as you are.**
> 
> The Superior Man shares many traits with the Ideal Man, such as the ability to face his fears, release shame and self-doubt, and accept life’s challenges as opportunities for growth. However, Deida’s male archetype differs slightly from Glover’s in his spiritual connection to the world at large. For example, Deida believes the Superior Man is in touch with both masculine and feminine energy—within himself, in those around him, and in the push and pull of the universe. He also notes that the Superior Man knows how to be present and approach every situation with an open and loving heart.
> 
> While _NMMNG_ never implies these traits are _not_ part of the Ideal Man, the spiritual aspects of Deida’s Superior Man aren’t a focus for the psychoanalytical Glover. And while Deida doesn't explicitly define an "Inferior Man" equal to the “Nice Guy,” he does hint at undesirable male qualities that are similar to Glover's Nice Guy attributes. For instance, Glover's Nice Guy withholds his true thoughts and emotions; likewise, Deida criticizes men who don't wholeheartedly share their true self and life purpose with others.

#### When Nice Guys Aren’t So Nice

While the Nice Guy traits listed above may be interpreted as passive or even annoying, they’re far from _mean_. But Nice Guys’ suppression of the self—to avoid disapproval, conflict, or strong emotions—leads them to frequent disappointment. Glover stresses that **in their frustration with life, Nice Guys are often far from _nice_.** In fact,**** their indirect and avoidant nature results in an angry cycle of self-victimization:

**Nice Guy does something to _appear_ nice → He stews in silent resentment when things don’t automatically go his way → Unable to contain his anger any longer, he eventually lashes out via tantrums, passive-aggressive behavior, or even abuse**

Glover notes that because he avoids addressing the root cause of his tantrum—opting to “fix” the reactions of others instead— _the cycle continues indefinitely_.

> **The Victim Mentality**
> 
> This cycle is often referred to as a disorder of its own: **the victim mentality**. Psychoanalyst Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries presents a similar cycle when discussing victimhood. Just as a Nice Guy believes he must people-please to get what he wants out of life, de Vries’s _victim_ stage is defined by a belief that all control over your life rests in the hands of external forces. And like a Nice Guy’s eventual angry outbursts, his _victimizer_ stage sees the “victim’s” feelings of powerlessness turn into rage that gets taken out on the innocent people around them.
> 
> However, unlike Glover, de Vries adds a final _rescuer_ stage, in which the “victim” decides to “rescue” others in an attempt to fix everyone’s problems except their own. When someone tries to help the “victim” in return, they invent reasons to resist this assistance so as to unconsciously affirm their victim status and elicit more attention.
> 
> Similar to Glover’s views on becoming an Ideal Man, de Vries believes**the best way to break this cycle is to self-reflect and develop a healthy self-image.**

##### Nice Guys’ Negative Qualities

Overall, **repression, self-pity, and fear bring out Nice Guys’ worst characteristics.** This table includes the primary undesirable traits Glover found across many Nice Guys:

**Negative Quality** | **Reason**  
---|---  
Deceitful  | Their passive and people-pleasing behavior drives them to lie and tell others what they want to hear.   
Manipulative  | Because they think they must conceal their needs, desires, and emotions, they employ _indirect tactics_ to get what they want.   
Overbearing  | To avoid friction, they want you to stand back so they can micromanage and do things the “right” way.   
Compulsive  | Their repression may manifest as self-destructive, compulsive behaviors. These addictions can be drugs, alcohol, or sex (such as porn and masturbation).   
  
> **When “Nice Guy” Became an Ironic Misnomer**
> 
> At his time of writing, Glover wasn’t the only person making the link between “Nice Guys'' and their negative characteristics: Internet culture at the turn of the 21st century brought Nice Guys’ supposed “niceness” under scrutiny. In 2002, Heartless Bitches International—one of the World Wide Web’s first sites made for women, by women—released a series of rants on so-called Nice Guys. Although _NMMNG_ was published digitally in 2000, two years before the rants, HBI’s criticisms are often credited with popularizing the Nice Guy discussion.
> 
> HBI’s take on the definition of a Nice Guy aligns closely with Glover’s. They agree that Nice Guys are actually passive and unkind because of their horrible insecurities. However, Glover’s and HBI’s views, and presentation of those views, do differ somewhat. The rant that extends most outside of Glover’s perspective focuses on how Nice Guys appear to women experiencing them first hand. HBI bluntly states that Nice Guys’ behavior makes them look like stupid, needy, fragile, slobby losers (as a humorous blog, HBI uses much harsher language than Glover—something even the men who agree with them call out in the comments). On the other hand, the rant says Nice Guys make women feel smothered, bored, objectified, patronized, and even like losers themselves.
> 
> Although they have vastly different approaches and audiences, HBI and Glover arrive at the same conclusion: **To overcome your “nice” persona, you must first learn to love yourself.**
