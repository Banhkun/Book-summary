## Exercise: Remember You’re Perfectly Imperfect

Sometimes we need a reminder that we’re loved despite our flaws and mistakes.

* * *

Think of a situation in which you tried to hide a personal flaw or mistake. What concealment strategies (lying, rationalizing, distracting, and so on) did you use?

Consider the effectiveness of your strategies. Did your tactics successfully erase this flaw or mistake?

Were you still loved and supported by those around you after this incident? How might you have approached the situation differently if you knew you had their support no matter what?
