## Exercise: Set Your Boundaries

Practice setting your limits.

* * *

Think of a time you said “yes” to something when you wanted to say “no” (other than something you _have_ to do for work, childcare, and so on). What feelings or fears led you to respond this way?

Now imagine you had said “no.” How do you think the situation would have played out? Why?

What boundaries could you set next time? Write down how you would communicate your limits.
