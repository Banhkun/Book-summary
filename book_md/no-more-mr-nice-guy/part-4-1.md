## Part 4.1: How Nice Guys Deny Their Power | Chapters 5-6

Now that you understand how to live for yourself (and why Nice Guys fail to do this), we’re going to focus on the inherent _power_ Nice Guys deny and Ideal Men embrace.

Before we tackle strategies for empowerment, this section will look at the powerlessness Nice Guys experience when they deny their abilities and masculinity. We’ll also explore some of the societal changes that affected Nice Guys’ perception of other men.

### Nice Guys Act Like Wimps in the Face of Adversity

Calling Nice Guys wimps may sound harsh, but Glover acknowledges that’s often how they act when in the throes of the victim mentality. Between this mentality and his unproductive beliefs, a Nice Guy thinks he lacks control in all aspects of his life, which only feeds into his feelings of resentment, frustration, and powerlessness.

Glover adds that Nice Guys have a particularly hard time embracing life’s ups and downs **because they believe life can (and _should_) be straightforward and smooth. **(They even fear success because of their perfectionist tendencies and the pressure the spotlight brings.) Ultimately, they set themselves up for disappointment because _unpredictability is a fact of life_.

> **Do We Really Want an Easy Life?**
> 
> If we’re set up to feel cheated by thinking a smooth, easy life is possible, why are we inclined to believe it’s possible in the first place?
> 
> Psychotherapist Sian Morgan-Crossley explains that this belief stems in part from our tendency to compare ourselves to others. Under the false impression that everyone around us has it easy, we wonder why our lives aren’t easy, too. Health educator Donnovan Somera Yisrael adds that as humans, we’re evolutionarily inclined to seek out stability. Like our ancestors who sought reliable food, water, and shelter, **our longing for certainty is innate**. So don’t beat yourself up too much for fearing the unknown—it’s human nature.
> 
> But Morgan-Crossley reminds us that **an _easy_ life is one of stagnation**. Without challenges, we can’t grow. In fact, one study on _post-traumatic growth_ found that pushing through adversity can boost our resilience and wisdom, which contributes to our overall well-being. Another study noticed that while people _currently_ facing hardships struggle to recognize and appreciate life’s pleasures, those who find themselves on the “other side” of adversity—at least in the moment—have an increased capacity for appreciating the little things.
> 
> The idea of an easy life may _sound_ appealing but in practice, it would leave us bored and looking for more.

### Nice Guys Reject Their Masculinity

When Nice Guys repress their masculinity, they deny a core part of themselves and their potential power. Between their parental relationships and some major societal shifts in the 20th century, Glover says **Nice Guys grew up believing masculinity was _inherently bad_.** This belief has prompted generations of increasingly passive Nice Guys who are:

#### Attached to Their Mothers

According to Glover, Nice Guys who grew up with emotionally needy mothers remain devoted to them in adulthood. This relationship is normal and healthy in boyhood, but eventually boys must grow up and bond with men to become healthy, masculine adults.

**Ideally, Glover says, a boy becomes a man with help from his mother and father:**

His mother attends to his needs as a child. It’s her job to discourage dependency—including her own—by ensuring her needs are met.

His father’s job is to be present and actively bond with his son, which guides the boy from a matriarchal sphere of influence into the world of _men_.

However, Glover noticed many Nice Guys don’t go through this transition. **Without a strong paternal presence, both mother and son become codependent.** Unable to individuate from his mother, a momma’s boy grows up to be a momma’s man. Glover has witnessed these Nice Guys struggle in future intimate relationships, as their partners realize their attention and devotion lie elsewhere.

> **_Iron John_ and the Transition of Boys to Men**
> 
> Glover isn't the only author to discuss the idea that boys must be ushered into manhood by their fathers. Robert Bly also touches on this topic in _Iron John: A Book About Men_ (1990), a book often discussed as a logical predecessor to Glover’s _NMMNG_. The book focuses on the development of the “soft male” in the 1950s, while trying to reclaim a masculine identity Bly and Glover agree has been somewhat lost to time.
> 
> Like Glover, Bly notes that boys must be initiated into adulthood with the help of their fathers. Unlike Glover, Bly says it’s a son’s job to break away from his mother, as she won’t consciously release him to the dangerous world until he proves he can handle it. With this goal in mind, Bly stresses the importance of initiating a boy into the sphere of men. In many cultures, coming-of-age rituals will do this by 1. simulating a separation between a boy and his parents and 2. teaching a boy to tend to his “wounds” (physical, emotional, or otherwise) in a healthy way.
> 
> Similar to what Glover observed in Nice Guys, Bly says a boy who never experiences this kind of initiation may adopt the role of a victim because he has no productive means of dealing with his wounds and overcoming his codependent relationships.

##### Effects of the Lack of Men in Education

According to Glover, whether inside or outside of the home, boys struggle to find male role models—including in our current public education system. Glover claims that throughout the 20th century, schools saw an increase in female teachers. At the time of _NMMNG_ ’s publication, 15% of American elementary school teachers were male, meaning more often than not, impressionable boys tend to be surrounded by mostly women. Glover says boys become accustomed to seeking women’s approval during these early school years.

(Shortform note: As of 2018, the number of male elementary school teachers in America has dropped to 11%. But the shift to a women-dominated education system didn’t begin in the 20th century as Glover implies (although the number of female teachers did continue to grow at that time). In fact, the trend began as far back as the mid-19th century when the American public school system began. Just a few decades after its inception, more than half the teachers in America were women. Education being seen as “women’s work” is one of the reasons teaching remains an underappreciated and underpaid position, which in turn drives men away from the profession.)

#### Detached From Positive Masculine Traits

To Glover, **masculinity is self-sufficiency.** Positive masculine traits support the survival of the individual, family, and community, such as _determination, strength, bravery, honesty, and passion_. However, he also believes masculinity includes harmful traits like _aggression, ferocity, and cruelty_.

The above destructive traits cause Nice Guys’ fear of masculinity. But while repressing this “dark side,” Glover says they bury their positive masculine traits as well, which makes them: _insecure, cowardly, unambitious, and lifeless_.

> **What Masculinity Means to the Superior Man**
> 
> While Glover and Deida both believe men will benefit from embracing their masculinity, their definitions of the concept differ extensively.
> 
> As the more overtly spiritual of the two, Deida doesn’t simply discuss masculinity, but masculine _energy_. According to him, we all have the capacity for masculine _and_ feminine energy. He breaks these energies into two simple categories: those who ravish (masculine) and those who desire to be ravished (feminine). Deida believes it’s up to you to decide which energy you align most with. That being said, he specifies that _The Way of the Superior Man_ is intended for men who align with the masculine.
> 
> Deida stresses the importance of the _polar attraction_ between the masculine and the feminine, so he further defines both energies through what they can give the other. He sees the following as masculine “gifts” to the opposing feminine:
> 
>   * Unconditional love
> 
>   * Stability
> 
>   * Security
> 
>   * Decisiveness
> 
>   * An analytical perspective
> 
> 

> 
> While Glover’s understanding of masculinity is largely based on what a man is _capable of_ , Deida’s concept lies more in what it _feels_ like to be a man and how this specific energy positively contributes to his relationships and the overall balance of the universe.

##### The Shift From Rural to Urban

**What caused this detachment from positive masculine traits?** Glover sums it up through a major historical change in 20th century America: the shift from rural life to urban life. From the turn of the 20th century onward, America went from an agrarian society to one of primarily urban industry and office jobs. Glover says this caused young men to develop different relationships with their parents:

**Fathers:** When families worked on farms, boys toiled alongside their fathers and other male family members. Once urban life became the norm, fathers spent their days at an office away from their sons. Boys lost regular contact with their fathers and stopped seeing them hard at work.

**Mothers:** With dads away at the office, mothers assumed the role of both parents. It was now Mom’s job to teach her sons the ways of men. This meant **boys saw masculinity filtered through a feminine lens, which increased their detachment from other men.**

(Shortform note: According to the Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, urbanization completely redefined the family unit, work, and even concepts of personal responsibility. But it wasn’t just boys who suffered from the breakdown of the pre-urbanized rural family unit—married women and mothers also experienced a loss of kinship. Smaller families, the dispersal of the extended family unit, and the marginalization of unpaid “domestic” work caused women to become more isolated and lose the support systems they once had. As we've already noted, Glover believes that lonely, emotionally starved mothers form unhealthy attachments to their sons. It seems urbanization helped set the stage for this type of codependent relationship.)

#### Isolated From Other Men

Due to an overall lack of positive male bonding, Glover says **Nice Guys aren’t equipped to develop healthy relationships with fellow men.** They pride themselves on being the opposite of their fathers and other men: attentive (to women), accommodating, even-keeled, and patient. This causes them to miss out on the support and companionship that accompanies male community.

> **The Importance of Friends and Why Men Struggle to Make Them**
> 
> Everyone needs friends (whether they’re a Nice Guy or not). In fact, research has shown that friendships (or a lack of them) affect our physical and mental well-being. One study found that our close relationships with friends have a bigger impact on our lifespan than the strength of our familial relationships: Participants with the most friends were discovered to live 22% longer than those participants with the least amount of friends.
> 
> So if friendships are an integral part of a satisfying life, why do adult men struggle to form them (specifically with other men)? There are a few reasons:
> 
>   * **Men bond around experiences.** While women tend to bond by discussing their lives and emotions, men relate to each other via shared activities (like sports or camping). One study found about 40% of male participants compartmentalized their friendships: Female friends were said to be intimate confidants, while male friends were there for engaging in decidedly male activities with. As men grow up, finding the time, space, and energy for these kinds of shared activities becomes increasingly difficult.
> 
>   * **Men are more likely to prioritize their marriage and career over friendships.** In their book _The Lonely American: Drifting Apart in the Twenty-first Century_ , Drs. Jacqueline Olds and Richard S. Schwartz recall their 1980s study that examined social isolation in America. They found that even more than women, men (regrettably) put their friendships on the backburner to focus on their career, marriage, and family.
> 
>   * **Men’s brains might not be wired to excel at interpersonal communication.** In 2014, neuroscientists conducted the largest study on sex differences in our neural pathways. These researchers found women’s neural pathways appeared to work left to right—or between hemispheres—whereas men’s brains were structured to work front to back within one hemisphere. Women’s _inter_ hemispheric communication allows them to easily connect the analytical and the intuitive, making them better equipped for interpersonal communication. Men’s _intra_ hemispheric communication connects perception with coordinated action, making them better equipped for learning and performing tasks that require coordination.

##### Social Movements That Divided Men

Glover argues that various 20th-century social movements contributed to men's increasing feelings of isolation from one another:

**The Anti-War Movement:** According to Glover, the Vietnam War deepened the chasm between Baby Boomers and their fathers’ generation. World War II veterans took pride in fighting for their country, while their sons of the 1960s protested Vietnam. Unlike their fathers, the young men of the Anti-War movement preached _peace and love_ over bombs and war.

> **The Post-Vietnam Distrust Between Generations**
> 
> In her article “Fathers, Sons, and Vietnam,” sociologist Tracy Karner explores the distrust that arose between WWII veterans and their sons after the latter group returned from Vietnam. She takes Glover’s point further, emphasizing the feelings of betrayal that arose when sons heading overseas—who were told stories of valiant, necessary war in which the US was a “winner”—found the opposite of what their fathers had described. Further, upon their return, the lack of resources offered to Vietnam veterans (as compared to those after WWII) made these young men feel left behind. These sons found the America their fathers had described to be a myth.
> 
> Between Vietnam, Watergate, and shifting morals of the 1960s and 70s, **this “crisis of credibility” forced the younger generation to question all forms of authority—including their fathers and their brand of masculinity.**

**Second-Wave Feminism:** During the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s, women continued to break free from their assumed roles while**men grew increasingly confused about their role in society.** In particular, Glover says young men internalized radical feminist slogans that asserted men were bad or useless. Nice Guys were already scrambling to please women—and now they believed they had to try _even harder_. This obsessive focus on solely _women’s_ approval continued to isolate men from one another.

> **Were Men Negatively Impacted by “Feminist Slogans”?**
> 
> While the impact of feminist movements on gender roles and societal values is clear, there’s little concrete evidence to back up Glover’s claim that the second-wave’s “radical slogans” negatively affected the egos of young men. In fact, these “damaging” slogans likely didn’t exist to the degree that Glover implies, or at least weren’t mainstream enough to affect an entire generation of men.
> 
> Unlike first-wave feminism—which focused on women’s voting and property rights—the women’s liberation movement of the mid-to-late 20th century turned its sights on women’s roles in the home and workplace, reproductive rights, legal inequalities, judgmentcto sexism, as well as domestic and sexual violence towards women. With these goals in mind, the most prominent slogan of the second-wave movement was not a tirade against men but, “The personal is political.” This phrase sought to highlight the fact that women’s everyday experiences were entrenched in their unequal political and social status. Its impact inspired women to weave political activism into their daily lives and prompted the creation of feminist consciousness-raising groups.
> 
> The main slogan Glover takes issue with is “All men are rapists,” which comes from Marilyn French’s novel _The Women's Room_ (1977). (However, the full quote is: “All men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes.”) The book explores a range of women involved in the liberation movement and that particular phrase is said by a character meant to represent militant radical feminists, _not_ mainstream feminism. Although French’s novel was a New York Times bestseller the year of its release, it was considered a text for “hardcore feminists” and was critiqued harshly in the media for its portrayal of men. Thus, it’s difficult to imagine this slogan permeating pop culture and the minds of young men in the way Glover describes.
> 
> With the context of this phrase in mind, as well as a lack of historical or psychological research on the impact of these “slogans” on men, we don’t have hard facts to corroborate Glover’s observations on this topic.
