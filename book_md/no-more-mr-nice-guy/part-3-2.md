## Part 3.2: How to Start Living for Yourself | Chapters 3-4

Now that you understand the ways and mechanisms that cause Nice Guys to live for others, let’s focus on how to _live for yourself_.

We’ll start with **how to reach a point of self-acceptance**. Then, we’ll focus on the next step: **prioritizing yourself so** **you can take responsibility for your own needs**.

### Accept Your True Self

The first goal of the Ideal Man is _self-approval_. This journey begins by looking inward—rather than outward—for approval. Glover notes that **to be truly intimate with yourself and others, you must wholeheartedly be yourself.**

Here are Glover’s self-acceptance strategies:

#### Self-Reflection: ID Your Approval-Seeking Habits

Before you can accept yourself, you must look inward and recognize your approval-seeking habits. In order to ID them, ask yourself what _you_ want.

Observe your day-to-day behaviors. Glover suggests you take a minute to acknowledge not only _what_ you do but _why_ you do it, especially in regards to your attachments. Ask yourself:

  * “Does this make me happy?”
  * “Who am I doing this for?”
  * “What do I want? What do I need?”



> **Ask _What_ , Not _Why_ When Self-Reflecting**
> 
> The ultimate goal of self-reflection is self-awareness, but does all introspection lead to this outcome? Organizational psychologist Tasha Eurich says _not necessarily._ Eurich cites multiple studies that show **self-reflection isn’t directly correlated to our self-awareness**. This doesn’t mean self-reflection is a useless act but that we must do it _with intention_.
> 
> Although Glover encourages us to consider _why_ we do the things we do, **Eurich urges us to instead ask ourselves _what_ questions when self-reflecting to make that reflection more intentional and productive.** For example, instead of asking _why_ you have a specific attachment, you might find it more productive to phrase this question as “ _What_ does this behavior do for me?” or “ _What_ effect does this behavior have on my self-worth?”
> 
> According to Eurich, _why_ questions (“ _Why_ do I feel this way”) are more likely to prompt us to think of our past or personal failings, or launch us into the victim mentality. Meanwhile, _what_ questions (“ _What_ am I feeling right now?”) help us name and understand our current emotions or even imagine our potential. In her own studies, Eurich found those who both practiced self-reflection _and_ developed self-awareness always focused on the _what_.
> 
> Are _why_ questions ever appropriate? Eurich says yes, but we should save our _whys_ for problems in our environment (“ _Why_ did this experiment fail?”) and our _whats_ for issues of the self (“ _What_ do I value?”).

#### Self Care: You’re Worth It

Glover states that because Nice Guys doubt their self-worth, they rarely do nice things for themselves. But taking good care of yourself is necessary to assert your value. Additionally, **spending time with yourself gives you the opportunity to reflect on your wants, needs, feelings, and general life direction.** Most importantly, Glover says, _you_ make the decisions during this me-time. Ask yourself what care you need (or even want) in the moment.

Self-care can be as simple as drinking more water throughout your day or as elaborate as taking a dream vacation. According to Glover, two dissonant ideas come together when Nice Guys start caring for themselves:

  * “I’m valuable.” (Asserted by the act of self-care)
  * “I’m worthless.” (Asserted by old self-limiting beliefs)



But like anything, self-care is a matter of practice. The more you do it, the more often the little voice that says “ _You’re worth it!_ ” will win out.

> **Making Time for Self-Care**
> 
> A common myth about self-care is that we just _don’t have time for it_. But with your self-worth and well-being at stake, **self-care should be a priority rather than a luxury.**
> 
> Here are some tips for working regular self-care into your daily schedule:
> 
>   * **Just say no:** Self-care doesn’t have to involve adding lots of activities on top of your already busy life. Sometimes you can simply refrain from things that cause you stress or negative emotions. For example, if you find social media to be a crutch or wasteful time-suck, deleting the social apps from your phone could be an instant act of self-care (and may even free up more of your time). Saying “no” to something that you can’t or don’t want to do is another act of self-care that only _gives_ you more of your time back.
> 
>   * **Schedule it:** Thinking of self-care as an _if-I-get-to-it_ activity is a surefire way to make sure it doesn’t happen. This is why scheduling it, as you would any meeting or appointment, is essential. You don’t need to block out hours on end for self-care but find brief, regular moments to take for yourself. You could include a short walk outside during your lunch break. Or maybe you wake up 15 minutes earlier to start your day with a quick workout. Even five minutes of meditation can help break up your day. Making self-care part of your daily routine will help it become habit.
> 
>   * **Get some help:** If you feel like your days are simply too busy to make any time for yourself, it’s time to utilize your resources. This might mean using technology or other services to optimize your time (like a meal delivery service to cut down on cooking). But it also includes asking those around you to help with your workload. Ask your neighbor to watch the kids for a night so you and your partner can have a date night. In the time it takes your roommate to do the dishes you could do a face mask and take a nice hot shower.

> 
> _Simple Self-Care Techniques_
> 
> Embracing and caring for the power of your mind, body, and spirit doesn’t need to be difficult. Here are a few more ways you can practice self-care regularly:
> 
> **Mind:** Read a book, keep a journal, dive into a hobby, declutter your space, take a mental health day
> 
> **Body:** Eat healthy foods, get a good night’s sleep, get a massage, cut down on intoxicants, go to the doctor or dentist
> 
> **Spirit:** Spend time with friends, treat yourself to a gift, enjoy music, relax (in nature, in the bath—whatever _you_ need)

#### Positive Affirmations: You Can Do This

Glover suggests using _positive affirmations_ —or constructive statements that challenge old beliefs—to help you push through moments of self-doubt. Tell yourself you’re lovable, important, and capable in a way that works best for you.

Glover wants you to remember that **affirmations alone cannot change a person.** However, he says they help reinforce productive habits and combat negative thoughts.

While we encourage you to create your own, here are some example affirmations to get you started:

  * “I’m worthy of love and acceptance.”
  * “I’m enough just as I am.”
  * “I deserve happiness.”
  * “I’m allowed to take time for myself.”
  * “My needs are valid. My feelings are valid.”
  * “I’m human and I make mistakes.”
  * “My past is not a reflection of my future.”
  * “I am capable. I can do this.”
  * “I have the power to create change.”
  * “My potential is limitless.”



> **Do Positive Affirmations Actually Work?**
> 
> In his review of scientific literature on positive affirmations, addictions counselor Steve Rose noticed that positive affirmations don’t often work the way we expect them to. Despite claims that affirmations help us battle our worst thoughts and moods, studies show that isn’t totally accurate. One study found that using affirmations we don’t already believe may actually make us feel worse. Another noticed that while listening to positive affirmations may help boost your mood, reading them may lead to unproductive self-reflection.
> 
> This doesn’t mean positive affirmations are useless, but if you find they make you feel _worse_ , don’t force it. You can’t compel yourself to instantly accept something you don’t believe—yet.
> 
> So when _do_ positive affirmations work? Rose says they’re better for affirming beliefs you already hold. One study found stating your values or beliefs out loud can boost your motivation or guide your internal compass.

#### Reveal Yourself: Share With Others

As you start to discover the real you, Glover recommends keeping a support system or “safe people” around to help you through ups and downs (he prefers a support group of other men). Exposing your true self can be scary, so do it with people you trust**.**

According to Glover, **our safe people help us combat self-sabotaging beliefs and serve as a reminder that we’re loved, even when we slip up.** Although we’ve stressed the importance of internal validation, external affirmations from safe people like “I’m proud of you,” and “We’re here for you no matter what,” help reverse unproductive beliefs.

(Shortform note: In addition to affirmations, your safe people can keep you on track and prevent you from developing tunnel vision. In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves note that in times of distress, we often get bogged down in the details. But outside parties provide an objective perspective and can help us see the bigger picture, decipher our emotions, and figure out a path forward. They suggest explicitly telling those in your life about your personal goals, as they can hold you accountable through related challenges and choices.)

### Become Unselfishly Selfish

If Nice Guys are selfishly unselfish when prioritizing others, Ideal Men must be _unselfishly selfish_ by putting themselves first. According to Glover, **there’s only one way to become unselfishly selfish:_Take responsibility for your needs_. **When you prioritize yourself, you assert new, more productive beliefs about yourself, your needs, and how to meet these needs. **Everyone has needs and prioritizing yourself is the only mature, direct, and honest means of satisfying them.**

(Shortform note: Although Deida agrees that the Superior Man is responsible for himself, his interpretation of what this responsibility _is_ differs from Glover’s. Deida believes that in his intimate relationships, the Superior Man is responsible not necessarily for his needs, but for knowing his purpose in life and using it to set goals to keep himself and his woman on track. As a man, Deida says it’s your responsibility to cut through female moods and emotions—as well as your own preoccupations with your duties—and provide you both with a clear direction.)

Glover suggests you start small: **Try putting yourself first for a week.** Let those in your life know about your experiment and what you hope to gain from it. At the end of the week, check in with yourself and your loved ones. What changed?

Men in Glover’s support group participated in the same weeklong challenge. In the end, he noticed his patients’ covert contracts and resentment-fueled outbursts began to disappear. They were finally in a position to genuinely _care_ for their loved ones. No longer smothered, their partners were free to prioritize themselves in return.

> **Why You Shouldn’t Feel Guilty for Prioritizing Yourself**
> 
> Although, as the example of Glover’s support group shows, prioritizing yourself can have many positive effects, many of us still feel guilty for doing so. If you’re experiencing guilt because you believe prioritizing yourself...
> 
> **Makes you a narcissist:** Science says you can throw this thought away entirely. According to psychotherapist Dr. Jon Belford, if this worry is keeping you from caring for yourself, you’re not a narcissist as this thought wouldn’t even cross a true narcissist’s mind.
> 
> **Is all about personal, instant gratification:** Define what putting yourself first really means. This isn’t about “feeling good” or “indulging,” it’s about doing what you need to do for your wellbeing.
> 
> **Takes time away from something or someone else:** There will always be something else you could be doing, but taking care of your needs makes you a more available and present partner, parent, or employee/leader. So you’re not doing it “at the expense” of something else. You’re doing it so you can be a more caring person.
