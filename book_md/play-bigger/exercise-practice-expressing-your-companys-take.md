## Exercise: Practice Expressing Your Company’s Take

Define your personal take to practice expressing your company’s take.

* * *

Write down three qualities or traits that are an important part of your identity. (For instance, these might be 1) sense of humor, 2) generosity, and 3) open-mindedness.)

Now, note a few guiding principles that inform how you behave and view the world. Also briefly describe your outlook on the world—what’s the lens through which you view what’s happening around you? (A sample principle might be: “Treat others as you wish to be treated,” and your outlook might be described as: “Don’t take life too seriously.”)

Next, think of a brief story that describes a self-improvement or learning journey you’ve been on. What’s something about yourself you’ve worked to improve over the years? What initially made you notice that thing? (For instance, you used to be anxious around other people but have worked to increase your social comfort because you wanted to connect more to others.)

Finally, complete the above steps for your company, thinking of your company as an individual with a personality, thoughts, and feelings. What are your company’s strongest qualities? How does it view the world and what are its guiding principles? What problem did it notice and seek to solve?
