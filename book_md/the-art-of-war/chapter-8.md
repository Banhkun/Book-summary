## Chapter 8: Flexibility in Leadership

**A good leader knows how to adapt to make any situation an advantageous one.** You must have a flexible mind to be able to see advantages in the land and in your position and make use of them. If you maintain a constant stance or structure, you may also reveal your form and weakness of mind to the enemy, which puts your troops in harm.

**Be willing to adapt your strategy accordingly depending on the circumstances.** If you merely allow the momentum of forces to serve as a guide for action, your advantage will never change.

If you try to push your troops without the benefit of adaptation, even if your force is bigger, you will have a hard time gaining the trust of your troops. If your troops don’t trust your judgement, they won’t fight for you.

### Rules of Adaptation

**The ability to adapt means having contingencies in place when momentum is not on your side.** It also means doing the opposite of what seems advantageous in the moment. The following are rules for adaptation:

  * Have plans in place for how to handle being surrounded or backed into a corner to balance your disadvantage.
  * Avoid action that seems too easy, such as taking a direct route when there are areas on the route that could lend to ambush. 
  * Don’t attack a weakened enemy when you see that they have nothing to lose. 
  * Don’t attack an easily taken territory if the locals are loyal and there is an abundance of supplies on hand.
  * Don’t attack a territory when keeping it secure would require more effort than what is gained. 
  * Dismiss the orders of your civil leaders when they lead to emptiness for your troops.
  * Do what is right for advantage, not what is right for greed.



### The Psychology of Adaptation

Understanding your strategy facilitates adaptation, as does understanding the mindset of the enemy. **Psychology plays an important role in actions and counteractions during battle.** For instance, what hinders your competitor is the threat of harm. What ties up your competitor is work. What energizes your competitor is possible gain.

  * Make your enemy believe harm will come from attacking you, and they will thwart themselves.
  * Confuse the enemy with deception and formlessness, and they will work overtime chasing you around.
  * Tempt the enemy with profit, and they will be easily persuaded. 



Assume the enemy will enter conflict and attack, and prepare for it before it is even broached.

There are five ways you can do more harm than good as a leader.

  * If you have no fear of death, you can be killed.
  * If you have too great a fear of death, you are vulnerable to capture.
  * If you have a hot temper, you can be lured into foolish situations.
  * If you are self-righteous, you can be offended easily.
  * If you are too benevolent, you can be lured into rescue traps or hesitant to take the necessary actions. 



Therefore, you should not be resigned to death or feel that life is too precious. Be guided by strategy and momentum only, thereby being immune to goading or flattery.

> **Historical Example: Tempting the Enemy into Formation**
> 
> During the Spring and Autumn Era, the state of Chu wanted to attack the state of Jiao. The Chu general knew that the Jiao were small and led by volatility. He also knew they had a reputation for chasing opportunities for gain.
> 
> He sent a force of unarmed men into Jiao territory under the guise of chopping wood. The men were quickly captured, and the taste of victory grew heavy in the mouth of Jiao’s leaders. Bolstered by this capture, the Jiao sent a force to chase the Chu into the mountains. However, the Chu, knowing the Jiao would not be able to resist this goading, were lying in wait. When the Jiao forces rushed the mountains, the Chu ambushed them and attained victory.
