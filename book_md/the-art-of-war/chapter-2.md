## Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for Victory

In order to set the stage for victory, you need to manage both your resources and your forces wisely.

### Wise Resource Management

One way a mishandling of resources leads to defeat is through extensive and exhaustive battles. **Extensive and lengthy operations deplete your reserves.** Thus, an intelligent leader will not keep his troops in the field for lengthy periods.

  * Waging war is like igniting a fire. If the flame burns too hot for too long, it will burn itself out.
  * Similarly, engaging in extended battles without gain will exhaust your resources, including weapons, money, energy, and food. This will weaken your troops and lead to loss.



Therefore, battles should be swift. **Be big and bold, attacking quickly and ferociously, then retreating.**

#### Tactics for Ensuring Ample Resources

**Use your enemy’s resources when possible to sustain your troops.** Build your armor from your home stores, but when you win the battle, nourish your bodies with the enemy’s food. Feeding off the enemy’s food supply has three benefits:

  1. You save your resources for when they are really needed, such as during a lengthy campaign. 
  2. You reduce the resources of the enemy, leaving them vulnerable to an attack. 
  3. You don’t have to take food from your homeland, which leaves nothing left for the people and leads to poverty.



Also, take into account that costs of goods near a place of battle will inflate, which causes a strain on the locals’ finances. This scenario can leave a country impoverished as goods are depleted and spending increases.

  * For example, if the battleground is close to home, local proprietors of goods will raise their prices to benefit from the military presence. 
  * As food prices increase, many locals will be unable to afford those goods or overextend their finances to afford them.
  * Further impacting locals, the supply of goods will be used up quickly by the military. When there is no more food, the locals will suffer.
  * They will have no money available for the procurement of goods from other sources.
  * Without food and money, the quality of life for the locals will decrease. 



Lengthy campaigns create a negative situation for the homeland, whether the battleground is nearby or far away.

  * **When resources are depleted through lengthy battles, the people, as well as the military, become exhausted and suffer.**
  * If your country is left in peril without resources or money, there will be no one to support your leadership anymore.
  * If the military acts intelligently, everyone involved, including those at home, will benefit. 



### Managing Your Force

**You should gather your troops only after an assessment of yourself and your enemy has been made and victory is determined the likely outcome.** If you gather troops too soon and have to redo the action down the line when you really need them, the public will be weary and less supportive.

However, gathering the troops is not all that is required to build a strong and successful force. **Ensuring that the troops are rewarded for their efforts will breed motivation.**

  * Rewards should be intentional and earned. 
  * They should be delivered without bias of rank. 



Rewards given smartly will encourage the troops to behave in a manner that reaps rewards. On the other hand, rewarding everyone equally or arbitrarily will generate no motivation and deplete your resources.

Likewise, punishments are just as useful as rewards in building the constitution of your force.

> **Historical Example: Rewards**
> 
> General Cao Cao was a well-respected and renowned military leader in Chinese history who avidly abided by Sun Tzu’s _Art of War_. Toward the end of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E. to 220 C.E.), Cao Cao often invaded enemy territories. During these raids, he would acquire a trove of valuable treasures, whether rare objects or gold. Whenever these spoils were retrieved, he would divvy them out to those who showed incredible strength and effort. He was generous with his rewards. Those who did not show exceptional prowess or effort received nothing. In this way, his soldiers were motivated to work hard, and he was able to be successful in most of his battles.

> **Historical Example: Punishments**
> 
> General Yang Su commanded during the Sui Dynasty (558 to 617 C.E.). He was known for his decisive leadership and swift executions of those who disobeyed his command. In preparation for battle, Yang would seek out troublemakers or those who’d erred for execution. This number could be as low as 12 men or as high as 100.
> 
> When it was time to engage in combat, he would send out hundreds of men to attack the enemy. If they failed, he would execute them and send another group. If they failed, the process was repeated. Everyone under his command understood the stakes of failure, and as a result, they always fought hard and were often successful in overtaking their opponents.
