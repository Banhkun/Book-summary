## Shortform Introduction

_The Art of War_ was written as a strategic handbook for how to navigate military conflict. The principles and suggestions provided throughout the book are geared toward armed struggle and the relationships between governments and military factions. Because of this, much of the language used throughout this summary involves military jargon and references. However, the teachings of this book are applicable to real-world scenarios, as well. Whenever possible, efforts have been made to use more general language. In places where the language is more jargon-heavy, we’ve translated the military terms and position categories into modern-day representations to help you understand how these principles relate to your personal experiences.

The actual text of Sun Tzu’s words is pithy; Lionel Giles’s classic 1910 translation of _The Art of War_ is just 25 pages long. However, because of its pithiness, it can be undecipherable. As a result, a variety of translations have been published with further elaboration on Sun Tzu’s words. We’ve based our summary on Thomas Cleary’s translation, which includes line-by-line commentary by historical Chinese generals and scholars. In our summary, much of the elaboration and historical examples come from this commentary to augment Sun Tzu’s words.
