## Chapter 3: A Thoughtful Plan of Attack

Victory is not just winning the battle. **Killing is not the most important thing. Destabilizing your opponent is.** If the battle is won but the opponent’s forces and country are obliterated, that is a lesser victory than if you are able to overcome them and force a surrender.

  * If you can weaken your opponent’s resolve and force them to concede with their nation intact, your victory is more successful.
  * The people will have greater respect for a battle won with integrity than one won through total destruction. 



If you prepare your forces and show your prowess in the five traits, you will have won the psychological battle and may avoid a physical one. If the surrender comes before a battle is fought, all the better. **Killing should only be a matter of necessity to survive, not the goal of the mission.**

#### Strike Preemptively to Avoid Battle

**The best time to strike an enemy is when they are involved in preparations.** Strike before the enemy is fully mobilized, and they will be unable to fight back. This may prevent a battle. This strategy involves using intelligence, rather than brawn, to win.

If intelligent strategies don’t work, the next strategy is to win through intimidation.

  * Form alliances to increase your strength to a point where fighting would be ill-advised for your opponent. 
  * Form alliances with the enemy’s allies to disrupt the enemy’s power. 



Ultimate victory is when battle has been thwarted through intelligence or intimidation, there has been no destruction, no cities have been seized, and no blood has been shed.

> Historical Example: Ending Conflict Before It Begins
> 
> During the Spring and Autumn Era (722 to 481 B.C.E.), when the Zhou dynasty was beginning to collapse, the state of Jin wanted to overtake the state of Qi, a much smaller state. The Jin sent an emissary to scope out the Qi. The emissary, feigning drunk aggression, insulted the Qi’s ruler and tried to force the Qi to disregard etiquette. When the Qi did not react to the insult and did not abide the aggressive demand, the emissary returned home and told the Jin leadership that the Qi were alert, cautious, and prepared. Therefore, they should not be attacked at this time. The Qi were able to thwart armed battle through intelligence.

#### Prepare Adequately

However, if strategic, psychological warfare does not lead to an early solution, then you may be called upon to physically attack enemy forces. **Attacks should be on enemy forces only** , not territories, cities, or civilians**.**

  * Prepare ahead of time to avoid catastrophe in the field. Sun Tzu says six months are required to prepare the materials for an attack, including weapons and shelters, to avoid malfunctions and casualties. Don’t rush into battle without first ensuring that you’re adequately prepared. If you fight from a place of anger and don’t take time to prepare, you will be sending your troops to their deaths. 



A strategic siege is one where your forces are still strong, your resources still ample, and your casualties are nil.

### The Rules for Approaching Enemy Forces

If all traits are equal between you and your enemy, there are rules for how to proceed.

If you have ten times the troops, you should surround the enemy.

  * A large differential is needed if you are to enclose them without gaps in the formation. 



If your numbers are not large enough to attack, such as only five times larger than those of the enemy, divide your troops into groups.

  * Use several groups to broach an attack, and keep a few back to bar against surprise attacks and exploit any enemy weaknesses you observe as the attack progresses. 



If you are only slightly larger, such as a two-to-one ratio, divide your troops into two groups.

  * Use one group to draw out the opponent, and use the other to attack them unexpectedly. 



If you are equal in size and ability, deploy strategies to avoid direct combat.

  * Use strategies of division to disrupt the enemy’s power, then engage in ambushes and surprise attacks. 
  * If this strategy is not possible, go on the defensive and stand your ground.
  * Don’t get pulled into battle if you are not sure of victory.



If you are smaller or weaker, avoid conflict and flee.

  * Again, **engaging in battle without the assurance of victory is a foolish strategy.**
  * After retreating, build up your defenses and see to the nourishment of the troops.
  * Wait for a gap in the enemy’s strategy or for the enemy to relax, then strike.



### Understanding Appropriate Strategy

The strategy of your troops must be malleable based on circumstances. **If you try to control the troops only after conflict has begun, you will be thwarted or outmaneuvered.**

If you know your strengths and abilities and measure them as effective against your opponent, you can enter conflict prepared for anything. If you only know your strength and not your opponent’s, you will enter conflict blindly.

  * When you understand the essence of your enemy, you will know how to approach battle against them. 
  * When you understand your essence, you will know where you are vulnerable and how to mitigate impact. 



> **Historical Example: Knowing When to Fight**
> 
> At the beginning of the new Tang dynasty (618 to 905 C.E.), the founding ruler wanted to wipe out rebel armies from the former Sui dynasty still on the attack. When the ruler and a fellow warrior scouted the rebel army, they saw they were at a disadvantage sizewise. The warrior cautioned that attacking the rebels head on would be impossible. He suggested fortifying their position to tire them out and deplete their resources. The rebels expended much energy to instigate a battle with the Tang and ran out of food by nightfall. When they started to retreat, the Tang army followed and overpowered them.
