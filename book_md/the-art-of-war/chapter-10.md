## Chapter 10: Land of Opportunity and Danger

Within the strategy of successful leadership, you must understand both the types of terrain and grounds on which battles may be waged. _Terrain_ includes all physical elements of the land, and _grounds_ refer to the psychological considerations encompassed in the land.

### Terrain

There are multiple types of terrain, each with their advantages and disadvantages. **Terrain works as a supplementary member of your force, aiding advantage and victory.** You should have a strong sense of the surrounding terrain. The types of terrain and encompassing qualities are as follows:

**_Easily passable terrain:_** Terrain that allows both sides to move freely in and out.

  * If you command this terrain first and occupy the easiest routes, you will have the advantage. 



**_Hung up terrain:_** Terrain that is easy to enter but difficult to retreat from.

  * If the enemy has taken this terrain but is not prepared, you can advance with the advantage. 
  * If the enemy is prepared, advancing brings no advantage and you may become stuck and unable to retreat if necessary. 



**_Standoff terrain:_** Terrain that is unwelcoming to both sides, thereby creating disadvantages for both sides.

  * If the enemy is positioned in this terrain, be wary of opportunities for gain on this terrain. 
  * If the enemy provides a means for you to gain advantage, hold your ground. They will be forced to either retreat or advance, and you can attack from your advantageous position.



**_Narrow terrain:_** Terrain that offers only a small parcel of land.

  * If you get to this terrain first, occupy it completely and wait. 
  * If the enemy gets there first and occupies it, do not advance. 
  * If they get there first but fail to occupy the space, advance to gain the advantage. 



**_Steep terrain:_** Terrain comprising any part of the land that slopes.

  * Do not fight uphill on this terrain.
  * If you get there first, set up high and wait for the enemy.
  * If the enemy gets there first, retreat and fortify your defense position. 



**_Wide-open terrain:_** Terrain that lends no advantages to either side.

  * On this terrain, the momentum is equal.
  * Do not advance or engage in battle on this terrain because there is no way to gain advantage. 



Once you have assessed your opponent and the terrain, you will have a clear picture of where advantages lie and can be victorious. If you don’t assess either, you will lose.

### The Nine Grounds

There are nine types of “grounds” encompassed in armed conflicts.

**_Ground of dissolution:_** Basically a civil war, in which two factions from the same territory war with each other.

  * When troops battle close to home, their stability and endurance come into question.



**_Light ground:_** When you enter foreign territory but stay along the fringe.

  * Light ground allows troops to retreat easily.
  * Because light ground is easy to retreat from, the minds of the troops are not yet overcome by the realities of their duty, making them less effective.
  * When on light ground, move swiftly to avoid wandering minds and waning courage. 



**_Ground of contention:_** Land that is advantageous for whoever claims it first, either you or your enemy.

  * Examples include any natural barricades or strategic routes. 
  * If you get to this land first, occupy it. 
  * If the enemy gets there first, do not confront and attack. They have the advantage of the land on their side. 



**_Trafficked ground:_** Land with many avenues for entrance and retreat that is easily accessible.

  * Allow these routes to stay open so as to not cut off supplies or lose advantage. 



**_Intersecting ground:_** Land surrounded by population on three sides.

  * The first to gain this land gains access to all three territories.
  * If you are able to occupy this land and can earn the allegiance of the people, you will win. 
  * If you do not earn their allegiance, you are in trouble. 



**_Heavy ground:_** When you enter foreign territory and entrench your troops deep within it.

  * Heavy ground is difficult to retreat from.
  * Invaders become tougher and stronger the farther they enter into enemy territory.
  * Once on heavy ground, your troops become resigned to the fact that there is no easy retreat. They become geared to fight to the death. 
  * When in heavy ground, amass supplies and treat the locals humanely.



**_Bad ground:_** Land with difficult-to-pass natural features and which provides no stability for fortifying your positions.

  * Bad ground provides no advantages and should be vacated quickly. 



**_Surrounded ground:_** Land that is narrow and difficult to get into and convoluted to get out of.

  * Surrounded ground allows enemy forces to trap you and defeat you, even if you are stronger. 
  * If caught in surrounded ground, use unorthodox tactics to fight.



**_Dying ground:_** Land on which you can survive if your attack is swift and die when it is not.

  * The land is such that movement has become restricted and your only choice is to fight.
  * When your troops know there is no way out but to fight, they will do so with all their strength.



#### Understanding How Grounds Equate to Victory

By nature, leaders place their troops in harm’s way. Thus, all aspects of terrain, ground, benefits and dangers, and humanity must be assessed.

Therefore, when considering the state of your troops in relation to the grounds, the strategy is as follows:

  * Create emotional and mental unity among the troops on ground of dissolution. 
  * Maintain contact on light ground.
  * Keep your troops close and agile on ground of contention.
  * Fortify your troops’ defenses on trafficked ground.
  * Create strong alliances on intersecting ground. 
  * Provide proper provisions on heavy ground.
  * Push your troops forward on bad ground.
  * Tighten your front on surrounded ground.
  * Be honest about death on deadly ground. 



> **Historical example: Forming Alliances**
> 
> During the Three Kingdoms Era, the Shu army surrounded a faction of the Wei military. Cao Cao, a Wei general, wanted to relocate the rest of the Wei’s capital away from enemy lines for safety. But a minister of Wei advised against such an action, stating that it exuded weakness. Instead, he said they should form an alliance with the state of Wu. The Shu and Wu were considered to be allies, but the minister knew this was only a surface appearance. He assumed the Wu leadership would begrudge the Shu gains.
> 
> Cao Cao agreed and sent an emissary to create an alliance with Wu, who was tasked with attacking the Shu from the back. The Wu were successful, and the Shu retreated from its position surrounding the Wei army.
