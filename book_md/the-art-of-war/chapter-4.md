## Chapter 4: Organizing Your Forces

**The formation that a group of forces takes signifies the psychological state of those forces.** How you organize your troops provides insight into the stability and ability of your strategy and forces. Therefore, the formed express volumes and the formless express nothing. Be sure to hide your troopâ€™s formation.

**Likewise, the stance or formation of your enemy indicates their psychological state**. However, you cannot force your enemy to take a stance. You must understand that victory can be predicted but not created.

  * If your enemy fails to expose themselves through formation, you cannot know whether victory is certain. 
  * If victory is not certain, you should not attack. You can only prepare your own troops. 



### Defense vs. Offense

**Defense means laying low and becoming unseeable.** Within strategy, aim to appear formless, or unorganized, to keep the enemy from attaining insight into your forces. But keep your troops organized, and be prepared for the opposition.

  * **A good defense is the appearance of formlessness.**
  * Be defensive when victory is uncertain or you are lacking yourself.
  * Cover your tracks and appear unorganized until a vulnerability appears in your enemy, then switch to offense. 



Offense means attacking swiftly and decisively, bursting forth with the strength of a thunderstorm. If you attack quickly and with strength, it will be impossible for your opponent to prepare or react.

  * **Be on offense only when you have more than enough power to ensure victory.**



It is impossible to gauge the volume of water pooling in a deep canyon. Similarly, when your forces are hidden on the defense, your opponent cannot gauge your volume and strength. Like the release of the deluge, your offense will be massive and overwhelming.

### The Easy Victory

**A victorious leader wins first and battles second.** Therefore, a good leader takes advantage of opportunity, wherein they succeed when winning is easy. An easy victory means understanding the nuances of your opponent in order to preemptively strike.

  * Stand on advantageous ground by taking into consideration all circumstances that create vulnerability in your opponent. 
  * Another way of thinking about advantageous ground is creating a strategy that is so inscrutable and adaptable that defeating you becomes close to impossible. 
  * You have a contingency for everything, making you always prepared. 
  * You know your opponents so well as to be able to recognize even the slightest weakness and exploit it. 



> **Historical Example: The Consequences of Battle Without Strategy**
> 
> Toward the end of the sixth century, two empires were in conflict for supremacy: the Zhou and the Qi. The Zhou ruler wanted to attack a valuable Qi territory, but one of his advisors cautioned against it. The advisor expressed concern over the large and highly trained Qi forces tasked with defending the territory, stating that even if they attacked with their full strength, they would not be able to take the territory easily, if at all. He suggested attacking a smaller, less valuable territory, where victory was more assured. The Zhou ruler ignored this warning and went ahead with the attack, losing the battle and many men and resources along the way.
