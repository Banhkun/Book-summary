## Exercise: Practice the Focusing Question

The focusing question, intended to help you figure out what your immediate priority should be, is: “What’s the One Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” You can apply it to your work or any aspect of your life. For practice, try applying it to a simple goal, such as healthy eating.

* * *

Start by considering the question, “What’s the One Thing I can do to ensure that I eat healthy today such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” What are some possible answers?

Considering your possible answers, which one would make the most difference in ensuring that you eat healthily today?

How would doing that thing make everything else easier or unnecessary? For instance, taking healthy food to work with you might make it easier to resist eating the doughnuts in the break room.

Finally, extend the time frame in the focusing question to “this week” and “this month.” What One Thing would enable you to eat healthy not just today, but this week and this month?
