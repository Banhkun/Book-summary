## Exercise: Block Your Time

The key to productivity is scheduling or blocking time on your calendar—at least four hours daily—to focus on your priority and resisting distractions and interruptions.

* * *

How much uninterrupted time do you consistently spend each day on your top priority at work or in your personal life, so that you are making measurable progress each day and week toward your big goal?

What are the forces working against blocking off more time for your priority? Which one has the biggest impact?

How can you address each person or circumstance that keeps you from focusing on your priority—for instance, by changing your schedule, shutting down your email, or moving to a quieter location for your time block? (Remember that it’s your choice whether to be a victim of your circumstances.)

How might you enlist support from your boss and colleagues to focus on your priority?
