## Chapter 18: Live Large

**When you dream big and then make that dream your goal, you’ll end up living large.** To see what this could look like, write down your income and multiply it by two, five, ten, or some other number. Then write down the new number.

Ask yourself whether what you’re doing now will get you this number in the next five years. If your current actions will get you there, continue doubling the number until they won’t.

If you change your actions to match the ultimate number—your big goal—you’ll be living large.

You can apply this process to anything that matters: your health, relationships, spiritual life, career, finances, or business success. **When you stop limiting your thinking, you remove the limits on where you can go in your life.**

Of course, getting there requires working backward from your goal to determine the specific steps you need to take. Then, build momentum toward your goal by focusing on each One Thing until you master it. By taking action now, you avoid the alternative, which is feeling regret later.

In _Top Five Regrets of the Dying_ , Bronnie Ware interviewed people at the end of their lives about what they wished they’d done differently. The most common responses were wishing they’d:

  * Embraced happiness (realizing happiness is a choice)
  * Kept in touch with friends
  * Had the courage to express feelings
  * Not worked so hard
  * Lived their dreams, not others’ expectations.



Other researchers have also found that what people regret most at the end of life are the things they didn’t do. The way to avoid this is to make sure that each day you do what matters most, so that everything else falls into place. **You are the engineer of your success and are the first domino.**
