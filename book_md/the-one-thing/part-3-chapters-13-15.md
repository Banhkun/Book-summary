## Part 3 | Chapters 13-15: Implementing the One Thing

**There are three components to implementing your One Thing and achieving exceptional results: purpose, priority, and productivity.** Your big One Thing is your **purpose** , and your small One Thing is what you do now—your **priority** —to achieve it.

Purpose, priority, and productivity are like three parts of an iceberg. Productivity is the tip or part you see (just one-ninth of the iceberg). Priority is directly under the surface and purpose is deeper. Your purpose determines your priority, and both purpose and priority drive productivity.

How well you connect your purpose, priority, and productivity determines your personal level of success; the same formula applies to business success as well. **The formula for an exceptional life is to live with purpose, live by priority, and live for productivity.**

### 1) Live with Purpose

**Your purpose is the one thing you want your life to be about more than any other**.

_A Christmas Carol_ by Charles Dickens illustrates how purpose sets or changes the course of your life. At first, Scrooge’s **purpose** is to have money. His **priority** is amassing as much as he can. With maximum **productivity,** he accomplishes his goal/purpose. By his standards, he’s extraordinarily successful.

However, later in the story after being visited by ghosts, he changes his purpose. This changes his priority and how he focuses his productivity. Scrooge’s new purpose is caring about people; his priority is using his money to help people, while still making as much as possible. He’s productive in accumulating as much money as he can to help others.

When it comes to purpose, happiness is what we want most; it drives most of our actions.

Most people pursue happiness the wrong way. Acquiring money or something else you want can make you happy for the moment, but having things doesn’t guarantee lasting happiness. If you don’t have a big-picture purpose, you can fall into a pattern of always seeking more. After you get what you want your happiness diminishes as you get used to it, so you seek something else.

In reality, lasting happiness comes from becoming engaged in and finding meaning in what you do; your daily actions are driven by a bigger purpose. Happiness occurs in the process of fulfilling your purpose.

#### Find Your Purpose

Following are some tips for discovering your purpose. Remember that you can always change it; the key is to get started. (Shortform note: For more details, download the author’s free worksheet here.)

  1. Write down a handful of activities you’re passionate about—for example, activities involving family, work, community, or a hobby.
  2. List several outcomes you’re passionate about.
  3. Pick one activity and one outcome most important to you.
  4. Combine your activity and outcome to answer the question, “What’s the One Thing I can do that would mean the most to me, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?” 



Post your One Thing where you’ll see it often. Try it for a while, even if you’re not completely satisfied with it. You can always revise it or develop a better one later.

### 2) Choose Your Priority

**Your purpose specifies where you want to go. Your priority is what you do now to get there**.

Because of the way humans are wired, it can be hard to connect the present—what we’re doing now—with the future. According to psychologists, the further away a reward is, the lower our motivation to achieve it. In addition, we have a “present bias,” meaning we prefer present gains over future ones. For instance, if offered a choice of $100 now or $200 in the future, most people would take the $100 rather than waiting.

With this mindset, you can lose sight of achieving potentially extraordinary results. The way to connect your present action or priority to your big goal or purpose is to think in steps, each building on the previous step to reach your final goal/purpose. It’s like lining up your dominoes, so a small action sets off a chain of related actions leading to the result you want.

To see how things connect, ask yourself this series of questions:

  * Based on my **ultimate goal** , what’s the One Thing I can **do in the next five years** to reach it?
  * Based on my **five-year goal** , what’s the One Thing I can **do this year** to be on track to reach my five-year goal, to be on track to reach my ultimate goal?
  * Based on **this year’s goal,** what’s the One Thing I can **do this month** to be on track to reach my goals this year, in five years, and ultimately?
  * Based on **this month’s goal** , what’s the One Thing I can **do this week** to be on track to reach my goals this month, this year, in five years, and ultimately?
  * Based on **this week’s goal** , what’s the One Thing I can **do today** to be on track to reach my goals this week, this month, this year, in five years, and ultimately?
  * Based **on today’s goal,** what’s the One Thing I can **do now** to be on track to reach my goals today, this week, this month, this year, in five years, and ultimately?



Many people don’t reach their goals because they haven’t lined up the dominoes to connect the present to the future. Strategic thinking, or breaking down the process for achieving a big goal into steps, avoids what researchers call the “planning fallacy,” which is overestimating what you can accomplish because you haven’t thought through the process.

Train your mind to drill down from your big goal, like opening a set of Russian nesting dolls one at a time until you know the most important thing to do in the present.

### 3) Optimize Your Productivity

**Once you know your purpose plus your immediate and future priorities for getting there, you need to use your time productively to achieve the results you want**. The key to productivity is scheduling or blocking time on your calendar to focus on your priority and treating that time as sacrosanct.

There are four steps to time blocking:

#### 1) Block Off Your Personal Time

Begin each year by planning your time off. Manage your work time around your downtime—when you reserve time off to recharge and then take it, you’ll be more productive.

#### 2) Time Block Your Priority

**Design your days around your priority by blocking off a minimum of four hours a day to work on it as early in your day as you can.** Each day, take up to an hour to deal with timely matters, then focus on your priority.

Venture capitalist Paul Graham argues that in a typical business, there are two types of time: “maker” time, which focuses on doing or creating, and “manager” time, which focuses on directing or overseeing. Maker time requires large time blocks, usually half-days, while manager time is broken down into hours, usually spent attending meetings. For optimum productivity, be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon.

Comedian Jerry Seinfeld blocked off time every day for writing jokes (developing his craft). When he completed a time block, he crossed it off on his calendar so that the crossed-off days formed a visual chain. His mantra was: “Don’t break the chain” by misusing a time block.

#### 3) Block Planning Time

Near the end of each year, block planning time to assess where you are and what progress you need to make next year toward achieving your purpose. Also, block an hour each week to review your annual, monthly, and weekly goals/priorities.

#### 4) Protect Your Blocked Time

Blocking time is pointless unless you protect your blocked time and use it as designated. By doing so, you protect your priorities and purpose. Treat this time as inviolable.

Three threats to your time block are:

**1)** **An urgent request from your boss or key client to do something**. One way to respond is to say yes but put off actually doing it by asking, for instance, “Would Friday work?” Often the person asking for something will be satisfied if you just commit to getting it done. If you have to do it immediately, also reschedule your time block immediately.

**2)** **The urge to deviate from your time block to deal with other things**. Remind yourself of the domino that will fall when you complete your priority task. To preempt distraction, post a note where you can see it stating: “Until my priority task is done, everything else is a distraction.”

**3)** **Trouble staying focused**. When thoughts cross your mind of things you should do, make a note so you won’t forget them and get back to your priority.

Four ways to fight distractions are:

**1) Find a place to work where you won’t be distracted or interrupted**. If you have an office, close the door and window blinds. Or find a vacant room and close the door.

**2) Have supplies, snacks, and drinks on hand,** so you don’t need to leave your workspace except for bathroom breaks.

**3) Remove distractions** : turn off your phone, shut down your browser and email.

**4) Enlist support** : Tell colleagues what you’re doing and when you’ll be available.
