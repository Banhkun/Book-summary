## Chapter 1: The One Thing

In _The One Thing_ , author and real estate entrepreneur Gary Keller argues that the key to extraordinary success is focusing daily on the “One Thing” that will make the biggest difference in achieving your goal.

Keller, founder of the world’s largest real estate company Keller Williams, acknowledges this is counterintuitive in our multitasking world. But he argues that success comes from doing the right things sequentially, each connected to and building on the previous one, rather than doing a lot of disparate things simultaneously. **Extraordinary focus on One Thing each day is what leads to extraordinary success**.

_The One Thing_ tells you how to apply this simple but transformative principle to your work and in your personal life, where escalating demands and constant distractions work against focusing on anything for long.

**You start by thinking big—imagining extraordinary results—then narrowing your focus until you’re thinking small—focusing on the most important thing you can do at the moment to get you where you ultimately want to go.** Focus on the small One Thing exclusively, and when you complete it, move on to the next One Thing on your way to your goal.

Keller used this approach in his business, when it seemed to be faltering after a successful first decade. He worked with a consultant, who determined that he could get the company back on track if he changed the leadership in 14 positions. So Keller focused on this One Thing: finding the right people. Then, with the people in place, he helped each one focus on the One Thing he or she needed to do to help the company succeed. In its second decade, the company grew rapidly from a regional to an international player.

Keller realized that in his work and life, his greatest successes came when he focused on One Thing, while in instances where he was less successful, he’d been juggling multiple priorities but accomplishing little.

A scene in the 1990s movie _City Slickers_ sums up the One Thing approach. Curly, a crusty cowboy played by Jack Palance, advises city slicker Mitch, played by Billy Crystal: “One thing. Just one thing. You stick to that and everything else don’t mean sh-t.” Mitch asks, “What’s the one thing?” and Curly replies, “That’s what you have to figure out.”

_The One Thing_ , which Keller co-authored with Jay Papasan, is about achieving exceptional success by figuring out and focusing on your One Thing every day.

### Go Small

Everyone has the same number of hours in a day, yet some people accomplish more than others in the same amount of time because they “go small” or narrow their daily focus.

Going small is:

  * Ignoring the vast array of things you _could_ do and focusing on the right things.
  * Recognizing that everything isn’t equally important and finding the things that matter the most.
  * Connecting what you do (your immediate actions) with what you ultimately want, realizing that you get big results by narrowing your daily focus.



Most people think and act in the opposite way. Achieving big goals seems too complicated and time-consuming, so they set modest goals and keep busy with immediate demands. They work from jam-packed calendars and unprioritized to-do lists that keep getting longer. Before long they feel overwhelmed and even modest goals seem unattainable, so they scale back their goals and settle for less.

Doing too many things without subtracting anything means missed deadlines, high stress, long hours, lackluster results, lost sleep, and missed time with family and friends—when success is actually a lot easier to attain than you might think.

Big success comes, not from lowering your expectations, but from doing a few things well—subtracting rather than adding to your daily tasks. **Do fewer things that have more impact and your daily, focused achievements will add up to success**.

**Thinking big but focusing small works in any area of life. It means identifying and doing the One Thing that most advances your purpose.**
