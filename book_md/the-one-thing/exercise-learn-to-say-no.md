## Exercise: Learn to Say No

Focusing on your One Thing is your priority. This means you have to protect your priority by saying no to everything else that impinges on your time block.

* * *

Think about the past few days at work. How much time did you spend responding to others’ requests? What were some of the requests you received?

Do you see any patterns—for instance, what type of request was most frequent or time-consuming? Among your colleagues, who made the most requests?

What are some ways you can deter and/or redirect your colleagues, especially the ones making the most requests, in order to protect your time block?
