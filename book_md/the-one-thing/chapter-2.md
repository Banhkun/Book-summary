## Chapter 2: The Domino Effect

**When you prioritize so you’re focusing on the right thing at the moment, everything after that subsequently falls into place like a progression of dominoes**. Each domino represents a small amount of energy and as your dominoes fall, the energy in the string builds so that your final results are astounding.

In 1983, physicist Lorne Whitehead determined that a single domino can bring down another domino that’s 50% bigger. Another physicist tested and confirmed this in 2001, using eight dominoes of plywood, each 50% larger than the one before. The first was two inches tall and the last one thirty-six inches tall.

**When you attack your goals by starting with the one, right thing, it leads to bigger things—you build energy in a geometric progression** like Whitehead’s progressively larger dominoes. To extend the math in his example:

  * The tenth domino would be nearly as tall as NFL quarterback Payton Manning. 
  * The eighteenth would be comparable to the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
  * The twenty-third would be taller than the Eiffel Tower.
  * The thirty-first would surpass Mount Everest by 3,000 feet.
  * The fifty-seventh would be comparable in height to the distance between earth and moon.



**To achieve success, aim for the moon. Getting there is doable when you create a domino effect in your life.**

### Success is Sequential

Exceptional success, like a domino fall, is sequential, not something you achieve by multitasking or doing a lot of things simultaneously. You line up your priorities and focus on the first domino until you topple it. You begin with a linear process that becomes geometric; you build momentum as you do the first right thing, followed by the next and the next.

A wealthy person doesn’t become wealthy in a day; a champion athlete doesn’t start winning on day one. Money, skills, expertise, and accomplishments are built over time. **Success builds on success, sequentially, as you move from One Thing to another until you reach the highest level possible.**
