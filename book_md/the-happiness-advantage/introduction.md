## Introduction

Most people strive to be happy—and yet, for so many, happiness always seems to be just out of reach, or just around the next corner. Have you told yourself too many times that, once you reach the next benchmark, then you will be happy? This common approach to life is predicated on the idea that happiness comes after success, and that success comes after hard work. But we’ve had the equation all wrong.

_The Happiness Advantage_ , published in 2010, is an introduction to a relatively new formula for success, based on research in positive psychology and neuroscience. Under this paradigm, **not only can you put your happiness first, but you can actually achieve greater success as a result.** Author Shawn Achor offers insight as a leading expert on the connection between happiness and performance. In addition to studying under several pioneers of positive psychology, Achor helped create and teach a popular Harvard course on happiness, he has written multiple books about happiness and success, and he founded a research and consulting firm that optimizes people’s achievement through positive psychology.

### Why Study Happiness?

The field of psychology has historically been uninterested in studying happiness. Instead, it’s focused on _unhappiness_ and mental health challenges, in an effort to help people with below-average happiness ascend to average happiness levels. While that is an important goal, it strives to reach average, instead of seeking above-average happiness. The relatively new field of positive psychology inverts the lens: **Instead of focusing on why unhappy people are suffering, positive psychology asks why happy people are thriving.**

Positive psychology suggests that happiness isn’t the _result_ of success—it’s the _cause_ of it. Research supports this:

  * Doctors who are primed to be in a positive mood diagnose patients 19% faster than their neutrally primed peers. Priming is a process in which a person is exposed to a suggestion or idea that influences her thoughts and behaviors. (Shortform note: Many experts question the validity of priming because follow-up studies have failed to replicate results that confirm its effects.)
  * Optimistic salespeople outsell their pessimistic coworkers by 56 percent.
  * Students primed for happiness outperform their peers on math achievement tests.



If it’s true that happiness begets success, how can you become happier? Using research and personal anecdotes, Achor covers the following seven principles in this book:

  1. **Reap the benefits of happiness** : Happiness promotes productivity and success, and employers and managers can use these principles to achieve results in the workplace. 
  2. **Leverage the power of a positive mindset** : Your mindset affects your efforts and your actions.
  3. **Train your brain to see the positive** : When you develop a positive thinking pattern, you program your brain to focus on the positive and optimize the benefits of positivity. 
  4. **Learn and grow through adversity** : Adversity is inevitable, but, if you stay positive during challenging times, you will not only carry on, but also learn and grow through the process. 
  5. **Stay in control through incremental achievements** : Focus on small, manageable goals to keep you in control and build your confidence and motivation.
  6. **Create positive habits** : Maintain healthy behaviors by turning them into habits.
  7. **Optimize the benefits of social connections** : Social support raises your happiness and productivity.



Thousands of people have used these seven principles to become happier, and you can too.

### Anyone Can Change Their Thinking

If happiness correlates with success, what does that mean for people who simply are not wired to be happy? It turns out, anyone can change their thinking and behavior with some practice, despite the fact that people tend to overestimate the extent to which biology is fixed. Indeed, for most of the 20th century, the scientific community broadly believed that human brains only grow from birth through adolescence, after which the brain’s capacity is fixed. But over time, new studies started to challenge that assumption.

During the last several decades, scientists have discovered a concept called neuroplasticity, which means that **your brain continues to grow and change throughout life.** One experiment revealed that the brains of London cab drivers actually grew in a way that reflected their special skill sets. London’s streets are difficult to navigate because they’re not based on a grid system, as other big cities are, so cab drivers develop an intricate mental map of the city. Researchers discovered that the part of the brain in charge of this mental map—the hippocampus, which manages spatial memory—was significantly larger among cabbies than average people.

In another experiment, a man who had become blind as a teenager developed greater sensitivity and sophistication in his braille-reading finger than the average person would have in her index finger. As evidence of this, when scientists probed his braille-reading finger, it activated a much larger area of the brain than when they did the same on another finger.

### The Happiness Advantage Has Proven Results

As we’ll discuss further in upcoming sections, the Happiness Advantage really encompasses _many_ advantages, including:

  * Improved creativity 
  * Stronger relationships 
  * Better health
  * Increased energy



**These benefits raise the quality of your personal life, and they also optimize your success at work.** Studies show that positive psychology can help managers increase customer satisfaction by 42 percent and CEOs increase their productivity by 15 percent. Even in the most stressful environments, the principles of the Happiness Advantage have brought positive results to a wide range of businesses across 40 countries and five continents, including:

  * A business community operating in Zimbabwe’s collapsed economy 
  * Big bank employees in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis
  * Law schools and law firms, where students and employees suffer from high rates of depression and mental distress 
  * Hundreds of managers at a tax auditing firm during the first tax season following the 2008 stock market drop



The managers at the tax auditing firm felt less stressed and more satisfied with life after three hours of positive psychology training than managers who had not attended the training. Furthermore, those higher scores held up four months later, at the height of tax season.

The human brain has the capacity to adapt and grow to an extent that is still unknown. The seven principles will help you to make the most of this potential and enjoy the vast benefits of the Happiness Advantage. However, **this requires more than a positive attitude—it calls for you to take actions to change your thinking and behavior.** Rather than donning rose-colored glasses and ignoring your problems, these principles empower you to:

  * Conquer your challenges.
  * Be more productive and efficient.
  * Capitalize on opportunities.
  * Break bad habits.
  * Achieve lofty goals.
