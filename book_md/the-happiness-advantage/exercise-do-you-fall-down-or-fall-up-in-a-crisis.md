## Exercise: Do You Fall Down or Fall Up in a Crisis?

Reflect on your typical reaction when facing adversity, and practice falling up.

* * *

Describe a challenge youâ€™ve recently dealt with or are currently confronting (such as tensions with your boss or financial issues at home).

How could you frame this challenge with a positive explanatory style, in which you view the problem as local and temporary (instead of widespread and permanent)?

Consider the three paths you could follow in how you react to this obstacle. What would the First Path look like (in which you circle the problem and ultimately create no change)?

What would the Second Path look like (in which you create more negative consequences and put yourself in a worse position)?

What would the Third Path look like (in which you learn and grow from the situation, so that you end up in a better position)?
