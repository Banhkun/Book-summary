## Principle #2: Leverage the Power of a Positive Mindset

We’ve discussed the benefits of positivity and some strategies to raise your happiness, but sometimes the biggest obstacles are your own persistent, negative thoughts. Think of your mind as a seesaw. If a light person sits on one end and a heavy person sits on the other, the heavy person will be on the ground while the light person will be suspended in the air. However, if you place the fulcrum (the center point on which the lever balances) closer to the heavy person, that person will be easier to lift. When it comes to being happier, if your mind is entrenched in negative thought, it’s like moving the fulcrum _away_ from the heavy object—it becomes very difficult to lift. On the other hand, **if you focus on more positive thoughts, you leverage the power of your fulcrum by moving it _closer_ to the heavy object, and your power for positivity is unbounded.**

In this chapter, we’ll discuss how your mindset affects your efforts and your actions, and how to leverage this power to achieve success.

### Perception Is Powerful

If you’ve ever distracted an upset child with a joke, you know that you can’t be sad and happy at the same time. Your brain has a limited capacity to process the many aspects of your experiences and surroundings, so it filters your awareness through a positive or negative lens. This choice dictates your perception of the world, and perception defines your reality. In other words, **your mindset determines your reality—mentally and physically.**

In one experiment, a group of 75-year-old men spent a week at a retreat, where they were asked to act as they did when they were 55. Additionally, they were surrounded by newspapers, food, decor, and other environmental elements from the year when they were 55. Both before and after the retreat, each individual was tested on physical strength, cognition, short-term memory, and other metrics of health—and, by the end of the week, they had all improved in almost every category, including an almost 10% improvement in eyesight and memory. Just a week of living as if they were 55 again made their physical condition resemble that of a younger man.

The power of perception is also responsible for the Placebo Effect, in which a sugar pill alleviates a patient’s symptoms just as well as an actual drug. One striking experiment illustrates this by using an allergen instead of a drug: Thirteen students who were highly allergic to poison ivy were told the plant was being rubbed on their left arms—however, although researchers were actually using a harmless shrub, every participant reacted with redness, itching, and boils. Furthermore, the students were told that their right arms were being rubbed with a harmless plant, when it was really poison ivy. Despite the students’ allergies, only two had any reaction whatsoever.

The power of your mindset to impact reality is also at play in Expectancy Theory. This theory explains that **your expectation of an event can create brain patterns and reactions that are as real as the actual event.** For example, in one study, researchers told half of the cleaning staffs at seven different hotels that housecleaning constituted significant cardiovascular exercise and burned calories, while the other half received no such information. Several weeks later, the first group had lost weight and lowered their cholesterol level, while the second group had no such results. Both groups had performed the same work, but the workers who expected that their jobs would contribute to better health outcomes were actually able to manifest the results they had expected.

### Adjust Your Mindset to Optimize Your Performance

If it’s true that your mental approach to an experience actually impacts the outcome, how can you use that to your benefit? First, **alter your perspective of tedious, daily tasks to increase your engagement and motivation.** If you’re dreading a meeting that you perceive as a waste of time, find something you can gain from the experience: Maybe it’s an opportunity to observe your manager’s leadership style or to practice your active listening skills. Similarly, when you prepare for a task that makes you feel nervous or inept, prime yourself beforehand to focus on your strengths or recall other times when you performed well.

This mindset shift affects not only your work productivity, but also your leisure time. **When you consider spending time with family or doing a crossword puzzle as valuable opportunities to unwind and recharge, you will more readily reap the rewards of those breaks.** By contrast, when you perceive such activities as distractions and inefficiencies, you’re more likely to squander the benefits and fail to feel refueled afterward.

Since your expectations affect your experiences, let’s examine three ways in which you can improve your mindset to raise your performance.

#### Step 1: Be**lieve in** Y**our** A**bility**

Research shows that an employee’s confidence in her own ability to perform her job well is a better predictor of her actual job performance than her training or skill level. Be confident in your skills and talents—within reason. **Don’t overlook your weaknesses or overcommit to things you can’t accomplish, but do focus on your strengths as you approach the tasks in front of you.** You can only accomplish something if you first have the audacity to dream it and the confidence to try it.

(Shortform note: To read more about the power of mindset and the importance of dreaming big, check out our summary of As A Man Thinketh.)

#### Step 2: B**elieve in Your Ability to Improve**

**Whether you _think_ you can improve your skills and knowledge is a major determinant of whether you _actually_ improve. **Psychologist Carol Dweck proposes that people have one of two mindsets about their intelligence and abilities:

  1. People with a “fixed mindset” believe that their skills and capabilities are immutable, which leads to underperformance. 
  2. People with a “growth mindset” understand that exerting effort will lead to improvement, which leads to greater motivation, more effort, and, ultimately, better results.



In one of Dweck’s experiments, she and her colleagues determined the mindsets of 373 7th-grade students and then tracked their academic performances over the following two years. Students who had exhibited a growth mindset steadily raised their GPAs, whereas the students with a fixed mindset stagnated. (Shortform note: To learn more about the benefits of having a growth mindset and how to develop one, read our summary of Carol Dweck’s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success _._)

#### Step 3: R**eframe How You Think About Work**

Since your mindset dictates your experience, it can have a significant impact on your professional success. Scientists have defined three ways that people approach work:

  1. **Work is a job.** It is a necessary component of life and is externally rewarded by a paycheck.
  2. **Work is a career.** It represents an ongoing process of working to advance to new levels of achievement.
  3. **Work is a calling.** It is innately valuable and brings rewards such as meaning and purpose to life.



These distinct attitudes towards work cut across professions: A doctor can view her work as a job and a janitor can approach her work as a calling. The job itself does not define the experience—the perspective brought to it does. Try these strategies to reframe your view of work:

  * **Identify your personal life goals, and find ways in which your work helps you work toward those goals.** For example, if you’re a law professor and value being a mentor to your students, you can reframe the administrative work that you despise as a way to provide your students with valuable resources that will benefit their careers. 
  * **Focus on the ways that you bring value to your work** , and identify the unique skills you contribute.
  * **Recognize the inherent value of your work** , and the ways in which it positively impacts your customers, coworkers, and society. Draw a line down the center of a piece of paper and, on the left side, write down your job duties that feel meaningless. Then, for each one, draw an arrow to the right side of the page and write the purpose of that task. If that purpose still feels meaningless, draw another arrow and write the effect of that result. Continue this process until you reach a meaningful purpose for each task. 



### Your Mindset Affects _Other People’s_ Performance

Not only can your mindset impact your own outcome, but it can also contribute to the outcomes of others. This phenomenon is captured in what scientists have deemed “the Pygmalion Effect,” which reveals that **believing in someone else’s potential can actually help manifest that success.**

In one study, researchers tested elementary school students and then told their teachers that three of the students had demonstrated extraordinary potential. Despite the fact that researchers told the teachers to treat those three students exactly the same as the rest of the students, the three students’ test scores skyrocketed by the end of the year. The twist, however, was that those students’ original scores had been average; the experimenters had deliberately misrepresented their abilities to the teachers. Although the teachers had not consciously given the students any special attention or encouragement, **the teachers had unknowingly and nonverbally communicated their heightened expectations—and the three students had picked up on their teachers’ subtle messages and risen to their expectations.**

This phenomenon can also be seen in workspaces: Research shows that if a manager believes employees are only motivated by money, the workers will behave accordingly—but if the manager believes the workers are internally motivated, the workers’ outcomes will improve. **When you understand the power of the Pygmalion Effect, you can look at every interaction with colleagues and employees as an opportunity to recognize their skills, encourage them, and promote positivity.** Because of the power of a leader’s perspective on her team’s success, leaders should ask themselves three questions at the start of each week:

  1. Do I believe that my employees can improve their knowledge and skills?
  2. Do I believe that they are inclined to make the effort to improve and to find meaning in their work?
  3. How am I communicating my confidence to my employees?
