## Exercise: Reflect on Game Development

You’ve now had a rare look into some of the challenges that developers face while creating new games. Reflect on what you’ve learned about the gaming industry and how much work went into making the video games available today.

* * *

What, if anything, did you know about the game development process before reading this guide?

What surprised you the most about Schreier’s accounts of video game development? (For example, perhaps you hadn’t considered how rapidly-changing technology would impact the industry or didn’t realize how much overtime developers commonly put in while making a new game.)

Based on what you’ve read here, would you be interested in becoming a game developer? Why or why not?

Would you be willing to pay more or wait longer for games if it meant developers could experience better working conditions and work-life balance? Why or why not?
