## Week 2—Purpose #1: Worship

The second week of your journey brings you to your first purpose— _worship_ , or bringing pleasure to God.**** Like most people, you probably think that worship is going to church, praying, singing, and so on. While these are _acts_ of worship, that’s not all that worship is. **Worship is a _lifestyle_ that centers on making God happy. **It shouldn’t happen only when you’re in church or praying—the Bible instructs us to worship God _continually_.

Before discussing how to make worship a continual facet of your life, it’s important to understand what separates _true_ worship from _false_ worship.

**The Elements of True Worship**

**Worship doesn’t depend on who you’re with, what time it is, or where you are—it depends on your engagement with the words you’re saying and your intention to bring pleasure to God.** If you’re just going through worship rituals because you feel you “should” or because it’s “tradition,” your worship won’t please God. True, pleasing worship has four elements:

#### 1) Accuracy

Be sure you’re not worshipping an image of God that you came up with in your mind. In that case, you’re worshipping your own imagination or opinion. Instead, worship whom you _know God to be_ by the truths outlined in Scripture.

  * For example, “I think of God as someone who’d be understanding about _some_ sins,” is false worship. On the other hand, “I worship God, who is just,” is true worship. 



#### 2) Authenticity

You must mean what you say and do—worship that’s not genuine isn’t worship, just words. The best way to worship with genuine emotion is to find a method of worship that shows your love for God _in a way that feels good to you_ and _reflects the personality he gave you._

  * For example, the Bible names confession, song, dance, kneeling, playing instruments, raised hands, and shouting among many ways to express praise. 



It’s okay if your method of worship isn’t traditional or even mentioned in the Bible—God doesn’t care about tradition. Often, traditional worship doesn’t make people feel good, but it’s what they think they _should_ be doing. This results in emotionless, insincere worship. God wants to see passion and authenticity behind your worship, and it doesn’t matter how you make that happen.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of The Power of Positive Thinking to explore different forms of prayer and find the type that best suits you.)

#### 3) Thoughtfulness

Be sure you are engaging your mind in a meaningful way while you worship. Automatic repetition of verses and phrases will eventually void the words of their meaning, but you can avoid this by looking for new and interesting ways to praise God. There are a few ways you might accomplish this:

  * Try reading different translations of the Bible, or make a list of synonyms for words that you feel you might be overusing. 
  * Be _specific_ with your praises—tell God very specifically what you’re thanking him for, instead of generalizing. For example, instead of saying “I praise you for your gifts,” you might say, “I thank you for the beautiful sunshine that woke me up this morning, for my husband’s love in making my coffee, and for the insights my call with Jim gave me.” 
  * Consider how an unbeliever would perceive your worship. Would they understand the meaning of your prayers and words like _hallelujah_ or _amen_? Try rephrasing your prayers in such a way that _anyone_ could understand them. This has the added benefit of training you to help unbelievers feel welcome. 



#### 4) Presence

As long as you’re living in your mortal body on earth, your spirit and body can only be in one place at once.

  * This means deciding not to show up for worship opportunities, but saying, “I’m there in spirit!” doesn’t count. 



God wants you to worship him using your _body_ —that is, showing up physically for worship instead of using an easy cop-out to cater to your own interests or schedule. Your presence is a sacrifice of sorts because it forces you to give up two things:

  * Self-centeredness: Instead of focusing on yourself and your wants, you focus on God and _his_ wants. 
  * Energy: You commit to the effort of worshipping with your _whole_ self, even if you don’t feel fully motivated to do so, or if it doesn’t fit conveniently into your schedule.



### Five Acts of Continual Worship

There are five acts of worship that—when practiced with accuracy, authenticity, thoughtfulness, and practicality—make God happy.

#### Act #1: Love Him Absolutely

**God’s greatest desire is for you to love him in the same way that he loves you.** Imagine your relationship with your closest and most loyal friend. You probably stay in regular contact with this friend, know everything about her, trust her completely, and allow her to know everything about you.

God wants this type of close friendship with you, and nothing would bring him more happiness than your efforts to know and love everything about him—in this sense, your friendship is a form of worship. There are six ways you can establish and maintain your friendship with God.

##### 1) Have Ongoing Conversations

It’s essential to stay in regular contact with God—only speaking to him once a week at church isn’t enough to create a _close_ friendship.

Like many people, you’re probably in close contact with your best friend, texting her daily with updates on things happening in your life, thoughts you have, or questions about her day. **Your communication with God should be a similar stream of consciousness.**

  * Include God in everything you do, every thought that crosses your mind, and every conversation you have—think of your conversations with him less as prayers and more as ongoing texts.



You don’t need to be alone to spend time with God or talk to him—he’s with you everywhere, as long as you keep his presence in your mind and invite him to be part of whatever you’re doing, whether it be grocery shopping, driving to work, or meeting with a client.

  * If you have trouble remembering to feel his presence and keep an ongoing conversation, you can try writing reminders on sticky notes and putting them in high-visibility places, or set an alarm on your phone to ping you every hour with a reminder. 



##### 2) Meditate on His Word

Part of truly _knowing_ God is knowing what he thinks and feels—and there’s no better place to find this information than his Word. You can’t read the Bible all day in the same way you can talk to God all day. You can, however, think about Scripture.

  * Every week or so, select a few verses that you’d like to meditate on over the week. At regular intervals when you have a moment to think, just repeat these verses in your mind. 



**When you turn over verses in your mind repeatedly, you often find truths and lessons in them that you hadn’t noticed before—in this way, God is able to speak to _you_. **He shares his secrets and his knowledge, allowing you to understand him fully as a friend would.

##### 3) Voice Your Displeasure and Doubt

Honesty is one of the foundational elements of any solid friendship, so it’s not surprising that God desires your _total_ honesty. **This means that he’ll not only tolerate you voicing displeasure with him, but he’ll also encourage it and listen to it.**

  * Even in the Bible, those who were closest to God regularly spoke to him in anger—they argued with him, doubted him, accused him, and shouted at him. 



God doesn’t mind it when you express your anger, because it’s the first step to becoming closer to him. When you’re angry with God, it’s usually because you don’t understand that _everything_ he does is in your best interest. Eventually, you’ll understand the reason for your suffering, but for now, it’s just important to get it off your chest. By doing so, you put your emotions out in the open where they can cool off, instead of bottling them up and letting resentment simmer. It’s impossible to become best friends with God if you resent him.

  * If you need help articulating your displeasure, you can turn to the book of Psalms, which God gave us as “guidelines” for expressing emotion—while plenty of them are full of praise, many are full of complaints, fears, and doubts.



##### 4) Act With Faith

If your best friend tells you to do something you don’t understand or are afraid of, you’d probably question her. Here, your friendship with God differs—**when God tells you to act, you’re expected to obey him in total trust and faith.** This is a signal of intimacy because it proves that you love God, trust him, and _want_ to do as he says as a demonstration of your gratitude.

  * God’s requests can take many forms. He may ask you to share what you have, offer forgiveness to someone who’s hurt you, or reach out to someone who may reject you. 



##### 5) Share His Values

You care about what’s important to your best friend, and vice versa. When you become friends with God, the same thing will happen—you’ll value the same things he does.

  * What God cares about most is that all of his children accept him and love him. The closer you become to God, the more you’ll start to care about the faith and salvation of those around you as he does. 



##### 6) Desire His Friendship Above All

You didn’t become close to your best friend by accident—both of you put in the effort to meet up regularly, return one another’s phone calls, listen to one another, and open up to one another. **It’s crucial to make the same sort of effort with God if you want to become his friend.** If you don’t actively choose to deepen your relationship with him, you’ll never be close.

  * Check in regularly and ask yourself: Have I worked on becoming closer to God this week? Have I let other things get in the way of our friendship? How can I be a better friend to God next week?



#### Act #2 and Act #3: Trust and Obey Him Completely

**God wants you to trust and obey him, even when what he asks of you doesn’t make perfect sense.** This can be difficult—you likely often think that you know what’s best for you. God has known you since before your birth and deserves your faith that he knows best. You make him happiest when you completely trust that he’ll keep his promises to you, watch over you, and help you.

**Two factors determine whether your trust and obedience are _complete_ :**

  1. You do _exactly_ what’s asked of you. You don’t half listen to God, inserting your own, “better” way of doing things as you see fit. You don’t neglect any part of God’s instruction, and you do it precisely in the manner he wants. 
  2. You trust and obey _without hesitation._ You don’t hem and haw, question God, or deliberate about what to do—these actions are thinly veiled disobedience and mistrust. You act first and then reflect. Often, you’ll find that there was no way to understand God’s instructions until you did as he asked.



The story of Noah’s ark is an example of complete trust and obedience. Noah never questioned why God would have him build an ark, and was careful to follow God’s instructions for the construction and gathering of animals to the letter. It was only after the flood arrived that Noah was finally able to see the reasons for God’s demand.

##### Surrender: The Foundation of Trust and Obedience

**The process of “letting go” and giving yourself over to God with complete trust is called _surrender_. **In a state of surrender, you give your _entire life_ —your fears, ambitions, guilt, dreams, and so on—to God and fully devote yourself to serving him.

Many people worship God in a half-committed way because they haven’t surrendered themselves to him yet. There are three common reasons people avoid surrendering:

**1) Fear:** You might find it hard to surrender to God completely if you don’t understand how much he loves you or that he wants the best for you. God won’t use your surrender _against_ you in any way—it’s not a way for him to control you. He’ll only use it to push your life in the right direction.

**2) Pride:** Like many people, you likely want to be in control of everything in your life. Surrender conflicts with your pride because it feels like the destruction of control. It’s __ essential to realize that _you’re not a god._ Accept your limitations and surrender to God, who truly knows the best direction for you.

**3) Confusion:** If you’re confused about what surrendering means, you might develop a negative idea of what it is.

  * It’s _not_ giving up, or being resigned to the “way things are.” Rather, it often means breaking the status quo of your life in order to do the important work that needs to be done. 
  * It’s _not_ a way to give up your rational thinking and become a mindless zombie. God gave you a rational mind on purpose—he doesn’t want to take that from you. 
  * It’s _not_ a destruction of your individualism. God uses your unique thoughts and worldview to help others in meaningful ways.



**Surrender, at its base, is just _complete obedience and trust._** You serve God completely and willingly without question because you trust that he knows best.

#### Act #4: Thank Him Regularly

God has given you so much, and it’s only right to regularly express your gratitude. Remember that authenticity and accuracy are most pleasing—thank God for who _he is_ and thank him for specific gifts or opportunities he’s granted you.

  * For example, you might express gratitude for specific miracles described in the Bible, or start your morning by telling him a list of the small joys of your life you’re grateful for. 



This act of worship has the added benefit of making _you_ feel good, too. It always feels wonderful to give someone genuine praise and know you’ve made them happy. Every time you express gratitude to God, you allow yourself to feel that joy.

#### Act #5: Use Your Abilities Earnestly

Using your abilities is a practical, joyful, and constant way to worship. Every time God sees his creations doing what he designed them to do, he feels pleasure.

This type of worship doesn’t have any constraints— _everything_ you do can be an act of worship, as long as you’re doing it with an attitude of praise.

  * For example, going for a jog can be an act of worship if you remind yourself, “I’m grateful that God gave me the ability to use my body in this way.” Your job becomes an act of worship when you think, “I thank God for giving me the opportunity to use my mind and my skills in this way.”



### How to Worship When You Feel Alone

When you experience difficult circumstances, you may feel that God has abandoned or forgotten you in some way—bringing him pleasure will likely be the last thing on your mind.**However, it’s vital to continue your worship in these hard moments because this is when God is testing your character most.**

Worship becomes easier in confusing or frightening times if you can find ways to stay connected to God, even if his presence isn’t evident to you. There are four ways to remind yourself of God’s presence and his goodness.

**1) Express your feelings.** Don’t be afraid to tell God exactly how you feel about the test he’s given you—all negativity and anger included. Rather than seeing this as an insult, God will see this as an affirmation of your faith, in three ways:

  * Addressing God proves that you believe in him.
  * Speaking to God affirms that you believe he’ll listen to what you have to say. 
  * Being honest with God demonstrates that you have faith that he’ll let you say what you want and love you no matter what. 



**2) Remember that God is unchanging.** Continually remind yourself of truths about God—he’s good, he loves you, and he knows what’s best for you. Recall that God _wants_ you to pass your tests and won’t give you a challenge he doesn’t think you can overcome. He gave you this particular test because he _knows_ you’ll succeed.

**3) Have faith in God’s promises.** God promises that he’ll never leave you—no matter how you _feel_ , the reality is that God isn’t breaking his promise to you. Holding on to your knowledge and faith in this promise is a profound act of worship.

**4) Reflect on God’s sacrifices for you.** No matter what grueling tests God puts in your way, he deserves your praise and gratitude because of the sacrifices he’s had to make for _you_. He had to let his only son die so that humans like you would be saved.
