## Week 1—Introduction: The Meaning of Your Life

At some point in your life, you’ve likely asked yourself the same questions that people have been asking themselves for centuries: “Why am I here?” “What’s the meaning of life?” “What’s my purpose?” **From a Christian perspective, the answer is at once simple and complex: God put you here to fulfill the purposes he’s planned for you.**

### Where to Find Your Purpose

There are two routes you can take toward figuring out your purposes.

#### Route #1: Guessing

People have taken this route for centuries, musing about the meaning of life, questioning their origins, and wondering what they should do with their time on earth.

You’ve probably taken this route, too. You look _inward_ for answers about your purpose, asking yourself questions like:

  * “Why am I here?”
  * “What should I do with my life?” 
  * “Am I going to make an impact on the world?”



You’ve likely come up with a few ideas about what life is all about, such as personal fulfillment, seeking happiness or truth, career ambitions, or family. As a Christian, you assume that God is meant to help you fulfill these personal purposes. This inward-looking route will never provide you with clear answers—all you can do is speculate.

#### Route #2: Revelation

On the other hand, looking _outward_ to the Bible leads you to definitive answers about the meaning of your life. God has already explained the meaning of our lives—studying his Word _reveals_ why we’re here, how life should work, and what’s waiting for us in the future and eternity.

  * You might think of it this way: You’re an invention created by God. It doesn’t make sense to ask yourself or other inventions about your function because they won’t know. **Only the inventor and his instruction manual can explain your function.**



(Shortform note: Pastor Rick Warren wrote _The Purpose Driven Life_ as a 42-day Bible study journey to help you find your purposes and learn how to fulfill them. In this summary, we’ve grouped the elements of the journey into six weekly themes to add clarity and eliminate repetition.)

Of course, you first need to _accept_ God’s purposes for your life before you can _fulfill_ them. In this first week of your journey, we’ll explore six reasons that explain why you should accept and live for God’s purposes:

  1. It’s not about you. 
  2. You’re here for a reason. 
  3. Being driven by purpose creates peace. 
  4. There is a life beyond this. 
  5. Life is a test and a responsibility. 
  6. Everything is by and for God. 



Revisit these reasons for a regular reminder of the larger meaning of your life, what’s to be gained by serving God, and bolster your dedication to your purposes.

### Reason #1: It’s Not About You

**The Bible reveals that your life’s meaning isn’t actually about _you_. **Everything in your life comes back to God—your origins, your significance, your identity, and your purpose. Your life isn’t about fulfilling _your_ purposes. It’s about fulfilling God’s.

As God’s Word, this is an eternal truth. _This_ is what your life should be built on, not speculation about what you or others think the truth _might_ be.

  * For example, many people (and self-help books) make the mistake of thinking that “success” is the true meaning of life, but being successful and fulfilling your purpose aren’t the same thing. By following an assumed truth rather than eternal truths, you may be missing out on the greater purpose of your time on earth. 



You won’t find your identity and meaning by guessing at the truth. **It’s only by following God and accepting his purposes for your life that you’ll find your life’s _true_ meaning. **

### Reason #2: You’re Here for a Reason

You didn’t randomly come into existence—God imagined and created you long before you were born. There’s a reason behind _every single aspect_ of you and your life, such as:

  * Your race, physical features, talents, and personality
  * Where you were born and where you’ve lived
  * When you were born, and when you’ll die
  * The role of your parents in your life, and the quality of their parenting



#### Give Thanks by Accepting Your Purposes

**Your existence is an extraordinary _gift._** As the essence of love and a part of the Trinity’s perfect companionship, God doesn’t necessarily need company.**** He created you purely out of a desire to express his love.**** And he didn’t stop there—God loves us and values us above all other creations. To show this, he created a perfect home for us.

  * Biologists and scientists have repeatedly discovered ways that earth is suited _exactly_ to human needs. Some scientists claim that the only explanation for this is that the cosmos was specifically designed to support human life. 



It’s impossible not to feel overwhelmed with gratitude for all of the work and love that God’s put into your life. **You’ll never be able to repay him for what he’s done for you, but you can express your gratitude by putting God and his purposes at the center of your life.**

### Reason #3: Being Driven by Purpose Creates Peace

Everyone has different motivations driving their lives—these motivations can be _external_ factors like problems or pressure, _emotional_ factors like anxiety or fear, or _moral_ factors like values and beliefs. **When you’re driven by the wrong motivators, you can’t experience peace in your life.** Unfortunately, many people are driven by five common “wrong” motivators:

  1. **Guilt:** When you’re motivated by guilt, you’re controlled by your past and often sabotage your success without realizing it. Your life centers on running away from feelings of shame or regret. 
  2. **Resentment:** When you’re motivated by resentment, you hold onto wrongdoings and let them continue to hurt you, instead of forgiving and letting go. This will cause you to either withdraw and internalize anger, or lash out and spread anger—both actions that damage your relationships. 
  3. **Fear:** When you’re motivated by fear—which can come from anxiety, trauma, perfectionism, controlling parents, and so on—you spend your life sticking to the status quo and avoiding any possibility of failure. This holds you back significantly because it’s in trying new things or failing that you experience growth and overcome your fears. 
  4. **Materialism:** When you’re motivated by materialism, you put wealth and material possessions at the center of your life, often with the belief that they’ll make you happier, more important, and more secure. However, wealth won’t make you feel happier or more important—only a solid, positive perception of your self-worth can do that. Furthermore, wealth is _never_ secure. For any number of reasons, you can easily lose all of your wealth instantly.
  5. **The need for approval:** When you’re motivated by a need for approval, you worry what others might think about you and your choices, and you believe that doing what others want will prevent criticism and judgment. In this way, you let _others_ —such as friends, your parents, or your spouse—direct your life. 



#### Five Gains of a Purpose Driven Life

These negative and frustrating motivators fade away when you replace them with the _one_ motivator of fulfilling God’s purposes. A purpose driven life gives you meaning, simplifies your life, focuses your energy, motivates you, and prepares you for eternity.

##### 1\. God’s Purpose Creates Hope

_Hope_ is faith and confidence in the direction your life is going. It lends you the power you need to overcome any difficulties that life throws at you. On the other hand, if your life _doesn’t_ have hope, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and feel that tough moments are insurmountable.

  * Dr. Bernie Siegel studied the effect of hope in his cancer patients. He would ask them if they wanted to live to be 100 years old—those with a strong sense of meaning in their lives usually gave a definitive yes. He discovered that these patients were more likely to go into remission than the less hopeful patients were. 



**Making the fulfillment of God’s purposes your central motivation instills a sense of direction and hope in your life.** It requires you to make changes, separate from the status quo, and take on challenges—as you face your fears and push through these challenges, you’ll strengthen your ability to overcome tough moments and increase your confidence in your life’s direction.

##### 2\. God’s Purpose Simplifies

If your life isn’t driven by purpose, your decision-making is usually dictated by your circumstances or mood. This makes you tired and stressed—you’re constantly changing direction, trying to keep up with others, or attempting to balance what you want to do and what others want you to do.

  * For example, if you’re driven by approval, you might make decisions that are most agreeable to whomever you happen to be with to reduce the anxiety of conflict. You’ll inevitably have to keep changing your decisions every time you interact with someone who disagrees with you.



On the other hand, dedicating yourself to fulfilling God’s purposes grants you peace because it’s the only thing you _have_ to do. **This creates a clear benchmark by which to measure what is and isn’t worth your energy.** Each time you find that you’re unable to find the time or energy to work on God’s purposes, you know you’re becoming over-involved in wasteful, meaningless activities.

  * When this happens, take stock of everything that takes up space in your life. For each activity, ask yourself: “Does this help me with fulfilling God’s purposes or pull me away?” 



##### 3\. God’s Purpose Focuses

Many people live lives of constant movement, not only trying to _do_ everything but also _be good at_ everything. Trying to master everything in a jam-packed life will cause you to feel frazzled and confused.

  * Like many others, you might try changing external factors such as your job, relationship, or city in a futile effort to feel “right.” 



**The problem doesn’t lie in these external factors—it lies in your focus.** When your focus is divided across too many pursuits, you won’t feel that you have a true impact in any one of them. As a result, your life’s activity just feels like busywork that’s not particularly interesting, productive, or important. **When you clarify the _truly important_ pursuits in your life, your energy becomes focused and precise. **Instead of spreading thin, ineffective energy across many activities, you put _all_ your energy toward the activity you were created to do. Your actions become deliberate and effective, making your work productive and impactful.

##### 4\. God’s Purpose Motivates

When you lack purpose, it’s hard to feel passionate about any aspect of your life or your work—it all seems meaningless. Without a reason for all your effort, you quickly become tired, depressed, and hopeless.

**On the other hand, having a clear purpose—knowing precisely what you’re working for and what your goal is—is _energizing_.** It adds reason and meaning to your work, making it feel like a joyful and productive activity.

##### 5\. God’s Purpose Prepares

Many people are driven by the impression they want to leave on the world, both before and after they die. However, it doesn’t matter what people in this life think of you—your accomplishments and others’ memories of you will fade over time.

**Only your eternal life and the impression you make on God matter.** This life is a preparation for eternity, where God will judge your character by asking two questions:

  1. “Did you allow Jesus into your life?” That is, did you accept and live by the teachings of Jesus? Did you love him and put your faith in him? 
  2. “How did you use the gifts I gave you?” That is, did you use your gifts—your talents, opportunities, relationships, and so on—for _selfish purposes_ , or did you use them _for God’s purpose_?



If you focus your life on the fulfillment of God’s purposes, you’ll pass his judgment and spend eternity with him.

### Reason #4: There Is Life Beyond This

Earth isn’t your forever home—you’re just a tourist passing through. However, many Christians seem to believe that their true homes and their true lives are here on earth. **It’s crucial that you remember that the true “you” is in eternity, where you originated and where you’ll one day return.** There’s no _exact_ report of what’s waiting for you in eternity or what it will look like—it’s far beyond what the human imagination can understand. However, you can turn to the Bible to learn about the splendors of God’s kingdom and how you might expect to be rewarded for your faithfulness:

  * You’ll see your lost loved ones again. 
  * You’ll be free of any pain or suffering you might have experienced on earth. 
  * You'll be given work that you truly enjoy performing for eternity.



#### Why It’s Important to Think More About Death

Many people fear death or think of it as something strange or unjust. You may think this is because of a desire for immortality—a desire for your life on earth to last forever. **It’s actually because God designed us to have an eternal afterlife. This inherent knowledge of eternal living gives us a feeling that death is somehow “unfair” or “unnatural.”**

But, knowledge of eternal living should mean that death _isn’t_ too frightening or morbid to think about. **In fact, you should be thinking about death and eternity _more_ —it can significantly reduce the stress in your life. **

##### How Thoughts of Eternity Reduce Stress

Purpose driven living erases the frightening aspect of death—fulfilling God’s purposes for you ensures that you’ll receive the promise of eternal life. **You have nothing to worry about or feel uncertain about because you already know what’s next.**

Getting comfortable with the thought of eternity and frequently reflecting on it touches every aspect of your life in a positive way.

  * It reveals how unimportant small, everyday issues really are. You can move on from them quickly and focus on more eternal goals and issues. 
  * Thinking about what does and doesn’t matter in eternity helps you determine how to react to different challenges and situations. 
  * You realize that harm or suffering that may happen, though it may be scary or painful, _is only temporary._
  * You spend your money and your time in more fulfilling, prudent ways instead of wasting it on temporary or sinful pleasures. 
  * You prioritize what’s _truly_ valuable—you realize that wealth and accomplishments can’t be taken with you into eternity, so you focus on your character and your relationships. 



### Reason #5: Life Is a Test and a Responsibility

Ask yourself, “How do I picture my life?” Your response, the _life metaphor_ that comes to mind, reveals everything about you—what’s important to you, what you expect from your life, your attitude toward your circumstances, your motivations, and so on.

  * For example, if you say, “My life is a whirlwind,” you probably view life as fast and confusing, and feel that you’re not fully enjoying moments as they pass you by. If you say, “Life is a battle,” you may think life is difficult and full of struggle, and that there’s a way to “win” or “lose” at life. 



The way you view your life affects everything in it: your relationships, the way you spend time or money, your values, your goals, and so on. **Accepting God’s purpose allows you to reframe the way you see your life: The Bible tells us that life is a _test_ and life is a _responsibility_.**

#### Life Is a Test

God will test you throughout your life by putting conflicts, problems, changes, and success in your way. These situations are meant to challenge your faith, character, love, loyalty, and so on.

You can’t know everything that God will test you with, but if you look to the Bible you’ll see that tragedies, unanswered prayers, undeserved hurt, and significant changes are all ways that God has tested believers. **God gives you these tests because your response to them will both _develop you_ and _reveal you_.**

  * For example, you might respond to a challenging diagnosis by praying for guidance and reading Scripture— _developing_ your faith—while refusing to blame or be angry at God— _revealing_ your loyalty. 



##### You’re Being Tested Even When You Can’t Feel God

**God is _especially_ paying attention to how you respond to tests when you can’t feel his presence. God often feels absent in two instances:**

  1. **Difficult circumstances:** It’s easy to feel God’s presence when things are going well for you. It’s much harder to feel him when things get hard—it feels as if he may have forgotten you or abandoned you. The truest test of faith is continuing to feel God and trust him even when you encounter immense challenges.
  2. **Small, insignificant moments:** It’s easy to feel God in large, important events and situations. It’s much harder to realize that he’s in _everything_ , no matter how small or unimportant. Knowing that everything in your life has been put there as a test reveals that every moment of your life is significant and contributes to the development of your character. 



#### Life Is a Responsibility

As the creator, God is the true owner of everything on earth but as an expression of his love, he _entrusted_ all his gifts to you during your time on earth.

  * These gifts come in all forms: your particular talents, the natural world, your relationships, the events you experience, and so on.



You’re expected to take care of everything God’s given you, to the best of your ability. This is called _stewardship_ , and it’s some of your life’s most important work because it reveals how responsible you are. At the end of your life, God will examine each of the gifts he gave you and determine how well you took care of or used it. If he finds you to be a responsible steward of his gifts, you’ll receive three eternal rewards: God’s affirmation, important and interesting eternal responsibilities, and celebration.

### Reason #6: Everything Is by and for God

Everything in the universe was made by God to demonstrate his _essence_ , his _presence_ , his _power,_ and his _love._ Each thing in the world around you reflects his glory.

  * For example, think about the amazing and flawless design of the human body, microscopic forms of life, and seasons, just to name a few.



Besides the gifts he’s given us, God has expressed his glory in many amazing ways over the years—such as creating Jesus and allowing him to die for our sins, and appearing as a burning bush to Moses and giving him the Ten Commandments. There’s no possible way for us to _enhance_ God’s glory—it’s the most powerful, brilliant, complete thing in the universe.****

**Instead, we express our gratitude for all that God has given us by _showing_ his glory. **God’s glory is seen every time one of his creations fulfills the purpose he gave it. He assigned humans _five_ purposes:

  1. Worship 
  2. Unselfish fellowship
  3. Spiritual maturity 
  4. Your ministry
  5. Your mission 



**It’s in fulfilling each of these five purposes that you express your gratitude to God and succeed in showing his glory.** Through this summary, we’ll explore each of these purposes—looking at how they show up in your life, how you can dedicate yourself to them, and how you can succeed in fulfilling your purpose driven life.
