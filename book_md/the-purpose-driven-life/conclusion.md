## Conclusion: Putting All Your Purposes Together

Your five purposes are _lifelong_ work, and at times it will feel easier than other times. There are three major ways to keep yourself on track as you move forward: looking out for traps, regularly checking in on your balance, and preparing a purpose statement.

### Look Out for Traps

Throughout your life, you’ll repeatedly be confronted with two traps that distract you from doing God’s work: _envy_ and _approval-seeking_. We’ll discuss what each of these traps looks like and how to overcome them so that you can easily move past them and stay on track with your purposes.

#### The Envy Trap

It’s normal to be _interested_ in what other people are doing, and the different skills, personalities, or gifts they have. God likes it when we celebrate and study the diversity he created.

However, if your interest turns into _envy_ —that is, you begin to resent ways in which you weren’t made like others, or compare your unique work to that of others—you lose sight of the meaning and purpose of your life.

##### How Envy Hurts You

You’ll want to notice and shut down your envy as soon as possible because it’s destructive and distracting in four ways.

  1. **Envy is an insult to your unique creation.** When you wish to be like others, not only do you ignore all the amazing factors that make you _you_ , but you also insult God’s choices in creating you. He formed you exactly as he intended—your idea that you should be different in some way suggests that you think he made a mistake. 
  2. **Envy begs for your attention.** If you’re busy thinking about ways that you want to be different or watching the work of others, you can’t concentrate fully on your work and doing what God intended you to do. 
  3. **Envy wastes time and energy.** When you compare yourself to others, you end up overworking yourself in order to keep up with them or surpass them. Instead of being content with what God’s given you, you waste your time and energy trying to be or have _more_ —even though it won’t matter in the context of eternity. 
  4. **Envy paves the path to other sins.** Envy naturally creates feelings of conflict, competition, resentment, and so on. These feelings easily manifest in other sins, such as lying or stealing.



##### How to Overcome Envy

If you feel yourself becoming envious of others and distracted from your purposes, there are four mindset adjustments you can make to reduce your envy.

**1) Stop comparing:** Our uniqueness makes humans incomparable to one another, and God would never judge you for not being something _he didn’t make you to be_. Follow his lead.

  * Each time you start comparing yourself or your work to someone else, think, “God wouldn’t compare me to others. I choose to do the same.” 



**2) Celebrate others:** It’s tempting to feel envious when good happens to someone else, but not you—for example when a friend gets engaged while you’re still single, or a sibling gets a promotion at work while you’re stuck in a dead-end job. This usually happens because we feel that there’s a limited amount of “good” that God gives, and someone else receiving it means there’s less for you. This doesn’t make sense—God’s goodness is limitless.

  * When good happens to someone you know, remind yourself that it _doesn’t subtract_ from the amount of good that you can receive. Push yourself to celebrate them in the same way that they will celebrate you when good things happen for you. 



This step will substantially increase the happiness you feel throughout your life. If you’re only happy when _you_ experience good, you miss out on hundreds or thousands of opportunities to be happy in celebrating _others_ experiencing good.

**3) Practice gratitude:** Envy convinces you that what you have now isn’t enough, and only having “more” will make you happy. This is a myth—if you’re unable to be happy with everything already in your possession, you’ll be unsatisfied no matter how much you have.

  * When you start focusing on everything you _don’t_ have, turn your thoughts back to appreciating what you _do_ have. You might do this by spending time reflecting on gratitude each morning, or journaling. List abilities you have, personality quirks that make you special, or possessions that you’re grateful for like your home or your pet. 



**4) Trust God:** Envy is a symptom of doubting God—in thinking you should be different, you’re doubting the choices he’s made for you. Reflect on reminders of God’s love and proof that he knows better than you:

  * Everything you have is a _gift_ of God’s love and power. 
  * You don’t know everything God knows—his ultimate knowledge is much more trustworthy than your limited knowledge. 
  * Your life might feel unfair at some points, but even Jesus dealt with unfairness—his death was for _our_ sins, not his own.



#### The Approval-Seeking Trap

Approval-seeking, like envy, can easily make you lose sight of what’s truly important in your life. We’re made to cherish our relationships, so it makes sense to want to feel accepted, valued, and loved. These feelings are important because they’re what strengthen your bonds with others and gain the power and confidence to be _you_ and fulfill your purposes.

However, the desire for acceptance and love can easily go too far and become _approval-seeking_ —that is, you _need_ the approval and acceptance of others to be happy, and you fear the possibility of rejection or disapproval. This need can drive you to turn away from trying new things, taking risks, or doing the right thing—it stands directly in the path of the work necessary to fulfill your purposes.

##### How Approval-Seeking Hurts You

Being driven by the need for others’ approval damages your life in several ways:

  * All of your work is done for the sake of being liked or receiving recognition—it’s not genuine, and it’s not for God. You’re not fulfilling your purposes, but rather fulfilling your own needs above all else. 
  * You shy away from taking risks in faith—you don’t work on deepening your understanding of God’s Word or spreading his message because you fear what your friends or family might think of it. 
  * Like envy, approval-seeking is a gateway to other sins—if the choice to lie or cheat will guarantee that someone likes you, you’ll do it. 
  * Your principles and convictions become weak because you change them constantly to fit the people around you. There’s no _true_ you. 



##### How to Overcome the Need for Approval

**The need for approval is Satan’s way to ensure that God’s message to the world is stifled as much as possible.** Stay away from this trap by continually reminding yourself of three important truths:

  1. Nobody—not even God—can please everyone. It’s a fruitless goal, and not worth your time. 
  2. Approval isn’t a vital element to happiness—you can only be hurt by someone’s disapproval if you _allow_ yourself to be. Remind yourself that your happiness comes from your own choice to be happy with your life.
  3. This life is temporary. While the approval of others may _feel_ important or necessary now, keep an eternal perspective—the only approval that matters is God’s, and he’s the only one you’ll have to explain your choices to. When you realize how unimportant everyone else's opinions are, they lose their power. 



### Regularly Check in on Your Balance

Even those with the best intentions may lose sight of the necessity of balance between their purposes, choosing to focus on those that they’re enthusiastic about and choosing to ignore those that they’re not particularly interested in.

There are four activities that can help you take regular stock of the balance you’re keeping among your purposes.

#### Balance Check #1: Accountability Partners

Reading about your purposes is a great first step, but it’s important to engage in regular conversation and reflection about them with others. Through discussion, you can gain a better understanding of your purposes and get new ideas about how to fulfill them, strengthen your faith, and receive suggestions for improvement.

  * For example, you might share that you’re unsure of how to fit your purposes around your everyday tasks as a mother. Your accountability partner, also a mother, explains the small changes she’s made in her life in order to succeed in both areas. 



Being accountable to someone else is especially important when you start backsliding on any of your purposes. First, they’re likely to point out the issue before you even notice it. Second, they’ll act as a source of encouragement, ideas, and suggestions to get you back on track.

**Accountability partners don’t just _happen_. You’ll have to find and approach them yourself. **

  * Ask your fellowship group to act as your accountability partners.
  * Schedule regular meet-ups with your pastor.
  * Find someone who is on the same spiritual journey as you and commit to meeting once a month to check in.****



#### Balance Check #2: Spiritual Check-Ins

Every now and then, check in on your spiritual health and honestly evaluate how you feel you’re doing in the areas of worship, fellowship, character growth, ministry, and your mission.

During this check-in, ask yourself questions such as:

  * Are there areas of my life where I’m holding back from surrendering to God?
  * Am I being as honest and patient in fellowship as I’d want others to be toward me?
  * Do I look for the lessons in difficult moments, or just think of them as obstacles?
  * How often do I feel upset when others don’t acknowledge the ways I’ve served them?
  * Have I been holding back from making connections with unbelievers?



#### Balance Check #3: Journaling

Journaling is useful both for tracking your progress and growth and for spotting areas of your life where you’re not picking up lessons or working to fulfill your purposes.

Schedule a regular time each week to sit down and write about what you did during the week and a) the lessons you learned from your experiences and b) how your actions helped fulfill your purposes.

  * Of course, you learn from _both_ negative and positive experiences—your journal should include experiences of fear, doubt, and failure alongside experiences of happiness, success, and hope. 



#### Balance Check #4: Modeling Purpose Driven Living

Knowing the purpose of your life is a wonderful gift—share your knowledge with others, so that they can feel the same hope and meaning that you do. **This will help keep your purposes in balance because sharing what you know about purpose driven living isn’t just _telling_ others what to do—you’re a living demonstration of what it’s all about. **

Knowing that others are looking to you as an example naturally forces you to check in with yourself and identify where you may be slacking.

  * For example, while telling others how important it is to spread the news about God to unbelievers, one of them might ask what _you_ do to spread the news. This prompts the realization that you haven’t done any sort of mission work in a few months, and you commit to getting back on track. 



### Prepare a Purpose Statement

Because your purposes are a lifetime project, you may occasionally put them on the back burner or get distracted by other plans, goals, or temptations. **A purpose statement is a summary of the purposes of your life—a spiritual touchstone that you can return to regularly to realign your priorities and ensure that you’re living a purpose driven life.**

Create your purpose statement by writing down your commitments to your five purposes and your ideas for how you’ll best fulfill them and commit to them:

  * **Worship:** You know God should be at the center of your life, but it’s possible something will take his place. Think about your personal indicators that God has shifted down your priority list, and how you can realign your priorities. For example, when you’re driven by _work_ instead of your purposes, you start to feel anxious or restless. You can realign by committing to talking to God during your morning routine. 
  * **Fellowship:** Describe your church, your commitment as a member, and your relationships with other members. Think about how you plan to maintain your relationships and unity in the church. For example, you might make a list of things to try when you meet a “difficult” person: be as patient as possible, learn about them, and try to connect with them. 
  * **Character:** Think about the characteristics you want to develop over your lifetime, and write them down. You might include examples of situations that would develop these characteristics, as a reminder that everything has meaning. 
  * **Ministry:** Write down what you know about your SHAPE and how you can use it to serve others. Then, think about _who_ would be best served by your ministry.
  * **Mission:** Write down your personal testimony of finding God and starting a purpose driven life, and reflect on the life lessons you think would be most helpful to others. During your lifetime, you might find that you have a specific group of people God wants you to focus on and connect with. Add this detail into your purpose statement. 



In addition to your full purpose statement, think of a short slogan that is worded in a way that you can easily remember—memorize it and reflect on it often.

  * For example, “My purpose in this life is to thank God and talk to him as much as I can, bring my most authentic and loving self to my church, always choose to do what Jesus would do, serve others in a way that feels _right_ to me, and share what I know about God with everyone.”
