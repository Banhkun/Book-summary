## Exercise: Rethink Your Excuses

God wants you to spread word of his glory as far as you can. Today, this is more possible than ever—as long as you have your mental barriers out of the way.

* * *

What is your excuse for not completing your mission of representing Christianity around the world? (For example, you might think you’re too old or are afraid of leaving the country alone.)

What solutions can you think of to overcome this barrier? (For example, you can look for mission trips for older adults, or find a friend from your church to join a trip with you.)

What issues or events are getting in the way of completing your mission, because you’re attributing too much importance to them? (For example, you want to spend your spring break relaxing on a beach instead of on a mission trip, or you don’t want to take a week off work in case you miss something important.)
