## Week 3—Purpose #2.2: Build and Maintain Fellowship

It takes a lot of work to build a healthy, loving fellowship, but God reveals how to do so through his Word. Everyone’s fellowship community will look a little different, but they should have the same basic elements.

### A Fellowship Community’s Five Essential Elements

The Bible outlines five elements that every healthy fellowship community needs:

#### Element #1: Honesty

**In a healthy fellowship, members speak to one another _directly_ but lovingly, as they would a member of their family, and tell the truth, even if it’s not the easiest thing to hear. **Instead of turning away from conflict, they turn toward it—speaking with honesty to address problems, hold one another accountable, or correct one another’s actions.

This type of honesty allows group members to work through issues instead of hiding them or diminishing them—actions that create underlying frustration or hurt in the group, eventually causing it to crumble.

  * For example, a group member might leave because she found out that everyone was talking about her behavior instead of confronting her. Or, someone might leave because everyone _ignored_ her issue, making her feel alone and resentful. 



#### Element #2: Humility

Pride creates walls between people because it prevents you from asking for help and makes you feel that you’re better than others—not prone to the same sorts of mistakes or feelings that they are.

  * Prideful group members are likely to look down on other members when they’re experiencing normal, human struggles such as fear or doubt. This might prevent people from speaking honestly about their need for support.



Humility is essential in a fellowship group because it opens you up to asking for help and helps you relate to others’ experiences. You help people the best you can, understanding that one day _they’ll_ be helping _you_. There are several ways you can practice your humility, such as:

  * Listening to corrections and suggestions without reacting defensively
  * Putting other group members in the spotlight by highlighting their accomplishments, interesting ideas, special acts of service, and so on 
  * Admitting your weaknesses and being open-minded about others’ weaknesses 



#### Element #3: Courtesy

Being courteous of others means being considerate of their feelings and respectful of their differences and exercising patience.

  * For example, if someone expresses a fear that you don’t share, it’s not courteous to mock their feelings or brush them off. You should listen to them and validate their feelings, even if you don’t necessarily agree. 



Courtesy is especially important to remember when you’re dealing with someone that you find “difficult.” Difficult people are members of your spiritual family—they deserve all the courtesy and unselfish love you’d show other members. **One way to better love difficult people is _to attempt to understand them._** Ask about their experiences, and learn about how their lives have shaped them.

  * You may find that their “difficulty” stems from a place of insecurity, unmet emotional or social needs, trauma from their past, and so on. 



When you really know what’s inside of a person, it becomes much easier to show them patience, grace, understanding, and unselfish love.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Everybody, Always for more ways to commit to acting with love and patience when dealing with imperfect people.)

#### Element #4: Trust

**Your group not only has a duty to deal with any issues that a member brings up, but also to understand that these issues are shared in confidence—no one outside your group should find out about them.**

  * One thing to look out for is group members making gossipy “prayer requests” to people outside your group. This is an especially insidious way to gossip, as it uses the false guide of concern as a way to spread information. 



If someone is breaking your group’s trust, it’s vital that you confront them immediately and request that they stop. Their gossipy nature can easily divide or destroy your fellowship group if no one thinks they can trust one another.

#### Element #5: Regularity

Deep, meaningful relationships happen between people who spend a lot of time together—regular meetings will help create closeness within your group. These meetings shouldn’t be organized around _convenience_ —this makes it all too easy for urgent, unimportant matters to get in the way. **Your meetings should be a regular, steady spiritual touchpoint in your lives.**

  * Establish the importance of your meetings by having your group take a pledge to come to meetings regularly, even if it’s not what they _want_ to do or it feels a bit inconvenient. Then, hold one another accountable—if members don’t show up to meetings, check in with them. 



### How to Repair a Fractured Fellowship

Occasionally, you may find yourself at odds with someone in your group, or with a serious rift in your relationship. Instead of making the easy and selfish choice to walk away from an imperfect relationship, God wants you to do the hard work of repairing your relationships with unselfish love.

In any fractured relationship, strive to be a _peacemaker_.**** Peacemaking is an essential skill to loving unselfishly—in focusing on finding paths toward peace, you naturally start to better understand others and discover different ways to love them. Some people think that peacemaking means _avoiding_ conflict or people-pleasing, but it’s actually the opposite. **As a peacemaker, your duty is to _face_ conflict with the goal of resolving it and to do what’s right instead of what’s popular. **The Bible outlines five steps to guide you through the work of resolving conflict.

#### Step 1: Ask God for Advice

It’s tempting to gossip about relationship issues with friends, but your best bet is to talk to God about it first—either he’ll intervene to change the other person’s view of the issue, or he will give _you_ a necessary change of heart.

  * It’s important to be honest with God during these talks, so he understands exactly how you’re feeling and how you view the issue. Don’t hold back—nothing you can say to God, no matter how angry or mean, can surprise him. 



This conversation can also help you understand the core of the issue. Often, relationships are damaged when you’re expecting someone to give you something only God can give you, such as happiness, fulfillment, or perfect understanding. By looking for these things in the wrong places, you only set yourself up to be disappointed by the other person, through no fault of their own. **When talking to God, discuss your _expectations_ of the other person and honestly assess whether you’re asking too much of them.**

  * For example, “I thought Kate would understand my child’s issues because of her family’s experience, but she seemed to think it’s all _my_ fault. It was unfair to expect her to understand every nuance of the issue, which only God can do.” 



#### Step 2: Take Initiative

Don’t wait for the other person to approach you. God expects you to make the first move in working through and resolving a conflict, as soon as you can.

  * This is so important __ that Jesus said that conflict resolution should take priority over group worship if need be. If you need to skip church one Sunday to make amends with a friend, don’t hesitate.



Confronting the issue as soon as possible is essential because any time spent delaying is time for hurt and anger to stew and worsen. **However, be careful not to push a confrontation if it’s _not the right time_. **If either of you is feeling rushed, tired, or extra stressed, a conflict resolution won’t go smoothly. Hold off your confrontation until the first available moment when both of you are feeling physically and emotionally capable.

#### Step 3: Listen to Their Feelings

You can’t resolve a problem until you understand how the other person feels about it. Before launching into ideas for resolution, begin by letting the other person talk about their feelings—don’t interject with ideas or defenses. _Just listen._

**This is crucial—hearing and understanding their perspective gives you a more complete view of the issue, extends your patience, and guides you toward the resolution that will work for _everyone_. **This step may require you to listen without judgment while someone criticizes you or expresses anger toward you—this becomes especially difficult when you believe that their criticism and anger are unfounded.

  * Find strength in these moments by reflecting on how much of _your_ unfounded criticism and anger God has listened to. Focus on how much patience and unselfish love he shows you despite that, and commit to acting the same way. 



#### Step 4: Focus on Your Mistakes, Not Blame

As a human, you’re not perfect. **It’s likely that even if you _think_ you’re not at fault, you made a mistake in some way.** If you’re having trouble seeing your faults, you should ask a neutral third party for their input—they’ll have a clearer view of the situation than you will.

  * For example, if a group member feels upset about a correction you made during Bible study, you may think, “My correction was right. She’s overreacting because she’s jealous.” However, upon deeper reflection, you find that the way you corrected her came across as overly harsh, and it embarrassed her in front of the group. 



Believing that you’re fault-free can’t lead to resolution because the way you discuss the issue will pin blame on the other person, naturally making them feel defensive. There are two ways you can avoid the trap of blame:

**1) Make sure you’re discussing the _problem_ , not the _person._ **Before you speak, make sure what you’re about to say isn’t “weaponized” with accusations, criticism, belittling, and so on.

  * For example, in saying, “I’m upset because you went and blabbed to everyone at choir practice about a marriage issue I told our fellowship group in confidence,” you accuse and pin blame on them.
  * On the other hand, in saying, “I’m upset because something I spoke about in confidence was shared with many people with whom I did not want to share that information,” you avoid blame and stay focused on the issue. 



**2) Be the first to admit your own mistakes.** Demonstrating humility in this way naturally de-escalates the issue, as many people come into confrontations expecting to defend themselves. Instead, your humility makes the other person feel secure in admitting their own faults in the conflict.

These two steps fast-track conflict resolution**—** instead of arguing about _who did what_ , you move right into discussing how to repair what’s been done and how to prevent it moving forward.

#### Step 5: Look for Resolutions or Reconciliations

Conflict resolution doesn’t mean that one person “wins” and one person “loses.” It means that both parties come to a compromise together. When searching for a resolution, demonstrate your willingness to adjust your position in a way that meets _their_ needs instead of your own.

Ideally, they’ll reciprocate the courtesy, resulting in a fairly equal resolution of the issue. However, sometimes they won’t budge on their position—God created every member of his family to be different, so it’s natural that you won’t be able to align on some points. In these situations, it’s necessary to look for _reconciliation_ rather than _resolution_.

  * In resolution, you _come to an agreement_ about your differences or problems. In reconciliation, you _put them aside_ for the sake of your relationship. 



**Both resolution and reconciliation are good outcomes of conflict, as they both achieve your ultimate goal—maintaining unity with your spiritual family.**

> **Turn to the Bible for Conflict Resolution**
> 
> If you’re unsure of the best method for confronting someone, turn to the advice Jesus gives in the Bible.
> 
>   1. Try a private conversation, where you both speak about your feelings.
> 
>   2. If they refuse to listen to you or resolve the problem, involve one or two people who witnessed the point of conflict. They can give you a neutral confirmation of what the issue is and help you think of ways to reconcile.
> 
>   3. If they _still_ refuse to listen or reconcile, go to see your pastor together and ask him to mediate the discussion and reconciliation.
>

> 
> **If you’ve taken the issue all the way to your pastor and the other person still won’t work with you to repair your relationship, Jesus says you may think of them as an unbeliever. You’re still expected to love them, but you aren’t obligated to show them the mutuality, service, or trust you’d show the members of your spiritual family.**

### Commit to Protecting Your Church’s Unity

God wants you to learn the skill of unselfish love because it makes one of his and his son’s greatest desires—unity among his spiritual family—possible. **God desires unity because it’s the glue that holds churches together.** Without it, you can’t have genuine fellowship or the possibility of harmony and respect between church members.

The Bible provides five practical methods for performing your duty of protecting the unity in your church.

#### Method #1: Focus on Commonalities

If all you focus on is how the people in your church are _different_ from you, it’ll be impossible to feel unified with them or help them find each other’s unifying points. You can overcome this in two ways:

  1. **Think about what you have in common.** For example, you all share the same faith, you all share the experience of the same church, and you all have the same eternity to look forward to. 
  2. **Reflect on the _value_ of your differences. **God didn’t want all the members of his church to be the same—he purposely gave everyone different looks, personalities, skills, and experiences, and he wants you to love them all. Think of differences less as points of division and more as points of celebration by listening to the experiences of others, getting to know them, and enjoying the new perspectives they give you. 



#### Method #2: Don’t Expect Perfection

Your church is your family and has flaws, just like any other family. But, as with any other family, you don’t abandon them because of their flaws or mistakes—you work through your issues and find a way to improve together.

If you abandon your imperfect church family in search of a church with no flaws, _you’ll never find it.**There is no such thing as a perfect church, only churches trying their best to make their reality as close to the ideal as possible.**_ Searching for perfection will leave you hopping from church to church as a spectator, but never a member.

  * This means you’ll never have the opportunity to engage in fellowship with other members and learn the skill of unselfish loving. **By searching for perfection, you’ll miss out on the second purpose of your life.**



#### Method #3: Encourage Others

**When you criticize members of your church, you are arrogantly putting yourself in God’s place—only God can judge his believers.** Passing criticism on others is damaging in multiple ways:

  * It’s a sinful action that _you’ll_ be judged for in the end, not the target of your criticism. 
  * The points you choose to judge in others reveal _your own_ points of insecurity. 
  * Hurtful criticism damages the unity and harmony of your church.



If you feel that someone is doing something the “wrong” way, encourage them in another direction instead of overtly criticizing them. This redirects your energy away from _judgment_ toward the productive work of _improving together._

Imagine that someone in your church shows up for Sunday services but doesn’t interact with any other members and hasn’t gotten involved in any activities. You have a choice to make:

  * **Criticism:** You gossip to a friend,**** “Have you noticed that Martha never stays after services and hasn’t come to any events in her _two years_ here? She’s not so much a member as a spectator.” 
  * **Encouragement:** You approach her and say, “Martha, I wanted to introduce myself. I’m part of a Thursday night Bible study group that would love to get to know you if you’re interested in joining us.” 



#### Method #4: Shut Down Gossip

It’s intuitive that the _act_ of gossiping is sinful, but you might not realize that simply listening to it is wrong, too. **By listening, even if you don’t respond, you’re demonstrating that gossip and rumors—powerful weapons of hurt—are _allowed_. **

You have to speak up and stop gossip when you hear it, remembering to speak to the gossiper directly but lovingly, as you would a member of your family.

  * For example, you might say, “I’d prefer that you not talk to me about that because it sounds like a private issue with Tim. Did he give you permission to share that information?” 



#### Method #5: Show Support to Leaders

Often, the leaders of your church serve as conflict mediators, helping members reconcile their relationships and work through various hurts. This job is taxing—not only are they trying to preserve unity in the church, but they’re also trying to accomplish the impossible task of keeping _everyone_ happy.

**Their hard work and dedication to what’s best for you deserves your respect and trust—they’ll always give you the best counsel they can.**

  * You can show them your support by praying for them, loving them, making known your appreciation for them, and encouraging them. Urge your fellow church members to do the same.
