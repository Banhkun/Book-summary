## Exercise: Reflect on the Experiences of Your Fellowship

When your fellowship is genuine, you’ll receive the four vital experiences of mutuality, authenticity, sympathy, and forgiveness.

* * *

Describe your experience with _mutuality_ in your fellowship. (For example, your group came together to help another member when they were ill. Months later, she made sure _your_ physical needs were covered in the aftermath of a family death.)

Describe an experience of _authenticity_ in your fellowship. (For example, you discussed a temptation you struggle with and felt safe doing so. Your group responded by exposing their own struggles.)

Describe an experience of _sympathy_ in your fellowship. (For example, a member expressed that she was having some trouble in her marriage. Instead of ignoring the issue or saying, “It’s probably not so bad,” your group offered support and validated her feelings.)

Describe an experience of _forgiveness_ in your fellowship. (For example, you accidentally spread information that was shared with the group in confidence. Your group member forgives you and doesn’t bring your mistake up the next time _you_ share sensitive information.)
