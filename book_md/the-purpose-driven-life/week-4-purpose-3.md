## Week 4—Purpose #3: Spiritual Maturity

In this fourth week of your journey, we’ll discuss your third purpose, becoming more like God’s Son Jesus. **This might sound like an ambitious goal, but remember that you were made in God’s likeness, just like Jesus was.** You can see evidence of this in several ways:

  * Your spirit is immortal.
  * You have intellect—the ability to think and reason.
  * You can love and be loved. 
  * You have a sense of right and wrong. 



**You become more like God and Jesus when you take on their same values and character in your own life.** This doesn’t mean you’ll give up who you are to be just like Jesus—after all, God gave you a unique personality that he wants you to use. Rather than changing your personality, you’ll be changing your character to become more Christlike through _character development._

Your character already exists inside you but isn’t shaped in any particular way. Throughout your life, God will put new challenges in your way that will help you put the pieces of your character together—ultimately, his goal is that you’ll arrive in heaven with a character as close to Jesus’s as possible.

### The Choice to Grow Spiritually

It’s not possible to become more like Jesus just by willpower alone. Only the power of the Holy Spirit is strong enough to effect the changes that God wants for your character.

You may feel that the Holy Spirit has never worked through you before. Like many people, you probably believe that the Holy Spirit shows up in brilliant, grand gestures. **Rather, the Holy Spirit’s power shows up in our lives in quiet and reserved ways— _every time you choose to grow spiritually._**

  * This choice looks like taking a small leap of faith to complete a seemingly impossible task, pushing forward when you feel weak or afraid, or choosing the right thing to do. The Holy Spirit doesn’t help those who are waiting for power or strength before they act—it’s activated by those who feel weak but act anyway. 



Growing spiritually isn’t the _easy_ choice, but it’s the _right_ choice. It allows God’s Spirit to live through you and give you his power, wisdom, and love so that you can complete the task ahead. **This strengthens your character—as time goes on, you’ll feel less afraid of the challenges God puts in front of you.**

#### Change Your Character by Changing Your Behaviors

Your character is a sum of your behaviors and habits—these must change to become more Christlike if your character is to become more Christlike, too. There are three parts to changing your behaviors.

##### Part 1: Reject Your Old Behaviors

To grow spiritually, you must _commit to changing_. **This is a crucial point of your spiritual life because it’s the kickoff point of your spiritual maturity.** Unfortunately, many people choose not to commit to their spiritual growth, which causes them to miss out on their purpose in different ways:

  * Some people don’t commit because they’re afraid and end up without meaning or purpose in their lives.
  * Some people half-commit, or have paradoxical commitments—such as _both_ wealth and spiritual maturity—which leads them to feel constantly frustrated and unable to truly master any of their commitments. 
  * Some people commit to the _wrong_ things—such as power, wealth, or pleasure. At the end of their lives, they don’t have the promise of eternal life, and their temporary earth commitments disappear, leaving them unfulfilled. 



You must choose a _full_ commitment to becoming more Christlike—otherwise, you risk missing the meaning and fulfillment that life has to offer.

##### Part 2: Change the Way You Think

Once you’ve rejected your old way of doing things and committed to developing your character, turn your focus to _the way you think._ Your actions are dictated by your beliefs and attitudes—therefore, changing the way you think will naturally change your behaviors and habits.

It’s important to understand here that your brain mostly works on autopilot—that is, instead of thinking through all possible decisions or reactions to a situation, your brain saves energy by automatically choosing what you usually do or whatever’s easiest.

  * For example, you might automatically become defensive when you receive criticism, even when it’s warranted. Or, you might eat a cupcake that’s offered to you, instead of declining it. 



(Shortform note: Read our summary of The Willpower Instinct __ for a deeper look at how autopilot decisions can rule your life.)

**There are two ways you can override your autopilot: willpower and reprogramming.** When you try to force new behaviors with _willpower_ alone, you consciously choose to do the opposite of what your autopilot tells you to do. Instead of changing the thinking at the base of your behaviors, you’re changing _only_ your behaviors—treating a symptom, instead of the disease.

This may work in short-term contexts—such as saying “no” to that cupcake once—but won’t work out in the long term. Your willpower simply isn’t as strong as your autopilot, so you’ll quickly wear out and fall back on automatic actions.

**For long-term behavioral changes, you need to _reprogram your autopilot_ so that your thoughts support the right behaviors. **This is an ongoing project of consciously examining the thoughts that prompt your decisions and reactions, and realigning them with the way Jesus would think. There are two parts to this examination:

**1) Identify and stop self-centered thoughts.** Recognize when your thoughts are all about you, what you want, or how you feel. These sorts of thoughts are considered _immature_ because they’re thoughts that an infant would have—they think only of themselves and their needs, interested only in _taking_ rather than _giving_.

  * For example, if someone corrects one of your ideas and you react defensively, you’re thinking about yourself—you’re driven by your feelings of embarrassment or hurt pride, or feel that your idea deserved more appreciation. 



**2) Make your thoughts about others.** Consider how your self-centered thoughts could be more about others—how you can _give_ rather than _take_. These thoughts focus on the perspective, needs, and feelings of others, and are considered _mature._

  * For example, if someone corrected one of your ideas, the mature choice is to react with humility and accept their correction. You realize you’re not perfect and their correction was made in your best interest with the intent of making your idea even better.



##### Part 3: Align Actions With Thoughts

It’s important here to think about what it means to be “spiritually mature.” Many people falsely believe that it means knowing a lot of information about the Bible and its concepts. While knowledge is important, it’s essential that you _act_ on it.

  * For example, you might have a spiritually mature thought, such as, “I should make time to visit the elderly members of my church.” This thought doesn’t develop your character if you never act on it. Instead, it’s a passing thought that gets edged out by your commitment to spiritually immature thoughts and desires, like your social life or hobbies. 



Frequently reflect on your _actions_ and ensure that they’re aligning with your _thoughts_.**Ask yourself: Have I truly committed to being Christlike, or am I only doing half of the work?**

### Three Tools of Character Development

Once you’ve committed to becoming more spiritually mature, God will use three tools to provide you with opportunities to further develop your character: his Word, other people, and circumstances.

#### Tool #1: God’s Word

**Absorbing God’s Word and living by it should take high priority in your life, as it contains the truths that nourish your spirit and guide you in fulfilling your purposes.** There are three everyday activities you can perform to internalize God’s Word and live your life by it.

##### Activity 1: Accept the Authority of His Word

The Bible is the guidebook for your life and should be where you turn when you need to make decisions or examine your behaviors. **God’s word is an unfailingly reliable standard that will never lead you astray, as other authorities might, such as:**

  * Peer pressure: “Everyone else said I should do it.”
  * Tradition: “This is how it’s always been done.”
  * Logic: “It seemed to make sense.”
  * Emotion: “It felt like the right thing to do. 



When making decisions, always ask yourself: “What does the Bible tell me to do?” Whatever God’s Word instructs, you must do with full faith in his authority.

##### Activity 2: Fill Your Mind With His Word

Living by God’s Word becomes easier when you keep it, ready to use, in your mind. There are five common ways that people fill their minds with his Word.

  1. **Be receptive:** Listen to his Word with an open mind, looking for the lessons. If you feel you aren’t learning anything during a sermon or Bible study, examine your mindset. There is _always_ something to learn from his Word, so if you’re not learning it’s because you have a closed-off attitude. Focus your mind on being open to new ideas and lessons. 
  2. **Read:** Read the Bible every day. One way to stay on track with this is to create a reading plan—this helps you read with purpose instead of jumping between sections or missing out on sections that might not seem interesting. 
  3. **Study:** Bible study should go hand-in-hand with your reading. Effective study involves reflecting on the information you’re reading and writing down your thoughts, questions, and insights. Your questions and insights don’t need to be especially profound or poetic—simply asking who, what, where, when, why, and how will make you more engaged with the text.
  4. **Memorize:** Having verses memorized can help you in many situations, as you have a ready reminder of God’s instructions when you need to make good choices, give advice, resist temptation, and so on. To start your practice of verse memorization, select several parts of Scripture that feel especially relevant to you. Write them on a card that you can carry with you and look at frequently.
  5. **Reflect:** Meditating on God’s Word means choosing a verse, focusing on it, and thinking about it over and over again. This firmly plants the verse in your mind and lets you explore it and understand it from many different angles. 



##### Activity 3: Apply the Lessons of His Word

It’s incorrect to think that once you’ve read something, you’ve absorbed the lessons and understood it. **To truly understand the lessons of God’s Word, you need to apply them to your life.**

Each time you read and study God’s Word, think about the lesson in it. Then, create a plan to use the lesson in your life. A good action plan is specific and has three parts: It’s _personal_ and involves one of your own relationships or character development, it’s _doable_ , and it _has a deadline_.

  * For example, if you read the story of the Good Samaritan, you might make a plan to help someone you don’t know within the next week to develop your capacity for helping others without receiving anything in return. 



#### Tool #2: People

You can’t grow spiritually just by reading the Bible or praying—God wants you to grow _with_ others because they lend you the support you need for meaningful growth. Sometimes applying the lessons of his Word can be difficult, or can expose something you don’t like about yourself such as weaknesses or corrupt morals. **Sharing the journey of spiritual maturity—and all its difficulties—with a support system allows you to continue your growth in a number of ways:**

  * Others act as a support system when you feel too weak to make the right choice. 
  * They can help you understand parts of God’s Word in ways you wouldn’t have seen by yourself. 
  * They can give you ideas on how to implement his lessons in your life, and you can hold each other accountable to see the tasks through. 



Furthermore, other people are imperfect and may irritate you or test your patience. **These interactions are a true test of your character—will you act selfishly, or will you choose to act as Jesus would?** Every time you respond with patience and unselfish love in these moments, your character becomes more Christlike.

#### Tool #3: Circumstances

God puts difficult circumstances in your way in order to put you in an environment necessary for growth. If you always lived in your comfort zone, you would never learn about enduring pain, taking on seemingly insurmountable challenges, or stretching the limits of your faith.

However, the problems God puts in front of you won’t always help you with your character development. **Difficult circumstances will only strengthen your character _as long as you respond to them as Jesus would._** Reacting in a selfish or immature way will only create resentment or frustration that holds you back instead of helping you grow.

##### How to Respond to Difficult Circumstances Like Jesus

The Bible outlines three ways that you can make sure your response to problems aligns with a Christlike character.

**1) Remember that God is good.** Always know that God is acting in your best interest—if he’s giving you pain or not responding to your prayers for assistance, it’s because he knows that’s what will be best for your character development.

  * For example, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers and initially couldn’t understand the pain he had to endure. Eventually, God’s plan came into focus when he realized he was meant to help save Egypt from famine. 



In these hard moments, turn your focus _away_ from your problem and _toward_ God’s plan—reminding yourself that there is a reason behind your suffering can help alleviate it.

  * It helps to also remember that your difficult circumstances or pain are _temporary_ , but the character you’re developing will live _eternally._



**2) Give thanks.** God wants us to give thanks in all circumstances. This doesn’t mean you have to be thankful _for_ the circumstance—it would certainly be difficult to find a way to be thankful for pain or suffering. Rather, God wants you to be thankful that _because_ of the circumstance, you can learn and develop your character.

**3) Keep going.** You’ll likely feel the temptation to give up on your circumstances or turn away from God. _Make the choice to grow spiritually_ —keep moving forward with faith, patience, and perseverance. **The only path to character development is _through_ your circumstances.** Avoiding problems or trying to find a shortcut through them causes you to miss out on crucial moments of leaning into faith or pushing through fear.

  * As a result, you’ll continue to approach problems with a “Why me?” mindset, instead of recognizing God in your circumstances and making the spiritually mature choice to ask, “What’s the lesson here?” 



### Temptation’s Role in Spiritual Growth

You may think that temptation is an _obstacle_ in your path to becoming Christlike, but it’s actually a valuable learning opportunity. **God puts you in situations where you’ll want to act in _direct opposition_ to the qualities Jesus possessed, such as love, patience, faithfulness, and self-control. **When you make the choice to stick to Jesus-like qualities in these situations, you develop the strength of your character.

The most crucial aspect of these temptations that God creates is that there’s a _choice_ to make. Your character is like a muscle—it needs resistance to develop and strengthen.

  * For example, you don’t develop your integrity while taking an exam in a supervised setting, as there’s no opportunity for you to cheat. You _do_ develop your integrity when you’re trusted to take an unsupervised exam and have the opportunity to check your answers against your textbook, but choose not to cheat. 



#### The Pattern of Temptation

Before you can effectively resist temptation, it’s important to understand what it _is_. **Fortunately, temptation is incredibly predictable** —the Bible reveals that Satan always relies on the same four-part process to lead believers astray:

**1) Satan identifies your desire and urges you to fulfill it.** These desires might be evil, such as the desire to get revenge on someone, or they might be legitimate _but only when exercised at the right time for the right reason_ , such as sexual pleasure.

  * It’s important to realize here that temptation comes from your mind, not your environment. No situation has the power to tempt you if you keep hidden desires out of your mind.



**2) Satan makes you doubt God’s Word.** He plants questions in your mind such as, “Does God really say this is bad?” or “Wouldn’t God want me to do this and be happy?” Remember that God’s Word is never wrong and his guidelines will never fail you.

**3) Satan lies to you about the consequences.** This is dangerous because he sounds authoritative, but he’s always lying. He’ll tell you “Nothing bad will happen. No one will find out. This isn’t a big enough sin to follow me. It has to be fine because others are doing it.” But, everything you do has eternal consequences—giving into temptation and sinning shows up on God’s radar.

**4) You act on the thought.** Satan’s suggestions, coupled with your internal questions and doubts manifest in sin.

#### How to Defeat Temptation

Knowing the mechanisms of temptation puts you on the offense against it, rather than defense—**it’s always much easier to _stay away from temptation_ than it is to _get out of_ temptation.** There are four key actions you can take to keep your mind alert to the risk of temptation and ready to overcome it.

##### Action #1: Rethink Your Vulnerability to Temptation

**There are two crucial ideas to understand about temptation: It’s _normal_ and it _doesn’t go away with spiritual maturity_. **

**1) It’s normal.** Many Christians feel that temptation is a sign of failure or weakness on their part, and they can be discouraged from their efforts to develop their spiritual maturity—this thinking misses out on three key points about why temptation happens.

  * Temptation is a signal of your faith, not weakness. It means that Satan’s recognized you as his enemy, and is trying his best to distract you from your belief and service to God. 
  * Feeling temptation is a _good sign_ because it means Satan hasn’t won you over. If he had, you wouldn’t wrestle with temptation at all—you’d simply give in to it. 
  * _Having_ temptation isn’t sinful— _giving in_ is. Your character strengthens every time you feel temptation, but choose not to act on it.



**2) It doesn’t go away with spiritual maturity.** You might hold the false belief that you’re spiritually mature enough not to be vulnerable to temptation anymore. **Keep in mind that _even Jesus dealt with temptation throughout his life._**

  * Not only is this mindset prideful and arrogant, but it leaves you _especially_ vulnerable to temptation—tempting thoughts can more easily catch you off-guard when you’re not on the lookout for them. 



##### Action #2: Recognize Your Triggers

We know temptation is in the mind, not the environment itself. Think about what types of situations bring your inner desires to the surface. Keep in mind that Satan knows what these situations are, so you have to figure them out too if you want to stay a step ahead of him.

A good way to think about your triggers is going through basic questioning of who, what, where, when, and why:

  * **Who** am I with when I'm most tempted? 
  * **What** sorts of things usually tempt me? For example, food, money, desire for revenge, physical attraction, and so on. 
  * **Where** do I frequently feel tempted? For example, at home, work, at your parents’ house, or on business trips. 
  * **When** do I usually feel tempted? This could refer to different days of the week or different times of the day. 
  * **Why __** am I turning toward desires? Often, temptation stems from emotions such as loneliness, hurt, anger, embarrassment, success, elation, and so on. 



Once you’ve figured out the situations that most frequently make you feel tempted, resolve to avoid them. For example, if you always feel tempted to gossip with a certain coworker on the train home on Fridays, either don’t commute with her anymore or keep your conversations away from gossipy topics.

##### Action #3: Change Your Focus

It doesn’t do you any good to fight against Satan’s focus on your desire—he’ll always win. Thoughts of temptation only become stronger the more you try to fight against them, much like someone telling you, “Don’t think about a white bear.” Suddenly, that’s all you can think about.

However, you can _diminish_ the power of a thought simply by occupying your mind with other topics.

  * **Distract yourself with other thoughts:** Recognize that you’re feeling tempted, and consciously redirect your thoughts to something else. For example, if you’re tempted to gossip about a friend, think of something that excites you and talk about that.
  * **Physically remove yourself:** If the situation you’re in is stirring up a thought of temptation, leave the situation. This can look like changing the TV channel, getting off a phone call, or closing your Internet shopping tabs. 
  * **Quote Scripture:** Push tempting thoughts to the side by filling your mind with Scripture that you’ve memorized. 



##### Action #4: Ask for Help

When faced with temptation, be humble and ask for help from others instead of fighting on your own. There are two places you can turn to for help in overcoming your temptations:

**1) Turn to God.** Ask him to help you and have faith that he’ll give you the tools you need. People often skip this step, afraid to ask God for help for various reasons.

  * Some think God won’t understand their struggle. Remember that even Jesus knows what it means to face temptation. 
  * Some don’t really want help and would rather give in to the temptation. This reveals that they think they know _better than God_ what’s good for them. 
  * Some feel embarrassed to ask for help, especially if the temptation is one they’ve faced before. Remember that God is _always_ willing to help—he’ll never be annoyed or bored with you. 



In a way, God likes it when you deal with temptation because it strengthens both your dependence on him and your character—you first lean into your faith to get the tools you need, and then you become more like Jesus when you overcome the temptation.

**2) Turn to a friend or support group.** Talk about your struggles with someone you can be honest with, like a good friend, your fellowship group, or your pastor. Their support—which includes their encouragement, their prayers, and their efforts to hold you accountable for your actions—vastly improves your chances of overcoming your temptation.

### Remember It’s a Lifetime Project

**Remember that character development doesn’t happen all at once—it’s a lifetime process that has setbacks and stagnation _._** You’ll never be _just_ like Jesus in this life because it’s only when you arrive in eternity or when Jesus returns to earth that you’ll be able to perfectly see him and adjust your character to be exactly like his. In the meantime, your purpose is to _strive toward_ a Christlike character.

Because this work takes so long, it might be easy to forget about it or think that it’s okay to “cheat” now and then. **It’s crucial to always remember that _character_ matters far more than anything you have on earth. **It’s the only thing you take into eternity with you. ****

Keeping this in mind is important because in forgetting your commitment to Christlike character, you become vulnerable to the influence of others, such as your family, friends, or colleagues.**** When you shape yourself according to your commitments to _them_ , you risk missing out on the spiritual maturity that gives you meaning in life and promises eternal life. Regularly check in and ask yourself:

  * What commitment am I fulfilling right now? 
  * Are my actions in the interest of _character development_ or _personal fulfillment?_
