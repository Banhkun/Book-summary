## Exercise: Practice Thinking in Loops

Circular thinking, rather than linear thinking, is the core of seeing the big picture: You do something, your action creates an effect, then that effect loops back around and affects you in some way. Take some time now to think about a loop you already work with in your daily life.

* * *

What’s one feedback loop in your daily life? (Note that this doesn’t have to be work-related—if you do something nice for your family (cause), your action puts them into a good mood (effect), and their good mood makes your day more pleasant (affecting you), that’s a perfectly valid cause-effect-cause loop.)

Is this a positive or negative feedback loop? In other words, does this loop naturally build upon itself, or does it move toward a balance point? Explain how the loop builds upon itself or the balance point that it moves toward.

Does this feedback loop benefit you? If so, how? If not, what change could you make to disrupt the loop?
