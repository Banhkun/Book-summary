## Exercise: Reframe Your Situation

Adding challenges to everyday activities makes them engaging and interesting—reducing your need for a distracting “escape.”

* * *

Describe an activity that often makes you feel bored, restless, or otherwise in need of escape. (For example, practicing an instrument or writing article pitches.)

How can you “dive deeper” into this activity—that is, break it down into smaller parts and examine them closely? (For example, you might research each of your instrument’s chords and which chord combinations work best, or go through old, accepted pitches to identify “best practices.”)

How can you create a challenge within this activity? Keep in mind that engaging challenges usually set _limits_. (For example, you challenge yourself to learn one new song per week or make a goal of sending three pitches in two hours.)
