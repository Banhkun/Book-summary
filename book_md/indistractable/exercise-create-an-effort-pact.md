## Exercise: Create an Effort Pact

You can help yourself avoid undesirable behaviors by making them harder to perform.

* * *

What’s an undesirable behavior that you’d like to perform less? (For example, skipping the gym or going on social media when you should be studying.)

How can you attach an effort pact to this behavior to make it more difficult? (For example, finding a gym buddy so you have to call and cancel on them if you want to skip a workout or using a site-blocking browser extension that you must undo before visiting social media.)
