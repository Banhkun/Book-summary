## Exercise: Build Your Ideal Self and Relationship Schedule

Building a schedule that prioritizes whatâ€™s _truly_ important depends on being clear about your values.

* * *

What are your _personal_ values? (For example, your values may include challenge, variety, and learning.)

What value-aligned activities can you schedule into your week? (For example, you might timebox several hours per week for advancing in your hobby and an hour on the weekend for exploring a new part of town.)

What are some non-negotiable timeboxes you can create for your family and friends? (For example, you read to your kids for 30 minutes every night, cook dinner for your spouse one night per week, and have a standing appointment for Sunday night drinks with your friends.)
