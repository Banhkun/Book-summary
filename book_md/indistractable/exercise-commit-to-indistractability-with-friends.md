## Exercise: Commit to Indistractability With Friends

When friends spend distracted time together, they miss out on important moments and conversations that deepen their relationships.

* * *

Describe situations where you and your friends often become distracted. (For example, you always end up looking at your phones while at dinner together or your children often wander into your get-togethers and derail your conversations.)

How can you minimize these distractions? (For example, calling out inappropriate phone use or agreeing not to let children interrupt your conversations.)
