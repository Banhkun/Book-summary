## Chapter 15: High-Risk Pregnancy

This scary chapter goes through major complications of pregnancy in the third trimester, their consequences, and treatments.

(Shortform note: Oster did not include the baseline rates for these and risk factors, so we did the research and added them here (thus, any inaccuracies are not the book’s fault). Mercifully, the risk for any grave condition is usually <1%.)

Generally, if a particular complication happens in your first pregnancy, it’s likely to happen in future pregnancies.

#### Placenta Previa

What: Placenta covers the cervix, partially or fully.

Rate: 0.5%

Risk Factors

  * Maternal age > 40 and < 20
  * Prior C-section
  * Prior abortion



Consequences

  * Vaginal bleeding with potential for hemorrhage
  * Preterm birth



Management

  * Most self-resolve
  * If continues to term, C-section around 36 weeks



(Note the vicious cycle here - placenta previa leads to C-sections, which increases risk of placenta previa.)

#### Placental Abruption

What: Placenta detaches from the uterine wall

Rate: 0.5%

Risk Factors

  * Maternal trauma
  * Pre-eclampsia
  * Chronic hypertension
  * Maternal age > 40 and < 20



Consequences

  * Painful contractions and vaginal bleeding
  * Preterm birth
  * Fetal growth restriction
  * Need for C-section



Management

  * If full-term, deliver baby
  * If preterm, depends on severity of abruption



#### Gestational Diabetes

What: Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy

Rate: 3-9%

Risk Factors

  * Obesity and overweight
  * Family history of type 2 diabetes
  * Maternal age > 35



Consequences

  * Higher risk of macrosomia (large for gestational age, > 8lb 13oz at birth)
  * Delivery may need instruments or C-section
  * Risk for stillbirth, neonatal metabolic problems



Management

  * Glucose monitoring and control



#### Rh Alloimmunization

What: Baby has Rh+ blood, Mom has Rh-. Mother produces antibodies that can cross placenta and lead to destruction of fetal red blood cells.

Rate: 0.1%

Risk Factors

  * Requirement: mother must be Rh- and father is Rh+ (homozygous or heterozygous)
  * Amniocentesis/CVS causes blood mixing
  * Bleeding in pregnancy
  * Previous pregnancies with Rh incompatibility (first baby is less at risk)



Consequences

  * Risk of fetal anemia and hyperbilirubinemia



Management

  * Rhogam shot at 28 weeks and after delivery. This destroys fetal red blood cells before the mother can develop immunity to them. This dramatically reduces risk of Rh disease.



#### Cervical Insufficiency/Incompetence

What: Painless dilation of the cervix before reaching term

Rate: 1-2%

Risk Factors

  * History of cervical biopsy
  * Repeated procedures to cervix during pregnancy
  * Significant trauma to cervix



Consequences

  * 2nd trimester miscarriage
  * Very preterm birth



Management

  * Cervical length screening
  * Progesterone treatment
  * Cerclage (sutures above cervix opening) at weeks 14-16



#### Fetal Growth Restriction

What: Poor fetal growth, usually due to poor nutrition or inadequate oxygen to fetus

Rate: 3-10%

Risk Factors

  * Poor weight gain
  * Poor nutrition
  * Smoking
  * Alcohol
  * Diabetes
  * Hypertension, cardiovascular disease



Consequences

  * Low birth weight
  * Preterm birth
  * Still birth
  * Metabolic, breathing problems



Management

  * Continual evaluation of growth
  * May induce early delivery if baby would be better off outside mother



#### Preeclampsia, Eclampsia, HELLP Syndrome

What: High blood pressure (>140/90) with increased protein in urine. Symptoms include headache, abdominal pain, sudden weight gain.

  * Eclampsia involves seizures resulting from multi-organ failure, vascular permeability, and cerebral edema. 
  * HELLP = hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. 
  * Possible mechanism involves abnormal vascularization of placenta, causing hypoxia and release of factors causing inflammation.



Rate: 3-5%

Risk Factors

  * Obesity
  * Hypertension
  * Older age
  * Diabetes
  * Mother >35 years



Consequences

  * Multi-organ failure
  * Maternal and fetal death



Management

  * Blood pressure management
  * Aspirin
  * Delivery of baby



#### Placenta Accreta

What: Placenta forms an abnormally firm and deep attachment to the uterine wall.

Rate: 0.3%

Risk Factors

Consequences

  * Hemorrhage at time of delivery
  * Damage to local organs
  * Maternal death



Management

  * C-section followed by hysterectomy
