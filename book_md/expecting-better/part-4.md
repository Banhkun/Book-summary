## Part 4: The Third Trimester | Chapter 14: Premature Birth

A premature birth occurs before 36 weeks and occurs in 12% of pregnancies. Early-term is between 37-38 weeks, and full-term is 39 and beyond.

Over the past decades, survival for preterm babies has increased dramatically due to improvements like assisted ventilation (lungs develop later in pregnancy). It’s a marvel that even babies born at 22 weeks still have a shot at survival.

However, premature children are more likely to get sick, have lower IQs, and may have vision/hearing problems. 75% of 5-year-olds born before 30 weeks have a disability (vs 27% of full-term births). Their IQs were 5-14 points lower.

Here’s a table of % of births occurring at each week of gestation:

**Weeks of Gestation** | **% of Births** | **Probability of Death in First Year**  
---|---|---  
22  | 0.05%  | 77.1%   
23  | 0.06%  | 62.6%   
24  | 0.09%  | 39.3%   
25  | 0.10%  | 26.0%   
26  | 0.11%  | 18.1%   
27  | 0.12%  | 13.6%   
28  | 0.17%  | 7.5%   
29  | 0.20%  | 5.5%   
30  | 0.28%  | 4.0%   
31  | 0.36%  | 3.2%   
32  | 0.51%  | 2.1%   
33  | 0.78%  | 1.5%   
34  | 1.39%  | 1.1%   
35  | 2.33%  | 0.8%   
36  | 4.37%  | 0.6%   
37+  | 89.09%  | 0.2%   
  
Chances of a preterm baby are thus sizable, but still in the small minority.

### Delaying Labor

If you go into labor early, what happens?

  1. You receive tocolytics (eg magnesium sulfate) to suppress contractions and delay birth for 1-2 days.
  2. You receive steroid shots, which speeds up fetal development.
     * Steroids result in 30% decrease in fetal death.
  3. You can get transported to a hospital with a higher-level NICU, with more sophisticated equipment to handle very preterm infants.



Oster argues **there is no evidence that bedrest works** at preventing preterm birth. It also entails risk from taking leave from work and medical risks like muscle atrophy and weight loss.
