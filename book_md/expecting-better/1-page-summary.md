## 1-Page Summary

_Expecting Better_ contains a wealth of information on conception, pregnancy, and labor. Here are some of the most memorable points, especially when they contradict common wisdom.

### Conception

Your chances of getting pregnant decline with age. Chance of conception in a month is 24% at age 25; 21% at age 30; 16% at age 35; 7% at age 40; and 3% at age 45.

In terms of timing sex, it’s pretty much impossible to get pregnant outside of a 6-day window before the day of ovulation. That’s because the egg only survives for 24 hours after release, so the sperm have to be waiting in the Fallopian tube to greet the egg. Luckily, sperm live up to 5 days. Therefore, **the best chance of conception happens the day before or the day of ovulation**. Conception can still happen up to 5 days before ovulation, with lower chances.

The frequency of sex during this 6-day window does NOT make a difference in chance of conception - it's more important to hit the right day.

There are a variety of ways to track ovulation, including temperature charting and cervical mucus. The most accurate is ovulation sticks, which detect hormones in urine. Of women randomly given access to ovulation detection sticks, 23% got pregnant within 2 months, vs 15% who didn’t have them.

### Pregnancy

#### Risks to Baby

**Alcohol:** There’s no strong evidence showing 1 drink per day affects child IQ, test scores, or behavior problems. However, this means sipping 1 drink per day, not binge drinking 7 drinks in one night and abstaining the other 6 nights.

**Caffeine:** It seems safe to have up to 3-4 cups of coffee per day.

**Tobacco:** Tobacco is not recommended at any time in pregnancy or in life.

**Food:** Toxoplasmosis and Listeria are the most dangerous infections to the baby. These come from undercooked meats, unwashed produce, and other sporadic outbreaks. Otherwise, for typical foods that may cause illness (from raw eggs, raw fish, shellfish) use your standard caution - your risk of infection aren’t higher when you’re pregnant.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Many drugs that are probably safe for pregnant women don’t get an explicit clearance from the FDA, because they’re hard to test in randomized controlled trials. Check the full summary for a list of common examples by their FDA category.

#### Miscarriages

The risk of miscarriage is highest at week 6 (2 weeks after missed period) at 10-15%, then declines rapidly to 2% by week 11.

It’s common to announce after the first trimester (roughly 12 weeks), but the risk of miscarriage decreases substantially by week 9.

These factors increase miscarriage rate: having a previous miscarriage; maternal age; IVF pregnancies.

#### Prenatal Screening

Many parents want to get prenatal screening to detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome. The traditional techniques of amniocentesis and chorionic villi sampling are accurate but have risk of causing miscarriage. There’s a newer noninvasive test, cell-free fetal DNA testing, that has very high accuracy, with both sensitivity and specificity above 99%.

Before getting a screen, it’s useful to consider what you’re going to do based on the news you receive. For some parents, screening may have no point - no matter what they find, they’ll continue with the pregnancy. Then testing would just cause undue anxiety and may be unnecessary.

If you do want a test, then consider what you’ll do if you get a positive or negative result.

#### Weight Gain

Mothers starting at a normal BMI should aim to gain about 30 pounds over pregnancy. If you deviate, it’s better to err toward more weight gain than too little weight, since complications for low weight babies are much worse.

Some women may undereat in the hopes that they won’t have to take off weight after pregnancy. But **90% of women starting out at normal weight had returned to normal weight by 24 months postpartum**.

### Labor and Delivery

#### Birth Timing and Complications

90% of babies are born week 37 and above (“normal term birth”).

Incredibly, a baby born at 22 weeks (a bit over half of the normal pregnancy length of 40 weeks) still has a 23% chance of survival, due to improvements in assistive breathing and other technology.

At week 42, pregnancy is medically induced, due to increased risk of stillbirth.

Some serious complications like placental abruption are mercifully rare, affecting <1% of mothers.

#### The Delivery

Birth plans are short documents that describe what you want to happen during your birth and what treatments you’re willing to accept in which situations. For instance, you can describe in what conditions you want labor to be induced and how intensely you want the fetus monitored. Oster argues it’s far better to think about hard decisions and articulate your preferences beforehand than to come up with them on the fly.

About 66% of women get epidurals. They don’t show differences in fetal outcomes, but they do increase pushing time, cause longer recovery, and have some minor risks.

Doulas are labor companions who support women throughout the childbirth journey and show lower risk of C-section and use of epidurals. Oster really liked this.

<1% of women in the US have a home birth.
