## Part 1: Conception | Chapters 1-3

### Chances of Conception

Contrary to what you learned in high school health class, it’s not that easy to get pregnant. Female fertility peaks in your teens, then decreases gradually from then on, until falling off a cliff around age 45.

In more positive terms, **you’re much more likely than not to have a baby if you’re in your 30s**.

A study of births at different ages from the 1800s shows that the chance of having children:

  * is similar between ages 20 and 35
  * women aged 35 to 39 are 90% as likely as the youngest group
  * women aged 40-44, 62% as likely
  * Women aged 45-49, 14% as likely. 



A more modern study of artificial insemination showed that after 12 cycles (months), women under 30 had a pregnancy rate of 75%; women age 31-35, 62%; women over 35, 54%.

(Shortform note: it’s not explained what comprises the 46% of women over 35 who weren’t able to get pregnant after 12 cycles. What fraction of women will get pregnant with more cycles, and what fraction will unfortunately never be able to conceive?)

### How Weight Affects Conception

70% of the US is overweight (BMI > 25) and 35% are obese (BMI > 30).

Obese women are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to have pregnancy complications and infant complications. Here are a few graphs illustrating the difference:

(Shoulder dystocia is an emergency occurring during labor in which the baby’s shoulder gets stuck and can’t easily come out behind the pubic bone.)

Overweight women who are neither obese nor of normal weight have risk profiles somewhere in between.

### Conception and the Ovulation Cycle

The ovulation cycle lasts 28 days on average. Starting from Day 1, when the period starts, the first 14 days are gearing up for ovulation. On Day 14, the egg is released and travels through the Fallopian tube toward the uterus. This journey takes around 6 days. If the egg is fertilized, it implants in the uterus around Day 23.

Critically, the egg survives only an average of 24 hours, well before it makes it to the uterus. Therefore sperm must be waiting around in the Fallopian tube, right as the egg is released.

Luckily, sperm live up to 5 days in the Fallopian tube. Therefore, **the best chance of conception happens the day before or the day of ovulation**. Conception can still happen up to 5 days before ovulation, with lower chances.

Here’s a graph of chances of conception depending on day of ovulation cycle, in women aged 26-35:

**Myth:** It’s best to have sex every other day, so you can hit at least one of the two best days and save up your sperm.

**Reality:** Chances of conception are nearly identical whether you have sex once, twice, three times, or more in the 6-day window before ovulation. **The critical thing is to hit the day of ovulation or the day before.**

Fun fact: Out of say ~500 million sperm in an ejaculation, only ~200 will reach the egg and have a chance of fertilization.

### Conception and Previous Contraception Use

If you’ve previously used long-term contraception like the pill or IUDs, it may take time to get back on normal ovulation cycles. Your earlier cycles may be longer and may not lead to ovulation. But don’t worry - your previous use of contraception has no long-term effects on fertility.

For women who’ve taken the pill:

  * The first month off the pill, 60% have a normal cycle. 9 months after stopping, nearly everyone returns to a normal cycle. 
  * Women going off the pill were less likely to get pregnant in the first 3 months, but just as likely to get pregnant within a year as women who didn’t take the pill.
  * The duration of pill usage has no effect on fertility or time to return to normal cycles.



Women who used IUDs took a month longer to get pregnant than women who stopped using the pill, but otherwise had the same rates of conception.

### Detecting Ovulation

There are a few ways of detecting ovulation.

#### Temperature Charting

Here’s how your body temperature changes in your cycle

  * In the first half of your period cycle, your temperature will be low, usually below 98 degrees F. 
  * **The day after ovulation, it’ll increase by 0.5 degree or more.**
  * If you don’t get pregnant, body temperature will drop the day your period starts; if you do get pregnant, it’ll remain elevated.



To track temperatures accurately, check your temperature when you wake up, before you get out of bed and move around. Travel, jetlag, and fevers can affect this.

Temperature charting accurately identifies the day of ovulation 30% of the time, and 30% of the time it mistakenly points to the day before ovulation. So the odds are decent with this relatively simple method.

**The downside to temperature charting is that it only detects _after_ ovulation has occurred** \- so it’s more useful to track your cycle for conceiving in future cycles, not this one.

#### Cervical Mucus

Right before you ovulate, your cervical mucus will be stretchy like egg whites (this consistency is better for sperm to swim through). **The day when it transitions to this form is a good day to try conceiving.**

To study your cervical mucus, reach into your vagina and run your finger around the cervix.

The benefit of tracking cervical mucus is you can detect the day of ovulation in your current cycle, vs temperature charting which detects changes only after. The drawback is that semen can look like mucus, so it’s more accurate a day after sex.

This method has an accuracy rate in about 50%. Some women combine this and temperature charting for a more accurate picture.

#### Ovulation Detection Sticks

These pee sticks detect luteinizing hormone, which peaks the day before ovulation.

The accuracy of ovulation sticks is strong - it identifies the day of ovulation 100% of the time. Of women randomly given access to ovulation detection sticks, 23% got pregnant within 2 months, vs 15% who didn’t have them.

The downside of ovulation sticks is cost - they run about $30 per month.

### Chapter 3: The Two-Week Wait

After you ovulate and try to conceive, it takes about 2 weeks to see if you have your period. What do you do in this time - namely, can you drink alcohol or caffeine, and eat deli meats? (more on these later)

Oster argues that embryos are more resilient than you might think - because the early embryo is a mass of pluripotent cells, any cells that are killed can be replaced by another cell. But there’s a limit - kill too many cells and the embryo will fail to develop.

**If you want to stay on the cautionary side, then pretend you’re pregnant in the 2 weeks. Then on the day you find out you’re not pregnant, you can party.**

Home pregnancy kits cost ~$5 per test and measure hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), which is produced by the implanted embryo (to maintain the corpus luteum in the ovaries, which then secretes progesterone). With these kits, the false negative rate is high - only 50% of pregnancies are detected 4 days before a missed period. But the false positive rate is very low - they are very unlikely to tell you you’re pregnant when you’re not.

**One downside to early detection is that pregnancy loss is very common** \- as many as 50% of fertilized eggs don’t result in pregnancy. Normally this ends in what appears to be a heavy period. With early detection kits, you might learn you’re pregnant, only to lose it, which can be very disappointing. Some people may just choose not to detect early and just wait for their period.

Fun fact: hCG used to be detected by injecting urine into infantile mice or rabbits that were then dissected. If the urine contained hCG, the animals would ovulate. Some organizations now collect urine from pregnant women to extract hCG for fertility treatment.
