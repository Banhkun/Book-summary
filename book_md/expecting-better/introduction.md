## Introduction

Emily Oster is a Harvard-trained economist at Brown University. When she was pregnant, she was dismayed at the quality of pregnancy information. First, clinicians and other mothers seemed to have contradictory ironclad rules for pregnancy. Secondly, and even worse, it wasn’t clear what evidence supported their beliefs, despite their strength of conviction!

For Oster, getting pregnancy advice felt like having a realtor who said that some people don’t like houses with backyards, so they wouldn’t have any houses with backyards on their showing list. Then, when Oster said she actually did like backyards, the realtor would say, “no, you actually don’t. This is the rule.” Obviously this sounds ridiculous - but this is the usual state of pregnancy advice.

Unwilling to take common advice at face value, Oster decided to peruse the medical literature for real data to some of her questions. Was drinking a glass of red wine really all that bad? What’s the best way to arrange for delivery? To her dismay, she found a vast range of study quality (usually varying in sample size and how well the study controlled for confounding factors). But she noticed trends and suggestive data that she’s sharing in this book.

_Expecting Better_ is not generally meant as a prescriptive guide. Rather, just as Oster trains her economics students, you should 1) gather the right data about a decision, 2) weigh your personal costs and benefits, 3) make your personal decision based on all the information you have.

(Shortform note: in this summary, we’ll use “you” as though we’re speaking to the mother.)
