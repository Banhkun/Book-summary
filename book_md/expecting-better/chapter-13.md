## Chapter 13: Pharmaceuticals while Pregnant

The baby is exposed to most drugs the mother takes, except for large molecules (e.g. heparin) and drugs that get stuck in the placenta (e.g. buprenorphine).

Drug safety is hard to test in pregnant mothers because of ethical concerns - if there is risk of damage, then exposing a fraction of mothers to a drug seems unspeakable. Furthermore, medicine has a traumatic memory from the use of anti-nausea drug thalidomide in the 1950s, leading to thousands of infants with birth defects and thousands of deaths.

Therefore, **many drugs that are _probably_ safe for pregnant women don’t get an explicit clearance from the FDA**.

The FDA classifies drugs into five categories (A B C D X), based on strength of evidence on safety:

**Category A**

  * **Definition:** Well-controlled human studies show no risk to fetus in any trimester.
  * Examples
    * Folic acid
    * Levothyroxine (hypothyroidism)



**Category B**

  * **Definition:** No well-controlled human studies and animal studies have shown risk to a fetus, OR animal studies show risk but well-controlled human studies show no risk.
  * Includes common substances that are unethical to experiment with by withholding from a control group, like vitamins.
  * Examples:
    * Macrobid/nitrofurantoin (antibiotic)
    * Amoxicillin (antibiotic)
    * Metformin (diabetes)
    * Tylenol/acetaminophen
    * Claritin
    * Benadryl
    * Pepcid AC (heartburn)



**Category C**

  * **Definition:** No well-controlled human studies. Either animal studies have shown problems for the fetus, OR there have been no animal studies.
  * The broadest category - includes both drugs that show no problems in small animal and human studies, and drugs that show damage in animal studies.
  * Examples:
    * Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic)
    * Gabapentin (epilepsy, nerve pain)
    * Vicodin/hydrocodone (pain)
    * Ambien (insomnia)
    * Prilosec (heartburn)
    * Ibuprofen (pain)



**Category D**

  * **Definition:** Evidence of harm to fetus in human studies, but benefits may outweigh risks in certain situations.
  * Once a drug falls in this bucket, it’s hard to get out given how difficult it is to prescribe and get new studies.
  * Examples:
    * Paxil/paroxetine (depression)
    * Lorazepam (anxiety)
    * Prinivil/lisinopril (hypertension)
    * Tetracycline (antibiotic, acne)
    * Aspirin



**Category X**

  * **Definition:** Should not be taken during pregnancy under _any_ circumstances.
  * Also includes drugs that have no purpose during pregnancy, like oral contraceptives
  * Examples:
    * Accutane/isotretinoin (acne)
    * Leflunomide (arthritis)
    * Warfarin (anticoagulant)
    * Lipitor/atorvastatin, Zocor/simvastatin (high cholesterol)
    * Finasteride (enlarged prostate)
