## Chapter 21: The Aftermath

The baby’s out! Now there are just a few more actions to know about.

**Delayed Cord Clamping**

  * Waiting a few minutes to cut the cord allows the baby to reabsorb some blood from the placenta. 
  * This is useful for premature birth, halving the need for blood transfusions for anemia and hypotension.
  * The risks are mixed for full-term babies, as they get higher iron levels but also risk jaundice.



**Vitamin K Shots**

  * They’re meant to reduce bleeding disorders. 
  * These have been standard since the 1960s.
  * Some controversy has arisen about its linkage to childhood cancer, but these findings were not replicated. Common sense suggests that if vitamin K did cause cancer, cancer rates should have increased in the 1960s when they became standard.



**Antibiotics in the Eye**

  * Gonorrhea or chlamydia exposure to the baby during birth can lead to blindness.
  * It’s mandatory in most states even if you don’t have STDs. But there’s no real downside to them.



**Cord-Blood Storage**

  * The idea is stem cells from cord blood can be useful for treatment.
  * Families with severe rare blood disorders may find this useful.
  * Putatively this is useful for bone marrow transplants for leukemia. However, keep in mind a child cannot use her own cord blood; she must use a sibling’s. The chance of using banked cord blood is 1 in 20,000.
  * Another sales pitch is that cord blood could be used for regenerative medicine in the future. Oster argues that by that point, we’ll probably have better stem cell technologies in general, including techniques to derive stem cells from ordinary cells.
  * Consider banking in a public blood bank instead to help a stranger out.
