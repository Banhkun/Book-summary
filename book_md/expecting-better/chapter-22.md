## Chapter 22: Home Birth

<1% of women in the US have a home birth. If you’re high risk (breech, twins, gestational diabetes), you’ll probably need a hospital birth, as **it’ll be hard to find a midwife to attend a risky birth**.

Home birth supporters will say that delivering at home is how it’s been traditionally done. It’s more comfortable, and you don’t risk the hospital forcing you to get a treatment you don’t want. Studies also show that births at home show fewer vaginal tears and lower infection rates.

In contrast, hospitals are useful for interventions - emergency C-sections, Pitocin to reduce hemorrhage, epidurals, doctors who have seen plenty of unique birth situations before.

**Research is mixed on infant death and outcomes on home birth vs hospital birth.**

Up to a third of mothers planning first-time home births change their mind during labor and deliver in the hospital. This abrupt transition will probably be more disruptive than starting in the hospital.

If you do choose home birth, Oster suggests working with a **certified nurse-midwife** , who will have the most training and certification. Certified professional midwives don’t have a nursing degree, and direct entry midwives don’t have a college degree and no license.

A good compromise - your hospital may have a more comfortable birthing center, a comfier room with a tub, a bigger bed, and less fetal monitoring.
