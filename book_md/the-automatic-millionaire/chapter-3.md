## Chapter 3: Investment Options for Your Retirement Account

Once you’ve chosen your retirement account, you’ll need to select investment options that determine how your money will grow—retirement accounts can only earn interest on and grow your money if that money is invested into stocks and bonds. The firms you choose for your IRA or self-employment needs will build your investment portfolio based on the investment options you select. As we’ll explore in this chapter, these options will cover how long you intend to invest your money and how aggressively you want to invest.

In this chapter, we’ll explain how to balance your investments for maximum returns—**read this before you fill out your retirement plans** to ensure you pick the most suitable options for your situation.

### How to Diversify Your Investments

Bach explains that to ensure that you get the best return from your retirement plan, you need to diversify your investments—this means that you need to invest your money in a combination of cash, bonds, and stocks. **The more diversified your investments, the safer your money** —stocks may lose their value, but if your money is diversified, the overall value of your plan will stay consistent. However, the safer your investments, the less likely you are to make money on your plan.

> **What Does It Mean for an Investment to Be “Safe”?**
> 
> Bach explains that you need to diversify your investments to ensure that your money is safe, but he doesn’t elaborate on why some investment options are “safer” than others. We’ll therefore explain the difference between “safe” and “aggressive” investments:
> 
>   * **Safer investments** (cash and bonds) make less money because they are based on short-term investments with minimal risk. They are less risky because the value of cash and bonds don’t change according to the whims of the stock market—their value remains stable.
> 
>   * **Growth investments** (stocks equate to a share of ownership in a company) create more money but are also susceptible to income fluctuations that impact the value of your investment. A company’s value fluctuates according to how well it’s performing and the economy in general. Therefore, stocks are ranked by how safe they are, or in other words, how likely the company is to grow in value.
> 
>   * **The riskier the investment, the more aggressive it is**. For example, an investment in an established company such as Netflix is classed as a _growth investment_ because the company is expected to continue to perform well. However, if you invest in an unknown start-up based on the assumption that it will eventually become as valuable as Google, this is classed as an _aggressive growth investment_ : If your prediction is right, your shares in the company will be worth a lot more than what you initially invested. But, if the company fails, your investment will lose value.

#### How to Change Your Diversification Strategy Over Time

Further, Bach argues that your diversification strategy needs to change over time to reflect your age and your income goals—the younger you are, the more you can afford to take risks with your money because you have more time on your side. However, the closer you get to retirement age, the more you need to play it safe and protect your money.

The table below illustrates the recommended balance for each age group to invest their retirement money.

**Order of Risk** | **Your Age and How Much to Invest in Each Option**  
---|---  
(Safest first)  | **Under 30** | **30-50** | **50-60** | **60 Plus**  
**Cash** | 5-10%  | 5-10%  | 5-10%  | 10-15%   
**Bonds** | 5-15%  | 15-25%  | 20-30%  | 25-35%   
**Growth & Income Investments** | 30-40%  | 35-45%  | 30-40%  | 30-40%   
**Growth** | 40-50%  | 25-35%  | 15-25%  | 10-20%   
**Aggressive Growth Investments** | 5-10%  | 5-10%  | 0-5%  | 0-5%   
  
> **Further Advice for Diversifying Your Investment Portfolio**
> 
> If you’re looking to learn more about applying Bach’s suggestions and diversifying your investments, Sethi provides a lot more information in _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ about how stocks are classified and what should be included in a diverse investment portfolio. According to Sethi, stocks are categorized by the amount current shareholders are investing into the company:
> 
>   * Large-Cap: More than $10 billion
> 
>   * Mid-Cap: $1-5 billion
> 
>   * Small-Cap: Less than $1 billion
> 
> 

> 
> In addition, he explains that stocks fall under the following categories:
> 
>   * International: Stocks from companies in other countries
> 
>   * Growth: Stocks expected to grow in value
> 
>   * Value: Stocks that are low priced compared to their actual value
> 
> 

> 
> Sethi suggests that you invest in each of the six types of stocks, as well as bonds, to create a diversified investment portfolio. In contrast to Bach, **Sethi suggests you avoid investing in cash as it will lose value over time due to inflation.**
> 
> As a result, his advice for asset allocation by age differs slightly from Bach’s recommendation:
> 
>   * Age 35-45: 10% bonds and 90% stocks
> 
>   * Age 55: 31% bonds and 69% stocks
> 
>   * Age 65: 47% bonds and 53% stocks
> 
> 

> 
> **Socially Responsible Investing**
> 
> When you invest in stocks, you buy a share of a company—**this share supports the company’s growth**. For this reason, it’s important to consider who your growth and aggressive growth investments really support. Many investors actively avoid investing in companies that conflict with their values—for example, they might avoid investing in a tobacco or firearm company because they don’t want to _support_ those industries.
> 
> As well as looking at what investments you want to avoid, **consider choosing to invest in industries that you _want_ to support**—this type of investment is called socially responsible investing (SRI). When you use this strategy, you choose investments that align with your values—you benefit causes you care about while investing in your future.

### How to Manage Your Investments

If you don’t feel comfortable managing these combinations, Bach suggests that you invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded mutual funds (ETFs) as they automatically manage and diversify your money for you based on your requirements (how much risk you’re willing to take). They’re also easy to use. Alternatively, employee and individual retirement plans offer “asset allocation funds” or “balanced funds”—these funds also manage your combinations for you.

In addition, many employee and individual retirement plans manage these diversified combinations for you based on your age and the date you expect to retire—they are commonly referred to as “**targeted-date funds** ”. These plans automatically balance your investments to reduce risks the closer you get to retirement age. The main difference with these plans is how they continue to be managed once you reach your retirement date. There are two options:

  * **Plans that take you _through_ retirement**: These plans are managed to produce ongoing income for a projected number of years after you retire. Bach suggests you use this option if you plan to retire young (early sixties).
  * **Plans that take you _to_ retirement**: These plans tend to concentrate solely on investments in cash and bonds by the time you reach retirement. Bach suggests you use this option if you plan to retire in your seventies or eighties.



> **What You Need to Know About Mutual Funds, ETFs, and Targeted-Date Funds**
> 
> Mutual funds, ETFs, and targeted-date funds are popular choices thanks to the way they conveniently manage your retirement investments for you. However, while Bach mentions the benefits of each fund, he doesn’t include important information you need to consider before you make your decision:
> 
> **Mutual Funds**
> 
>   * The fees you’re charged vary quite significantly depending on which fund you choose—the higher the fee, the less you earn on your investments.
> 
>   * Your results depend on how efficiently the _people_ in charge manage your fund.
> 
>   * You may be subjected to additional tax payments depending on how your fund is managed.
> 
> 

> 
> **ETFS**
> 
>   * Your investments may be limited to large-cap stocks (companies with over $10 billion worth of investments)—this reduces the diversity of your investment portfolio.
> 
>   * You’re more likely to pay higher fees and earn less than if you invest directly into stocks.
> 
>   * The tax rules vary according to what type of investment options you choose so you’ll need to ensure that you’re well informed before you sign up.
> 
> 

> 
> **Targeted-Date Funds**
> 
> While various banks and brokerages might offer a retirement plan for a specific year, each plan will consist of different investments and will produce different results depending on the diversity ratio used. For example, you may have a 2050 plan that earns significantly less than your friend’s 2050 plan because both plans follow different investment ratios.
> 
> In addition, each fund will have different fees that impact the value of your earnings. So, though targeted funds are a convenient way to set up your retirement plan, you’ll benefit more if you shop around and compare the way the different funds are managed.
> 
> Here’s some additional information about each type of targeted-date fund:
> 
> **Plans that take you _through_ retirement**: Your investments continue to adjust and rebalance throughout your retirement. This means that your investments are likely to grow during the early years of your retirement. Growth investments do come with risks—if you don’t have additional income to fall back on, this plan may be too risky for you.
> 
> **Plans that take you _to_ retirement: **Once you reach your retirement date, the diversity of your portfolio remains static. This means that your investment options are limited from the date of your retirement. While this plan limits the growth of your investments after your retirement date, it is the safest option if you don’t have additional income to rely on.

##### Your Company’s Stock Options

If you work for a publicly-traded company and sign up for a 401(k) with them, your plan may offer you options to invest in your company’s stock. Bach urges you to consider your company’s stock as an aggressive growth investment: **You should not invest more than 5-25% of your retirement money into your company’s stock** , no matter how successful and stable they are. This is because you’ll reduce your diversification and increase your risk if you invest too much—if your company fails, you could lose your investment!

(Shortform note: If you work for a stable, established company, you may question why Bach urges you to consider all company stocks as aggressive growth investments. However, all company stocks are susceptible to unexpected fluctuations. For further clarification, refer to _The Smartest Guys in the Room_ —this book offers a detailed explanation of how established companies can fail, create losses for shareholders, and wipe out employee retirement accounts.)

#### Financial Advisors

If you choose to work with a financial advisor, specify that you would like to look at targeted-date funds, asset allocation funds, and balanced fund options.

> **Do You Need a Financial Advisor?**
> 
> Bach suggests that you work with a financial advisor if you don’t feel comfortable managing your investment options—however, his suggestions indicate that you can achieve the results you want without additional help.
> 
> According to Burton Malkiel, author of _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ , you shouldn’t need to rely on a financial advisor to actively manage your investments. He argues that fund managers rarely beat the average market return over the long term, regardless of their track record. However, if you decide to use a financial advisor, Malkiel advises that you choose one with:
> 
>   * **A low expense ratio** —the higher the expenses, the more of your investments go towards paying your advisor.
> 
>   * **A low turnover rate** —the higher your turnover rate, the more tax you have to pay.
>
