## Chapter 5: Clear Your Debts

Now that you’re prepared for emergencies, turn your focus to getting out of debt. Like most Americans, you’re probably carrying some debt—Bach claims that the average American family owes $8,400 in credit card debt, and, in total, **Americans owe approximately half a trillion dollars in credit card debt**. Why is this? Bach claims it’s because people are more focused on _looking rich_ than they are on actually _being rich_. In other words, they rely on credit to maintain the illusion of a rich lifestyle while they risk their financial security.

(Shortform note: Bach’s conclusion that people are in debt because they’re more focused on looking rich is a little reductive. A recent survey revealed that 37% of low-income and middle-income households rely on their credit cards to cover basic living expenses such as groceries and utilities. Further, these people tend to work longer hours or take on a second job just to cover their debts and survive.)

Further, **the average American only pays the minimum balance due every month** —for $8,400 charged at 18%, it will cost them $20,615 over the course of 30 years to pay off the balance, and that’s based on the assumption that they pay regularly and don’t add further debt to the balance.

(Shortform note: So many Americans get stuck in the debt trap that Bach describes because of the way they’re targeted by credit card companies. Credit card companies profit from interest payments and penalty fees: Every time you fail to pay your balance off in full, they make a profit. Unfortunately, this business model encourages some disreputable companies to target vulnerable consumers—they offer low-interest rates to entice low-income earners and include _hidden fees_ to maximize their profits.)

Bach argues that, if you’re in debt, **you should prioritize clearing the amount before you build your savings account**. This is because _the interest you earn in your savings account is far less than the interest you pay towards your debts_. To clarify, if you owe $2,000 in credit card debt and just make the minimum monthly payments, it will take you more than 18 years, and a total of $4,600, to pay off your balance. The same $2,000 held in a savings account earning 1% will only total $2,392.29 after 18 years. Therefore, **you’ll save far more money if you clear your debts first**. However, Bach does suggest that you set aside one month’s worth of savings before you focus on clearing your debts.

(Shortform note: It’s true that clearing debts before you build your safety net will save you more money in the long term. However, if your job situation is insecure, some financial experts advise that you should prioritize your savings before you clear your debts. This way, you’ll avoid getting into further debt if you do lose your job—you won’t have to rely on your credit cards to survive because you’ll have savings to fall back on.)

> **Are You Making Excuses for Your Debts?**
> 
> Prioritizing getting out of debt in the way Bach describes seems like a no-brainer: Many of us dream of having a debt-free existence. So, why is it that so many people _don’t_ prioritize clearing debt—and, in fact, allow it to grow?
> 
> Bach doesn’t explore this question in detail; but, according to Sethi, people allow their debts to get out of control because they often find ways to _justify remaining in debt_. They:
> 
>   * Accept that being in debt is “normal” and justify it by comparing their debts to the debts that their friends and family owe
> 
>   * Feel defeated by the size of their debts—their debts are so huge that they assume that they’ll never be able to pay them off so they don’t bother trying
> 
>   * Blame credit card companies for “preying” on them instead of taking responsibility for their decisions
> 
> 

> 
> Try and stay mindful of the excuses you use to overlook your debts throughout the rest of this chapter. Ultimately, no matter what excuses you tell yourself, getting out of debt is both possible and a good idea.

### Your Debt-Clearing Plan

In this section, we’ll learn how to make a plan for clearing your debts and rebalance your automated payment plans to pay them off as quickly as you can. We’ve broken the process down into four distinct steps: total up your balances and interest, make commitments, reduce your payments, and prioritize your debts.

(Shortform note: Sethi’s debt-clearance plan differs from Bach’s method and provides some contradictory advice—we’ll compare Sethi’s process to Bach’s throughout each of the four steps.)

#### Step 1: Total Up Your Balances and Interest

Bach states that if you’re currently in debt, you’ll need to total up the balances you owe and the amount of interest you’re paying on top of this balance. Ask yourself the following questions:

  * How many credit cards do you (including your dependents) have?
  * What is your current outstanding balance in total?
  * What is the average interest rate you’re paying on these balances?



(Shortform note: Sethi advises that, instead of trying to calculate your debt yourself, you should call up your credit companies to find out how much debt you owe, how much interest you’re paying, and the minimum monthly payment. He claims that many people are unaware of exactly how much debt they’re in, so they need to speak to their debtors before they can come up with a plan to clear their debts.)

#### Step 2: Make Commitments

Next, Bach recommends committing to two principles:

  * **Don’t buy things you can’t afford** (property is the only exception as it tends to appreciate in value). 
  * **Refuse to use credit cards** —cancel them and remove the temptation to use them.



(Shortform note: Both Bach and Sethi advise that you don’t buy things you can’t afford. However, they differ on what methods you should use to pay for what you buy. In contrast to Bach, Sethi suggests that you **keep your credit cards, as they’ll improve your credit history** —make use of them, but always pay your balance off in full. This way, you show lenders you can be trusted to pay back the money you borrow. He argues that this is one of the most important things you can do to improve your credit score and your financial situation.)

#### Step 3: Reduce Your Payments

Next, Bach says it’s time to try to reduce your debt payments:

  * **Contact your credit card company** and ask if they can lower the rate of interest you’re paying (tell them you’re thinking about moving your balance to a company that offers a lower interest rate).
  * **Consolidate all of your payments** —if you have multiple debts, consider moving them all to a single low-interest account (check Bankrate for the latest offers).
  * **Automate your payments** to avoid paying late fees or penalties



(Shortform note: In addition to consolidating and automating your payments, Sethi argues that you should negotiate lower interest rates regardless of **whether you’re in debt or not**. This will reduce your chances of getting in debt if you ever fail to pay off your balance.)

#### Step 4: Prioritize Your Debts __

Instead of consolidating your payments, you could choose to pay off your debts one by one. To determine the most cost-effective way to pay off your debts, Bach suggests dividing the balance of each debt by the minimum payment required—this will show you the number of payments you need to make to pay off the debt.

  * For example, you have two debts with a balance of $1,000. The minimum payment for the first debt is $10 so it would take 100 payments to clear this. The minimum payment for the second card is $20 so it would take 50 payments to clear this.



Next, **rank your debts so that the lowest number of payments is on top**. So, continuing with the previous example, the debt that requires 50 payments will be on top—this is the debt you will clear first. Prioritize paying off this debt as much as possible while you continue to pay the minimum balance for your remaining debts. Once you’ve cleared this, keep working down your list in this way until you’ve cleared all of your debts.

(Shortform note: Sethi also suggests that you commit to paying off one card at a time while using automated payments to pay the minimum balance for the rest of the debts. However, he argues that you have two options for how to do this: prioritize the cards with the highest interest, or use Dave Ramsey’s “snowball method” to prioritize paying off cards with the lowest balance (regardless of the interest they charge). He advises that you should plan to make more aggressive payments until you clear your debts—prioritize your expenses until your debts are cleared. It’s worth making a few sacrifices for the long-term savings you’ll make.)

### Balance Your Investments

Bach suggests that you continue to invest in your retirement even while you clear your debts. He notes that if you wait until your debts are paid off before you start saving, you’ll get used to _not_ saving. On the other hand, if you keep investing in your retirement accounts, he says that the progress you make will motivate you to clear your debts so that you can invest even more towards your future wealth.

(Shortform note: Bach suggests that you continue to fund your retirement account so that you can _make financial progress_. However, Sethi argues there’s another reason for doing this: You can make use of your ever-growing retirement account when you’re faced with a financial emergency. Sethi suggests that, if you end up with unexpected expenses and your only option is to use your credit card, you should consider withdrawing money from your retirement account instead. While this will incur losses on your retirement earnings, you’ll still save more than if you increase your existing credit card balance—and the exorbitant interest rates that come with it.)
