## Exercise: Plan How to Clear Your Debts

Debt is an obstacle to wealth. Prioritize clearing your debts so that you can redirect your money towards saving for your future.

* * *

Total up your debts: What outstanding balances do you owe and how much interest are you paying for each balance?

List the minimum monthly payment for each of your debts.

For each of your debts, divide the balance amount by the minimum payment amount—this will show you the number of payments you need to make to pay off the debt.

Rank your payments so that the lowest number of payments is on top—this list will prioritize the order in which you clear your debts.
