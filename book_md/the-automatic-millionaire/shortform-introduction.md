### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Crown Business, Penguin Random House LLC

The book was first published in 2003. This guide is for the 2016 edition, which includes new and updated information on topics such as financial apps and taxes.

### The Book’s Context

#### The Book’s Impact

Within weeks of its publication, the first edition of _The Automatic Millionaire_ had ranked as the bestselling title on _The New York Times, The Wall Street_ _Journal, USA Today,_ and _BusinessWeek._

Bach’s thousands of media appearances—including features on _NBC’s Today Show_ and _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ —combined with profiles in many major publications, including _The New York Times_ , _People_ , and _The Wall Street Journal_ , greatly contributed to the book’s success. His frequent media exposure, coupled with powerful endorsements, enabled Bach to inspire millions of people, build trust with American audiences, and quickly spread his **simple and actionable wealth strategies**.

As a result of his popularity with American audiences, _The Automatic Millionaire_ spent 31 weeks on the _New York Times_ bestseller list and sold over 1.5 million copies. It’s since been translated into over 12 languages.

Bach continues to help people of all ages and income levels make sense of their finances, and he enjoys enormous success: 12 of his books have become _Wall Street Journal_ bestsellers, and he’s had 10 consecutive books appear on the _New York Times_ bestsellers list.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Many reviewers agree that, while _The Automatic Millionaire_ doesn’t include any new ideas about personal finances, Bach’s practical and simple presentation of financial concepts makes the steps easy to understand and follow. Reviewers generally regard the book as an encouraging and motivating resource for beginners, and many reviewers gift it to teenagers to foster financial awareness.

However, the simplicity of the book also puts many reviewers off—some have remarked that Bach writes in a “cheesy” and “patronizing” way and over-explains the concepts. These reviewers feel that the book’s length doesn’t justify the material covered.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

There are nine chapters in this book. The first and last chapters summarize the material within the book. The remaining chapters focus on how you can automate your finances in the following areas: cutting your expenses, funding your retirement, investing your money, saving for emergencies, buying a home outright, clearing your debts, and donating your money to good causes.

Strangely, Bach provides advice on how to tackle your debts in his seventh chapter, _after_ he encourages you to buy a home. Some reviewers have questioned the logic behind his decision since buying a home _before_ you clear your debts would not only incur additional debt but also increase your financial worries.

Bach offers simple explanations throughout his book and provides real-life examples of successful “automatic millionaires” to motivate you, as well as links to resources so that you can take immediate action on his suggestions.

### Our Approach in This Guide

This guide explores Bach’s key ideas about automating your personal finances and building wealth, but we’ve condensed and reorganized the concepts to flow in a more logical sequence. For instance, we’ve reordered the chapters to cover debt clearance _before_ we explain how to buy a home.

We also compare and contrast Bach’s process with those of other popular financial authors like Ramit Sethi (_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_) and Scott Pape (_The Barefoot Investor_). Furthermore, we discuss psychological research underlying _why_ people fail to prepare for their financial futures, possible caveats to Bach’s recommendations, and updated resources.
