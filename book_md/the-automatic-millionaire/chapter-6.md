## Chapter 6: Own Your Home Outright

Once you’ve cleared your debts, you can start thinking about bigger savings goals such as buying a house. This is important because, according to Bach, you’re more likely to build long-term wealth if you own your own home and accelerate your mortgage payments.

(Shortform note: Bach believes that renters are less able to build wealth because they’re funneling the majority of their money towards their rental expenses. However, research shows that renters who invest their money into stocks can build more wealth than homeowners. This is because your money earns more interest from stocks than it does from your home.)

In this chapter, we’ll first explore the benefits of owning your own home. Then, we’ll cover how you can get on the property ladder and automate your payments to pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible.

### The Benefits of Owning a Home

According to Bach, the average American renter has a net worth of less than $4,000. In contrast, homeowners have an average net worth of $140,000. In other words, **homeowners are more than 35 times richer than renters.** This is because homeowners end up spending less money than renters in the long run. Let’s say you rent an apartment at $1,500 a month over 30 years—at the end of this period you’ll have spent $540,000 and have to _continue_ to pay rent. On the other hand, if you buy a house and you pay $1,500 on your mortgage for 30 years, at the end of this period you’ll own your own home (no more payments) and be free of debt.

In addition, Bach notes buying a home will provide financial security in the form of equity—over the long term, the value of real estate investments always increases (the average annual return since 1968 is 5.3%).

> **The Disadvantages of Owning a Home**
> 
> In contrast to Bach, Sethi argues that **you shouldn’t think of your home as an investment** as the expenses involved will make it difficult for you to make any money from it. He claims that:
> 
>   * Your costs will be higher than they are when you rent because you’ll be responsible for insurance, property taxes, and maintenance.
> 
>   * You’ll only gain an average of 0.6% a year on this asset compared to an average annual return of 8% on the stock market.
> 
>   * You’ll end up paying additional taxes and fees when you sell your home.
> 
>   * You’ll miss out on the amenities and perks offered by rentals in the same price range as it works out far more expensive to buy properties in convenient areas (close to public transport, local schools and shops, and so on) than it does to rent them.
> 
> 

> 
> So, while Sethi doesn’t discourage you from buying a home, he does insist that it’s not for everyone—consider whether you’re happy with the costs (not just financial) involved in owning your own home before you take the leap.

Bach suggests you follow three steps to buy a house: pay your down payment, choose the right mortgage payment plan, and accelerate your mortgage payments. Let’s explore each in detail.

### Step 1: Pay Your Down Payment

The main reason why people don’t buy a home is the belief that they need to pay thousands of dollars upfront to get a mortgage. Bach argues that these people are wrong—there are many programs designed to enable first-time homebuyers to finance up to 100% of the downpayment for the home they want to purchase. These programs help renters come up with a down payment so that they have more of a chance to apply for a mortgage. Bach suggests that you research housing finance agencies if you need help putting together a down payment.

> **Save for Your Down Payment**
> 
> Bach doesn’t provide information regarding _why_ companies would offer to provide you with a loan for a deposit, and it’s unclear whether these loans would incur additional costs or have strings attached—such as whether you’ll be restricted to buy specific types of houses or limited by location.
> 
> In addition to researching the options he mentions and seeking advice from the resources listed above, you could also start saving for your down payment while you search for a home to buy. The more you save, the more options you’ll have when it comes to choosing and buying your own home.
> 
> Pape (_The Barefoot Investor_) suggests the following ways to save for a down payment while you’re renting:
> 
>   * Set aside 20% of your monthly income.
> 
>   * Consider living on a single wage (if you have a partner) and set aside the rest.
> 
>   * Cut your rental expenses by living somewhere cheaper.
> 
>   * Earn extra income by taking on freelance work and set aside all of this income.
> 
> 

> 
> Finally, calculate how long it will take you to save for your chosen property if you funnel all of these savings and extra income into your down payment fund.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Mortgage Payment Plan

Bach claims that you should be able to spend between 29-41% of your _gross income_ on housing expenses—which include your mortgage, taxes, and insurance. Aim for the minimum if you still have debts to clear and more if you don’t have any debts to pay off. For example, if your salary is $40,000 a year, you can afford to pay from $11,600 a year ($967 a month) to $16,400 a year ($1,367 a month) towards all of your housing expenses.

(Shortform note: In addition to Bach’s suggestions, Pape claims that it’s crucial to also factor lifestyle changes into your housing expenses before you decide to buy a house. For example, if you have children, your expenses will increase significantly—you’ll either have to pay for childcare or reduce your working hours to care for the children, and this will impact your ability to keep up with mortgage payments.)

Bach also suggests that you research mortgage providers to compare interest rates and figure out how much you can afford to spend on a home.

> **Mortgage Resources and Advice**
> 
> While Bach recommends some mortgage rate resources in the book, many of these are now out of date. The following list of recommended mortgage loan providers (2021) provides the latest expert recommendations:
> 
>   * Quicken Loans
> 
>   * SoFi
> 
>   * LoanDepot
> 
>   * New American Funding
> 
>   * Reali
> 
>   * Citi Mortgage
> 
>   * Guaranteed Rate
> 
>   * Chase
> 
>   * Busey Bank
> 
>   * PennyMac
> 
> 

> 
> In order to receive an accurate quote from these resources—loans are tailored to your credit history and what you can afford—you’ll find it useful to gather the following documents before beginning your research:
> 
>   * Tax returns
> 
>   * Proof of income
> 
>   * Bank statements
> 
>   * Investment statements including savings and retirement plans
> 
>   * Debt records including student loans and car loans
> 
>   * Recent utility payment statements
> 
>   * Renting history
> 
>   * Gift letters to indicate funds that have been gifted towards your home purchase
> 
>   * Child support or alimony documentation
> 
>   * Bankruptcy records
> 
> 

> 
> When you research interest rates, make sure you also factor in the following costs as they can add a substantial amount to your overall loan:
> 
>   * Application fee
> 
>   * Credit report fee—non-negotiable
> 
>   * Appraisal fee—non-negotiable
> 
>   * Underwriting fee
> 
>   * Property taxes—non-negotiable
> 
>   * Government fees—non-negotiable
> 
>   * Service fee
>

#### Pros and Cons of Popular Mortgage Plans

There are multiple mortgage payment plans to choose from and each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages:

  * **Fixed-rate mortgages:** These mortgages’ interest rates stay the same for the full loan period. (The loan period is usually either 30 years or 15 years.) This protects you from fluctuations in the economy and keeps your monthly payment consistent. However, you’re also locked into your plan for a long period, unless you remortgage. 
  * **Variable-rate mortgages:** These mortgages’ interest rates stay the same initially for an agreed period, then fluctuate based on the economy. These plans tend to offer the lowest initial interest rates, making your initial mortgage payments lower. However, if interest rates increase following your initial fixed-rate period, you may struggle to make your payments.



> **Other Common Mortgage Plans**
> 
> Bach’s advice in this section is somewhat minimalist. In addition to the fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages that Bach explores, there are six other common mortgage types that may interest you and better fit your financial situation:
> 
>   * **Conventional mortgages** : For primary or secondary homes and investment properties. Interest rates are higher but the overall cost of the plan tends to be lower. Look into this if you have a strong credit history, a stable income and employment history, and the funds to put down at least 3% as a down payment for the home you want.
> 
>   * **Government-insured mortgages** : For borrowers who haven’t saved for a down payment, or meet certain income limits. Look into this if you’re worried about your credit history and your ability to put down a down payment.
> 
>   * **Jumbo mortgages** : For homes in expensive locations. Interest rates tend to be lower than they are for conventional loans because you need to put down a large payment. Look into this if you have an excellent credit history, a high income, and the funds to put down at least 10-20% as a down payment for the home you want.
> 
>   * **Construction loans** : For people who want to fund the construction of their homes. Look into this if you want to build your own home and can afford to pay a high down payment.
> 
>   * **Interest-only mortgages** : For people who are happy to pay only towards their interest, not their equity, for the first few years. Look into this if you want to keep your mortgage payments low for a fixed amount of time (five to seven years) but can commit to higher payments after this period.
> 
>   * **Balloon mortgages** : For people who want a short mortgage and can afford to pay a large lump sum after a few years. Look into this if you want to commit to a short mortgage (seven to ten years) and then make a large payment at the end of the period to clear the balance.
>

### Step 3: Accelerate Your Mortgage Payments and Build Your Equity Fast

Overall, Bach recommends fixed-rate mortgages, as he believes these have the most benefits. However, he notes that a drawback of these plans is that you’ll end up paying a huge amount of interest over the full mortgage term (and at the beginning of the term, you’ll pay mostly interest, accruing minimal equity in your home).

However, he insists that you can avoid the disadvantages of fixed plans if you accelerate your mortgage payments: in other words, pay more towards your mortgage each month or year than you need to. This enables you to cut years off your payment plan, thus reducing the amount of interest you pay in total (since interest accrues exponentially over time—thus, cut the time spent paying your mortgage, and you cut the amount of interest you pay).

> **The Disadvantages of Paying Off Your Mortgage**
> 
> Bach strongly believes that paying off your mortgage will lead to more wealth so he doesn’t cover the disadvantages of taking this route. While accelerating your mortgage payments will save you thousands of dollars in interest, there are a few possible drawbacks to consider before you decide to proceed with this plan:
> 
>   * **Access to cash** : Even with accelerated payments, it will take years to pay off your mortgage. During this time, you won’t be able to access the additional money without refinancing or selling your home—make sure you have enough money in savings accounts to cover emergencies.
> 
>   * **Tax breaks** : The interest you pay on your mortgage is tax-deductible (you receive a tax rebate for these payments). Once you pay off your mortgage, you won’t be able to receive this tax benefit. If you’re a landlord, this could have a massive impact on your tax payments.
> 
>   * **Credit score** : Your credit score hinges on proof of your ability to reliably make regular payments to pay off your loans. Once you pay off your mortgage, this loan will no longer be factored into the equation used to determine your credit score and could lead to a slight drop (this impacts your ability to get a new loan).
> 
>   * **Pay-off** : The money you invest into your home would earn substantially more if you invested it into stocks (4.5% for a home and 10% for stocks based on the average rate of return for the last 90 years).
> 
> 


#### Check With Your Mortgage Provider

The longer it takes you to pay off your mortgage, the more your mortgage provider benefits—it makes a profit from all of the additional interest you pay. Some providers may penalize you for attempting to pay your mortgage earlier while others may not. Therefore, once you’ve decided on how you intend to accelerate your mortgage payments, Bach suggests that you contact your (current or prospective) mortgage provider to check whether you’ll be penalized for making extra payments.

> **Why Mortgage Providers Penalize Extra Payments**
> 
> You may be wondering why mortgage providers penalize you for attempting to clear your debts—don’t loan providers want people to pay them back as quickly as possible? To clarify this, we’ll briefly explain how mortgage providers make a profit.
> 
> There are two parts to your mortgage payments: the actual loan amount and the interest fees. Mortgage providers rely upon the interest you pay to make a profit—this profit allows them to provide more loans and make more money.
> 
> Mortgage providers are able to offer loans with low interest rates because they accumulate the profit from interest payments during the life of the loan. When you cut the length of your repayment period, you cut their profits—this forces them to offer loans with higher interest rates.
> 
> This explains why some mortgage providers penalize you for early repayments, divert the extra money you pay towards interest (their profit) instead of equity (your profit), or delay sending your money towards your mortgage (the longer they hold onto the money, the more interest they can earn by investing it). These tactics give mortgage providers a bad name, especially when they don’t explicitly state these penalties. However, when you understand the business model behind loan providers—they need interest payments so that they can provide long-term loans—it’s easy to see why they need to put such measures in place.
