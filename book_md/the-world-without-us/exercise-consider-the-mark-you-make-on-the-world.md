## Exercise: Consider the Mark You Make on the World

As Weisman makes clear, the world was here long before our arrival and will continue long after we’re gone. However, we do leave an impact, both as a species and as individuals. Reflect on what changes you’ve made to the world and to the lives around you, as well as how your individual choices may carry on into the future.

* * *

Consider the place, family, and culture into which you were born. What circumstances prior to your birth would have the most profound impact on your childhood? What events in society and your immediate family set the stage for the path you would later take in life?

Name one or more positive actions you’ve taken in your life that impacted your family, your job, or your community. How many people do you think were affected? Was anyone else’s life significantly changed by what you did?

Imagine the lives of the people around you 10 years after you’re gone. What lasting legacy will remain of your presence, whether or not people are aware? What one thing that you’ve created or changed do you think will continue the longest?
