## Exercise: Identify Your Calling

King Melchizedek tells Santiago that our calling in life is usually more clearly felt when we’re children, and we lose touch with it as we grow older. So, if you’re struggling to discover what your calling is, you may need to look back into your childhood.

* * *

What did you dream about doing when you were a child? If you can’t remember, think about when you were a teenager, or young adult. Write down anything you can think of.

Now, looking at what you wrote, write down how you could incorporate those dreams into your life. If they seem unrealistic, think about what’s at the basis of that dream that _is_ realistic. For example, if you wanted to be a “superhero,” perhaps what you really wanted was to help people.
