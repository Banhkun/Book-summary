## Chapters 2-3: What Meditation Is and Isn’t

_Mindfulness in Plain English_ deals specifically with **vipassana meditation**(or insight meditation), with roots in Theravada Buddhism.

### What Meditation Isn’t

There are other forms of meditation, and misconceptions about meditation, that this book is not dealing with:

  * Meditation is not just relaxation or euphoria. You _can_ achieve a deep and blissful relaxation (eg through _samatha_ meditation), but this is only temporary. The goal of vipassana is further: awareness. 
  * Meditation is not going into a trance. In a trance, you lose control of yourself and are susceptible to control by another party. In deep concentration, you maintain control of yourself.
  * Meditation doesn’t let you have psychic powers.
  * Meditation is not selfish. It clears the mind of selfish intent and opens the path to compassion for others. In contrast, there are plenty of bad deeds done in the name of good that are actually ego-driven (the Spanish Inquisition). 



Furthermore, meditation is not mindless, automatic, and predictable. It should be an experiment every time. If you reach a feeling of predictability in your practice, you have stagnated and gone off track. **Look at each second as though it were the first and only second in the universe.**

### What Meditation Is

Meditation involves concentration, like prayer and yogic meditation. But concentration is a means to an end - **the ultimate goal is awareness** , or **mindfulness**.

Awareness is the ability to **listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in them**.

  * So much of your thought is automatic that you cannot be said to have real control of your thinking. Up pops a stimulus (an attractive person, the smell of food, annoying party music) - and immediately you react with a feeling.
  * The first step to avoid this is to realize what you are doing as you are doing it, to stand back and quietly watch. You learn to scrutinize your own perceptual process with precision. You decouple the perception of a stimulus with the arising of thought.
  * With meditation, you examine the very process of perception. You watch the feelings that arise and the changes that occur in your own consciousness.



Awareness is attentive listening, mindful seeing. You look at what is right there in front of you, rather than getting caught up in an endless thought-stream that overrides reality.

**Awareness is being completely honest with yourself.** You watch your mind and body, notice things that are unpleasant to realize, then come to terms with it.

  * You learn not to reject things you dislike about yourself or your life - growing old, having your mistakes pointed out, your bad habits.
  * You find the roots of emotions like greed, hatred, and anger. You extinguish them.
    * If you do not have the root of hatred, no one can make you angry by pointing out your faults. Instead, you are thankful to that person for pointing out a deficiency that you can improve about yourself.



When you’re mindful you see through the “hollow shouting of your own impulses” and pierce their secret. Your urges yell at you, coaxing, beckoning, threatening, but you realize they have no power at all.

For much of your life, you have given in to your impulses out of habit. You don’t realize that they’re merely empty threats. But **once you look beyond the threat, you realize: behind your urges, it is all empty.**

### More Abstract Consequences of Mindfulness

(Shortform note: if you’re a novice meditator, the rest of this chapter may be vague. The lessons may feel more visceral once you practice further.)

The ultimate object of mindfulness is to learn to see the Buddhist truths of existence: impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness.

**Impermanence**

  * The world is forever changing. Molecules within your computer, your body, your home are shifting and slowly dissolving.
  * One day you look at yourself and you’ve aged. Aghast, you pine for lost youth. Where does this pain come from? Your own inattention - you failed to look closely at life. You assumed mistakenly that things would last forever.
  * With meditation, you perceive life as ever-flowing movement. All things are inherently transitory.



**Unsatisfactoriness**

  * Every worldly thing is in the end unsatisfying. There is no peace in clinging onto things - material possessions, sensations, emotions, health.
  * Many experiences themselves simply cause suffering - pain, sorrow, grief.
  * Even when you have pleasant experiences, they inevitably end, and you pine for more. You grasp onto the best memories, chasing them endlessly.



**Selflessness**

  * You have a deeply ingrained notion of self that is “me.” You view “me” as a thing separate from all other things. You pinch off “me” from the rest of the universe, then grieve over how lonely you feel. Doesn’t this seem self-defeating?
  * WIth meditation, you chip away at the concept of “me” to see your place in human society. In this way, you become tied to everyone else.



The three factors of meditation are morality, concentration, and wisdom. These influence the other.

  * Understanding things deeply requires a high-level objective view, giving equal weight to everyone’s concerns. This requires freedom from greed, envy, and other selfish psychic irritants.
  * When you have wisdom to truly understand a situation, compassion toward all parties involved is automatic, and thus you automatically behave morally as you restrain yourself from any thought or deed that may harm others.
  * When you don’t understand things deeply, then you create problems. You don’t see the consequences of your actions.



Meditation can also lead to intuitive problem solving. When your conscious mind gets in the way of solving a thorny problem, your intuition can pop out a solution.
