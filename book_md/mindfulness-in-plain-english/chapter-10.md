## Chapter 10: Dealing with Problems

Sometimes your meditation will feel like hitting a brick wall. These are opportunities to develop your practice. Instead of running away, you confront the problem head-on, examining it to oblivion. If you can deal with issues that arise in meditation, it will carry over to the rest of your life.

Buddhist philosophy: “**pain is inevitable. Suffering is not.** ” Bad things happen to everyone. How you deal with it and interpret it determines how you are affected emotionally by bad things.

For all problems that arise, the general approach is to **observe it mindfully without getting engaged. Watch the problem form, peak, and dissipate. Notice its intensity and how it affects the body.** The problem will naturally dissipate. And you will find that many of our day-to-day emotions are simply superficial mental states that have no control over you.

The common problems that arise:

#### Physical pain

  * Get rid of physical pain before meditating (eg medicine for a headache).
  * Wear loose clothing and relax your posture. Keep your arms and neck muscles relaxed.
  * If pain remains, make the pain the object of your meditation. Explore the feeling. 
    * You will observe there are two things - the pain itself, and your resistance to that pain. This is a barrier between “me” and “the pain.”
    * You will feel the physical resistance to the pain through muscle contraction. Relax those muscles one by one. 
    * Mentally, you will find a “I don’t like this feeling” sentiment. Locate this and relax it too.
    * Once this barrier has vanished, you will find yourself merging with the pain. At this point, it no longer hurts - suffering is gone.
  * Don’t make the mistake of finding it hard to be mindful when you feel pain. In fact, mindfulness never exists by itself - it always has some object.
  * These techniques will carry over into the rest of life, including anxiety and sadness.



#### Drowsiness

  * Apply your mindfulness to the state of drowsiness itself. This awareness will evaporate drowsiness.
  * Try to eat lightly before meditating or wait after a big meal.
  * If you need to sleep, then sleep. You will not gain any new insight from fighting sleep.



#### Distraction

  * If you have irritating tasks or problems that keep coming up, solve them first before meditating. But don’t use this as an excuse to not meditate, thinking all your problems need to be solved.
  * If you don’t know what you’re agitated about, observe it, and the cause will eventually surface.



#### Stupor

  * By deepening concentration, you can enter a state where you feel pleasantly divorced from the body. If you dive into the pleasure too much, your mind will stop being mindful, attention scattering aimlessly through vague clouds of bliss.
  * Mindfully observe this and it will dissipate.



#### Miscellaneous

  * Legs going to sleep - don’t worry about legs going to sleep. It’s just nerves pinching, not lack of blood circulation. Numbness will disappear as you practice.
  * Boredom - mindfulness looks at everything with the wondrous eyes of a child. If you’re bored, look again.
  * Fear - scary thoughts or memories may arise. Just observe it wash over you. These are just thoughts and can’t hurt you.
  * Discouragement, trying too hard - drop your expectations. Don’t punish yourself for being unmindful, for realizing you’ve been unmindful is itself mindfulness.
