## Chapter 7: What to Do with Your Mind

The state you are aiming for is where you are aware of everything that is happening in the moment, observing your thoughts forming and disappearing without engaging in the thoughts.

This is different from thinking about all thoughts that come up, which is akin to daydreaming.

**There is a difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought. The “texture” is different.**

  * Being aware of a thought is light in texture, arising lightly as a bubble, and the thought passes without giving rise to the next thought in the chain. 
  * Normal conscious thought is heavier in texture - “ponderous, commanding, compulsive.” It leads straight to the next thought in the chain.



The object is to use breathing as the focus of concentration. Your breath is the reference point from which the mind wanders and is drawn back. Distractions, by definition, are deviations from a central focus. From this central focus of breathing, you then go on to note all physical and mental other phenomena that arise.

Why focus on breathing, and not any other thought or sensation? The author recommends breathing as the object of focus because:

  * It is portable, cheap, and freely available. 
  * It happens automatically for most of the day, so being aware of it is subtly challenging. You’ve got to work at it to focus on it, but not focus too hard. 
  * You need to learn to focus on your breathing without manipulating it. There are lessons to be learned here on the nature of will and desire.
    * Analogy: when sawing wood, you don’t watch the saw blade. You watch the line you’re cutting along.
  * There are many variations of breathing (length, depth, smoothness) that are interesting to observe.
    * But you must observe it without thinking about it, without verbalizing your thoughts about it. Don’t think: “my breath is smoothening out! What’s going to happen next?” Return merely to focusing on the breath.
  * Breath is universal to all living things, so it also connects you to the rest of the living world.
  * The breath is naturally a present-moment process. Once it passes it passes, and the next one comes. This transience is different from our memories or our future worries and plans.



### Handling Distractions

Distractions will naturally arise. You’ll learn ot deal with them.

At times you will find yourself utterly incapable of wrangling your mind from thinking random thoughts. You will not be aware of where the thoughts come from, and you will feel crazy. This is the “monkey-mind.” **Realize that your mind has always been this way - you have just never noticed.**

Gently but firmly return to your focus. Do not get upset or judge yourself from straying. Do not force things out of your mind - this adds energy to the thoughts that will make them return stronger.

Set small goals. Try to focus for just one inhalation and exhalation. You will still fail, but keep at it.

(Shortform note: Again, don’t beat yourself up over getting distracted. Don’t fixate on the goal of achieving some desired end state. Don’t feel like a failure for not meeting mindfulness. Instead, think of meditation as the exercise of bringing your mind back to concentration. Every distraction is a chance to practice this and get better.)

### States of Mind to Avoid

Just as you should avoid thinking, **you should avoid sinking**. Sinking is the dimming of awareness, a mental vacuum where there is no thought, no concentration on anything. It is like a dreamless sleep. It is a void to be avoided.

Do not go in expecting goals, like the ability to solve problems. This will load your brain with problems to be solved. Take a break from all that worrying and planning. Let your meditation be a complete vacation. The problems will take care of themselves later.
