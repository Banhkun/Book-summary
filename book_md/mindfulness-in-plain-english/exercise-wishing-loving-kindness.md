## Exercise: Wishing Loving Kindness

Try the recitation to practice loving kindness to people you don’t usually wish it for.

The recitation: “May **___** be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to **_**. May they always meet with spiritual success. May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life. May they always rise above them with morality, integrity, forgiveness, compassion, mindfulness, and wisdom.”

* * *

Repeat this recitation multiple times (out loud or in your head), replacing the blanks with these in order: I | my parents | my teachers | my relatives | my friends | all indifferent persons | all unfriendly persons | all living beings. You can also picture specific people with whom you have problems.

How do you feel afterward? Do you sense any changes in someone you previously felt friction with?
