## Chapter 4: The Right Attitude

Meditation is very sensitive to the mental attitude you bring to the activity. Here’s the right attitude to have while meditating.

**Don’t expect anything.** Sit back and see what happens. See it as an experiment. Let the meditation move along at its own speed and in its own direction. Throw away your preconceptions of what it should feel like and what it should achieve.

**Don’t strain or rush**. Counter-intuitively, the more you force things, the further you’ll be from your goal.

**Accept everything that arises**. Don’t condemn yourself for having feelings you wish you didn’t have. Accept them. This is the first step to removing yourself of them.

**Don’t expect the same thing every time**. Every meditation is an experiment, and the feeling is just momentary. You will stagnate your practice.

**Investigate for yourself**. Don’t take any word as scripture. Even Buddha was a nonconformist, avoiding dogma. Discover your own insights and methods.

**Don’t ponder**. Thinking won’t free you from the trap. Meditation purifies the mind naturally by mindfulness, without using thoughts or words. Don’t think. See.

**Don’t dwell upon contrasts. Focus on similarities**.

  * Ordinary thinking is full of comparisons, leading to greed, jealousy and pride - “I’m more/less attractive/wealthy than that person.”
  * Instead, focus on the factors universal to all life that will move you closer to others. Build feelings of kinship rather than estrangement.
