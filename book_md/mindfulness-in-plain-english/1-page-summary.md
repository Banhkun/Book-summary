## 1-Page Summary

### Why Meditate?

**Many of us find life continuously unsatisfying.** We can distract the nagging feeling for a time, but it inevitably comes back. We must have more. Things must be better. We get stuck in “if only” wishful thinking mode - “if only I had X, all my problems will be solved.”

There is no satisfying this impulse. You will never have enough. You equilibrate so quickly to your environment that nothing is ever satisfying enough. The only winning move is not to play.

Is there another way to live? **You can control your mind to step outside the endless cycle of desire and aversion.** You can learn not to stop wanting what you currently crave, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.

**Meditation is the path to this level of understanding and mental peace**. It purifies the mind of “psychic irritants,” bringing you to a new state of tranquility and awareness. It makes you deeply aware of your own thoughts and actions.

### What Meditation Is

Meditation involves concentration, like prayer and yogic meditation. But concentration is a means to an end - **the ultimate goal is awareness** , or **mindfulness**.

Awareness is the ability to **listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in them**.

  * So much of your thought is automatic that you cannot be said to have real control of your thinking. Up pops a stimulus (an attractive person, the smell of food, annoying party music) - and immediately you react with a feeling.
  * The first step to avoid this is to realize what you are doing as you are doing it, to stand back and quietly watch. You learn to scrutinize your own perceptual process with precision. You decouple the perception of a stimulus with the arising of thought.
  * With meditation, you examine the very process of perception. You watch the feelings that arise and the changes that occur in your own consciousness.



For much of your life, you have given in to your impulses out of habit. When you’re mindful you see through the “hollow shouting of your own impulses” and pierce their secret. Your urges yell at you, coaxing, beckoning, threatening, but you realize they have no power at all.

### The Mindset of Meditating

Meditation is very sensitive to the mental attitude you bring to the activity. Here’s the right attitude to have while meditating.

**Don’t expect anything.** Sit back and see what happens. See it as an experiment. Let the meditation move along at its own speed and in its own direction. Throw away your preconceptions of what it should feel like and what it should achieve.

**Don’t strain or rush**. Counter-intuitively, the more you force things, the further you’ll be from your goal.

**Accept everything that arises**. Don’t condemn yourself for having feelings you wish you didn’t have. Accept them. This is the first step to removing yourself of them.

**Don’t ponder**. Thinking won’t free you from the trap. Meditation purifies the mind naturally by mindfulness, without using thoughts or words. Don’t think. See.

### How to Start Meditating

Determine how long you are going to meditate. Beginners can start at 10-20 minutes. But do not worry about attaining any particular goal within a particular time period - this will just be distracting and counterproductive.

Sit in a comfortable pose. Do not change the position again until the time you determined at the beginning. Shifting positions will avoid giving you a deep level of concentration.

  * Sit with your back straight. The spine should be erect, with the head in line with the spine. Be relaxed, not stiff. Have no muscular tension.
  * Your clothing should be loose and soft. Don’t wear clothing so tight it restricts blood flow or nerve sensation. Take your shoes off.
  * You can choose to sit on the floor on in a chair. 



Sit motionlessly and close your eyes.

Your mind is like a cup of muddy water. Keep it still, and the mud will settle down and the water will be seen clearly.

The mind must focus on a mental object that is present at every moment. The book recommends starting with focusing on your breath.

Take 3 deep breaths. Then breathe normally and effortlessly, **focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils where the air is flowing through**.

  * Simply notice the feeling of breath going in and out. You may notice mindfully that there is a brief pause between inhaling and exhaling - but don’t obsess over this.



**Keep focusing your attention on your breath.**

**Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything.** Simply notice the incoming and outgoing breath, and notice as the breath lengthens as you relax.

When your mind wanders and gets distracted, bring it back. The book suggests counting in a variety of ways, basically to distract your mind back to breathing:

  * Count 1 when inhaling, 2 when exhaling. Repeat to 10 then repeat.
  * Count 1 to 10 quickly when inhaling, and again when exhaling.
  * **Once your mind is focused on the breath, give up counting**.



When distracted, gently but firmly return to your focus. Do not get upset or judge yourself from straying. Do not force things out of your mind - this adds energy to the thoughts that will make them return stronger.

Over time, your breathing will become shallower and more subtle. This is an indicator of concentration.

  * You will develop a new more subtle “sign” - which appears differently to different people (a star, a long string, a cobweb, the moon, a flower). Over time, master this so that whenever you want the sign, it should be available.



The mind must keep up with what is happening at every moment, so do not try to stop the mind at any one moment. This is **momentary concentration**.

When you feel in a state of concentration, the mind can then move to other sounds, memories, or emotions, one at a time. As they fade away, let your mind return to the breath.

### How to Continue Meditating

Establish a formal practice schedule. Set aside a certain time.

  * Meditating in the morning is a good start to the day. Wake up fully, then sit down to meditate. Don’t get hung up in the day’s activities.
  * Evening before sleep is another good time. It clears your mind of mental rubbish throughout the day.



Once a day is enough when you begin.

Start with 20-30 minutes for sitting. Over time, you can lengthen this, so that regular practitioners can sit for hours.

### Wishing Kindness On Others

It is tradition to begin meditation with a few recitations. They have a practical purpose for psychological cleansing and aren’t meant to be dogmatic rituals. Here’s one that wishes well on yourself and others.

“May **___** be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to **___**. May they always meet with spiritual success. May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life. May they always rise above them with morality, integrity, forgiveness, compassion, mindfulness, and wisdom.”

Repeat this recitation multiple times, replacing the blanks with these in order: I | my parents | my teachers | my relatives | my friends | all indifferent persons | all unfriendly persons | all living beings.

#### Benefits of this Recitation

**Mindfulness is egoless awareness. If you start with ego in full control, it is difficult to get mindfulness started.** If your mind is in fury, it’s hard to focus during meditation.

This recitation overcomes the ego. Balance the negative emotion by instilling a positive one. Giving confronts greed; benevolence confronts hatred.

First you banish thoughts of self-hatred and self-condemnation, letting good wishes flow to yourself.

Then you expand out to other people, overcoming greed, selfishness, resentment, and hatred.

How can you wish well on your enemies?

  * Realize that they are suffering, just like you and everyone else. If your enemies were well, happy, and peaceful, they wouldn’t be your enemies. If they were free of pain, suffering, paranoia, fear - they wouldn’t be your enemies. So the practical approach is to help them overcome their problems, so you can live in peace and happiness.
  * In contrast, **if you wish poorly on another person** \- “let him be poor. Let him fail. Let him be ugly” - this will generate a physiological stress response that **handicaps you and makes you less pleasant to others**.
  * By wishing well on them, you practice noble behavior, which will more likely improve your enemy’s life and convert him from an enemy.
