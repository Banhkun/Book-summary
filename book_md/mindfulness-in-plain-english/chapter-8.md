## Chapter 8: Structuring Your Meditation

Meditation requires continuous practice, and so it benefits from structure.

The environment: Sit in a quiet, secluded place where you won’t be disturbed. Don’t be on display or feel self-conscious. Avoid places with music or talking. Ideally sit in the same place each time.

#### When to Sit

Establish a formal practice schedule. Set aside a certain time.

  * Meditating in the morning is a good start to the day. Wake up fully, then sit down to meditate. Don’t get hung up in the day’s activities.
  * Evening before sleep is another good time. It clears your mind of mental rubbish throughout the day.



Once a day is enough when you begin.

Don’t overdo it so you feel like it’s a chore, or so you expect magical results when you apply it too intensely. The best is when you look forward to sitting.

#### How Long to Sit

Start with 20-30 minutes for sitting.

Choose the length before sitting, and stick to it. Don’t peek at your watch during it, just let the sitting come to a close.

After a year, you should be able to sit for an hour at a time. Seasoned meditators practice 3-4 hours a day.

Don’t force yourself to sit with pain just to feel all tough and mighty. This isn’t an endurance contest.
