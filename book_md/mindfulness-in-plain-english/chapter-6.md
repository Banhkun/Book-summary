## Chapter 6: What to Do with Your Body

The author is clear to say that you should learn by doing, not by following dogmatic prescriptions. However, there are certain meditation practices that have been optimized over millennia, and they’re worth trying out.

The body position is meant to provide stability to remove distractions and create immobility of the mind.

Sit with your back straight. The spine should be erect, with the head in line with the spine. Be relaxed, not stiff. Have no muscular tension.

  * Straightness invites alertness. Slouching invites drowsiness.



Your clothing should be loose and soft. Don’t wear clothing so tight it restricts blood flow or nerve sensation. Take your shoes off.

You can choose to sit on the floor on in a chair.

When sitting on the floor:

  * Use a cushion that is relatively firm, at least 3 inches thick when compressed.
  * Sit close to the front edge of cushion, and let your crossed legs rest on the floor in front. Use some padding to protect shins and ankles from pressure.
    * Sitting too far back causes the front edge of cushion to press into thigh and pinch nerves.
  * Fold your legs in a style you’re comfortable with. In ascending order of preference:
    * Native American style - right foot tucked under left knee, left foot under right knee.
    * Burmese style - both legs lie flat on floor from knee to foot. They are in parallel.
    * Half lotus - both knees touch floor. One leg and foot lie flat along the calf of the other leg.
    * Full lotus - both knees touch floor. Each foot rests on the opposite thigh.
    * The lotus positions are best because they are most stable for long periods of time.
  * Hands are cupped one on the other, resting on lap below navel with wrist pressed against thigh, with palms turned upward. Relax arms.



When sitting on a chair:

  * Choose a chair with a level seat, straight back, no arms. Do not lean against the back of the chair.
  * The seat should not dig into your thighs.
  * Place legs side by side, feet flat on floor.



Sit in the entire session in that posture without moving.
