## Chapters 6-8: The Crisis Theory

So far we’ve seen neoliberal economies being forged through violent coups.**** In this chapter, we’ll examine a different strategy that free-market economists used to advance their agenda: leveraging crises to sway public opinion, rather than making people fall in line with brute force.

**The “Crisis Theory” would be instrumental in bringing free-market economics to countries like the US and Britain, where military coups weren’t an option.**

### Struggles for the Chicago School

Although free-market economics spread quickly and brutally through South America, it had a harder time gaining traction in the US and Britain. **In both countries, there was an insurmountable conflict between free-market capitalism and democracy.** Because neoliberal policies would hurt the majority of the people, they’d never vote for politicians who tried to implement those policies.

1\. Resistance in the US: In 1971, a few years before Pinochet seized power in Chile, President Nixon rebuffed Milton Freidman’s ideas. Though Nixon had once been enthusiastic about Friedman’s capitalist orthodoxy, the US economy was in a slump, and the president knew that trying to implement free-market policies would cause enormous backlash. Instead, Nixon went in the opposite direction by imposing price caps on necessities like oil and rent. Shortly afterward, inflation went down and the economy began to rally.

Friedman was outraged by Nixon’s betrayal, and he insisted that the administration had to stop what it was doing. Friedman flatly denied that there was any connection between the price caps and the sudden recovery of the economy. However, the American people thought differently; they re-elected Nixon in a landslide, **and in doing so they unknowingly rejected Friedman’s free-market orthodoxy.**

2\. Resistance in Britain: In 1981, the economist Friedrich Hayek—who taught at the Chicago School, where he was held up on something of a pedestal—took a trip to Chile to see what the Chicago-trained economists had created. He was so impressed with the free flow of money there that he wrote to his friend Margaret Thatcher, then-prime minister of Britain, and urged her to transform Britain’s economy in a similar way.

Thatcher, however, insisted that such an economic shock program wouldn’t be possible in Britain.**** Trying to implement free-market policies would practically guarantee that Thatcher (who was already losing popularity) would be soundly defeated in the next election.

### Thatcher Brings the Free Market to Britain

Things looked grim for the Chicago School economists’ dreams of a global free market **until a seemingly insignificant military conflict changed the course of economics.**

The 1982 Falklands War—or the Malvinas War if you’re in Argentina—was an 11-week struggle between Britain and Argentina for control of the Falkland Islands. While the conflict was trivial from a military standpoint, from a political standpoint it was exactly what Thatcher needed to boost her popularity.

Now that Britain had an outside enemy, the people were swept away by a wave of nationalism and militarism. They eagerly fell in line with the prime minister, who praised their patriotism and fighting spirit. The prime minister’s approval rating more than doubled during this time, rocketing from 25% to nearly 60% as the otherwise meaningless conflict went on.

**Thatcher used her new popularity to start imposing the policies that she’d told Hayek were impossible.** For example, when there was a coal miner strike in 1984, Thatcher framed it as another front of the Falklands War. She said that they’d fought the enemy without, and now they needed to fight the enemy within with the same ferocity and resolve.

Now that the workers had been billed as the enemy, Thatcher was able to bring the full power of the state against them. She used all of the surveillance and counterintelligence tools at her disposal, along with thousands of police officers, to break the miners’ union and end the strike.

By 1985 the union, one of the most powerful in the country, had capitulated. Nearly 1000 miners were fired, and other unions knew that going on strike or fighting for better conditions would risk bringing the state’s wrath down upon them as well.

With two victories under her belt, Thatcher started taking major steps toward a free market economy. Over the next few years, the British government privatized British Telecom, British Airways and British Airport Authority, British Steel, British Gas, and other formerly government-run industries.

#### A Different Type of Crisis

Margaret Thatcher’s efforts in Britain had proven that free-market capitalism didn’t necessarily need a dictatorship to whisk people away to torture camps. **Rather, a national crisis could make the people fall in line.** Now, all that Friedman and his followers had to do was leverage _internal_ crises as effectively as Thatcher had leveraged the _external_ crisis of the Falklands War.

After the internal crisis of the Great Depression, the American left had made major gains by advancing the New Deal and the Keynesian policies it supported. Friedman was now determined that it would be his students, rather than Keynes’s, who would be ready to take advantage of the next crisis.

To that end, Friedman—backed by underwriters from some of the world’s largest corporations—built a collection of right-wing research institutes and produced a 10 part PBS miniseries about the importance of economic freedom, called _Free to Choose_. In short, he was laying the groundwork to make sure that he’d have broad public support when the next crisis hit.

### Bolivia’s Shock Treatment

**Despite Thatcher’s efforts in Britain and Friedman’s in the US, it would be Bolivia that provided the true testing ground for Friedman’s new crisis theory.**

Bolivia in the mid-80s was at a crossroads that made it the perfect place for this new type of crisis capitalism. On the one hand, it was finally having general elections after two decades under a dictator’s thumb. On the other hand, the country was in so much debt that the interest it owed was greater than its national budget, and inflation was up to a staggering 14,000%.

The election was between Bolivia’s former president Victor Paz Estenssoro, and its former dictator Hugo Banzer. The vote was extremely close, so close that the final decision was left to Bolivia’s congress, but Banzer’s party was certain that he would win. Even before the results were announced, they called in a young economist named Jeffrey Sachs to start planning a solution to Bolivia’s economic crisis.

Sachs was an odd hybrid of Chicago School economist and Keynesian. He favored Friedman-esque economic shock therapy, but he wanted to soften it with some government support for those who would be hit hardest by the free-market policies.

Sachs knew next to nothing of Bolivia’s history and had never worked in development economics before. However, he was the golden boy of Harvard’s economics department at the time, and confident that he knew everything he needed to know in order to turn Bolivia’s crisis around—in a single day, he claimed. **To that end, Sachs laid out a plan for Banzer that involved price deregulations, budget cuts, and raising the price of oil by 1000%.**

#### Paz Takes Back the Presidency

To everyone’s surprise, Congress chose Paz, not Banzer, to take the presidency. Paz had been known to completely change his policies while in office, and to swing left or right as seemed beneficial to him at the time. While he was no radical socialist, he also wasn’t known as a Chicago-style capitalist. However, that was about to change.

It’s not clear exactly what prompted Paz’s sudden, extreme move to the right this time, but there’s some evidence that he’d been promised support from the US in exchange for creating a free-trade economy in his own country.

Paz set out to correct Bolivia’s spiraling economy with policies based on Sachs’s recommendations—but then went far beyond anything that Sachs had proposed. His new plan called to completely eliminate food subsidies, cancel all price controls, and raise the price of oil. On top of that, even though these moves would cause the cost of living to skyrocket, the plan called to freeze all government wages at their current levels. It made severe cuts to government spending and opened Bolivia’s borders to all kinds of cheap imports. It also downsized a lot of state-run companies, the groundwork for full privatization.

President Paz dictated that **whatever changes they made—whatever economic shocks they administered—had to be done quickly, suddenly, and all at once so that the country’s unions and the public couldn’t respond.** He likened it to a surprise military attack against a dangerous enemy. To fulfill his demands, his team compiled all of their proposed changes into a single document that rivaled “The Brick” in size and scope. The entire plan would have to be accepted or rejected; there was no room for amending it.

Paz didn’t even give his cabinet the chance to reject it. He read the entire document aloud to a shocked room and said that anyone who didn’t like it should resign. With inflation out of control and the vague promise of support from Washington giving them hope, nobody dared to oppose his plan.

#### The Outcome of Bolivia’s Shock Therapy

The price increases and cuts to spending did indeed end hyperinflation, as promised. **Within two years inflation was down from 16,000% to a mere 10%, which is impressive by any measure.**

However, alongside this seemingly miraculous recovery was enormous hardship for the poor and working class. Sachs, like Friedman, had sworn that free trade would create jobs for the jobless. That promise wasn’t fulfilled. The unemployment rate, which had been at 20% before Paz took office, climbed to somewhere between 25% and 30%. The state mining company alone had downsized from 28,000 employees to only 6,000, with no new private companies to replace it.

**As always happened with economic shock therapy, a small group of wealthy elites became far richer while everyone else became much poorer.** Homelessness soared, thousands of families couldn’t get enough food to eat, and even those lucky enough to have jobs lost most of their protections. The number of Bolivians who could claim social security dropped by 61% between 1983 and 1988.

One unforeseen consequence of the shock therapy was a massive expansion of Bolivia’s illegal coca trade. Coca, which is refined to make cocaine, was several times more profitable than any other crop, which naturally led desperate people to seek work on coca farms. A mere two years after Paz dropped his version of The Brick on Bolivia, illicit drug exports were bringing in more money than all of Bolivia’s legal exports put together. It’s estimated that 350,000 people were making a living from the drug trade in some way or another.

Naturally, the people who had voted for Paz were outraged at this betrayal of the nationalist platform that he’d run on. Tens of thousands took to the streets, where they were met with tanks, strict curfews, and harsh restrictions on travel. Riot police attacked workers’ unions, a radio station, and a university, as well as multiple factories. Political gatherings and marches were banned. **Effectively, any opposition to the new regime was made illegal, just as it had been under Banzer’s dictatorship.**

During this crisis, Sachs returned to Bolivia to advise president Paz and his cabinet. In spite of the mass hardship and suffering, Sachs staunchly opposed reversing or even slowing the changes. Instead, he used his prestige and charisma to shore up policymakers’ resolve as public pressure rose against them.

Outside of Bolivia, however, people didn’t see the hardship and repression that came along with the miraculous economic recovery. As far as the world was concerned, Bolivia had proven that economic shock therapy could be achieved without trampling peoples’ liberties or causing undue hardship.

On top of that, the fact that the man implementing the policies had been elected seemed to clear out the stench of dictatorship and authoritarianism that had clung to the Chicago School’s theories—never mind that Paz had gone completely against what he’d promised the people during his campaign.

**In short, Bolivia became a sort of blueprint for a new, more attractive method of economic shock therapy.** Rather than oppressive dictators and soldiers in uniform, people saw a democratically elected president and economists in suits working to fix a runaway economy, and apparently succeeding.

### New Opportunities for the Free Market

As it turned out, there would be plenty of opportunities for economic shock therapists to try the new Bolivian model. Economies all through the Southern Cone were in crisis due to extravagant loans that the juntas had taken out, which made them ripe targets for free-market economists.

John Williamson, a prominent right-wing economist in Washington, D.C., watched Sachs’s work in Bolivia with particular interest. **What he saw there was proof that Friedman was not only right about how to rein in hyperinflation, but also that his new crisis theory was correct.** The economic crisis in Bolivia had been just as effective for Paz as the Falklands War had been for Thatcher, and much more palatable to the rest of the world than Pinochet’s dictatorship had been.

In fact, in the mid-80s, several influential economists noted that hyperinflation had many of the same effects as a war: It created mass fear and confusion, displaced many people, and caused widespread loss of life. In short, like war, hyperinflation was a crisis—one that seemed to justify using any and all measures to bring it under control.

For the most orthodox of the Chicago School’s followers, this fact meant that hyperinflation wasn’t a problem to solve, but rather an opportunity to seize. As it turned out, there would be many such opportunities in the years to come.

#### Debt Bombs in the Southern Cone

Dictatorships were collapsing all over the world in the 1980s, a period that political scientist Samuel Huntington called the “third wave of democracy.”**** It was an exciting time for most of the world, and a frightening time for advocates of the free market—it seemed like only a matter of time before developmentalism or similar theories started gaining ground again in the world economy.

**However, the democratic governments replacing those dictatorships ran into economic problems almost immediately.** The Southern Cone once again provided perfect examples: Bolivia, for instance, had gone from $7.9 billion of external debt to a crushing $45 billion during the junta years. Brazil, the worst case of them all, had gone from $3 billion of debt to over $100 billion in just two decades.

At the time, many argued that the debts were odious (that is, not enforceable) and the lenders shouldn’t try to collect. There were both moral and legal reasons behind that stance. First, it wasn’t fair to demand that newly freed people pay off their oppressors’ deficits; second, many of those loans should never have been given out in the first place, since the lenders knew full well that the money would go toward funding human rights violations.

A recently declassified transcript of a conversation between then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Argentina’s former foreign minister made the second point plainly enough—Kissinger urged Argentina to take out as many loans as possible before its “human rights issues” made the US unable to help any further. **In other words, the US administration knew exactly what Argentina planned to do with the money, and was eager to lend it out anyway.**

Nonetheless, the US government and major world banks insisted that the new establishments be held responsible for their predecessors’ debts.

#### The Debt Spiral

Milton Friedman’s crisis theory would prove to be not just accurate, but self-fulfilling. **Deregulating the global market created the very crises that the Chicago School needed in order to implement its theories all over the world.**

Taking on the juntas’ massive debts would have been hard enough for the newly established governments, but their problems were only just starting. In 1980, US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker drastically increased interest rates. The repercussions of this decision have come to be known, aptly enough, as the Volcker Shock.

Domestically, the spiking interest rates led to a large number of bankruptcies and tripled the number of people who defaulted on their mortgages. However, the worst effects were seen abroad, where already-struggling governments could only keep up with the increased payments by taking even more loans. They didn’t dare to default on those loans, or band together into a debtor’s coalition, for fear of another wave of US-backed junta uprisings. They had no choice but to follow Washington’s rules, and those rules had suddenly become much stricter.

At the same time, other shocks hit the developing world as the prices of many key exports fell dramatically. For example, the price of tin—Bolivia’s largest legal export—fell by 55%, further destroying that country’s economy. Incidentally, that sort of reliance on resource exports was exactly what developmentalist economics had aimed to fix; a goal that US economists decried as a socialist fantasy.

### The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund

Free market economists even managed to take over the very institutions that were designed to keep the free market in check: the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These two organizations are economic coalitions between numerous countries, and they were intended to prevent economic collapses with generous grants and low-interest loans.

John Maynard Keynes lauded the institutions. He said that the world had finally realized the inherent dangers of a free market, which had led to such horrors as the Nazi regime in Germany and the juntas in the Southern Cone, and he was pleased with the steps that the world powers had taken to prevent those atrocities from happening again.

However, the IMF and the World Bank had a fatal flaw that prevented them from living up to their stated missions: Rather than following United Nations rules of one vote per country, they allocated votes based on the size of each country’s economy. **In effect, this rule gave the US veto power over almost the entire coalition.** When Reagan and Thatcher, two inveterate neoliberals, took power during the 80s, their combined economic clout was enough to fully harness both organizations for their free-market agenda.

Milton Friedman should have been vehemently opposed to these two institutions—the Bank and the IMF represented exactly the sort of government spending that he despised. It was, therefore, maybe somewhat ironic that so many key positions in both the World Bank and the IMF ended up being filled by Chicago School graduates. Ironic or not, though, the Chicago School quickly and deliberately took hold of the levers of power.

Their takeover became official in 1989 when the economist John Williamson revealed the “Washington Consensus.” It was a set of policies that, he claimed, the Bank and the IMF considered the baseline for a healthy economy. **The Washington Consensus was nothing less than Milton Friedman’s policy triad: privatization, spending cuts, and deregulation of trade.**

Rather than the promised grants and loans, the IMF started responding to cries for help with economic shock therapy. **Any country that came seeking aid had no choice but to accept, along with the financial aid, sweeping changes that privatized their industries and opened their borders to free trade.**

Of course, this was all done in the name of economic stability—that was still the IMF’s stated goal, despite the vast profits it was raking in from neoliberal policies. Nonetheless, those policies invariably created, as one of the IMF’s own senior economists would later admit, “economic bedlam.”

#### The Economic Bait-and-Switch

In the end, this expertly packaged deal was how Friedman and the Chicago School’s free-market theories not only survived but thrived as democracy spread across the globe. The crisis theory wasn’t so much an economic theory as a psychological one; people who were in shock from a crisis and afraid for their futures were easy to control.

Furthermore, it worked perfectly: When desperate countries came to the World Bank and IMF seeking relief, they were forced to accept brutal economic restructuring along with the aid they so dearly needed.

**It’s worth noting that, in many cases, shock therapy actually worked in the short term.** Countries were able to quickly rein in inflation and stabilize their currencies. These apparent economic miracles were held up as further proof that privatization and free trade were the only ways to ensure a healthy economy.

However, like every time free trade is imposed on a developing country, cheap imports quickly flooded the markets and forced local factories out of business. Unemployment and poverty soared—Argentina alone saw more than half of its population drop below the poverty line.

**Throughout the 90s and 2000s, further crises would help Chicago School economics take hold in many other countries around the world**.
