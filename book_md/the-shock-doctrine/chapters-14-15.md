## Chapters 14-15: The Washington Consensus at Home

So far our study of free-market capitalism has been mostly focused on US efforts abroad. In this chapter, we’ll see how that movement swept the US itself, mostly under the two Bush administrations.

We’ll also circle back to one of our earliest topics: the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the resulting invasion of Iraq. Specifically, we’ll see how President George W. Bush’s concept of an outsourced, privatized military functioned during that time.

### Dick Cheney Works to Privatize the Military

President Bush Sr.’s Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, worked on both sides of the free market—government and corporate—to bring the modern privatization craze to the US military. Working first as Secretary of Defense, and later as CEO of the massive multinational corporation Halliburton, he created a military contract so vague that it put an entire overseas operation under private control.

First, Cheney reduced the number of active soldiers and made up for it by greatly increasing the military’s reliance on private contractors like Halliburton. He then asked Brown & Root—Halliburton’s engineering division—to identify jobs being done by US troops that the private sector could take over. Unsurprisingly, the company found many tasks that they claimed they could do more efficiently than the military. **This led to a new contract called LOGCAP: the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program.**

A small group of companies was asked to apply for a position providing “logistical support” for the military, with minimal details about what that might actually involve. Along with the work came a blank check: Whoever had the contract could bill for any costs they incurred, plus a percentage profit. In the end, Halliburton ended up winning the contract they’d helped to create.

Then, in 1995, Halliburton brought Cheney on as its new CEO. Thanks to that vague contract they’d created together when he was Secretary of Defense, **Cheney and Halliburton could expand the definition of “logistical support” until the company was effectively in charge of an entire overseas military operation.**

Under Cheney’s leadership, Halliburton almost doubled the amount of money it received from the US government—from $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion—in just five years. Cheney himself was richly rewarded for his work, too. Before taking office as Bush Jr’s vice president, he estimated his net worth at somewhere between $18 million and $82 million, with as much as $30 million of that coming from his Halliburton stock options.

#### Privatizing Domestic Affairs

With the Cold War over, defense contractors like Lockheed Martin—which relied on government weapons contracts for income—needed a new strategy. Their new approach was to get involved in work that was traditionally handled by civil servants: everything from sorting mail to monitoring air traffic. Their efforts got a boost in the 2000s, after George W. Bush took office—Bush was absolutely in favor of private contractors handling as much of the country’s work as possible. **In 2004, the New York Times reported that Lockheed Martin “[ran] a breathtakingly large part” of the US.**

People could see the effects of privatization on a smaller scale in the state of Texas, governed at the time by George W. Bush. His time as governor wasn’t very memorable, but the one thing he was exceptionally good at was selling off pieces of his government to private interests. This was especially true of security-related operations, which made Texas something of a preview for the War on Terror he would begin in the next decade.

Bush's love of privatization was on display during his 2000 presidential campaign as well, when he claimed that hundreds of thousands of federal employees were doing jobs that the private sector could handle more efficiently. **He said that, if private contractors could do the job better, then they should get the contracts.**

### Privatizing the Military

The Bush administration’s privatization craze reached beyond civil matters like mail and air traffic control; **they dreamed of a publicly-funded, privately-run military whose operations were handled start-to-finish by outside contractors.** That idea was extremely unpopular among top military officials, but the crisis of the 9/11 terrorist attacks gave the administration the leverage it needed to push through the reforms anyway.

In 2001, Donald Rumsfeld joined President Bush Jr’s cabinet as Secretary of Defense. At first, many people were confused why he even wanted the job. After all, he was already past retirement age and had personal wealth estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars.

As it turned out, Rumsfeld _didn’t_ have any interest in being a traditional defense secretary—but he had great interest in bringing the new model of corporatism to the US military.**In short, he wanted to finish the work that Cheney had begun a decade earlier.**

Rumsfeld envisioned laying off huge numbers of troops and personnel and hiring outside agencies like Halliburton and Blackwater to take up the slack. He then wanted to take the money they saved from these measures and pour it into private research firms, to further cement the US’s military and technological supremacy in the world.

His vision was immensely unpopular at the Pentagon. After just seven months it seemed like the end of his time as Secretary of Defense was already in sight. On September 10, 2001, Rumsfeld made a speech that should have been the nail in his coffin: **He called the Pentagon’s bureaucracy a threat to the nation, and declared war on his own workplace.** However, the infamous terrorist attacks that took place the next day pulled media coverage away from Rumsfeld’s extraordinary speech, and quite possibly saved his job.

### The September 11 Shock

The terrorist attacks that hit the US on September 11, 2001 seemed, at first, to mark a reversal of the last decade’s privatization mania. New York’s police officers, firefighters, and rescue workers were undisputed heroes in the aftermath of the attacks. The Bush administration, which had been so dedicated to privatizing these civil service organizations, now praised their courage and thanked them for their sacrifices. **As it turned out, their newfound appreciation for civil servants was just a distraction from their continuing privatization efforts.**

The Bush administration was rumored to be working on an economic stimulus package in the vein of the New Deal—using a large amount of government money to bolster the flagging economy. The move had been prompted by the twin threats of a declining economy and the War on Terror; the administration needed to do something dramatic to stave off a recession. **However, what emerged wasn’t remotely similar to FDR’s massive public works projects.**

Even as President Bush praised civil servants’ patriotism, he and his administration continued their plans to privatize everything they could reach. They were more convinced than ever that only the private sector had the ingenuity and the flexibility to defend against such attacks in the future.

They offered contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars per year to private interests, with no competition and almost no oversight. These contracts were for services ranging from media and technology to health care and incarceration.

**In short, the Bush administration performed classic economic shock therapy.** While the country was reeling from an unexpected and horrific attack, the administration put vast amounts of public wealth and resources into private hands.

#### The So-Called War on Terror

The 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center gave the Bush administration exactly what it needed to bring free-market capitalism to the United States in full force. It was a crisis that provided a common enemy for the people to rally against, and a justification for anything the government did to fight back.

So began Bush’s infamous “War on Terror.” While it was supposedly an effort to defeat terrorism around the world, in practice, it was a smokescreen to build a privatized police state, both at home in the US and abroad in the Middle East. The specifics changed constantly: the identity of the enemy, the scale of the conflict, and the rules of engagement shifted freely to maximize profit and keep the “war” going endlessly.

Large sections of the economy, ranging from disaster reconstruction to war and homeland security, were turned over to private contractors. **To Bush and his underlings, the role of government wasn’t to protect the country; it was to buy protection on the free market.**

The Department of Homeland Security (which isn’t an actual arm of the government so much as a middleman between the government and defense contractors) provides the perfect illustration of this. The Department was founded on the supposition that “terrorists” could attack anywhere, any time, with any weapon. That meant that they had to have security in all places, at all times, against every conceivable risk—in other words, there was practically no limit to how much money they could funnel to private companies.

In a February 2007 article, the New York Times noted that contractors seemed to have become an unofficial branch of government—a branch formed without any public debate or formal policy.

One of the most effective ideological tools the administration used during this time was simply promising that none of their decisions were driven by economic ideology. Officials claimed that 9/11 had “changed everything.” Of course, for free-market crusaders and the corporations they worked for, all that had changed was how easily they could implement their agenda.

#### Profiting From Policy

The men behind the War on Terror conflated what was good for business with what was good for the country, and therefore made decisions based on what would bring their companies the greatest profits. **The Bush administration was so tangled up in conflicts of interest that it was sometimes hard to tell where the government ended and the private sector began.**

This conflict of interest was perfectly illustrated by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who flat-out refused to divest himself of stock in numerous disaster and defense-related companies. In other words, Rumsfeld was profiting handsomely off of the decisions that he himself made as Secretary of Defense.

Another notable figure during this time was James Baker III. He’d worked for the federal government in the past, and was a symbol of a more reserved, less chaotic time. In the years since, he’d made a fortune in the private market.

(Shortform note: James Baker III had served various functions under several US presidents. Most recently before this new appointment he’d been Secretary of State under President George H. W. Bush.)

Bush named Baker a special envoy for Iraq’s debt. **Baker’s goal was supposedly to convince other nations to forgive Iraq’s crushing debts, but what he did was exactly the opposite.**

One confidential document proved just how deep his conflicts of interest ran. The document was a 65-page business plan from a consortium of companies—including one that Baker was a partner in—promising to use their foreign influence to collect some $27 billion from Iraq for one of Iraq’s main creditors, Kuwait. In exchange for this service, Kuwait would invest $1 billion into Baker’s company, the Carlyle Group.

That was only one of Baker’s many dismal failures as special envoy. While his orders were to clear as much as 95% of Iraq’s foreign debt, all he accomplished in that time was rescheduling some of it. Iraq’s debts were still equal to 99% of its GDP.

Nor were Rumsfeld and Baker the only ones influencing policy for their own benefit. Bush also had a large number of advisers, many of whom were volunteers, but all of whom were profiting from the new disaster capitalism complex.

In short, Bush created a massive complex that was federally funded but privately run, with practically no oversight nor spending limits. **It was, quite possibly, the greatest victory for the Chicago School’s crusade to date.**
