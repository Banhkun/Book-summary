## Chapter 12: Sachs’s Successor

In this chapter, we see how Sachs’s failure in Russia drastically changed his views on neoliberalism and free-market economics. However, when Sachs abandoned the free market crusade, others were ready and willing to pick up where he left off.

In fact, these new frontrunners of neoliberalism took things farther than Sachs ever had. One of them made a crucial discovery: **Free market economists didn’t need to wait for crises to arise naturally.** They were perfectly capable of intensifying problems that already existed, or even of inventing crises completely out of thin air.

### Sachs’s Change of Perspective

After Russia succumbed to Yeltsin’s dictatorship, even Jeffrey Sachs realized that the economic shock therapy had failed. He set about trying to secure foreign aid to help the country recover, but he ultimately failed because his fellow economists weren’t interested in helping the US’s former enemy.

**However, when Sachs pitched his new plan to the US government and the IMF, they flatly refused to help Russia get back on its feet.** That was a devastating blow to Sachs, whose plans heavily relied on foreign aid money—in fact, that money was why Yeltsin had agreed to the economic shock therapy in the first place.

When people later asked what went wrong, Sachs admitted that he’d badly misread the situation back home in the West.

First of all, when Chicago School orthodoxy had first been pushed on the countries in the Southern Cone, it had been a bold new experiment in capitalism. Naturally, **those who stood to profit from shock therapy experiments had vested interests in making sure they succeeded.** Therefore, they provided aid money that wasn’t charity so much as it was an investment. By making sure the countries’ economies recovered and grew (and by ignoring the staggering human costs), they showed that shock therapy was effective, and thus they made sure that it would be used in other countries.

Secondly, while Sachs saw the end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union’s collapse as another opportunity for shock therapy, many others saw it as a rousing victory for capitalism and democracy. They still viewed Russia as an enemy—even though the conflict was officially over—so they had no interest in helping.

#### Capitalism’s Global Monopoly

In one sense, simple free-market ideology had held back aid to Russia. Basically, **with the Soviet Union gone, capitalism had a monopoly on the world.**

While the Soviet Union had been a world superpower, people could—at least theoretically—decide whether they supported capitalism or communism. During times of economic hardship, such as after World War II in Europe or during the Great Depression in America, socialism and communism always grew in popularity; having a government that promised to take care of people’s needs started sounding better than the ruthless individualism of pure capitalism.

Therefore, governments and economists had needed to soften capitalism and make it more appealing. They did this through government-sponsored jobs, social programs to make sure that people could afford to eat, and foreign aid to help countries who were suffering economically.

However, with the Soviet Union gone and Russia struggling, there was no threat to capitalism anymore. Capitalism’s major competitor had gone out of business, so to speak, so capitalists didn’t need to win people over—they had no other system to turn to.

In short, communism’s fall was the realization of the Chicago School’s dream: Pure capitalism, unfettered and unthreatened, holding a monopoly on the world.

### Ruthless Economics

The capitalism monopoly was on full display at an economic conference held in Washington, D.C. in January of 1993. **The main topic of the day was how to get politicians to pass policies that would be unpopular with their people.**

There were several recurring themes throughout the conference:

  * How soon after elections to begin economic shock therapy 
  * Whether it would be better to go through center-left parties instead of right-wing ones, so that the shock therapy would come as a sneak attack (as had happened with Solidarity in Poland)
  * The merits of warning people so they could prepare for the shock therapy, vs. catching them off guard so they couldn’t fight back



Jeffrey Sachs was booked to give a speech at the conference, and he used the opportunity to explain how badly people were suffering in Russia. In short, he was trying to appeal to the attendees’ humanity, so that they’d agree to send the aid that Russia needed.

His efforts failed, most likely because he’d misread the situation again. The conference attendees understood perfectly well how devastating an economic crisis was—they were familiar with Friedman’s crisis theory, and many of them had applied it in their own countries. However, where Sachs saw suffering people in need of foreign aid,**they only saw a desperate president Yeltsin auctioning off his country’s wealth for a fraction of its value.**

### An Invented Crisis in Canada

It was clear that Jeffrey Sachs had gone as far with Chicago School ideas as he cared to, but another economist, John Williamson, was more than willing to take up the reins.

Building on Friedman’s crisis theory, in which countries only submit to shock therapy when they’re suffering and desperate, **Williamson put forward the idea of actively causing crises.** Instead of waiting for opportunities, he asked, what if they could make their own?

Not even a month later, in February 1993, Canada was suffering economic disaster—or so the media claimed. The national newspaper warned that a debt crisis was looming. A TV special reported that Canada’s credit would run out within a year or two.

The overall message was that Canada was spending far more money than it could afford to. If this overspending continued, the media claimed, Wall Street would soon lower Canada’s credit rating. If that happened, wealthy investors would take their money somewhere safer.

**Canadians were told that the only way to avoid economic disaster was to drastically reduce government spending on things like healthcare and unemployment benefits.** The Liberal Party, which was in power at the time, did exactly that—despite having run on a platform of job creation and social programs. It was Canada’s version of the Solidarity party’s bait-and-switch.

#### The Lie Is Exposed Too Late

Two years after the peak of Canada’s debt hysteria, an investigative reporter named Linda McQuaig exposed the fraud. **She showed how the crisis had been invented by a few far-right think tanks, which were funded by some of Canada’s largest corporations and banks.**

McQuaig spoke with Vincent Truglia, the analyst in charge of determining Canada’s credit rating, and he told her something unusual: He’d been heavily pressured by Canadian bankers and corporate executives to lie about the country’s financial situation. Canada was the only country, he said, where people wanted him to _lower_ the credit rating instead of raise it.

Eventually, Truglia got so sick of the demands and the politicized numbers coming out of Canada that he personally issued a commentary on it. He promised that Canada’s spending was _not_ excessive. He took aim at the manipulated numbers coming from the think tanks, showing exactly where and how they were misrepresenting Canada’s finances.

However, by the time Canadians learned that there was no debt crisis looming, it was already too late. Politicians had passed the budget cuts and gutted the social safety net. Despite numerous budget surpluses since then, the cuts have yet to be fully reversed.

**It seemed that Williamson’s plan to create crises out of nothing worked perfectly.** By 1995, political talk in Western democracies was filled with warnings about debt crises and impending economic collapse.
