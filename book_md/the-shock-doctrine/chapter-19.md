## Chapter 19: Ecological Shocks

There’s one type of shock that we haven’t discussed yet: natural disasters. In this chapter, we’ll see how natural disasters can be just as effective as war or market shocks, if not more so.

Much of this section will be focused on Sri Lanka, which was devastated by a tsunami in 2004, which paved the way for privatization and free trade. **However, many other Asian countries suffered similar disasters and received similar “help” in the early 1990s and early 2000s.**

### Sri Lanka the Tourist Trap

Sri Lanka is a small country—roughly the size of West Virginia—but several things made it extremely attractive to the frontrunners of global capitalism:

  * It had a large amount and variety of wildlife like leopards, elephants, and monkeys.
  * Its beaches weren’t cluttered with high-rises and other such large buildings.
  * Its mountains featured many Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu holy sites.



In short, it was a perfect destination for tourism.

However, Sri Lanka’s east coast had long been threatened by ongoing civil war and was too dangerous for tourists. That changed in February 2002, when the two sides of the war signed a ceasefire agreement. The agreement wasn’t true peace, more like an uneasy break in the fighting, but it was enough.

Suddenly, guidebooks started pointing to the Sri Lankan coast as a hot new tourist destination. USAID, the World Bank, and the World Bank’s offshoot company the Asian Development Bank eagerly jumped into the newly peaceful area to start making plans. However, before any of their grand ideas for reconstruction could become reality, Sri Lanka would have to meet a now-familiar list of demands:

  * Sell off state-owned land (which comprised about 80% of Sri Lanka at the time)
  * Weaken labor laws
  * Make large cuts to government spending, meaning mass layoffs at government-owned companies
  * Open the fishing business to large industrial corporations, rather than allow it to be handled by individuals in small boats
  * Accept hefty loans from the World Bank and IMF—in this case, so that Sri Lanka could quickly update its infrastructure



The shock therapy plan, which was called _Regaining Sri Lanka_ , was finalized in early 2003 and the World Bank gave its stamp of approval. However, many Sri Lankans—particularly the impoverished fishers displaced by the fighting—resisted this plan for economic shock therapy.

For one thing, they’d just come out of a prolonged civil war, fighting for ideals like “homeland” and “territory.” Now that the fighting had finally paused, the plan called for them to give up what meager properties they had and allow corporate interests to build there. Naturally, the people had no interest in doing so.

For another, this was 2003, and the world’s love affair with global free-market capitalism had taken a severe hit after the Asian economic crisis. Many Sri Lankans predicted that, for most citizens, the sacrifices wouldn’t be worth the economic gains.

Sri Lankans soundly rejected the plan by USAID and the World Bank. First, a wave of strikes and protests swept the country. Then, in April 2004, the people voted in a group of center-left politicians and self-identified Marxists who swore that they’d scrap the entire plan.

### The 2004 Tsunami: Tragedy and Opportunity

That all changed on December 26, 2004, when a devastating tsunami hit Sri Lanka and almost completely cleared the shoreline. Every hut and fishing boat was swept away in the storm, along with tourist cabanas and bungalows. Approximately 35,000 Sri Lankans died, and almost a million lost their homes—most of whom were small-boat fishers who relied on the sea to live.

What was tragic for the fishers was a golden opportunity for the capitalists. Once the rubble and bodies had been cleared away from the shoreline, they were left with pristine beaches all along the coast. Plus, as always, the free-marketeers could use Sri Lanka’s time of need to make demands and gain concessions in exchange for aid. Even the most committed leftists couldn’t turn down IMF and World Bank money, which they desperately needed to rebuild the ravaged country.

Meanwhile, the people who had previously resisted with strikes and protests were busy with more immediate concerns. They had no income, no way to feed their families, and nowhere to live except the camps-turned-shantytowns. Herman Kumara, who was then the head of the National Fisheries Solidarity Movement—an organization representing the small-boat fishers—explained that by the time his constituents recovered from the tsunami, it would be far too late.

(As a side note, the disaster capitalists had practiced for this scenario a few years earlier, in 1998, when Hurricane Mitch devastated several countries in Central America. In the months after the hurricane, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala all accepted rapid privatization (often selling state-owned industries for a fraction of their worth) in exchange for foreign aid.

However, those countries had experienced the old version of economic shock therapy; the plans for Sri Lanka were even more ambitious. They aimed to give corporations not just investment opportunities, but direct control over the reconstruction.)

President Kumaratunga, pressured by lenders from Washington, determined that the plans for rebuilding couldn’t be handled by elected officials. Instead, she formed the Task Force to Rebuild the Nation, a group of ten of the country’s most powerful banking and industry executives—fully half of whom were involved in the tourism sector.

Not one member of the Task Force represented the fishers or farmers of Sri Lanka. Moreover, there wasn’t a single scientist, environmentalist, or disaster-reconstruction expert among them. Nonetheless, this group would create and implement the plan for Sri Lanka’s reconstruction.

**In essence, the country’s democracy—which had firmly rejected the Chicago School’s agenda—had been swept aside and replaced with direct corporatist rule.**

#### Rebuilding Sri Lanka

The Sri Lankan government moved almost immediately to prove that it was willing to accept the disaster capitalists’ terms. President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who had run on a platform rejecting privatization, described the tsunami as a religious epiphany. She claimed that it had been a sign from nature itself that Sri Lanka wasn’t making proper use of its rich natural resources.

For example, just four days after the tsunami, Kumaratunga’s government pushed through a bill that would clear the way for water privatization. Most of her citizens didn’t even notice it had happened. Meanwhile, the Task Force drafted a complete plan for national reconstruction—a feat they somehow accomplished in only ten days, without ever leaving the capital.

The Task Force promised to rebuild the devastated shoreline better than it was before—however, what their plan really did was make sure that the small-boat fishers didn’t come back to the newly-cleared beaches. The hotels were much more profitable than the local workers, and therefore much more attractive to foreign investors.

Meanwhile, the US supported reconstruction efforts using the same method as in Iraq: namely, massive contracts to its own companies. The only direct aid that the US gave to the fishers was a $1 million grant to improve Sri Lanka’s “temporary” shelters—a clear sign that they weren’t meant to be temporary at all.

Unrest rose among the displaced fishers. Many of them had lived on that land for generations, and were willing to fight for it. A short while later, though the peace treaty was technically still in effect, the tension erupted into violence.

As a result of the renewed fighting, many aid organizations pulled out of Sri Lanka. Other organizations shifted their efforts south, to the safer government-controlled areas. That shift only intensified the now common feeling among northerners that the aid money was being spent unfairly.

In July 2006, the northern faction officially called off the ceasefire. The civil war was back on, and more than 4,000 people died over the next year.

It’s unclear whether disaster capitalism directly sparked the renewed fighting, but one thing is certain: **For peace to flourish, it has to be more attractive to the average person than war is.** Armies need to feed and house their fighters, so average Sri Lankans may have been better off during the civil war than they were in the Chicago School economy. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Sri Lanka turned back to fighting.

#### The “Second Tsunami” of Globalization

The same pattern repeated itself in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Maldives: deadly storms, desperate people, privatized reconstruction, coastal “buffer zones” that don’t apply to industry, and widespread violence.

The devastating storms allowed displacement and gentrification that would normally happen over the course of years to take place in mere days or weeks. Capitalists didn’t have to fight to get people off their land—nature had taken care of that for them.

When the people tried to come back to their homes, or what was left of their homes, they found that the buffer zones were being enforced by the guns of police officers and private security firms. Countries all over Asia were seeing militarized gentrification—literal class wars.

In Thailand, for example, developers had armed security forces fencing off coastal land less than 24 hours after the tsunami hit. In some places, those guards wouldn’t even let people search their destroyed homes for the bodies of their loved ones.

The Chicago School’s crusade for unfettered free markets invariably creates a permanent underclass that comprises anywhere from 25% to 60% of the population. It’s class warfare, often backed up by actual military or police force.

However, when that model is forced onto a country that’s already devastated by disaster and conflict—such as Sri Lanka—the effects can be even worse. The strictly enforced peace comes with heavy costs, including the possibility of even deadlier wars.
