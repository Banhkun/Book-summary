## Conclusion: Recovering as Communities

**The final chapter of _The Shock Doctrine_ is a message of hope.** After spending so much time focused on the devastating effects of neoliberalism and disaster capitalism, we’ll end by taking a look at people and communities that are recovering from their brutal shock treatments.

In short, no matter how bad the state of shock is, it’ll wear off eventually. Avoiding similar shocks in the future is a matter of understanding disaster capitalism and rejecting it. Places like Thailand have done exactly that—local communities worked together to rebuild, without any damaging “help” from foreign interests.

### Shock Doesn’t Last Forever

**As we’ve seen, free-market economics always result in a huge transfer of wealth and power from the lower economic classes to the upper ones.** That transfer never happens peacefully, and in many cases, it doesn’t happen legally. That’s why the Shock Doctrine is necessary for the Chicago School and other free-market crusaders: Their economic reforms can only go through when the people are too exhausted or stunned to fight back.

However, by its very nature, shock eventually wears off. In the 2000s, many former economic shock labs—from the Southern Cone to Lebanon to China—started to shake off the effects of their treatments.

For example, in 2001 Argentina ousted a series of five presidents in three weeks, all while demanding freedom from the IMF’s austerity measures. Many other Latin American countries have refused to enter into further deals with the IMF and the World Bank, which frees them from the restrictions imposed by those organizations.

**In 2006, millions of Lebanese firmly rejected foreign aid after Israeli attacks.** Despite being deeply in debt and desperate for funds, Lebanese economists and some political leaders recognized that all the profit would go to the disaster capitalism complex and all the hardship would fall upon their own people.

Although Lebanon’s prime minister did accept the funds, and the terms that came with them, the citizens were much less cooperative. General strikes and protests erupted all over the country and brought the economy to a screeching halt.

The upheavals around the world are existential threats to free-market ideology. Remember, one of the Chicago School’s central claims is that free-market capitalism and democracy are inseparable elements of freedom; but now, **politicians from the US to Venezuela are starting to win elections by opposing neoliberal economics.**

Even in the US—where the Bush administration cemented “free enterprise” into the National Security Strategy and backed it up with the threat of the world’s largest military—people are rejecting Chicago School orthodoxy. A 2006 poll by the New York Times and CBS found that 64% of Americans believe that the country should have universal healthcare, and were willing to pay a bit more in taxes to reach that goal.

#### Rebuilding Communities

Unfortunately, those people shaking off the effects of shock now face two major problems. The first is that, although people are starting to buck the disaster capitalism complex and the free-market fundamentalism behind it, there are some ugly aftereffects from the hardship those people faced.

First of all, people want easy solutions to their problems, and **the easiest solution is always a scapegoat.** Marginalized people of all kinds find themselves on the wrong end of this “solution,” as seen in the anti-immigrant propaganda in the US—claims that illegal immigrants are stealing jobs and burdening the economy have proven very effective at redirecting economic anger and fear.

Second, as we saw in Iraq and Sri Lanka, **desperate people often turn to extremism and violence.** When combined with the previously mentioned scapegoating, this creates an unstable and dangerous mix that often erupts into violence against marginalized people—the very people who suffer the most under neoliberal economics.

Finally, perhaps the biggest problem of all is that people now have to rebuild their entire countries from the rubble that economic shock therapy left behind, and they have to do it largely without foreign aid. However, despite being such a daunting task, it’s also where we can see the most hope—because **communities all over the world are already doing it.**

For example, Thailand was hit by a tsunami that was every bit as bad as the one that hit Sri Lanka. However, unlike Sri Lanka, the Thai people rebuilt their own settlements and fishing communities, often within mere months.

Although Thailand’s politicians tried to evict them and develop the newly-cleared beaches, hundreds of people simply marched past the guards and set about the work of cleaning up and rebuilding. The people were ready to risk their lives to keep their land, and they were completely unwilling to wait in camps for a reconstruction plan like the ones in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.

A year after Hurricane Katrina hit, community leaders in New Orleans found inspiration in the rebuilt villages of Thailand. Endesha Juakali, who founded the “survivors’ village” in New Orleans, immediately set to work hiring local contractors and recruiting volunteers to fix the neighborhoods through direct action. Furthermore, like the Thai people reoccupying their own land despite the guards, many residents of New Orleans simply returned to their old homes and refused to leave.

In those two places—along with everywhere else that citizens have bucked the disaster capitalism complex and taken reconstruction into their own hands—**people say that they’re not just healing their communities, but themselves as well.**

Shock is, in essence, a feeling of powerlessness; people feel themselves swept away by forces they can’t hope to resist, let alone control. Therefore, rebuilding their own communities is an expression of their own power and a rejection of that helplessness.

The reconstruction efforts also wholly reject the endless quest for clean slates upon which to build model civilizations. These people aren’t starting from scratch, but from the ruins of their old homes. They make do with whatever tools and materials they can salvage, and their only ideologies are community and practicality.

It _is_ possible to recover from economic shock and protect against future shocks. As we’re seeing all over the world, it simply requires people to understand the nature of disaster capitalism and reject it. That’s easier said than done—the free market crusade won’t let go of its markets easily—but it can be done.

As we’re now seeing, communities can join together to support each other and rebuild, rather than waiting for external aid that comes with ulterior motives. **These communities are coming back quickly, efficiently, and—most important of all—durably;** the people won’t be taken in again by the false promises of economic shock therapy and disaster capitalism.
