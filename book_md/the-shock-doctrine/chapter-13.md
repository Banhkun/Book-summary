## Chapter 13: Shock Therapy in Asia

In this chapter, we’ll explore how the Chicago School’s crisis theory paved the way for vast new markets in Asia. **However, we’ll also see the first signs that economic shock therapy can fail by going too far** —if people suffer too much, too quickly, they might try to overthrow the free market and replace it with a more balanced system. That exact thing happened in Indonesia, where the people rose up to oust their leader after one too many shocks.

### The “Asian Tigers”

In the late 1990s, financial trouble in Thailand quickly spread throughout the region and led to the near-collapse of many Asian economies. Friedman and his followers saw this crisis as an opening that they could use to establish their policies.

These suffering countries had, just a year before, been held up on pedestals as prime examples of how globalization and free trade could produce enormous economic growth. Free market advocates called them the “Asian Tigers,” and they seemed to have a point: The Tigers’ economies were certainly growing at incredible rates.

However, their growth wasn’t due to unrestricted free markets. The Tigers had heavy government involvement in the economy, and strict policies that prevented foreigners from owning land or national firms. **If anything, they were evidence that a _mixed_ economy—with elements of both capitalism and socialism—was the key to rapid growth and stability. **

#### Economic Turmoil in Asia

The trouble began when an unsubstantiated rumor spread that Thailand didn’t have enough wealth to support its currency. **In the newly globalized, electronic market, that alone was enough to trigger an economic disaster.** Banks called in loans, which served to pop the quickly inflating housing bubble. Half-finished construction projects were abandoned all over the country, and the economy took a devastating hit.

Mutual fund brokers had previously presented the Asian countries as a single investment package. As a result, the crisis quickly spread beyond Thailand to Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and South Korea. Those countries had to empty their reserve banks just to sustain their currencies, which caused the unfounded rumor to become a reality: **Now they really were going broke.**

Decades’ worth of wealth disappeared from Asian stock markets in a single year. Naturally, as the economic situation in Asia worsened, investors were less willing to put money into those countries. Asian nations were caught in a cycle of fear that could only be stopped by a sudden, large influx of money.

**However, the message from the financial establishment was clear: do not help Asia.** Milton Friedman himself appeared on CNN to insist that the market be allowed to correct itself, as per Chicago School orthodoxy.

In November 1997, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, US president Bill Clinton made their position clear: The US Treasury wouldn’t be stepping in. The IMF was similarly reluctant—when it finally did respond, it wasn’t with a simple loan, but a list of now-familiar demands that would implement free-market economies in the affected countries.

Those countries who accepted the IMF’s “help” suggested that their problems had started because of how easily money could flow across their borders, so maybe they should put some economic controls back in place. However, the IMF refused to even consider that idea. In other words, **the IMF had no interest in what had created the crisis; they just wanted to use that crisis as leverage.**

Because ordinary people wouldn’t accept the IMF’s demands, those countries’ governments had to make policy changes through emergency decrees, which left average citizens with no say in the matter. **Once again, free-market reforms had trampled over democracy.**

### The Results

**The IMF’s “intervention” in Asia produced results almost as devastating as those in Russia.** At its worst point, Thailand was losing 2,000 jobs every day. In South Korea, 300,000 workers got fired per month. Indonesia’s unemployment rate climbed from 4 to 12 percent. In all, an estimated 24 million people lost their jobs.

As a result, the middle class shrank dramatically—63.7% of South Koreans identified themselves as middle class in 1996, and only 38.4% did so in 1999. Suicide rates and child prostitution rates increased as desperate families looked for any way out of their crushing poverty.

In spite of the human costs of their policies, the IMF thought that things were going well, economically speaking. It had taken less than a year to implement economic shock therapy programs in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Korea. Now they were ready to reintroduce those countries to the global markets—which, they hoped, would immediately start buying up the newly available currencies, bonds, and stocks.

**Instead, the exact opposite happened.** Would-be investors reasoned that, if those countries had been in such dire straits that their economies had to be remade from the ground up, then Asia must be in much worse condition than they’d thought. Rather than rushing to take advantage of these new opportunities, investors pulled out even more of their money, further worsening the crisis.

While the people suffered, vulture capitalists were only too happy to pick over the remains. Major Wall Street firms moved in and started cheaply buying shares in major companies like Kia. Samsung, once an industry titan, was divided up and the pieces sold off for a fraction of their former value. Daewoo’s car division, once valued at $6 billion, was sold to General Motors for only $400 million. It was Russia all over again, but this time the local firms were being pushed aside by multinational corporations.

The brutal economic crisis in Asia revealed how badly economic shock therapy could backfire: Not only did citizens of the “Asian Tigers” suffer terribly, but the investors whom the IMF hoped to attract wanted nothing to do with those countries.

#### Unexpected Backlash

The debacle in Asia also showed that **if shock therapy went too far, it could spark a backlash to free-market thinking.** For example, in Indonesia—where there had been a low-burning public rage ever since Suharto’s 1965 coup—the IMF went one step too far by demanding that Suharto raise the price of gasoline. In response, the people finally rose up and ousted the former general.

While Indonesia had the most dramatic backlash to the IMF’s free-market policies, people all over Asia were enraged at how their lives could be destroyed by the careless whims of hedge funds on the other side of the planet. Unlike in Russia, where the hardship could be spun as a painful but necessary transition from Communism to a free market economy, the Asian crisis was clearly the fault of the global markets. Then, when those same markets sent “help” to the suffering countries, all they did was make matters worse.

### South America Fights Back

While countries across Asia voiced their outrage at the IMF’s callousness, **the real revolution came at the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in 1999.** Developing countries across South America banded together to reject further trade concessions with the US and Europe—openly flouting their prior agreements. With neither side willing to back down, the talks eventually collapsed.

While some tried to write off the incident as a bump in the road on the way to global free-market capitalism, the resistance persisted, and it soon became clear that the economic landscape had shifted. The US government’s dreams of a free-trade zone encompassing the entire Asia-Pacific region, and another involving the Americas from Alaska to Chile, had to be abandoned.

**One major reason for this shift was that the world was, briefly, in a period of relative calm.** The debt shocks had worn off, the transitions to free-market capitalism were done, and there was no major world conflict to pull people’s attention. That left the Chicago School’s abysmal track record—namely, the massive inequality and corruption in every country that adopted free-market policies—at the center of international conversations.

It’s worth noting that capitalism’s monopoly on the world only lasted eight years: It started with the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 and ended when the WTO talks broke down in 1999. Now, once again, competing ideologies were rising up to loosen the free market’s global stranglehold.

However, increased opposition wouldn’t stop the free-market capitalists from trying to advance their agenda. Soon, the world would be rocked by larger shocks than ever, and the free market fundamentalists would keep using the disorientation and anxiety of those shocks to continue their deadly work.
