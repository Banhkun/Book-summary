## Chapter 3: The First Shock Experiment

In the previous chapter, we discussed the Chicago School’s first forays into establishing neoliberal economies in foreign countries. With the backing of the US government, some of these attempts worked—but their efforts in Chile failed badly.

This chapter discusses the turning point in the battle for Chile when General Pinochet launched a coup and seized the country from President Allende. As we’ll see, Pinochet was much more receptive to the Chicago School’s ideas than Allende, and he was willing to use whatever force was necessary to realize those ideas in Chile. **By understanding this history, we’ll see how free-market capitalism and brutal repression go hand in hand.**

### General Pinochet’s Coup

On September 11, 1973, Chilean general Augusto Pinochet declared war on President Allende. Because Pinochet controlled the military and police, Allende’s forces were wiped out in brutal fashion—24 rockets launched directly into the presidential palace put a swift end to the resistance. The “war” was over by mid-afternoon.

**However, the military coup was only the beginning.** Pinochet and the other generals knew that their grasp on Chile depended on the people fearing them too much to mount any organized resistance, so over the next days, an estimated 13,500 civilians were imprisoned. Many were tortured, and hundreds were executed.

To ensure that the whole country got the message Pinochet sent one of his most vicious men, General Stark, to the northern provinces. In each city and town that Stark passed through, he and his men would visit the prisons and find high-profile political opponents to publicly execute. His mission came to be called the Caravan of Death, and its message was inescapable: to resist Pinochet was to die.

#### Chile’s Shock Treatment

The new government began running into problems almost immediately. Nixon’s economic war on Chile had taken a toll, and Pinochet—who was by no means an economist—was ill-prepared to help it recover.

**While Pinochet handled the military matters, Chile’s Chicago-trained economists quickly published and distributed** their 500-page economic bible, which came to be known simply as The Brick. Soon, copies of The Brick were on the desks of those military officers who would be running the new government.

The plan laid out in this lengthy book bore all the hallmarks of Milton Friedman’s teachings. It called for deregulation, privatization, and few-to-no social programs run by the government. The economists assured Pinochet that the market would naturally govern itself, and would find its proper balance shortly after he withdrew government interference.

These were exactly the same ideas that the Chicago School had tried to implement peacefully, only to be soundly rejected. However, this time, anyone who would have resisted was either dead, imprisoned, or terrified into submission.**** Pinochet’s government gladly adopted The Brick’s policies.

**Their extreme free-market experiment was a disaster.** Inflation skyrocketed, jobs were lost as the market was flooded with imports, and starvation quickly spread. Even Pinochet himself seemed concerned about how badly his people were suffering.

Naturally, the Chicago-trained fundamentalists believed that the problem wasn’t with their ideas, but with the fact that they weren’t being implemented strictly enough. Rather than roll back the changes, they argued, Pinochet must accelerate them. Seeing that their experiment was wildly unpopular and in danger of collapsing, they called in Milton Friedman himself to save the day.

Friedman met with Pinochet and promised him much the same thing that the Chilean economists had: If he were to quickly and drastically reduce government spending, and remove all obstacles to free trade, Chile’s recovery would be nothing short of miraculous. All the people who had lost their jobs would quickly find new ones in the soon-to-be-burgeoning private sector.

Friedman repeatedly used the phrase “shock treatment.” Much like Dr. Cameron proposed, as discussed in Chapter 1, he was calling for Pinochet to break his country’s economy back down to a perfectly blank slate. By doing so, Friedman promised, inflation and unemployment would be eliminated within months.

#### The Effects of Shock Therapy

Like so many who heard Friedman speak, Pinochet became a convert. He gladly subjected his country to the shock therapy that Friedman prescribed, and the effects were brutal. Chile’s economy shrank by 15% in the first year of these new policies, while unemployment—which had been just 3% under Allende—climbed to 20%. Families were now spending the vast majority of their income just to buy bread, and forgoing “luxuries” like bus fare and milk.

The patient was definitely convulsing. However, contrary to Friedman’s promises, these convulsions didn’t last mere months; they went on for years, with no signs of improvement. Meanwhile, Pinochet’s junta continued to promise that this was the only way to treat the “sickness” of developmentalism that had supposedly ravaged the country.

Pinochet’s government went even further, implementing Friedman’s most extreme policies. They replaced the public school system with charter schools and vouchers, eliminated public health care, and privatized cemeteries, kindergartens, and even the social security program. Chile became a model for free-market economists the world over, who had previously only seen their ideals printed in textbooks.

#### The Chilean “Miracle”

It’s worth noting that Chile did experience some years of steady economic growth under Pinochet—however, that growth didn’t happen until the mid-80s. That was a decade after Pinochet first tried Friedman’s economic shock therapy, and long after he’d radically changed course.

**Chile had faced total economic collapse in 1982.** Free-market capitalism had put all of Chile’s assets in the hands of speculators and financial institutions, who’d proceeded to run up a massive $14 billion debt. Once again inflation ran rampant, and unemployment climbed to a crushing 30%.

In order to save his country, Pinochet had to do what Allende had done years before: Nationalize major industries and put a firm hand on the economy. Furthermore, following the shock therapy debacle, nearly all of the Chicago-trained economists lost their government posts, and several were investigated for fraud.

Nonetheless, after Pinochet died in 2006, many publications—including the New York Times and the Washington Post—praised his free-market policies and the economic miracle they’d created. None of those publications seemed to realize that **the “miracle” hadn’t happened until he abandoned Friedman’s economic theories.**

### The Spread of Chicago Economics

Despite the terrible repercussions, Chile was the beginning—the Chicago School’s first major victory against developmentalism and Keynesian economics.

**The Chilean plan, as laid out in The Brick, would later be implemented in many other South American countries.** In every case, it would be pushed through by a combination of government force and corporate wealth, and it would take place during some sort of national crisis. Eventually, every country that had once been a model of developmentalism—Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina—would be under the control of a military junta with US backing.

Of these, Argentina’s implementation of Chicago economics may have been the most brutal and horrific. The Argentine generals who ousted Isabel Perón turned to Pinochet for advice on their next steps. They didn’t privatize everything quite as quickly as Pinochet had—for instance, the oil reserves and social security remained under government control, at least at first. Otherwise, though, the methods were much the same, as were the results: runaway inflation, soaring unemployment, starvation, and disease.

However, their methods of keeping order were a bit different. While Pinochet’s public massacres were extremely effective at keeping the population in line, they were a public relations nightmare. Since the entire point of Chicago economics was to trade with wealthy outsiders, it was counterproductive to have such a horrific reputation that other countries refused to trade with you.

Therefore, the Argentine generals settled on disappearances as their preferred means of eliminating opposition. Rather than publicly slaughtering people who spoke out against them, they’d simply kidnap those people. Sometimes they did so in secret, spreading the terrifying knowledge that the state could simply whisk anyone away at any time, with no warning. Other times they arrested people very publicly as a show of force. It’s estimated that some 30,000 Argentine citizens were taken during these years.

While not as dramatic as Pinochet’s methods, they were equally effective. Though everyone knew what was happening, they were too afraid to speak out—indeed, most would pretend that nothing was wrong. Argentines even have a phrase to sum up that combination of knowledge and denial: “We didn’t know what no one could deny.”

### The Economic Truth and the “War on Terror” Story

Rodolfo Walsh, an investigative journalist who lived in Argentina during this time, had been keeping records of the junta’s many crimes. However, he wrote, the worst part of the regime wasn’t the arrests or the torture, but the economic policies. **In those policies, Walsh said, you found not only the motive for these atrocities—that is, funneling more wealth to the wealthy—but also a system that deliberately torments millions of people with crushing poverty.**

However, while the juntas didn’t make any secret of the fact that they were implementing sweeping economic changes, they were smart enough to deny that they were using violence to achieve those goals. Instead, when they acknowledged the kidnappings and killings at all, they justified their actions on the grounds that they were fighting against Marxist terrorists funded by—and beholden to—Russia’s KGB. If their tactics were monstrous, well, it was only because their enemy was, too.

Argentina's Admiral Massera, speaking in terms that sound strangely familiar today, said that they were fighting a war for freedom and life itself, against people who wanted to impose tyrannical Communism. He also called these imaginary adversaries nihilists, claiming that their only purpose was to destroy everything—though, he said, they would hide their true intentions behind populism and social justice.

Once again, the CIA played a hand in the misinformation campaign. They worked to recast Chile’s ousted president Allende as a dictator in the making; a man who came to power through democracy, but was working to create a Russian-style police state. They claimed that the left-wing guerrilla fighters in Uruguay and Argentina were so numerous and deadly that the new governments had no choice but to suspend civil liberties and do whatever was necessary to crush them.

**All of these claims were either grossly exaggerated or completely made up by the juntas, as later investigations by the US Senate would show.** People were kidnapped, tortured, and killed long after any credible threat to the new regimes was over. The so-called War on Terror was actually a war on anyone who opposed the juntas’ free-market fundamentalism.
