## Chapter 2: Milton Friedman’s Counter-Revolution

In this chapter, we introduce some of the key players in free-market economics: the Chicago School of Economics and its great hero Milton Friedman. We’ll discuss their retaliation against FDR’s New Deal in the US and similar programs in South America, and their early efforts to replace those programs with their own vision of perfect free-market capitalism—efforts that would, in time, lead to the modern disaster capitalism complex.

### The Chicago School of Economics

**Disaster capitalism got its start in the University of Chicago’s Economics Department in the 1950s, under Milton Friedman.** He wasn’t the only economist of his day who believed in free trade without government interference, but it was Friedman’s energy and charisma that helped the idea to really take root in his students. After Friedman’s courses, they viewed themselves not as mere economists, but as soldiers fighting a righteous war against harmful government overreach and interference.

Much like Dr. Cameron, Friedman believed that he needed to start with a blank slate. He dreamed of a country that was free from economic regulations, rules, and special interests, where pure capitalism could run its natural course. Also like Cameron, Friedman thought that the only way to reach such a state was through painful, destructive shocks to the country’s economy. He thought that by tearing down the old systems, he’d be able to build a new, healthier economy.

Friedman’s ideas about capitalism bordered on mysticism: He and his students saw the economic laws of supply and demand, inflation, and employment (or unemployment) as sacred and inviolable. He believed that these “natural” economic forces would balance one another perfectly and create the ideal market—there would be exactly the right number of products at the perfect prices, everyone who wanted to work could find a job, and inflation wouldn’t exist.

**According to the Chicago School of Economics, any problems that arise _must_ be because the market isn’t really free, and the solution _must_ be to remove all regulations and interference. **

In short, Friedman’s version of capitalism was more like religious fundamentalism than science. Furthermore, like religious fundamentalists, his greatest enemies weren’t the fundamentalists of other “religions” like Marxism. Rather, he despised those who sought a mix of capitalism and government intervention, such as social democrats or _Keynesians_ (described below).

#### Keynesian Economics

John Maynard Keynes was a hugely influential economist in the early 1900s. His ideas were so prominent that, even to this day, there’s a school of economic thought that bears his name.

_Keynesian economics_ is based on increasing demand in the economy by increasing government spending and economic intervention, while at the same time cutting taxes. In simple terms, **this school of thought suggests bolstering the economy by giving average people more spending money.**

Keynesians favored capitalism in some aspects of the economy but demanded government-controlled education, government ownership of essential services like water, and strict laws to keep private companies in check.

### Backlash Against the New Deal

Mixed economic systems like Keynesian economics, which featured heavy government intervention in essential areas, came to prominence in the 1930s through the 1950s. Perhaps the most notable of them was Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal in the US.

These mixed systems only became more entrenched after World War II, when German fascism had taken root largely due to economic instability following World War I. Therefore, following the Second World War, **the world superpowers agreed that markets needed to provide stability and dignity for average people.** That agreement led to Social Security in America, national health care in Canada, and many other hallmarks of what one might call “decent” capitalism.

The world seemed to be prospering and things were good for the common folks, which left Friedman and his free-market capitalists with few supporters. However, what was good for the majority was _not_ good for the rich and powerful—executives of major US corporations weren’t happy about having to redistribute their wealth through taxes and increased worker salaries.

Even so, rich executives couldn't simply argue for lower taxes and lower wages—they would have seemed selfish. Instead, they promoted the economic theories of Milton Friedman, **who developed a three-part agenda that he believed would return the economy to its natural, healthy state:**

  1. Governments must eliminate all laws and regulations that hinder corporate profits
  2. Governments must sell off any assets that corporations could run instead
  3. Funding for social programs must be drastically cut—or, ideally, eliminated entirely



(Shortform note: One of the major difficulties in discussing Friedman’s movement is that it has rebranded itself many times, often using terms that seem to have opposite meanings to one another. For example, Friedman called himself _liberal_ —but his followers in the US associate that term with long hair and high taxes, and prefer to call themselves _conservative_. Furthermore, the ideas that Friedman promoted would be called _neoliberal_ in most of the world, but the American branch of that movement adopted the term _neoconservative_ in the 1990s. For this guide, we’ll use Friedman’s term _neoliberal_.)

Whatever one calls it, Friedman’s economic strategy was designed to roll back New Deal policies and reset the American economy to how it was before the Great Depression, and then push even further in favor of privatization and corporate profits. However, his ideas were impossible to implement in America at the time because the New Deal’s programs were incredibly popular. Even when Eisenhower—a hard-line Republican—took office in 1953, he didn’t dare to overturn the New Deal for fear of losing re-election.

### Fighting Back Against Developmentalism

Since not even Eisenhower could push through the neoliberal agenda in the US,**he and the Chicago School started looking abroad for easier targets.**

When Eisenhower took office, **countries in the Middle East and Latin America were quickly growing and prospering thanks to _developmentalism_. **Developmentalism is an economic theory stating that the best way for developing countries to grow is to establish strong internal industries and raise government revenue by nationalizing certain resources like oil. In other words, industry and the government would support one another, and the entire country’s economy would prosper as a result. Developmentalism also called for high tariffs on imported goods to encourage “buying local.”

Developmentalism, combined with heavy government spending and strong social programs, was having enormous positive impacts on the economy and quality of life in many Third World countries. For example, Argentina had the largest middle class in South America during the Developmentalist period, while Uruguay boasted universal health care and a 95% literacy rate.

However, as we saw in America, the policies that helped the common people were hurting the rich and powerful. Corporate interests and feudal landowners saw that the government was taking “their” land and money and giving it away to the lower classes.

To counter the economic policies that were hurting their profits, corporations enlisted the help of American and British foreign policy groups to warn that developmentalist policies would lead to communism. **In short, they wanted to push developing countries into the Us versus Them mindset of the Cold War:** Anything that wasn’t pure, unchecked capitalism was communism, and communism was evil.

### Expanding the Cold War

**In the interest of furthering the fight against “communism,” the CIA launched two coups d’etat against Iran and Guatemala** —two countries whose economies were much more Keynesian than Stalinist.

In 1953 the CIA ousted Mohammad Mossadegh, an Iranian leader who had brought the nation’s oil company under government control. In doing so, the CIA returned power to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was more willing to cooperate with foreign companies.

Then, in 1954, the CIA overthrew President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman of Guatemala, allowing the United Fruit Company—a massive American corporation with a long history of violence and human rights violations—to operate unimpeded.

Those first coups happened relatively easily. However, developmentalism was much more entrenched in the Southern Cone of South America (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, which together had some of the most advanced and successful developmentalist economies), and fighting it would take a bit more cunning.

#### Brazil and Indonesia

The US studied Brazil and Indonesia—both of which had recently undergone regime changes—as possible models for how to successfully **oust the entrenched developmentalist governments of the Southern Cone and replace them with radically capitalist ones.**

##### Brazil’s Gentler Coup

**In 1964, a US-backed _junta_ (a military faction) overthrew the Brazilian government in a relatively peaceful manner.** There were no public shows of brutality or mass arrests, and while junta officials did torture some of their political opponents, they did so on a small scale and kept it well-hidden.

The junta imposed a pro-business economic model designed, in large part, by University of Chicago graduates. However, Brazil’s poverty rates skyrocketed under that model, and in 1968—a mere four years later—protesters flooded the streets.

In the face of these mass protests, the military junta became more openly violent. It crushed the people’s remaining freedoms, mass arrests and torture became the order of the day, and the last vestiges of democracy were brutally repressed.

**Overall, it was clear evidence that a gentle touch couldn’t keep the people in line.**

##### Indonesia

The 1965 coup in Indonesia proceeded very differently. Then-president Sukarno had pushed pro-poor policies and carefully protected Indonesia’s economy from Western influence, which led to a strong national economy but effectively shut out the global market.

In 1965, the US supplied oppositional Indonesian general, Suharto, with weapons and supplies from the Pentagon, as well as intelligence from the CIA. With that support, **Suharto launched a brutal and systematic campaign to wipe out the country’s left-wing.**

In a little over a month, somewhere between half a million and a million people had been killed by Suharto’s soldiers and their supporters. Reports from that time talk about streams and small rivers clogged with dead bodies.

Then, a group of economists trained at the University of California at Berkeley drew up the plans for Indonesia’s future. They passed their lessons on to Suharto, who had no prior education in economics or finance. Therefore, they had enormous influence over his ideas about how to run the country. While not quite as fundamentalist as Friedman’s Chicago-trained fanatics, the Berkeley economists were extremely welcoming toward foreign investors who wanted to exploit Indonesia’s resources, which was good enough for America and Britain.

**Of the two, Indonesia’s regime change had been far more effective.** The suddenness and unthinkable brutality of Suharto’s military coup, along with the cooperation of free-market capitalists to set up the new economic structure, left Indonesia’s people too broken and scared to fight back. Though there wasn’t yet a term for it, Suharto had used the Shock Doctrine to push through his reforms.

### The Chile Project

Despite the brutal effectiveness of Suharto’s coup in Indonesia, the US decided to try something different in Chile.**US officials worked together with the University of Chicago to organize an educational coup, rather than a political one.**

The government paid to bring top Chilean students to study at the University of Chicago. At the same time, the University sent professors to Chile to train students and teachers in their fundamentalist style of capitalism. In true University of Chicago style, they worked to create righteous crusaders who would fight back against the “evils” of developmentalism.

Under the University’s tutelage, every aspect of Chile’s social programs was studied and picked apart. Students were taught to scorn attempts to help the poor, and to view Chile’s education and healthcare systems as the ridiculous attempts of a poor country to live beyond its means. Many of those students would go on to do their Ph.D. dissertations about the foolishness of developmentalism in Latin America.

The first part of this plan worked perfectly. Students took what they’d learned from the University of Chicago and went back to Chile to proselytize. However, the next step—using these ideological soldiers to turn the Southern Cone into Friedman’s imagined free-market paradise— _wasn’t_ working. The main economic debate of the Southern Cone was still about the proper next step for developmentalism, not about how to overturn it and implement free-market capitalism. The vaunted Chicago-trained economists were all but ignored.

**By the 1970s it seemed that the Chile Project, as it was called, had been an expensive failure for the Chicago School.** The Southern Cone continued moving to the left politically and economically, while the ideas of the Chicago School of Economics weren’t even a blip on its radar.

#### Nixon’s Economic War on Chile

When then-president Richard Nixon heard that Salvador Allende had won the 1970 election in Chile—running on a platform of nationalizing major portions of the economy that were currently being run by corporations—**he famously ordered CIA director Helms to “make the economy scream.”**

Heeding the call to arms, powerful American corporations—who had large stakes in Chile’s phone service, mining operations, and other industries that would soon be bought up by the government—banded together to squeeze Chile’s economy. They planned to block US loans, stop buying anything from Chile for six months, and do whatever they could to make sure that no American money flowed into the country. They planned to make Allende capitulate by threatening him with total economic collapse.

But for all their efforts, Allende not only kept his office, but his party also gained even more support in the 1973 midterm elections. Clearly, the Chilean people strongly supported Allende’s socialist policies. Even if the corporations successfully ousted Allende, it seemed certain that someone just as progressive would come along to take his place.

In 1972 an explosive exposé revealed documents showing that **the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) had conspired with the CIA and the US State Department to stop Allende from taking power** —a plot that clearly failed, as Allende had taken office and still held it at the time of the exposé. Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate launched an investigation, and in 1973 released a damning report showing that ITT’s corporate interests had had a direct and substantial impact on US foreign policy toward Chile.

However, even supported by the highest powers in the US, the University of Chicago was unable to overthrow developmentalism in Chile. Clearly, the free market capitalists would need more extreme tactics to bring about the regime changes they dreamed of.
