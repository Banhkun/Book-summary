## Chapter 2: Balance Planning With Opportunity

Understanding what motivates you is the first piece of a strategy for career happiness. The second is balancing your plans with unexpected opportunities that come up. Both companies and individuals must know how to do this in order to thrive.

### The Theory of Emergent Opportunities

Once formulated, every strategy continues to evolve in response to options that develop. There are two types of options:

**1) Anticipated opportunities** : These are opportunities you identify and choose to pursue. When you create a plan based on opportunities you see, you’re pursuing a deliberate strategy.

**2) Unanticipated opportunities** : These are a combination of problems and opportunities you run into while implementing your deliberate plan. They essentially compete for resources (money, time, attention) with your deliberate plan. When these unexpected things come up, you must decide whether to stick with the plan, adjust it, or replace it with one of the new options. You may make an outright decision, or an implicit one in which the cumulative impact of daily decisions evolves your strategy. **A strategy that evolves this way is called an emergent strategy.**

A strategy isn’t static—it continues to develop as events warrant. The trick is deciding when to adjust your original plan and when not to: The new option might sap momentum from your plan while it’s succeeding, or if you’re too focused on your plan even when it’s failing, you could miss out on a better opportunity.

Many companies have succeeded by adopting an emergent strategy (and converting it into their deliberate strategy). Walmart is an example: Founder Sam Walton originally planned to build a large store in a city (Memphis). But due to extenuating circumstances, he ended up building it in a smaller town, Bentonville, Arkansas, where he already had another store. This evolved into a strategy of putting big stores in small towns, to forestall competition from other discount retailers.

Honda’s experience introducing motorcycles into the U.S. illustrates in more detail how problems and unanticipated opportunities can change strategy.

### Honda Succeeds by Changing Gears

In the 1960s, Honda introduced a motorcycle into the U.S. market in an effort to compete with Harley-Davidsons and European imports. But Honda’s bike had expensive mechanical problems (which U.S. dealers lacked the capacity to fix), and it didn’t sell. However, Honda initially stuck to its plan of trying to sell the motorcycle.

Meanwhile, they had shipped some smaller bikes called Super Cubs to the Los Angeles area; these bikes were popular in Japan as vehicles for making deliveries in crowded streets. Honda employees in the U.S. used them the same way at work, but also took them into the hills on weekends for off-road adventures.

This sparked wider interest and demand for the Super Cub as a recreational “dirt bike,” so Honda began importing and selling more of the bikes. Its sales mitigated Honda’s losses on the larger bike, and the company eventually realized selling the Super Cub to a new niche customer—the off-road biker—was a better strategy than selling a large motorcycle.

### Applying the Theory

Young people often think they should plan out their careers step by step for the next five years, then stick to their plan. But things change—**your career path will constantly present new options and choices.**

Here are a few guidelines for deciding what to do when new problems or opportunities come up:

  * If you have a job that satisfies both hygiene and motivation factors, then stick with your deliberate plan.
  * If you’re clear on your goals, and your experience affirms they’re the right ones, focus on your deliberate strategy.
  * If your job or career so far doesn’t satisfy both hygiene and motivation factors, adopt a flexible or emergent approach: Try things, learn from experience, and adjust. Keep evolving your strategy until it clicks (until you find work you love and can excel at doing; that is, work that meets hygiene and motivation factors).



You’re unlikely to come up with a fully formed strategy by sitting down and thinking until one pops into your head. It will develop from a combination of planned and unplanned options.

Christensen’s career path illustrates how unplanned options can become your strategy. He originally aspired to be the editor of the _Wall Street Journal._ But while he was studying for an MBA at Harvard, a consulting firm offered to help pay the costs if he took a job with them when he graduated. He accepted the offer (an emergent strategy), and he loved consulting work.

After five years there, he and a friend started their own consulting business; investors eventually fired him and installed their own CEO. However, even before being fired, he’d begun considering academia as another potential career. So he entered a Ph.D. program. Becoming a professor became his deliberate strategy (he dropped the idea of becoming the _Wall Street Journal_ editor).

#### Ask a Key Question

When you’re open to emergent opportunities, you still need a way to decide when to pursue an option and when to stay the course with your deliberate strategy. The best way is to ask yourself a question when you’re thinking of going a certain direction: **What assumptions have to be correct for this course of action to succeed?**

In deciding their strategy, businesses rarely ask this question. Instead, they proceed based on initial projections without testing whether the projections are accurate. As they go along, they keep adjusting projections and assumptions to fit what’s happening, getting themselves in deeper when the projections turn out to be off base.

Here’s an example of how this flawed strategy works:

  * An employee or team gets an idea for a product or service.
  * They come up with a business plan with numbers based on assumptions (guesses).
  * They get the go-ahead to proceed, then realize some assumptions are flawed. But they’re too far into the project to change it. 
  * Further, resources have already been invested and no one wants to tell management assumptions were wrong.
  * Things go downhill from there.



Disney’s attempt to launch a theme park near Paris failed because its assumptions about visitor behavior based on the other parks were wrong for the Paris plan. No one asked what assumptions had to be right for the plan to work. A big assumption that turned out to be wrong was that people would book lodging and stay for an average of three days at the park (as they did at other Disney parks), even though the new park had only 15 rides versus 45 at a typical Disney park.

#### Test Assumptions

Here’s a better way for a company to determine what’s going to work and what isn’t before sinking a lot of money into a project.

1) Acknowledge that the initial financial projections are iffy. Make a list of the assumptions they’re based on.

2) Ask which have to be right for the projections to pan out. Rank the assumptions by importance and probability—from the most important/least certain to the least important/most certain.

3) Come up with a quick, cheap way to test the most important assumptions.

4) With an understanding of whether the important assumptions are likely to be accurate, the company can decide whether to invest.

With this process, teams focus on what it will take for the projections to be realized, instead of just massaging numbers until they look good.

#### Before You Accept a Job

Like companies that put their faith in untested assumptions, it’s easy for people to commit to a job or travel too far down a career path before realizing it’s not working out. To avoid this, when considering a job, ask yourself:

  * Why do you think you’d enjoy this job and how do you know this?
  * What would others have to do for you to succeed in the job? (For instance, the company would have to follow through on a promise to provide you with certain training.)
  * What assumptions do you have about the job that have to be right _for you to succeed_? Do you have control over these things? (For instance, you assume you would have a mentor, or the opportunity to work on new product development.)
  * What assumptions have to be right _for you to be happy_ in the job? Are they hygiene or motivation factors? (For example, you’ll be able to work from home two days a week.)
  * How can you test your assumptions? (For example, if you’re assuming the company will keep its promise to provide training, ask for examples and dates of similar training the company has provided to employees.)
