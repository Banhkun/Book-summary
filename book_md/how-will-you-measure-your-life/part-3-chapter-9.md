## Part 3 | Chapter 9: Living With Integrity

Most people believe they’re ethical, and they can easily identify right and wrong. But integrity depends on small everyday decisions made over time, rather than one big decision where there’s a red flag.

**Many people start down a slippery slope by engaging in marginal thinking, which is thinking that focuses on the short-term cost or benefit but fails to grasp the full impact of an action.** They make small, seemingly harmless decisions or compromises that lead to more and bigger compromises—with devastating consequences, from business failures to jail terms.

The key to making ethical decisions is to recognize and avoid marginal thinking in your professional and personal life. This section examines the theory of marginal versus full thinking, how to avoid marginal thinking, and therefore, how to live a life of integrity.

### The Theory of Marginal Versus Full Thinking

Businesses decide whether to invest in something by determining the marginal costs and benefits, or revenue. Marginal costs are additional or new costs compared to a company’s fixed costs, such as buildings and equipment. In economic terms, the marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of something using your existing capabilities; marginal revenue is the additional revenue generated from the sale of an additional unit.

Analyzing the marginal or additional costs and revenue of a potential investment or action is referred to as marginal thinking, but more broadly, marginal thinking means determining whether something is worth doing, given the additional cost or benefit. Both businesses and individuals make this calculation. However, marginal thinking can get businesses and people in trouble if they don’t also look beyond the marginal cost, which is short-term, to what a decision might end up costing them down the road.

Whether a business decision hinges on marginal costs or marginal revenue, it can result in bigger long-term costs or problems. Here are two examples of marginal thinking that led to worse consequences later:

  * **Opting _against_ marginal profits**: In the late 1990s, the DVD movie rental company Blockbuster chose not to expand into online rentals and compete with upstart Nexflix, because the potential additional revenue from online rental was small compared to its current revenue from DVD rental (36% versus 66%). While this decision made financial sense in the short term, it ultimately sank Blockbuster—which filed for bankruptcy in 2011—when online rental completely replaced renting DVDs from physical stores. 
  * **Opting _for_ small marginal costs: **A company may choose to expand on what it’s already doing because it’s cheaper (the marginal cost is small) instead of investing a lot more money in a completely new line of business that will grow the company in the long term. U.S. Steel chose this route: They increased production in existing facilities with excess capacity instead of investing in new, cheaper processes that a competitor, Nucor Steel, was using. Nucor ended up taking market share from U.S. Steel.



In both examples, marginal thinking that didn’t consider the full picture (both short-term and long-term effects) had a devastating long-term cost: It hurt or destroyed the company’s competitiveness.

### Applying the Theory

Marginal thinking applies not only to company bottom lines, but also to choosing right and wrong.**The marginal cost of doing something morally questionable “just this once” always seems small, but the full cost turns out to be a lot higher.**

It’s easy to convince yourself that it’s OK to do something you wouldn’t normally do because in this instance, there are extenuating circumstances. And the cost seems small because you're not looking ahead.

Countless numbers of people have ruined their lives and those of others by making this mistake, whether on Wall Street, in politics, or in sports. For example, Nick Leeson, a 26-year-old trader, bankrupted the British merchant bank Barings in 1995. Leeson made a small trading mistake that he didn’t want to admit because he wanted to be seen as a success—so he hid the loss in an obscure trading account. He made more risky trades to pay back the loss, and kept on losing. He lied and forged documents to hide mounting losses. Ultimately, his trading losses soared to $1.3 billion, the bank collapsed, and 1,200 employees lost their jobs. Leeson was sentenced to six-and-a-half years.

#### Do the Right Thing 100% of the Time

If you cross a moral or ethical line once because of seemingly justifiable circumstances, you’ll keep crossing the line. The best way to avoid this is to never compromise your morals—it’s easier to maintain your standards 100% of the time than 98% of the time. You either stand for something, or you don’t. Once you’ve crossed your moral line, it no longer has any power to stop you—so when faced with the temptation to cross it, stop, think about the long-term cost, then turn around.
