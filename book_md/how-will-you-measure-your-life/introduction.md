## Introduction

In _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ business consultant and Harvard professor Clay Christensen shows how **economic theories that help businesses succeed can also help individuals make better life decisions**. He presents theories and business case studies that show you pitfalls to avoid, and also how to be happy and successful in your career and personal life.

Typical self-help books on how to succeed and be happy are based mostly on anecdotes and on routines that worked for the authors, but that may or may not work for you.

In contrast, we know theories work: They’re tested, proven, and can be universally applied. A theory is a statement of cause and effect. Economic theories show the impact on a business of doing certain things; they predict what will happen in the future and what steps managers might take. They can do the same for your personal life.

Christensen, author of _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , developed this book from a Harvard class exercise, in which he discusses how the business theories presented in the class also apply to personal life choices and questions, including:

  * How to be successful and happy in your career
  * How to build relationships with your partner, children, other family members, and close friends that are a lifelong source of happiness
  * How to live with integrity



(Shortform note: Read our summary of The Innovator’s Dilemma here.)

Christensen began exploring these questions after finding that many of his former Harvard Business School classmates had struggled in their personal lives, and often didn’t enjoy their work despite significant professional accomplishments. A few, including Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, ended up on the wrong side of the law.

Christensen wrote this book to help define a path to both professional _and_ personal success. It’s intended to help you find fulfillment by understanding what’s most important to you, and ultimately answering the question of how you’ll measure your life.

### How Theories Work

When making decisions, people often try to predict what will happen based on as much data as they can gather; however, **data only tells you what happened in the past. Letting it drive decisions is like driving a car by looking in the rearview mirror** ; you can’t see where you’re going.

Alternatively, you can base decisions on experience, but often, you don’t have time to learn on the job—for instance, to go through a couple of divorces to learn about relationships, or a couple of kids to master parenting.

In contrast, theories are more helpful in making decisions because they tell you what will happen without you having to experience it first. Good theories take the form of “if … then” statements (for example, _if_ you don’t align your resources with your strategy, _then_ your strategy will fail). You can see what actions cause what outcomes and why, then make a wise decision.

For example, developing a theory of lift was the key to humans learning to fly. Prior to this, people failed to fly because they didn’t understand causation. Since creatures with wings and feathers could fly (a correlation), early inventors tried building similar wings and jumping from high places, which failed. They didn’t understand what actually causes or enables flight until 1738, when mathematician Daniel Bernoulli presented a theory that explained how lift makes it happen.

Developing and refining further theories in the form of rules telling pilots what to do under different types of circumstances eventually made flight predictable and reliable.

### Applying Theories to Life

Similarly, making good decisions and solving problems in life requires understanding what actions cause what outcomes. The theories explained in this book will help you see cause and effect. They’re reliable—they stem from university research, which has been tested in a variety of organizations. Each chapter highlights a business theory and applies it to a personal challenge.

However, to solve a complicated problem, you may need the insights of more than one theory. For example, besides the theory of lift, early aviators also needed to understand the theories of gravity and resistance. So readers will find it useful to examine problems from the perspective of several different theories in the book

Operating without a theory is like navigating at sea without directional instruments—you’re relying on the currents and chance. However, good theories point you in the direction of good decisions in business and life. From there, it’s up to you. **Theories tell you _how_ to think about key decisions, not _what_ to think.**

(Shortform note: For the sake of coherency, we’ve summarized the book’s prologue and Chapter 1 in the introduction. Consequently, the summary’s Chapter 1 corresponds to the book’s Chapter 2, the summary’s Chapter 2 corresponds to the book’s Chapter 3, and so on.)
