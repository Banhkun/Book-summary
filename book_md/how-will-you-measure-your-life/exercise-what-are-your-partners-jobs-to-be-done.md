## Exercise: What Are Your Partner’s ‘Jobs to Be Done’

Applying the jobs-to-be-done theory in your relationship means figuring out what “jobs” your partner needs you to do (not assuming you know what the other person wants and needs), then doing those things as well as you can.

* * *

Describe a time when you did something for your partner and they didn’t seem to appreciate it. How did you react and why?

Putting yourself in your partner’s shoes, why do you think they reacted as they did?

What jobs do you think your partner most wants you to do? How can you find out?
