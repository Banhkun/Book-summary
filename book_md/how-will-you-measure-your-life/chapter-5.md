## Chapter 5: Determine the Job to Be Done

**Products often fail because companies develop them based on what they want to sell rather than on what customers need.** They make something people don’t want or can’t use.

We often treat our relationships the same way misguided companies try to sell products—we focus on what’s important to _us_ rather than what the other person wants. Changing your perspective can change your relationships.

### The ‘Jobs to Be Done’ Theory

In his book _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Christensen introduced a new theory of marketing and product development: determining the “job to be done.” The idea is that **when people buy a product or service, they’re in effect hiring it to do a job for them.** Products designed to do jobs customers want done are most successful.

(Shortform note: For more on the jobs-to-be-done theory, read our summary of The Innovator’s Dilemma here.)

Marketing efforts often focus on targeting products to demographic segments, but we don’t buy things because of our demographics, although demographics may correlate with some buying decisions. What happens is that a job or need comes up, and we look for a way to address it. If there’s a product out there that can do the job, we buy it. If not, we find a way to make do. What causes us to buy is having a job and determining that a product will help us get it done.

Here are some examples of companies or products that succeeded by figuring out what jobs customers needed to have done and doing them well.

  * Instead of targeting products to a customer segment, the discount furniture seller IKEA structures its stores to do a job customers need to have done: to quickly and conveniently furnish a new home or apartment. They provide everything customers need in one place—they keep everything in stock and provide a play area for children and a restaurant so customers stay in the store longer. IKEA packages products flat to fit in cars and, for larger items, offers same-day delivery. 
  * A fast-food chain that wanted to sell more milkshakes identified the job its customers were buying milkshakes to do. It turned out that milkshakes served as a convenient, portable, and satisfying breakfast that people could consume on their commute to work without spilling in their car. So the company came up with ways to do this job better—by making its milkshakes more filling (adding chunks of fruit) and convenient (providing a larger straw).
  * A toy company developed 12-minute card games that appealed to parents who wanted a quick game they could play with kids in the evening and wrap up before bedtime. Other available games didn’t do this job for parents because it took too long to finish them.



### Applying the Theory

**Applying the jobs-to-be-done mindset can help you improve your personal and professional life.** In each situation, strive to understand the job you’re being “hired” to do, and then do it well. Thinking of your marriage from this perspective can be transformative.

It will take practice; most people can't articulate the jobs _they’re_ trying to do, let alone the jobs they and their spouse are hiring each other to do for them.

Understanding what your spouse or partner is hiring you to do requires that you put yourself in the other person’s shoes (listen and practice empathy). This means realizing that the jobs your partner is trying to do, or needs you to do, are not necessarily the ones you _think_ they should be focusing on. Ironically, many marriages in which partners are selfless are actually unhappy, because each is giving what _they_ want to give—or what they think the other wants. They make wrong assumptions and, therefore, aren’t meeting the other’s true needs.

For example, when a husband gets home from work, he notices the kitchen is a mess. He assumes that this indicates his wife had a hard day, and that she could use some help. So he cleans everything up and starts dinner. But this isn’t the “job” she wants him to do; what she wants is a listening ear. Her day has been rough because of spending hours with small children, not because of chores. While he focuses on cleaning up instead of listening, she feels ignored.

Working to understand, rather than assuming, your partner’s needs is the way to build a strong marriage. Couples who are the most trusting and devoted to each other are doing the jobs each person needs to have done. In contrast, marriages in which one or both people define the relationship in terms of getting what they want often end in divorce.

### The Importance of Sacrifice

Understanding your partner’s jobs-to-be-done strengthens the love and commitment you have for each other. **The extent to which each of you sacrifices for the other’s happiness and success is the glue that holds your relationship together.**

Sacrifice strengthens commitment not only in marriage but also in other relationships: among family members, close friends, organizations, and cultural groups. For example, Marines are deeply committed to their fellow Marines, the Corps, and the country, as a result of sacrificing for their peers during grueling training.

Your family is worth sacrificing for. Ask yourself what job your partner needs you to do, then devote your efforts to doing it. Let your partner and children sacrifice for you in turn, and you’ll strengthen your commitment to each other.
