## Chapter 6: Develop Your Children’s Capabilities

In recent years, many industries have outsourced certain functions and processes, including the pharmaceutical, auto, oil, information technology, and semiconductor industries. Investors, consultants, and academics have encouraged this as a way of increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Similarly, **parents have outsourced certain family functions to coaches, teachers, and other adults.**

While outsourcing can be a benefit, it can also undermine companies and families when decision-makers delegate the wrong things. The way to determine what the wrong things are is to understand and apply the theory of capabilities.

### The Theory of Capabilities

Before outsourcing anything, companies need to fully understand their capabilities, especially which capabilities are critical to the company’s future. Capabilities derive from three factors:

**1) Resources:** These include people, technology, equipment, brands, designs, information, money, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually visible and measurable. Employees create value for companies when they convert resources into products and services.

**2) Processes:** These are the ways employees communicate, coordinate, and make decisions.

Unlike resources, processes don’t appear on a balance sheet. But while less visible, processes facilitate the use of resources to solve problems. Processes include:

  * The methods or systems by which products are developed and produced.
  * Methods of market research, budgeting, employee development, compensation, resource allocation, and so on.



Strong processes work regardless of who performs them (employees doing them are more or less interchangeable).

**3) Priorities:** This may be the most important of the three factors determining capabilities. Priorities guide a company’s decisions, including what the company invests in and chooses not to invest in. Leaders need to communicate clear company priorities so employees make decisions aligned with the company’s priorities and strategy.

### Deciding When to Outsource

In applying the theory of capabilities to determine when outsourcing makes sense, a company must do two things:

1) Understand that your suppliers’ capabilities can and will change; to get a sense of how they might change, watch what your suppliers are striving or aspiring to do in the future.

2) Understand what capabilities your company will need to succeed in the future. Always keep these capabilities in-house; otherwise, you’re giving away your future.

Understanding the value of capabilities differentiates a good CEO from a poor one. Here are two examples of outsourcing gone awry:

  * **Dell:** Dell was a highly successful U.S. computer manufacturer in the 1990s. It saved money, for which it was applauded by Wall Street, by outsourcing the manufacture of components to the Taiwanese company Asus. It started with circuits, then motherboards, then continued until Asus was putting together Dell computers in their entirety. Once Dell had outsourced all its major capabilities to Asus, the Taiwanese company used what it learned to launch its own computer brand.
  * **U.S. semiconductor manufacturing:** American companies outsourced basic semiconductor assembly to Taiwanese and Chinese suppliers, while retaining control of more complicated and profitable aspects like design. However, Asian suppliers kept moving upmarket, increasing their capability to make complex products. Today, U.S. companies outsource sophisticated products and components to Asian companies because U.S. facilities can no longer make them.



### Applying the Theory

In the same way companies weigh their capabilities, you can assess your own and your family’s capabilities—your resources, processes, and priorities.

In considering your own capabilities, you’ll find strengths, as well as areas you wish you’d done more to develop. You can’t make up lost opportunities (nor could Dell), but as a parent, you can help your children make the most of their capabilities.

In the context of your resources, processes, and priorities, think about what your children will need to be able to do, given the challenges they’re likely to face:

**1) Resources are the first factor determining how a child’s capabilities develop.** These include financial and material resources, talent, knowledge, experience, and relationships.

**2) Processes are the second factor determining how a child’s capabilities develop.** Processes are ways a child uses her resources to do or create something new. Processes include how she thinks, questions, solves problems, works with others, and so on; they’re unique to the child.

Resources and processes work differently: Knowledge provided to a child in class is a **resource** she can use—for instance, to get a better grade on a test. However, when the child takes what she’s learned (the resource) and applies it to doing an experiment or creating an app, she’s using a **process**.

**3) Priorities are the third factor determining how a child’s capabilities develop.** Children’s priorities mirror those of adults (for example, school, sports, family, work, and faith). As with adults, their priorities guide their decisions—including what gets the most attention, what they procrastinate on, and what they ignore.

**Here’s how the three components of capability work together:** _Resources_ are what a child uses to do something; _processes_ are the way she does it; her _priorities_ are why she does it.

#### Parental Outsourcing

It’s critical that children develop processes for doing things. However, our society and families are increasingly limiting children’s ability to do so by outsourcing—much as Dell outsourced its process capability for developing personal computers.

A generation ago, more U.S. families involved children in work, such as gardening, caring for animals, preserving food, and doing sewing and repairs. Children developed processes for solving problems and getting these things done. Wealthier parents have outsourced much of this home-maintenance work today. In its place, parents go overboard in providing resources for children—youth sports, music and art lessons, summer camp, and semesters abroad.

While these opportunities (resources) allow some children to apply what they learn, the activities don’t resonate with or engage many others. This is because the opportunities tend to involve things parents _think_ their children will like, or that reflect the parents’ ambitions rather than the children’s interests. Another issue is that the activities may be too scripted.

Along with providing opportunities, **parents need to ensure the experiences challenge children to take responsibility, do difficult things, and create or invent things.** These help children develop the processes they’ll need in the future, as well as the self-esteem that comes from accomplishment.

A focus on showering children with resources has resulted in a disproportionate number of young adults lacking the capabilities, especially processes, necessary for employment. **Parents should start early with providing problems for their children to solve.**

#### Outsourcing Values

In addition to process capabilities, children need to learn their parents’ priorities and values. **You convey your values, often without realizing it, while doing things with your children.**

Kids pick up this information when they’re ready to learn it—you can’t predict when that will be, which is why it’s important to “be there” for them as much as possible. If you’ve filled your children’s time with activities you’re not involved in, they’re likely to pick up the values of the other adults around them when they’re ready to learn.

While providing children with resources is part of a parent’s job, so too is developing their capabilities through chances to develop processes and values. If you outsource this, you’ll lose the opportunity to develop your children into the kind of adults you want them to be.
