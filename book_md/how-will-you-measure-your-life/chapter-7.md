## Chapter 7: Learn From Experience

When businesses hire people, especially for key positions, they often prioritize talent: They look for people with the “right stuff.” But when people succeed, it isn’t because of innate talent, but because they learned to handle pressure and setbacks through experience. Employers make better hires when they look for the right experiences rather than promotions and awards.

**This “schools of experience” theory of hiring can guide your career, and also help you prepare your children for success.** The key is to seek out jobs that provide key experiences relevant to the job you ultimately want. Similarly, in your family, create experiences for your children that build key skills.

### A Theory for Hiring

In the 1979 book _The Right Stuff_ , Tom Wolfe described the competitive world of test pilots, where those who were chosen had a unique combination of talent and fearlessness: the “right stuff.” NASA adopted the formula for choosing the first astronauts.

Similarly, many companies look for the right stuff, or innate talent, in hiring key executives. They look for candidates with a string of successes and an upward trajectory. However, talent doesn’t predict success—it’s common for executives who were successful in one company to fail in the next.

A better approach to hiring decisions is the “schools of experience” theory developed by Morgan McCall of the University of Southern California and described in her book _High Flyers_. The model focuses on process capabilities—whether a candidate has handled situations like those he would face in the new position.

Successful leaders develop their abilities through “courses” they take in the schools of experience: failures, challenges, or experiences doing something new. For example, Nolan Archibald, CEO of Black & Decker, decided early on that he wanted to become a CEO. But instead of seeking a fast-track executive training position, he started out working in an asbestos mine. Throughout his career, he continued to ask himself what experiences and problems he needed to master so he’d be capable of becoming a CEO.

### Applying the Theory

You can **build your career the same way by “signing up” for important experiences, instead of looking for jobs with pay and prestige or a fast track to promotion.** Determine which experiences you’re likely to need in the future and master those “courses” before you need them.

Similarly, **parents should determine what experiences their children will need to be successful as they grow, and create those experiences.** Help them learn important lessons early in life.

Encourage children to aim high and keep trying if they fail. Also, resist the temptation to solve children’s problems for them—don’t bail them out by helping with or doing a project they left until the last minute. Otherwise, you’re teaching them to take shortcuts and expect others to save you. Let them learn from the consequences of their mistakes.

Often it’s easier to do things for kids—for instance, to plan their scout camping trip—but when you let children do it themselves, they learn about planning, organization, and teamwork. If a child doesn’t learn what you’re trying to teach from one experience, try something else. Preparing children for the future is one of the more important things you can do for them.
