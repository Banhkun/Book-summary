## Chapter 8: Create a Family Culture

Both businesses and families have cultures that guide their members in making decisions in line with established priorities when bosses or parents aren’t around to provide direction. This chapter examines how cultures work and how to create a family culture.

### Forming a Company Culture

People often think that perks and policies, such as casual dress, free food, company T-shirts, and bringing kids or dogs to work, define a company’s culture. While these may reflect office culture, a culture itself is less visible.

Organizational expert Edgar Schein of MIT defined culture as an ingrained way that employees go about their work—it’s a sense of the way a company does things, which becomes so automatic that people don’t think of doing things any other way. This sense develops over time from working together and seeing what works (the first time something works, others repeat the process and it becomes the way to do it). Together, employees reach an understanding of the company’s priorities and the processes for implementing them.

Managers don’t need to supervise everything because the organization essentially runs on its own. People instinctively do things in the prescribed way. **Another way to define culture is as the combination of an organization’s priorities and processes.**

The animation studio Pixar is an example of a company with a strong culture. Its**** creative process differs from that of other studios. Instead of a development group assigning ideas to directors to pursue, Pixar helps film directors refine their own ideas. Nearly everyone in the company provides no-holds-barred feedback on each film; the timetable takes a back seat to quality. The processes and priority of creating top-quality films have become a unique creative culture.

### Steps for Creating a Culture

Many companies proactively create a culture, writing it down and talking about it frequently. For example, Netflix posts key elements of its culture online, including:

  * Not having a vacation policy: Employees may take off as much time as they want as long as they’re doing great work and meeting their responsibilities.
  * Expecting all employees to be outstanding performers; those with merely “adequate” work will be let go.
  * Giving employees “freedom and responsibility,” rather than operating on a command and control model.



According to Schein of MIT, a company can **create a culture by following these steps:**

  * Identify a recurring problem.
  * Assign a group to figure out how to solve it (and have them keep trying until they come up with a good solution).
  * Every time this problem comes up, assign this team to solve it so that the process becomes instinctive; this way of doing things becomes the group’s culture.



**If leaders define a culture but don’t embody or enforce it, the company will evolve a different culture based on the priorities and processes that have worked and become embedded.**

For example, the energy company Enron had a “vision and values” statement articulating four values: respect, integrity, communication, and excellence. However, starting with its leadership, Enron failed to live by these values, and the company collapsed amid scandal.

To determine whether you have a healthy company culture, ask yourself whether, when faced with making a decision, your employees have made the ones you wanted them to make (and whether you followed up with feedback). If leaders and managers are inconsistent or inattentive, poor decisions can evolve into a culture.

### Applying the Theory

Like a company, **parents need to proactively develop a family culture, or way of doing things, so children instinctively do the right thing when their parents aren’t around** because they know that “this is the way our family behaves.”

Building a culture involves knowing your priorities and designing a culture around them by demonstrating how problems are solved the right way and repeating the process until it becomes embedded.

For example, if kindness is a family value, help your child choose kindness in a situation where it’s warranted. Make sure he repeats the decision on subsequent occasions; if he doesn’t choose to be kind, discuss how he should have acted differently. Next time, he will be guided by a sense of “this is how we do it.” For example, Christensen and his wife Christine helped their son be kind to a bullied classmate, and praised him when he did it.

Of course, parents need to live by the priorities they articulate. For example, Christensen and his wife wanted their children to love work, so they created opportunities for their children to work with them on home remodeling projects. The kids not only had fun and learned a value, but also developed a sense of accomplishment from the work they did—for instance, they took pride in the rooms they’d helped paint.

You have to build the culture you want and reinforce it so it becomes automatic. If you don’t dictate the standard, negative behaviors will form the culture.
