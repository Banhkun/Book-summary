## Exercise: Apply the Samurai Approach to Virtues

Horowitz argues that organizations need a foundation of common virtues similar to that of the samurai.

* * *

Choose one of your organization’s virtues. Define it explicitly and clearly state its purpose. Identify which other virtue in your organization’s culture balances it out.

Come up with a rule that will force people to put the virtue into action. Explain how the rule would work.

Finally, consider how you might assess a job candidate’s openness to the virtue during the hiring process, and how you might reinforce it during onboarding.
