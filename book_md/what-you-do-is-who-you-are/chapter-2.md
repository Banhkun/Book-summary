## Chapter 2: Lessons From the Samurai—Develop Virtues

Now that we’ve discussed what culture is and why it matters, we’ll explore Horowitz’s advice for developing the core values of your culture. He draws lessons on how to develop your values from the first historical model he examines: samurai warriors.

The samurai were a military class that ruled pre-modern Japan from 1186 until 1868. Their virtues, expressed in an honor code or _bushido_ , were so effective that they kept the samurai in power for nearly 700 years, and they’re still echoed in modern-day Japan. (Shortform note: In _The Book of Five Rings, _written in the 17th century, samurai warrior Miyamoto Musashi reflects on _bushido_ , emphasizing the importance of constant practice, achieving mental and physical equilibrium, and ways to defeat any enemy.)

Horowitz explains that **the honor code established a common foundation for warriors consisting not only of values but also instructions for applying them in every situation.** _Bushido_ refers to these _actionable values_ as “virtues.”

(Shortform note: As with the term _culture,_ Horowitz applies to business another word we’re used to seeing in other contexts. _Virtue_ is a concept more commonly discussed in ethics or philosophy, and when the samurai talked about virtues, they were in fact talking about the ethical and philosophical foundation of their culture. Nowadays, virtue is often defined as the moral excellence of a person, but other, more expansive definitions refer to virtue as an attitude, disposition, or character trait that enables us to be and to act in ways that develop our human potential. This latter definition is closer to the one Horowitz gives of beliefs that are consistently translated into action.)

Horowitz believes business leaders should follow the samurai’s example of intentionally defining foundational beliefs coupled with instructions for everyday behavior. In this chapter, we’ll explore Horowitz’s four lessons from the samurai honor code, as well as examples from the business world. (Shortform note: In _Daring Greatly, _Brené Brown argues that the gap between aspirational and actional values—what we believe in versus how we actually act—leads to disengagement at work and in society at large.)

### Lesson #1: Always Be Aware of Death

Many of _bushido_ ’s virtues are recognizable in Japanese culture today, such as in their commitment to the highest standards of quality. Horowitz argues that this commitment to quality stems from the samurai virtue of honor, which they expressed as: Always be ready for death. To the samurai, this meant ensuring an honorable legacy regardless of when they died by constantly performing to high standards.

(Shortform note: While modern Japanese culture’s admirable commitment to quality echoes the _bushido_ principle of behaving with your legacy in mind, the same principle can be twisted in a harmful and unhealthy way. Psychologists worry that a drive for perfection and the safeguarding of honor, both rooted in centuries-long tradition, contribute to high rates of suicide in Japan—the highest in all of Asia.)

In the same way the Samurai prepared for death, Horowitz encourages business leaders to consider _their company’s_ death. If your company went out of business today, would you be proud of its legacy? Horowitz argues this mindset helps you **look beyond the usual ways to measure success** , such as profit, and consider the organization’s purpose and impact. (Shortform note: In his book _Who Will Cry When You Die?_ , Robin Sharma also advocates contemplating the end of your life to determine the values that actually matter to you. Sharma argues that to live a life you won’t regret, you must take control of your life today, beginning by identifying your purpose and using that to craft a life you will be proud of.)

### Lesson #2: Choose Your Virtues With Action in Mind

To apply the samurai approach, you must begin by choosing your culture’s virtues carefully. Horowitz advises you to **reflect on the _behaviors_ that will translate your virtues into the culture you want**. Remember, culture is created through the _actions_ of your employees. Additionally, Horowitz identifies two characteristics a virtue should have to be effective:

#### Characteristic #1: A Virtue Must Be Achievable

**Effective virtues are practical and set you up for success, not failure.** To create an effective virtue, Horowitz says you should specify what the belief would look like in practice, so you can determine whether it’s a virtue you can live up to. If you’d have a hard time applying the virtue consistently, it doesn’t belong in your culture, because you’ll constantly fall short. For example, accountability is a popular corporate value. A cultural virtue for accountability might be, “See our actions and decisions through, even when the outcome is not favorable.” You would only incorporate this virtue into your culture if you can commit to that level of accountability.

(Shortform note: In _Dare to Lead, _Brené Brown shares advice on how to make sure you regularly practice your values (virtues). She suggests creating a list of behaviors with which to regularly assess whether you’re putting your beliefs into practice. Consider what kinds of behaviors support the belief and what kinds of behaviors would be outside of it, and go back to the list often to see if you’re practicing your beliefs.)

#### Characteristic #2: A Virtue Must Be Defining

**Effective virtues define who you are as an organization** , so they point to what makes your company unique.

You shouldn’t select virtues that all other organizations in your industry are already espousing. If they are industry givens, your employees practice those virtues by default, and there’s no need to enforce them specifically. What’s more, Horowitz warns not to take cultural industry standards for granted. They might not work for you, or you might adopt the cultural practice without adopting the belief that underpins it. For example, fun office perks such as games and nap pods became popular thanks to Google’s emphasis on encouraging creativity. But flooding an office with perks without the underlying commitment to creativity doesn’t accomplish much. If employees can play ping-pong between meetings but don’t have opportunities to pitch new projects, the virtue of fostering creativity with play becomes meaningless.

(Shortform note: One way to choose virtues that define your organization is to identify the ones that your star employees already have. In _Traction_ , Gino Wickman advocates determining your organization’s core values by listing the characteristics of your star performers and deciding which of those define your company.)

### Lesson #3: Explain How to Apply Virtues

**Effective virtues incorporate definitions, instructions, and examples.** Horowitz explains that**_bushido_** contained all the information warriors needed to apply the virtues, starting with precise definitions. It defined what each virtue _was_ and what it _wasn’t,_ and explained what each looked like in action. The virtues complemented each other, preventing warriors from narrowly pursuing one to the detriment of another. For example, a warrior should have the courage to fight, but should also be benevolent and not harm anyone unnecessarily.

(Shortform note: Horowitz’s description of _bushido_ might make it seem like the code is a single, coherent book. However, it’s actually a collection of texts written throughout the reign of the samurai, and it evolved and changed over time, sometimes contradicting itself. But despite having different authors through different eras, it maintains a coherent overall ethos and approach to the way of the warrior.)

Besides instructions, _bushido_ gave concrete examples of how to apply each virtue, using storytelling to make them easy to understand and remember. The stories tried to foresee every possible _scenario_ in which a samurai would have to apply a specific virtue. The stories also anticipated different _reactions_ a warrior might have and explained how well each reaction fulfilled the code’s expectations. Finally, to keep the virtues alive, the samurai taught these stories to every new generation, thus cementing them in the psyche of all warriors across centuries.

(Shortform note: The samurai approach to communicating virtues through storytelling is one companies might already be familiar with, but in other contexts. For instance, in _Building a StoryBrand_ , marketing expert Donald Miller explains how to use stories to create the most effective marketing campaigns by casting customers as the heroes of a story about your brand. He also explains how to foster engagement from employees by sharing the same customer-centered story with them and then creating an employee-centered story that casts them as heroes and aligns their purpose with the company’s mission.)

After choosing your virtues, Horowitz recommends taking these steps to follow the samurai approach for applying them:

**1) Define the virtue explicitly**. Explain it in unambiguous terms and address as many scenarios as possible to help people understand and apply it in all situations.

**2) Make the purpose of the virtue clear**. Having a compelling “why” will make the virtue easier to apply, so make clear why you’ve chosen the virtue and what it will accomplish.

**3) Set up rules that force people to put the virtue into action.** Following a rule rooted in a cultural virtue will help employees acquire the virtue through muscle memory. The rule will force them to engage in the specific behaviors that the virtue calls for, and help them internalize the virtue by acting on it. For example, if the virtue is efficiency, you might set up a rule to “Get it done now, improve on it later.”

**4) Make virtues complement each other.** Balancing your culture’s virtues will prevent people from fixating on one behavior to the detriment of other equally important ones.

**5) Integrate the virtue into the hiring and onboarding processes**. Using the definition of the virtue and the actionables you have established, develop a cultural interview to assess whether candidates can put the virtue into practice. Once they’re in, the onboarding process should teach them the right cultural lessons from day one.

> **Five Elements of Strong Cultures**
> 
> In _Multipliers, _Liz Wiseman and Greg McKeown identify five elements of strong cultures that fit the samurai approach. Some of them overlap with the steps Horowitz lays out:
> 
>   * **Vocabulary:** Everyone uses the same definition for words and phrases, such as the definitions of virtues.
> 
>   * **Conduct:** Everyone responds a certain way in a certain situation, such as following rules to put the virtue into action.
> 
>   * **Convictions:** Everyone agrees on what is true and shares assumptions, such as the purpose of the virtue.
> 
> 

> 
> The final two elements complement the samurai approach:
> 
>   * **Myths:** Everyone admires the same people based on their accomplishments, behavior, or traits. You can do this by identifying employees who embody the virtue and highlighting them as role models.
> 
>   * **Customs:** Everyone adheres to the same customs and behaves the same way. You can do this by ensuring that every employee will have the opportunity to put the virtue you’ve selected into practice.
> 
> 


#### Example: Creating a Rule to Enforce a Virtue

When Horowitz co-founded Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm, he wanted the central virtue of the firm’s culture to be respecting the entrepreneur. To establish the virtue, he applied the samurai approach:

  * First, he _defined the virtue_ in two paragraphs, giving specific pointers on what respecting the entrepreneur looks like in practice, and why it’s important. 
  * Next, he _made the purpose clear_ by explaining why the entrepreneur was the firm’s focus rather than the investor. 
  * Then, he _established an actionable rule_ to drive home the point: Whenever an employee was late to a meeting with an entrepreneur, they’d be fined $10 for every minute that passed.
  * Finally, so that respecting the entrepreneur wouldn’t prevent employees from giving negative feedback when necessary, he _balanced that virtue with another_ : Always tell the truth.



(Shortform note: Horowitz’s rule for employees might seem harsh, but it’s designed to help the firm stand out in a context where entrepreneurs hoping to get funding are typically expected to wait for venture capitalists for as long as it takes. In addition, Horowitz says the rule works as a way to measure culture fit in the hiring interview process. When managers explain the rule during interviews, a conversation ensues about why the firm has taken that stance. By the end of that conversation, if the candidate doesn’t agree, it’s clear they’re not a good fit with Andreessen Horowitz.)

### Lesson #4: Start With Three Essential Virtues

While Horowitz argues that you should choose virtues specific to your company and its strategy, as the samurai created an honor code specific to being a warrior, he also believes there are three foundational virtues essential to every organization: trust, freedom to speak up, and loyalty. (Shortform note: Some experts agree that there are certain values all companies should have, but in _Built to Last_ , Collins and Porras argue that visionary companies have different philosophies and all they agree on is on consistently adhering to whatever philosophy or values they claim as their own.)

#### Essential Virtue #1: Trust

According to Horowitz, trust is essential because **organizations can’t succeed unless employees trust that their leaders and peers are furthering the mission**. But trust can only come from being consistently truthful, and in high-stakes environments, that’s easier said than done. Horowitz points out that sharing inconvenient truths can create uncomfortable situations and make a company vulnerable. Giving people inside or outside of the organization access to information that puts your company in a negative light, or reveals your weaknesses, can prevent immediate gains.

For instance, if a company is closing a low-performing branch, being truthful about what’s happening would get negative attention and might even cost it some business. The leader wouldn’t want people to think the company’s in crisis and worry that it might close other branches, or stop fulfilling its commitments to customers. Being less transparent about what’s happening might be appealing—but Horowitz says this would be a mistake because it would undermine the trust employees, clients, and partners have in the company.

(Shortform note: _Dare to Lead _(Brené Brown) discusses the consequences of not building trust into your organization’s culture. She says that when there’s no culture of trust in a workplace, team members hold back from expressing new ideas, they have a harder time recovering from failure, and they develop toxic defensive behaviors.)

Horowitz outlines the following steps for sharing an uncomfortable truth without letting it take over the narrative:

  * **First, tell the truth.** Being upfront about the situation helps secure people’s trust in you as a leader. Show people that you’re aware of what’s happening and that you’re not going to hedge or hide. In the example above, leadership should step forward to tell people exactly what the plan for the branch is and why they made the decision to close it.
  * **Second, admit whether and how you contributed to the problem.** This helps people feel confident that you’ve learned the lesson and won’t let this happen again. Let people know what you’ll be doing differently in the future. In our example, leaders should assess and communicate why they failed to make the branch successful and how that will inform future actions so that it doesn’t happen again.
  * **Third, frame the necessary next action within the organization’s broader purpose.** Reframing the situation helps shift the conversation from the momentary crisis to the overall path you’re on—from concern to confidence. In our example, the leader should communicate how the branch closing will allow the company to focus its resources in areas where it can have a bigger impact, and help everyone achieve success.



> **Actionables for Trust**
> 
> In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano lists actionables you can apply to foster a culture of trust in your organization. Besides admitting mistakes and keeping your word, some actionables include:
> 
>   * Providing autonomy and decision-making authority.
> 
>   * Giving bad news directly to an employee without sugarcoating.
> 
>   * Letting employees spend company money within certain limits.
> 
>   * Avoiding micromanagement or intense monitoring programs.
> 
> 


#### Essential Virtue #2: Freedom to Communicate Concerns

The second virtue Horowitz argues all organizations need is the freedom to communicate concerns. **If team members don’t talk about the problems they notice, the problems become much harder to solve** because, by the time you find out about them, they’ve grown exponentially.

(Shortform note: Acknowledging problems is a characteristic of adaptive organizations—those that can adjust and thrive when faced with novel challenges. In _The Practice of Adaptive Leadership, _Ronald Heifetz explains that freely acknowledging problems means encouraging everyone to bring up problems and ask uncomfortable questions. To foster this characteristic, he suggests not shying away from uncomfortable problems and encouraging contrarians who aren’t afraid to speak up.)

Horowitz outlines several reasons employees might hesitate to share their concerns:

  * **They might have caused the problem** and don’t want to expose themselves to negative consequences for their job or career.
  * **They might not know how to solve the problem** and don’t want you to interpret this as a lack of ownership.
  * **They might not want to interfere with immediate company goals** by addressing a long-term issue. 



(Shortform note: In _Dare to Lead, _Brené Brown argues that many work cultures are characterized by self-interested and self-protecting behaviors like the ones listed above, including avoidance of tough conversations and the refusal to take risks. These behaviors stifle a work culture’s creativity and learning, and they’re toxic to the potential for innovation. The antidote is practicing four courage-building skills: being vulnerable, choosing and practicing values, building trust, and developing failure resilience.)

To counteract employees’ reluctance to speak up about their concerns, Horowitz says leaders should explicitly ask employees to bring problems to their attention. For instance, when he was CEO, Horowitz required that everyone who attended executive meetings bring at least one problem.

(Shortform note: In _Good to Great_ , Jim Collins shares four steps to follow to foster a culture where facts can come to light:

  * Ask your team a lot of questions, and don’t feed them your own answers. 
  * Cultivate real debate where employees’ input can actually steer decision-making. 
  * When a move goes wrong, conduct detailed autopsies without assigning blame. 
  * Implement alarm-bell mechanisms that employees can activate if they see something’s wrong.)



#### Essential Virtue #3: Loyalty

The final virtue Horowitz believes all companies should incorporate is loyalty. **Loyalty sets off a virtuous circle that makes work relationships productive and sustainable.** Ideally, when leaders are loyal to employees, employees want to stay in the company and therefore strive to do their best work. In turn, leaders know they have a workforce they can rely on, and they do their best to keep them happy.

However, to foster the virtuous circle of loyalty in a dynamic labor market where people change jobs often, Horowitz says you must define and communicate how you will show loyalty to your employees so they know what they can expect from you.

> **Commitment Cultures**
> 
> Another way to understand loyalty in the workplace is through the framework of commitment cultures. In _Smarter Faster Better, _Charles Duhigg explains that in a commitment culture the employer is committed to each employee’s growth and success. While planning what loyalty (or commitment) will look like in your organization, consider some of the steps companies with commitment cultures take:
> 
>   * Invest in employee training to make it clear that you want to retain your employees.
> 
>   * Offer benefits such as flexible working and generous maternity leave packages.
> 
>   * Hesitate to lay off employees unless absolutely necessary.
>
