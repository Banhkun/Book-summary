## Exercise: Reflect on Why Culture Matters

Culture is the way employees make decisions and act based on their perception of underlying premises and shared beliefs.

* * *

Consider the way employees make decisions and act at your company or organization. List some behaviors that characterize your organization and what each behavior says about the culture.

Reflect on your company’s vision, and ask an employee or colleague to express that vision in their own words. Are your ideas aligned? How has the organization’s culture helped or hindered that alignment?

Do you self-identify with your organization’s purpose? Can you see how your own role within the company contributes to that purpose? Ask an employee or colleague the same questions and consider whether your responses are aligned.
