## Chapters 9-10: Be Fully Prepared and Take One Step at a Time

To make it easier to get focused and keep going on an important task, **make sure you have everything you’ll need in front of you before you begin, so you’re not distracted by looking for things later**. There are probably countless projects that never get done because people fail to prepare for the job in advance.

It’s like preparing to cook something—you assemble the ingredients and utensils on your counter before you start so you don’t have to look for something in the middle of following the recipe. Once you start your work task, you need to be able to keep going with interruption.

Clear your desk by setting aside unrelated work so you have only one task in front of you. Assemble all the documents and materials you’ll need and keep them within easy reach. Ensure that your work area is comfortable and as distraction-free as possible. The cleaner and more organized it is, the easier it will be to get started and work efficiently.

Once everything is ready, start immediately. **Develop the confidence to begin by behaving confidently**. Sit up straight and lean forward away from the back of the chair with your feet flat on the floor. **Tell yourself, “Let’s get to work,” and jump in**.

Take one step and the rest will follow. Also, don’t strive for perfection at each step—get it 80% right, move on, and make changes later. Once you start, press on until the job is done.

### One Step at a Time

The best way to overcome procrastination and **make a big job doable is by breaking it into smaller steps and focusing on one step at a time.** Lao-tzu wrote: “A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step.”

Most important things in life are done step by step. For instance, you don’t achieve financial independence all at once—you save a small amount of money every month for years. You reach health and fitness goals the same way, a little at a time.

Author Brian Tracy crossed the featureless Sahara Desert in Algeria this way—by focusing one at a time on oil barrels that were placed at five-kilometer intervals to mark the route. He kept an eye on each barrel until he reached it, at which point he could see the next one.

Similarly, in completing your task, go as far as you can and, as you reach each milestone, you’ll be able to identify and move toward the next one. Focus on the current step and have confidence that, when you complete it, you’ll know the next step.

Alternatively, imagine your large task is a salami that you’ve cut into thin slices, and you only need to eat one small slice at a time.

One factor in your favor is that humans have a psychological need for closure or completion. **You have a subconscious need to get tasks done and not leave things hanging.** When you’re pushing toward completion and when you finish a task, you feel happy because the completion triggers the release of endorphins. Finishing each step of a bigger task can make you feel good and motivate you to press on to final completion. Completing the task in its entirety makes you feel even better.
