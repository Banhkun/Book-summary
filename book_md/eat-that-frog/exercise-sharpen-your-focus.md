## Exercise: Sharpen Your Focus

To get anything important done well, you need to focus your attention on it. But often, people’s attention is scattered and interrupted, especially with constant messages and social media.

* * *

Describe your typical morning at work. What do you do first? How many tasks do you start and compete? How often are you interrupted?

In a typical morning, how often do you check and respond to emails? What if you reduced your checks to only one time—how would that affect the rest of your work?

Besides minimizing email checks, what else can you do create two 90-minute periods of sustained focus?
