## Exercise: Overcoming Limitations

In every effort, there’s always a major constraint or limiting factor somewhere that hinders your progress on completing your task or achieving your goal. Finding and removing it is crucial to your success.

* * *

Think of a task at work or a goal you’re trying to achieve. List the main factors affecting how quickly you accomplish this task. They could be internal (inside your company), external, or personal.

What’s the biggest factor—the one whose removal would speed your progress the most? What can you do about it?

Consider your key life goal or career goal and answer the same questions to identify the biggest factor holding you back.
