## Chapter 7: Focus on Results

Everyone is hired to produce specific results in several key areas. You need to know your key areas and expectations because your success and the company’s depend on delivering these results.

Most people get the concept of focusing on results, but they still have one of two problems:

  * They’re unsure of the results they’re supposed to produce and are being measured by.
  * They procrastinate on doing things in certain key areas important to the company and their career because they’re not good at doing those things.



Your key areas are things you’re responsible for accomplishing—if you don’t do them, no one does. For example, key result areas for managers and salespeople are:

  * Manager: planning, hiring, delegating, supervising, evaluating, and reporting
  * Salesperson: prospecting, building customer relationships, making offers, handling objections, closing sales, and getting referrals



It’s crucial to know what your key areas are and the expected results for your job. If you’re unsure of the specific results you’ve been hired to deliver, you won’t know how well you’re performing or how to improve and advance in your career.

### Clarify Expectations

Identify your key deliverables as you understand them, and discuss them with your boss to make sure you’re in agreement on what they are.

Also, discuss them with colleagues whose work must be coordinated with yours, so you’re moving in the same direction. For example, if you’re a salesperson, when you close a sale, others become involved in delivering the product or service. Further, your individual performance impacts whether your department or company meets sales and revenue goals.

Once you’ve identified your key areas, grade yourself in each area on a scale of 1-10 to indicate your strengths and weaknesses. Even if you’re excelling in five of six areas, poor performance in one area will hold you back. For example, a manager who can’t delegate may fail because it’s key to supervising and getting results from others.

Weak performance in a certain area can also lead you to procrastinate in that area or avoid it. Instead of ignoring or rationalizing your weaknesses, focus on the expectations you need to meet and develop a plan for excelling in all areas. The better you get, the more motivated you’ll be to complete the important tasks.

### A Clarifying Question

To help guide your career, here’s a useful question to ask yourself: **What skill would have the greatest impact on furthering my career if I excelled at it?**

Look inside yourself for the answer—you may already know it. Also, ask your boss, colleagues, and coworkers. Then, make a plan and start working to improve your performance in this area. You should have confidence in your ability to improve because most skills in business are learnable.

You’ll be able to overcome procrastination and get more done faster when you perform well in every key result area, in the process also boosting your career.
