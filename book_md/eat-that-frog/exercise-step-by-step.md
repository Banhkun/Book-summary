## Exercise: Step by Step

The best way to overcome procrastination and make a big job doable is to focus on completing it one step at a time.

* * *

Think of a task or goal you’ve been procrastinating on. Make a list of every step or action you’ll need to take to complete this task.

Organize the steps in the order they need to be done. What’s your first step? Can you break that step into even smaller steps? Think of slicing a salami into very thin slices.

What will be the benefits of completing this task? How will you feel upon completion?
