## Chapter 4: Weigh the Consequences

**You can determine how important a task is by considering the consequences of doing or not doing it.** This can help you determine what frog to eat, or what to do next.

According to a Harvard researcher, taking a long-term view is the biggest predictor of success. It’s more important than family, connections, or education.

How far ahead you think affects your decisions and actions. People who take a short-term view opt for immediate gratification; they tend to focus on relieving present tension and drudgery this way. Successful people delay short-term gratification, and focus on achieving longer-term goals for their career and life. Because they’re future-oriented, they consider how their current options will contribute to the future they desire. As a result, they make better decisions—use their time better—than those who give the future little thought.

At work, knowing what’s important to you in the long term helps you make better decisions about your priorities in the present. **The important things have significant long-term consequences; the unimportant things have few long-term consequences**. Activities with significant long-term impact might include taking courses to improve skills, reading about your field, and focusing on high-value tasks that will help you accomplish more and get ahead.

If a task has significant positive consequences or impact, make it a priority and start on it immediately. The greater the potential positive impact of a task, the more motivated you’ll be to stop procrastinating and get it done. Keep focused and build momentum by starting and completing consequential tasks one by one.

If there are likely to be significant negative consequences if you _don’t_ do a particular task quickly, make that task a priority as well, so it doesn’t derail your goals.

Time passes regardless of what you do with it—but how you use it, or what you do in the short term, determines where you end up down the road. Thinking about future consequences helps you determine your priorities.

### Deadlines and ‘The Law of Forced Efficiency’

**The “Law of Forced Efficiency” states that while there isn't time to do everything, there’s sufficient time to do the most important thing**.

You experience this when you have an imminent deadline on an important project. When you know the consequences of missing a deadline on a key task and time is running out, you find a way to get the task done, often at the last minute. You do whatever it takes in order to avoid the consequences of missing the deadline. You’re forced—or force yourself—to be efficient.

Sometimes, deadline pressure is the result of having multiple important things to do—many managers under this kind of pressure are working at 110% of capacity. The only recourse is to focus on each top thing in turn. But deadline pressure also can be self-imposed—a result of procrastination. This kind of deadline pressure works against you.

Many people say they work better under deadline pressure, but research indicates the opposite.

Under deadline pressure from procrastinating, people feel stressed, make mistakes, and have to redo work, which ends up taking _more_ time. Often the mistakes—such as product flaws and cost overruns—have long-term financial consequences.

It’s better to plan your time, and create “wiggle room” for unforeseen issues; add 20% to the estimated time a project will take. When you’re in control of your most important tasks, you’ll be calmer, more confident, and do a better job.

### Three Productivity Questions

Three questions can help you maximize your productivity:

**1) What are your most impactful activities?** Which ones will make the biggest contribution to your organization or your life? Besides answering this question yourself, ask your boss, coworkers, and others what they think the highest-value things are for you to do. Have a definite answer before you start anything.

**2) What can you alone do that will have a significant impact?** This is something only you can do—if you don’t do it, no one will. Doing it will make a big difference in your work or life.

**3) What’s the best use of your time at the moment?** This is the key to effective time management; answering it enables you to overcome procrastination and be productive. At any given moment, one task will be the best use of your time and is the one you should be working on.
