## Exercise: Make a List

Planning is as simple as making a list of the things you need to do. Create different lists and move items between themâ€”you need a master list, plus monthly, weekly, and daily lists. Spending 10 minutes to plan your day in advance saves up to two hours in wasted time and effort during your day.

* * *

For your job or personal life, make a master to-do list of everything you can think of for the immediate future. Then, as appropriate, move items from your master list to a monthly list.

Plan your upcoming week by making a weekly list, pulling items from your calendar as well as from your master and monthly lists. How does having a list of tasks for the week make you feel?

Now, pulling items from your other lists, make a list for the next day of specific items you will complete that day. Organize the tasks by priority.

Try this process with a project. Think of a work or home project, then make a list of every step required to complete it. Organize the steps by priority and sequence.
