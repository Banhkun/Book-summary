## Exercise: Building Relationships

You need successful relationships in order to have a meaningful life. Your primary or most important relationships should get most of your attention â€” you need to nourish them so they grow. But people often spend less time on these relationships than on peripheral relationships such as coworkers, neighbors, community members, and acquaintances.

* * *

What are the two most important relationships in your life? How much time do you devote to them per week, compared to your peripheral relationships?

How can you come up with more time to devote to your most important relationships? What other relationships or activities could you drop?

What step could you take immediately to improve one of your key relationships?
