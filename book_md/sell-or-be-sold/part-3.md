## Part 3: Sales Processes | Chapter 5: Improve and Implement Sales Processes

In Parts 1 and 2, we learned how to work on ourselves and our customers to improve our sales game. In this part, we’ll learn how to improve existing sales practices and learn a universal five-step sales process that works for almost any industry.

### Improving Existing Sales Processes

To assess your current sales processes, ask yourself:

  * Are customers complaining about how long it takes to buy something?
  * Are customers resisting you?
  * Are you getting low profit per transaction? (Are customers only buying your inexpensive products, not your pricier ones?)



If you answered yes to any of these questions, use the following steps to improve your processes:

**1\. Shorten them.** Many organizations have 10-12-step processes that take a long time to execute. Customers want to get in and out fast and don’t want to be forced to spend time with someone they don’t like (such as a salesperson), so the process should only take as long as a customer needs to become comfortable making a purchase.

**2\. Modernize them.** Most sales advice is ineffective or 50 years out of date. Sales processes need to take into account the fact that today it’s easier to access information, people are busier, and marriages are more equal and both parties have incomes and make decisions.

  * For example, for the past 50 years, accepted advice has been to spend as long as possible with a customer because they’ll feel indebted to you. As we learned in the first step, this doesn’t work today because customers don’t want to waste time.



**3\. Take the transparency test.** If you can’t advertise your sales process because it would horrify people (for example, step two is to flat-out lie to the customer), then there’s something wrong with it.

**4\. Prioritize the right players.** Sales processes should prioritize the customer, then the salesperson, and only then management. This is because a customer won’t buy if she’s inconvenienced by the process or isn’t given a proper pitch because the salesperson is hampered by the process.

### Universal Five-Step Sales Process

If you find that your existing sales process is too convoluted to improve, or you just want to try something new, you can experiment with Cardone’s universal five-step process. You’ll have to customize or tweak this process for your product, but the basic structure will work in any industry.

**1\. Greet the customer.** This is a short step that involves exchanging names, making a quick, good first impression (rapport comes later), and making the customer feel comfortable. Approach the customer, smile, thank them for seeing you, and shake her hand (making physical contract breaks the ice). Then, ask her what information she’d like.

**2\. Figure out what the customer wants and needs.** Do this by asking questions about previous things she’s bought, her motivations, what problems she’s trying to solve, and so on. This step isn’t about selling—it’s about information-gathering. The goal is to find out which product to show the customer and which features to highlight.

  * For example, if a customer wants a glass of water, is it to make her place settings look pretty, because she’s thirsty, or to flush an irritant from her eye?



**3\. Present a product.** Instead of letting a potential customer choose her product, pick something for her that will meet the wants and needs you determined in step 2. Don’t present all the benefits of a product—highlight the specific features that she’ll be most interested in to save both of you time. This step is about making the customer want the product, heightening its value, and creating urgency.

  * For example, if the customer who wanted a glass of water wanted it to set her table, she’s more interested in the aesthetics of the glass than the water inside it.



**4\. Make an offer.** First, ask everyone to sit down. (When you’re standing up, it’s too easy to rely on talking and pitching, which, as we learned, isn’t as credible as showing). Then, show your customer documentation and figures even if she’s not ready to see them. (She needs this information before she can think about making a purchase.) Finally, don’t ask her if she wants to buy—this would give her the opportunity to say no. Instead, ask her to sign the offer or to follow you to the next step.

**5\. Close.** Closing is getting the customer to hand over her money, sign a contract, or otherwise commit to the sale. It involves handling stalls and objections, and it’s the hardest part of the sales process. (For more detailed instructions on closing, Cardone recommends reading his book _The Closer’s Survival Guide_.)

#### The “Hard Sell”

**Cardone defines the “hard sell” as the moment the salesperson’s job becomes hard** (not as the moment a salesperson starts putting pressure on a customer). There’s often a point in the close where you’ll become uncomfortable—perhaps the customer starts screaming—and you must be able to endure this discomfort to make the sale. When you come to a difficult objection or feel yourself faltering, use the following strategies:

**1\. Recall your own conviction about the product.** This will give you the drive to hold your position and insist. Additionally, don’t let customers sell _you_ on their conflicting ideas and objections.

  * For example, a customer once said he felt Cardone was pressuring him. Cardone responded by explaining that he strongly believed the product would help the customer and asking him not to mistake Cardone’s passion and enthusiasm for pressure.



**2\. Don’t believe the reasons customers give you for not buying.** They’re likely excuses, not actual objections. Remember that the major reason people don’t buy is that they don’t think a product will meet their needs or wants. Prepare responses for common reasons.

  * For example, to handle the objection that someone needs to talk to her partner, you might say that if her relationship is anything like yours, she’ll have already discussed it.



**3\. Ask forward questions.** Ask for the information you need to help someone (such as why someone can’t put up the money), even if some people might consider it prying. Listen attentively to the answers and don’t answer the question yourself.

**4\. Ask for the sale multiple times.** Even if you think the customer will say no and reject you, ask her to buy. If she says no, keep asking. Almost no one will buy something without being asked, and most people need to be asked multiple times. (Many salespeople don’t even ask in the first place and this is the top reason why they fail.)

**5\. Don’t let yelling or emotional outbursts drive you away.** These reactions mean that the customer is close to buying. To handle them:

  * Stay with her even though it’s painful. Don’t be “polite” and leave.
  * Don’t take anything personally. The customer is probably upset about something that doesn’t have anything to do with you, such as her own budget limitations or fear of buying the wrong thing.
  * Stay in the present. Don’t think about times someone got emotional and _didn’t_ buy.
  * Maintain your calm and rationality.



For example, when saleswoman and fundraiser Charmaigne was fundraising for charity, she asked Cardone for a donation even though he’d already said no. He yelled at her. She responded by smiling and saying that the only reason he was being emotional was that he felt he hadn’t done enough. He donated more.

**6\. Visualize the desired outcome.** In your mind’s eye, see the customer handing over their money or owning the product.

**7.** After each hard sell, **write down the objections and details about the interaction** so you can use what you learned the next time you close.
