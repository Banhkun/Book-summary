## Chapter 2: Sell Yourself First

In the previous chapter, we looked at four steps to becoming a master salesperson. Now, it’s time to start selling—to yourself. **Before you can sell something to someone, you first have to sell _yourself_ on it, **because if you don’t believe in the product, buyers will sense your lack of conviction and won’t make a purchase.

To sell yourself:

**1\. Be unreasonable in your conviction that what you’re selling is superior.** Never even let it cross your mind that there might be something out there that can compete with your product. Your belief should be unshakeable in the face of customer objections, and if you’re truly convinced, no one will even challenge you.

  * For example, the people who work at Apple stores love Apple products. None of them would even consider buying a PC.



**2\. Ignore any negatives associated with your product** and concentrate only on the positives. Every week, make a list of why you (and others) should own the product.

**3\. Be willing to buy the product yourself at the price you’re asking** because you think the product is worth every penny. Expense is no excuse. If you believe that the product is guaranteed to work out (as you will need to, to be sold on it), then you should have no trouble using all your savings or going into debt to buy it. Every week, make a list of why the product is worth the money.

  * For example, when Cardone was selling a house that was worth $6 million, he set the asking price at $8.9 million because the house was in a great location and he thought that was valuable. He would have paid that price for the house and location himself, and only two months later, he sold it for just under the asking price.



**4\. Believe that _not_ buying your product from you is the worst decision of someone’s life.** You must think that failing to convince her to buy is an unethical disservice that you lose sleep over.

**If you’re having trouble feeling sold on your product, buy it yourself.** This will automatically make you more sold on it. Additionally, owning what you’re selling is one of the strongest ways to demonstrate conviction to others.

  * For example, when a car insurance and finance salesman was having trouble selling, he approached Cardone for help. The salesman had just bought a car but hadn’t bought any of the products he sold. Cardone told him to buy his products, and once he did, his income increased by 400%.



**There are some products you won’t be able to sell yourself on** —therefore, you won’t be able to sell them. For example, if you think smoking is unhealthy, you won’t be able to sell cigarettes. This is fine. You don’t need to be able to sell every product to be a good salesperson.

### Becoming _Un_ sold: The Three-Month Slump

There’s a common phenomenon in sales in which a salesperson sells a product successfully for 90 days and then chokes. **If you find your sales slumping, there’s a good chance you’ve become _un_ sold** (perhaps you’ve gotten some feedback from consumers that the product isn’t as good as you thought it was, and now you’re sold on the idea that you _shouldn’t_ sell the product). To escape the slump:

  * Review the reasons the product is beneficial.
  * Find out what’s causing your lack of conviction.
  * Recall the same spirit you had when you were first selling the product.
  * Troubleshoot your failures. Perhaps when you failed to close a sale for the first time, you attributed it to the wrong reason and therefore came up with the wrong solution, and are continuing to use this inappropriate solution.
  * Don’t blame unrelated factors. For example, some people feel their competitors (or the Internet) can offer such good prices that no one will buy from them. As long as you are sold, you can outcompete.
  * Consider whether management has made changes that affect the sales process. For example, if management is asking you to do something unethical, you’ll likely feel reluctant to sell.
