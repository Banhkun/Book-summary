## Introduction

When most people hear the word “salesperson,” they think of professionals in stores who encourage them to buy things. In fact, **_everyone_ is a salesperson—whenever you need to influence, persuade, negotiate, or even just communicate with someone, you are selling.** The best salespeople sometimes don’t even use that job title—instead, they’re negotiators, politicians, coaches, and so on.

**Whether or not you’re officially employed as a salesperson, your happiness and even survival depend on your selling ability.** If you can’t convince someone that you’re worth spending time with, you won’t have any close relationships. If you can’t convince yourself to eat vegetables and exercise, your health will suffer. If you can’t convince someone to give you a job or buy something from you, you won’t have the money to meet your basic needs. Therefore, **you won’t be successful if you don’t know how to sell, no matter who or where you are or what profession you’re in.** There are no exceptions.

  * For example, at first glance, doctors’ jobs may appear to revolve around healing people. However, their medical abilities aren’t what determines if they’re successful, their sales abilities are—if they can’t convince people that they’re knowledgeable and worth listening to, people won’t follow their instructions and won’t be healed.



In this summary:

  * In Part 1, you’ll learn how to set yourself up to be a successful salesperson in both professional and personal contexts. 
  * In Part 2, you’ll look at how to interact with customers.
  * In Part 3, you’ll learn an effective sales process. 



Note: _Sell or Be Sold_ is a revised and updated edition of _Sell to Survive_ , which Cardone self-published in 2008.

(Shortform note: _Sell or Be Sold_ was originally written in 22 chapters. We’ve reorganized the material for concision and clarity.)
