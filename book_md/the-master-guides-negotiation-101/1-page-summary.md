## 1-Page Summary

In our daily lives, **we all negotiate with others for things we want** , whether the context is business or personal. For instance, at work you may negotiate a contract with a supplier or a pay raise with a supervisor, while in your personal life you might negotiate with your friends about which movie you’re going to see. In any situation where you’re looking to get something from someone _else_ , you’re engaged in a negotiation.

Experts have different theories about the best approach to getting what you want out of a negotiation, how to think about the needs and goals of your counterpart (the person on the other side of the negotiation), how to prepare for a negotiation session, and tactics to maximize your chances of getting the best possible outcome. In Shortform’s Master Guide to negotiation, we’ve synthesized the ideas and recommendations from some of the world’s leading negotiation experts to help give you a competitive edge the next time you sit down to bargain. We’ll explore insights from:

  * _Never Split the Difference_ by Chris Voss
  * _Getting to Yes_ by Roger Fisher and William Ury
  * _Negotiation Genius_ by Deepak Malhotra and Max H. Bazerman
  * _The Art of Thinking Clearly _by Rolf Dobelli 
  * _The Art of the Deal_ by Donald Trump



### Two Main Approaches to Negotiation

At its most basic level, **any negotiation is about getting something you need from someone _else_**. And, by the same token, they’re looking to get something they need from _you_. To be a successful negotiator, you need to understand how we determine what our wants and needs are. Do our _emotions_ drive those needs, or are we essentially utility maximizers who always follow rational incentives to increase our material well-being?

The different answers to this question reflect the two main approaches to negotiation:

  * The _emotional approach_ says that in a negotiation, people are primarily motivated by their needs for emotional security and safety. Thus, your job as a negotiator is to help your counterpart meet those needs by practicing and displaying empathy toward them—which will get them to let their emotional guard down and enable you to get what you want from them.
  * The _rational approach_ says that your job as a negotiator is to efficiently and respectfully reach a fair agreement that provides clear and concrete benefits for both you and your counterpart. Contrary to the emotional approach, it’s about deciding issues based on objective measures and _separating_ emotions from the issue being negotiated. 



In this section, we’ll explore recommendations on structuring your negotiation and your interactions with your counterpart for each approach.

#### The Emotional Approach

In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss writes that**good negotiation happens on the emotional level of the brain, not the rational level**. Your job as a negotiator, Voss argues, is to practice and display empathy toward your counterpart by understanding their emotions, learning to see the situation from their point of view—and, ultimately, getting them to feel comfortable enough with you to let their emotional guard down. When they’ve reached this level of comfort with you, you’re in a better position to get them to agree to _your_ terms and conditions and meet _your_ needs.

According to Voss,**most people have two basic emotional needs—to feel secure and to feel in control.** To help your counterpart meet these needs, Voss advocates using calculated empathy—understanding someone _else’s_ feelings to get what _you_ want from them. This enables your counterpart to feel emotionally safe with you—to see you more as a _partner_ than an adversary.**** Calculated empathy techniques include:

  * Talking slowly and calmly to show that you’re _concerned_ about how the other person feels.
  * Using a light and encouraging voice to put your counterpart at ease.
  * Identifying, vocalizing, and labeling your counterpart’s emotions**** through phrases like, “It seems like you’re disappointed by what’s being offered.” 



Once you’ve used these techniques to get your counterpart to see you more as a partner (or even a friend) rather than an adversary, you’ll be able to tap into their _real_ desires and fears. And once you’ve unlocked these, you’ll have the upper hand.

##### Establish an Emotional Connection by Building Trust

Similarly, Deepak Malhotra and Max H. Bazerman (_Negotiation Genius_) write that **building trust and establishing an emotional connection with your counterpart is key to a successful negotiation**. They urge you to use vocabulary that your counterpart understands and consider spending time with them outside of the negotiation setting. This will make them more cooperative and open to sharing information with you.

Likewise, Roger Fisher and William Ury (_Getting to Yes_) emphasize the need to **build a positive relationship and person-to-person connection with the other side**. Before negotiations begin, get to know the people on the other side personally. It’s easier to negotiate with someone you know than with a stranger. Meet informally, learn each others’ likes and dislikes, and take the time to chat when you run into people whom you might have to negotiate with.

##### Understand Cognitive Biases

Once you’ve established an emotional connection with your counterpart by practicing strategic empathy and developing an interpersonal relationship, you can use that insight to **take advantage of your counterpart’s cognitive biases:mental errors in routine information processing that impact how we react to situations and form judgments.** Knowing your counterpart’s emotional wants and needs will enable you to frame your proposals and counteroffers in a way that appeals to those wants and needs.

Voss (_Never Split the Difference_) identifies some key cognitive biases that you can use to your advantage.

**The framing effect: People respond differently to identical choices based solely on how they’re presented**. For example, you’re a hiring manager and you’re trying to get a candidate to accept a job, but you don’t want to exceed the salary posted on your job description. And in the course of the negotiation, you’ve picked up that this candidate has an emotional need for a healthy work/life balance. Without budging on salary or changing anything substantive about the job, you can use the framing effect to _position_ the job in a way that speaks to those needs and makes the job more appealing. You might do this by highlighting flexible working hours, generous vacation policies, and remote work.

**Loss aversion: People fear an equal loss more than they value an equal gain**. Knowing this, you can put yourself in a strong negotiating position by framing your preferred solution as one that _prevents your counterpart from incurring a loss_. For example, if you’re making an offer on a house that needs some work, you might say something like, “The house is great, but it definitely needs significant contracting work. Now, I’m willing to waive inspection, but if we take too long, I might have to start looking for other deals.” By making them fear missing out on the sale, you make them more likely to accept your offer than if you’d framed it in purely positive terms.

##### Take Advantage of Logical Biases

Knowing how to take advantage of your counterpart’s irrationality can give you a powerful edge. In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli identifies a set of logical biases that, like Voss’s cognitive biases, enable you to take advantage of your counterpart’s emotional needs and desires by getting them to overlook what might be their rational self-interest.

**Social proof and authority bias:** **To maintain your place in a group, you’re pressured to copy other people’s behavior, especially if that person is an authority**. For example, if you’re selling your house and you come to understand that status and prestige are powerful emotional needs for the buyer, you might emphasize that your neighborhood is home to a lot of wealthy, powerful, influential people who’ve _also_ decided that it’s a great place to live.

**Story bias: People prefer entertaining narratives to boring facts**. In a negotiation context, taking advantage of your counterpart’s story bias might mean shying away from reciting facts about how your offer is advantageous for your counterpart. Instead, you might tell a story about the kind of life they could lead or the kind of person they could be if they make a deal with you. For example, if you’re selling your home to a first-time homebuyer, you might emphasize that buying the house is their entry to homeownership, generational wealth creation, and their first step toward realizing the American Dream.

#### The Rational Approach

The opposite of the emotional approach to negotiating is the rational approach. Practitioners of this theory write that **facts, evidence, and rational self-interest are what determine successful negotiations—with results based on fair, objective standards**.

Fisher and Ury (_Getting to Yes_) are major proponents of this approach. As we discussed in the previous section, they acknowledge the value of building emotional comfort and personal rapport with your negotiating counterpart. However, through their method of “principled negotiation,” they highlight the importance of separating personalities and emotions from the issue being negotiated. According to Fisher and Ury, negotiations can fall apart when emotions get too intertwined with the substance of the discussion. Fundamentally, they write, a successful negotiator focuses on the underlying rational interests of each side, not on emotions.

For example, if you’re negotiating with your spouse about which movie to see and you disagree with their choice, letting your emotions get the better of you might produce a response from you such as, “We always see what you want to see, and you know I hate action movies. It feels like you don’t actually care about what I want.”

Because you’ve made this too emotion-based, your spouse may feel attacked or get defensive, which will make it harder to reach a mutually satisfying resolution. A response more rooted in the rational approach might sound something like, “I know we both want to spend quality time together, and we want to spend our money doing something we’ll _both_ enjoy. Why don’t we each say what we’d really like to get out of this evening together and come up with a way for us both to be happy by the time we go home?”

### Preparing to Negotiate

Regardless of whether you accept the emotional approach or the rational approach to negotiation, experts agree that preparing for your negotiation is essential. In the section below, we’ll cover the main ways to prepare for a successful negotiation—by preparing for the worst, planning your moves and countermoves in advance, determining your boundaries for the negotiation, and understanding what kind of negotiator you’re going up against.

#### Preparare First—and Plan for the Worst

Fisher and Ury (_Getting to Yes_) write that **preparation is the first step in any negotiation**. Since you won’t know what the other side’s strategy is going to be, it’s best to focus on preparation initially and decide your direction of argument later.

They recommend some important preparation tactics:

  * **Think about the end:** Before starting to negotiate, think about what a good agreement would look like. To get there, what issues would have to be resolved? What kind of agreement could both you and your counterpart justify to yourselves? Envisioning the end result will help you stay on track.
  * **Draft a framework agreement.** Create a document that outlines a potential agreement with spaces for each item to be resolved. It can serve as an agenda, help keep discussions focused, and ensure important issues are addressed.



You also need to set yourself up so that you’re not surprised by the twists and turns of a negotiation. In _The Art of the Deal_ , Donald Trump writes that you need to prepare for the worst: No matter how well it seems to be going, any deal can fall through. If you act conservatively and prepare for this worst-case scenario, you’ll protect yourself against loss or failure.

For example, if you’re negotiating the starting salary for a job offer you’ve received, you might prepare for the worst by researching the salary range for comparable positions. Knowing the lowest end of the estimated salary range will give you a good baseline to know if your potential employer is lowballing you. If the worst happens and their initial offer is at the bottom of the range (or maybe even lower), you can plan your countermoves accordingly (a topic we’ll explore in greater depth in the next section).

Similarly, Trump emphasizes the need to have a backup plan. Even if a deal doesn’t fall through, conditions can change. Have a plan B, plan C, and even plan D—and be flexible and agile enough to pivot to any of them. To continue with our salary negotiation example, your backup plan for a lowball offer might be to make a list of your achievements, skills, and unique strengths as a candidate that demonstrate your value to the company.

#### Know Your Moves (and Your Counterpart’s)

On a more tactical level, Voss (_Never Split the Difference_) cautions that to prepare for a negotiation, **you need to plan some specific dodge-and-counterpunch moves to use—especially when you’re going up against a seasoned negotiator**.

##### Dodging Tactics

These are what you do to deflect your counterpart’s “punches”—aggressive threats, demands, and deadlines they may throw at you to pressure you into making a deal on their terms. You can use open-ended questions to say “no” without actually using the word, or pivot to non-monetary terms. Say things like, “Let’s put price aside for now. What _else_ can you offer that would make this a good deal for me?”

##### Strategic Umbrage

You need to be prepared to hit back without getting angry. Voss champions a technique psychologists call “strategic umbrage.” This means being genuinely angry (not faking it), but in control of your emotions. The key to strategic umbrage is getting angry at the _offer_ being made—not the person making it. Saying, “I’m afraid there are no circumstances that would make that proposal work for me” in a displeased—but measured—tone is a good way to leverage a little bit of anger to your advantage.

_Non_ strategic umbrage would mean letting your angry emotions completely dictate your negotiating posture in a way that’s counterproductive. In practice, this would involve losing your cool and making _personal_ attacks against your counterpart by saying things like, “If you think I’d even consider that pathetic excuse of an offer, either _you’re_ an idiot or you think I am.”

#### Determine Your Boundaries for the Negotiation

Negotiation experts write that there are a few tools you can use to determine your boundaries for the negotiation—specifically, when you’d walk away from a negotiation, your minimum conditions for a deal, and the range of outcomes that would be acceptable to both you _and_ your counterpart.

##### Find Your BATNA and Learn When to Walk Away

Fisher and Ury write that one tool to prepare for a negotiation is to **determine your best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA)**. Knowing your BATNA helps you decide when and whether it’s better to accept the deal or to walk away.

Their logic for using BATNA is this:

  1. The purpose of negotiating is to get better results than you’d get without negotiating. 
  2. Therefore, when negotiating, you need to know your best alternative to negotiation in order to know whether to accept an agreement. 
  3. Once you know this, measure any proposed agreement against your best alternative or BATNA. It will protect you from accepting a bad agreement, as well as from rejecting a good agreement. 



##### RV and ZOPA: Finding You and Your Counterpart’s Conditions for a Deal

In _Negotiation Genius_ , Malhotra and Bazerman supplement Fisher and Ury’s BATNA concept with two additional negotiation benchmarks to determine ahead of time: the RV and the ZOPA.

**Your reservation value (RV) is the _worst_ deal you’re willing to accept in your current negotiation**. For example, this might be the highest price you’re willing to pay or the lowest price at which you’re willing to sell. They recommend figuring out what your counterpart’s RV is as well.

**Your zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) is the space between your RV and your counterpart’s**. For example, if your lowest selling price is $10,000 and the highest your counterpart’s willing to pay is $15,000, then the ZOPA is between $10,000 and $15,000. This range gives you a more tangible measurement of how much value you can either claim or surrender during a negotiation. To claim the most value, you want to make a deal as close to your counterpart’s RV (_their_ worst potential deal) as possible.

#### Know What Type of Negotiator You’re Dealing With

Voss (_Never Split the Difference_) writes that before you finally get down to the business of negotiating, you need to understand what type of negotiator you’re going up against.

Voss identifies three main types of negotiators: Givers, Calculators, and Aggressives.

##### Givers

**Givers are people-pleasers who tend to be highly sociable and agreeable—but also poor time managers**. They’ll often agree to things that they can’t actually follow through on, since they’re so eager to make you happy. When dealing with a giver, Voss recommends focusing on implementation—getting details on how and when they’ll actually follow through on their commitments.

##### Calculators

**Calculators are methodical and diligent people who want to assess all the facts before committing to a decision**. As a result, they’re fairly unconcerned with time and less likely to be pressured by deadlines. When dealing with a Calculator, Voss recommends using clear, unambiguous data to back up your assertions. Also, don’t ad-lib, and avoid giving them any surprises.

##### Aggressives

**Aggressives are achievement-oriented people who prioritize getting things done.** They hate wasted time and care a _lot_ about meeting—and beating—deadlines. According to Voss, aggressives can be especially vulnerable to time pressures, since the biggest defeat to them is making no deal at all. If you can back them into a corner where they’re facing a deadline, you’ll be in a great position to dictate the terms.

Ury and Fisher (_Getting to Yes_) identify a similar type of negotiator to Voss’s Aggressives: Hardball negotiators. They offer suggestions for how to handle them.

**Hardball negotiators view negotiation as a contest they must win. Their strategy is to take the toughest positions and hold out the longest**. Their win-at-any-cost approach exhausts energy and resources and ruins their relationship with the other side. Ury and Fisher write that one of the most effective ways to counter this tactic is to simply call attention to it at the outset. Doing so will blunt the effectiveness of your counterpart’s bluster and cause them to worry that they’ve overplayed their hand and alienated you. As a result, they may drop it.

### How to Bargain

Having explored the two main approaches to negotiation and looked at how to prepare, let’s examine how to strike the best possible deal when you’re face-to-face at the negotiating table. In this section, we’ll cover:

  * How to take advantage of new information
  * How to use the Ackerman model to craft your offer



#### Take Advantage of Information

Voss (_Never Split the Difference_) writes that in every negotiation, **there is some hidden piece of information that, if it were known, would completely transform the dynamic of the negotiation and the final outcome**. Voss writes that there are three types of information.

**1)Known Knowns**: These are the things you know for sure. In a negotiation, the known knowns are things like your counterpart’s name, their offer, and the knowledge gained from your experience in past negotiations.

**2)Known Unknowns**: This is information that you know exists but don’t possess yourself.**** In a negotiation, a known unknown might be your counterpart’s price ceiling (the highest amount they’re willing to pay) or her dealbreaker condition. You know she _has_ these; you just don’t know what they are.

**3)Unknown Unknowns**: The most important pieces of information, according to Voss, are the _unknown unknowns_. These are the bits of information that we lack—and, crucially, don’t _know_ that we lack. In a negotiation, those who can best identify and exploit the unknown unknowns are those who come out on top. For example, if you discovered that your counterpart was facing some sort of external financial pressure (from a lawsuit or a job loss), you would have crucial leverage over them, because this information would tell you that your counterpart would likely accept a heavily discounted offer.

Similarly, Malhotra and Bazerman (_Negotiation Genius_) write that it’s critical to seek out information that negotiators commonly overlook, such as:

  1. **How the other side makes decisions.** Your counterpart may be bound to specific decision-making rules, such as being required to weigh criteria differently or needing to get the approval of a supervisor. By discovering this, you can figure out how to meet these criteria in a way that’s most suitable for you.
  2. **How strong the other side’s position is.** Negotiators may overlook their competitor’s strengths or underestimate how much information they have. To avoid this, the authors recommend you deliberately consider what unique advantages your competitors may have.



#### Use the Ackerman Model to Craft Your Offer

Voss (_Never Split the Difference_) recommends what he calls the Ackerman Model as a good alternative to traditional negotiating. Created by ex-CIA operative Mike Ackerman (who later founded a company advising law enforcement on kidnapping situations), this model is based on the offer-counteroffer system. It uses a tapering system that brings the ultimate number (whether it’s the price you’ll be paying or the price you’ll be receiving) closer to your preference.

Voss writes that the Ackerman Model improves on the traditional “split the difference” approach, which tends to produce a mutually _dissatisfying_ result.

Below, we’ll explore some of the key steps in the Ackerman model.

##### 1) Choose a Target Price

This should be ambitious, but reasonable. You don’t want to negotiate with yourself and set your target price too high (if you’re the buyer), but you also don’t want to set it so low that your counterpart would never agree to it. Doing some research beforehand will help you set your goal. Ury and Fisher (_Getting to Yes_) similarly caution against starting with an unreasonable position, as it can set off a struggle of wills with each side trying to force its position on the other. This leads to mounting anger and resentment—and if the bad feelings linger, it can become hard to reach a deal.

##### 2) Offer 65% of Your Target Price

Thus, if you’re aiming to pay $100,000, your opening bid should be $65,000. This is a starting bid designed to catch your counterpart off guard. Voss writes that an extreme starting bid like this can also trigger your _own_ sense of loss aversion in a constructive way. By starting with a low offer, you’ll start thinking of anything higher than that as a “loss,” which you’ll work hard to avoid. In reality of course, you’re still well below your target price at this point, so even if you move off your opening bid it’s still a “win” for you.

However, Ury and Fisher (_Getting to Yes_) warn that this sort of “positional bargaining” can compel negotiators to become rigid in their positions to the point where they can’t accept _any_ offer if it doesn’t meet their original position—even if that offer is better than no deal at all. The harder you try to convince the other side of the rightness of your position, and the more you defend it against attack, the more strongly committed to it you become. You feel compelled to maintain consistency with your past positions and to save face by not giving in.

##### 3) Plan Your Counteroffers

When planning your counteroffers, use three increases—but each time, reduce the size of the increase.**** For example, Voss recommends countering at first with a number that’s 85% of your target price (a 20 percentage-point jump). Then, you increase it to 95% of your target price (only a 10 percentage-point jump this time). If they’re _still_ not accepting this, then finally you meet them at your full target price (which by this point is a modest 5 percentage-point jump).

All of this activates your counterpart’s emotional instinct to be fair, reasonable, and reciprocal. Most people, writes Voss, are naturally inclined to match what they see as generosity toward themselves with generosity of their own toward others—indeed, most people don’t want to feel like they’re freeloaders. So when they see you making what _appear_ to be concessions (even though you’re only really going up to your actual target price), they’ll be more likely to want to match that “generosity” with generosity of their own.

Malhotra and Bazerman (_Negotiation Genius_) write that you can also respond by making an aggressive counteroffer and then suggesting both sides moderate their offers. You can then take control of the conversation by explaining why you made your counteroffer.

An example of this tactic might look something like this: You're negotiating a salary for a new job. The initial offer is $100,000 per year, but you believe this to be below-market. You might make an aggressive counteroffer by asking for $130,000, arguing that the market rate for the position and your unique skills, experience, and proven track record merit this. But you then concede that this number is much higher than their initial offer and may be beyond what their budget can support.

Having acknowledged this, you then signal a willingness to find a middle ground, telling the employer that you really want the job and are committed to reaching a number that you’re both happy with. You suggest that you both abandon your “extreme” positions and reach a number that makes sense for both parties. You ask for $110,000 and gauge how they react to your concession. Thus, you begin with an aggressive counteroffer to assert your value, but you also recognize the need for flexibility and demonstrate understanding and empathy for the employer's perspective.

##### 5) Signal When You’ve Reached Your Limit

Voss recommends**including a non-monetary item along with your final offer to signal that you’re truly at your limit.** For example, after you’ve made your final offer in a salary negotiation, you might signal that this is your final offer by shifting the discussion to other elements of the job, like your title, flexible work schedule, and office location. By pivoting to something other than money, you’re sending a message to your counterpart that the monetary portion of the negotiation is over, and you’re ready to move on to other items.

In _Negotiation Genius_ , Malhotra and Bazerman write that it’s important to keep an eye out for the concessions your counterpart is making during the negotiation. When her concessions progressively get smaller, it may mean that you’re approaching her RV—her worst possible deal, the minimum she’d be willing to accept. At this point, she’s probably less flexible about how much she can concede. However, Malhotra and Bazerman warn that your counterpart may also use this as a tactic to confuse you about her _real_ limits—deceiving you into thinking she can’t make any more concessions, when in fact she can.
