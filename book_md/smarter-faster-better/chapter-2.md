## Chapter 2: Maintaining Focus

Becoming motivated enough to complete a task is only one part of being productive. You also need to make sure that you remain focused on what you’re doing. If you continually become distracted or flit between tasks, you’re not going to be as efficient or as effective.

When you’re learning how to remain focused, it helps to consider the factors that can prevent you from doing so. The brain’s ability to focus effectively can be hampered by two factors:

  1. **Cognitive tunneling:** a cognitive process in which the brain becomes hyper-focused on one stimulus—usually the stimulus that’s the most immediate and obvious—at the expense of all others.
  2. **Reactive thinking:** a cognitive process in which the brain triggers an instinctive, automatic reaction to a stimulus or event.



### Cognitive Tunneling

Cognitive tunneling arises when your brain is forced to transition from an automatic state to a focused state too suddenly.

When you enter a state of “automatic pilot,” your brain takes the opportunity to rest. It disengages you from your surroundings. When you suddenly have to focus again, often due to an unexpected event such as receiving an unforeseen message or an unarranged phone call, your brain has to snap into “focused mode” very quickly.

When this abrupt transition occurs, the brain panics and doesn’t know exactly what to focus on. Rather than using common sense and concentrating on the thing that’s most important to you in your current situation, it takes the easy option. It focuses on something that’s right in front of you and ignores everything else.

Cognitive tunneling may occur during times of extreme stress. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, this may trigger your brain’s panic reaction, kick-starting its frantic search for an easy and obvious stimulus to focus on.

#### How Can Cognitive Tunneling Hurt Your Productivity?

**Cognitive tunneling’s harm lies in the fact that the most obvious stimulus in front of you isn’t necessarily the right stimulus to focus on to maintain your productivity.**

For example, imagine you’re at work. If your brain jumps to focus on the most obvious task that’s in front of it—such as an email you’ve just received—it may bypass more important or productive tasks. You’ll end up focusing your energy on a less useful activity, and your productivity will fall.

Likewise, cognitive tunneling hurts your productivity by robbing you of the ability to choose what to concentrate on. You can no longer choose to focus on tasks that further your priorities and goals. Instead, you’re left at the mercy of your brain’s panicked automatic reaction.

### Reactive Thinking

Reactive thinking is another cognitive process that can cause your focus to be diverted from its most productive path.

Reactive thinking is at the core of creating habits. It allows your brain to respond to certain situations without really having to pause or think about what’s happening. Instead, the brain instinctively reacts using a familiar mental process. For instance, if you’re driving and begin to approach a red light, your brain may instinctively tell you to start braking.

In and of itself, reactive thinking isn’t a bad thing. It can help you to deal with situations quickly and effectively, without having to pause to consider your course of action. **However, reactive thinking becomes problematic when your instinctive reaction is the incorrect response to the situation.**

For instance, your brain may trigger reactive thinking in a scenario that requires conscious thought and judgment in order to find the best way forward. Some situations can’t be successfully resolved solely using instinct; but, your brain may try to do so anyway. This instinctive response may prove to be unhelpful or damaging.

For example, imagine you’re driving down a country road when you notice an obstacle in your path a little way ahead. The thoughtful and appropriate response to the situation would be to brake smoothly and steadily as you approach the object, or to carefully swerve around the object if it’s possible and safe to do so. However, your brain’s instinctive reaction to seeing an obstacle may be to panic and sharply brake. In some situations, this can be dangerous—for example, if a car is close behind you, the driver may not have time to brake and may crash into you. Braking too hard can also damage your car’s brake pads and tires. To solve this situation in the best possible way, you can’t let instinct take over: you need to think carefully about your response.

Likewise, even in situations where reactive thinking may, in theory, be useful, your brain may inadvertently trigger the wrong automatic response for the situation. Because you can’t consciously control reactive thinking, you can’t ensure that the brain chooses the correct reaction.

This unhelpful form of reactive thinking can negatively impact your productivity. For instance, if your brain selects an instinctive reaction that doesn’t further your goals, or a reaction that causes issues that require time and effort to fix, this may hinder your ability to be productive.

#### What Causes Unhelpful Reactive Thinking?

Unhelpful reactive thinking occurs in a similar way to cognitive tunneling. It can be triggered when an unexpected event takes you by surprise and requires your brain to jump from “relaxed mode” to “focused mode” very quickly. The brain wants to deal with this surprising new situation swiftly, and so relies on a process that cuts down your response time: reactive thinking.

However, the brain doesn’t pause to consider whether the reaction it’s triggering is appropriate or not; it’s too startled to do so. It merely jumps to a reaction that you know well—a reaction that is familiar, rather than the one that is most effective. Thus, you’re left at risk of responding to the situation in an inappropriate way. You’re distracted from the most productive solution to the situation and prevented from focusing on the right thing.

### How Can We Teach Ourselves To Focus?

Up until now, we’ve concentrated on the cognitive processes that can prevent you from focusing. The next step is to consider what you can do to avoid these traps and maintain your focus. According to psychologists, the key to doing this may lie in creating mental models.

**A mental model is a narrative that you create in your mind about the world around you.** There are two forms of mental model:

  1. Telling yourself stories about what you’re experiencing as these events are occurring—for example, narrating to yourself who is speaking at each point during a meeting, what they are saying, and how others are responding. 
  2. Creating a narrative that lays out what you expect to happen in the future—for example, imagining how a person may respond when you initiate a difficult conversation, and how the discussion may progress.



You may have already been creating mental models without even realizing it. This way of thinking is a common framework that your brain uses to understand the world around you. However, you may not have considered how you can harness the power of strong and thorough mental models to improve your focus.

#### How Can Mental Models Help You to Focus?

Creating mental models can help with focus in two ways. Firstly, creating mental models of what’s happening around you in the present can lessen your chances of slipping into unhelpful processes such as cognitive tunneling or reactive thinking.

If you keep up a consistent mental model of your day as it’s happening—narrating each event as it happens—your brain never gets the opportunity to slip into a fully “relaxed” mode. It’s constantly active and paying attention to your surroundings. This means that if a sudden event occurs that requires your focus, the brain doesn’t have to make the sharp adjustment from relaxation to concentration. The transition is much smoother, leaving less room for the panic that triggers cognitive tunneling or reactive thinking.

**In preventing these unhelpful processes from taking hold, you are maintaining control of your focus.** You’re not at the mercy of our brain’s automatic reactions any more: you preserve your ability to consciously choose what to focus on and what to ignore. You can direct your focus to the task that’s going to lead to the highest amount of productivity.

Secondly, creating mental models that outline your expectations for the future can prevent your focus from being derailed by distractions. Spending time creating an outline of what you think ought to happen during a certain period of time (for example, during a certain hour or on a certain day) helps you to identify what your focus should be during that period. You can easily decide what you need to concentrate on to make your outline reality.

Then, when the time comes to put your plan into action, you can swiftly identify potential distractions from this vision. Because you have such a strong idea of how you expect things to go, deviations from this outline grab your attention. You can then decide whether these distractions are important enough to require your focus, or whether they can wait until later. By consciously deciding whether distractions deserve your attention or not, you’re taking control of your focus and making sure that it stays on the path that will result in the greatest productivity.

### Example: Qantas Flight 32

On November 4th, 2010, Qantas Flight 32 from Singapore to Sydney successfully made an emergency landing despite suffering catastrophic damage mid-air. Disaster was averted largely due to the actions of Captain Richard Champion de Crespigny, the pilot in command.

De Crespigny was known for creating mental models and discussing them with his crew prior to every flight. The models outlined what he and his co-pilots would do in case of various emergencies.

However, when Qantas Flight 32 suffered difficulties, too many systems failed for de Crespigny and his co-pilots to maintain focus using their standard mental models. All but one of the plane’s 22 main systems either suffered damage or shut down completely. The numerous malfunctioning systems were all providing the pilots with instructions on how to solve their various issues. This created information overload, and the pilots found it hard to know what to prioritize and where to channel their focus.

De Crespigny was able to take control of the situation by formulating a new mental model. He imagined that he was trying to land a Cessna rather than an Airbus A380. An Airbus A380 is a huge aircraft containing many complex systems. In contrast, a Cessna is a small, simpler airplane that only uses the basics.

By concentrating only on what a basic aircraft would need to do in order to land, de Crespigny simplified the situation and narrowed his focus. He was able to discern which of the Airbus' complicated systems weren’t relevant to his present situation. Instead, he focused only on operating the basic systems that would be instrumental in ensuring a safe landing.

De Crespigny and his co-pilots were able to successfully land the plane using this new mental model, saving hundreds of lives.

### Example: Mental Models in the Workplace

Imagine you have an important report that’s due by the end of Monday. How could creating a mental model help you to focus on and achieve your goal?

On Sunday night, you spend time creating a mental model. You imagine yourself spending Monday finishing and then sending off your report. This helps you to narrow your focus for the day: it’s all about the report.

Monday comes along, and you put your mental model into action. You know that small and non-time-sensitive tasks should wait, and you should instead focus on your report. However, midway through the day, you receive an email containing a question about a project that you’d managed.

Receiving this email wasn’t a part of your mental model. The model had you focusing on the report to the exclusion of everything else. Your mind immediately flags the email as a potential distraction. Rather than panicking and immediately shifting your focus to responding to the email, you evaluate whether or not it requires your attention now.

You consider whether the email is urgent enough to require your focus to be diverted from your report, and decide that it isn’t. There’s no time pressure on the query; your response can wait without there being any negative consequences. Meanwhile, there is time pressure on completing your report. It needs your focus right now.

Therefore, you continue to follow your mental model and make a note to return to the email later. **Creating and sticking to your mental model has enabled you to maintain your focus.**
