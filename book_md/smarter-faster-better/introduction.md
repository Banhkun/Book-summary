## Introduction

**_Smarter Faster Better_ explores the techniques that you can use to increase your productivity.** But what does “being productive” actually entail?

Productivity can mean a lot of different things to different people. However, it commonly involves four key elements:

  1. Using your time and resources efficiently and effectively to meet your goals.
  2. Getting as much meaningful work done as possible in the shortest amount of time.
  3. Achieving your goals with as little wasted effort as possible.
  4. Working efficiently enough to leave room for some balance in your life; meeting your goals and getting your required work done while minimizing stress and leaving time for other things that are important to you, such as family or hobbies.



### How Can You Become More Productive?

Charles Duhigg argues that becoming more productive doesn’t necessarily involve working for longer or pushing yourself to work harder and harder. Instead, he believes that **it’s all about making smarter choices in certain areas of your life.**

Each chapter of _Smarter Faster Better_ covers one of eight concepts that are instrumental in boosting productivity. Six of those concepts relate to boosting your personal productivity:

  1. Finding motivation
  2. Maintaining focus
  3. Setting effective goals
  4. Making productive decisions
  5. Becoming a productive innovator
  6. Using data productively



Duhigg also explores two concepts that relate to organizational productivity: building a productive team and managing a productive workforce.

All eight concepts involve making behavioral decisions that help us and others to become smarter, faster, and better at our tasks: in short, more productive.
