## Chapter 8: Managing a Productive Workforce

We’ve learned how creating a culture of psychological safety can boost the productivity of teams. We’ve also considered how crucial managers and leaders are in fostering psychological safety. However, that’s not the only step managers can take to increase organizational productivity.

According to Duhigg, workers become more productive when they believe two things:

  1. **They have the authority to make decisions.**
  2. **Their managers trust them and want them to succeed.**



It’s up to managers to create a culture in which these two beliefs can flourish.

To do this, you should implement two management techniques. The first is **lean manufacturing.** In this ideology, the person who's closest to the problem should have the authority to fix it.

The second technique that you should implement is the creation of a **“commitment culture.”** This is a workplace culture in which employers are truly committed to their employees’ growth, success, and happiness, causing their employees to commit to the company in return.

### Lean Manufacturing

Also known as the Toyota Production System due to its origins in the company of the same name, lean manufacturing is a system designed to maximize efficiency and productivity. It’s enabled Toyota to cut costs while keeping quality high.

Lean manufacturing is a complex philosophy that’s made up of many important elements. However, Duhigg chooses to highlight one aspect of this ideology that he believes is crucial to productivity: **giving the worker closest to a problem the decision-making authority to solve it.**

This method of decision making is based on the idea that the person closest to a given system or machine is likely to have the strongest knowledge of it. Therefore, if something goes wrong, they’re in the best position to fix it. The system utilizes every worker’s expertise, from executives to janitors.

Implementing this element of lean manufacturing has various benefits. For one, it makes day-to-day work more efficient. Workers don’t have to wait around for permission from on high to make their decision. They can get started on fixing issues straight away.

Crucially, this system also has the benefit of giving every employee a little bit of decision-making power. Every worker is allocated some authority, and thus a little bit of control. As we learned in Chapter 1, feeling in control fuels our motivation—and if we’re motivated, we’re likely to be more productive.

Lean manufacturing has proved to be so successful that it’s been adapted for other industries. For example, the Agile management ideology that’s often used in the software industry is largely based on this system. However, there are some caveats to lean manufacturing’s success.

#### The Limitations of Lean Manufacturing

Implementing lean manufacturing isn’t as simple as giving workers the power to make decisions and expecting things to change overnight. Just because workers have this power doesn’t automatically mean they’ll feel comfortable using it. They might be afraid of negative consequences if things go wrong—if they make the wrong decision, or if their “right” decision has unexpected drawbacks.

**For lean manufacturing to truly work, workers need to feel respected and trusted.** They need to feel that their employer will have their back regardless of the effects of their decisions. They should feel that managers are committed to helping them improve and learn from their mistakes, rather than just punishing them. They should also be assured that when they make good decisions, they will be recognized and respected for it, and not just ignored. One way to generate this atmosphere of trust and respect is to create a commitment culture.

### What Is a Commitment Culture?

As its name would suggest, **a commitment culture is a workplace culture in which the employer is committed to each employee** ; specifically, committed to each employee’s growth and success. It’s a culture in which employees are truly valued. Both managers and employees understand that everyone plays a vital role in the company’s success. Workers are given the room to make mistakes, learn from them, and improve their workflow accordingly. Employers are willing to invest in each employee’s growth even if that growth is slow.

When a commitment of this kind is shown to employees, they respond in kind and remain committed to the company. They’re driven to work harder because they genuinely care about the fate of the company and the work they’re doing. Workers will often choose to stay at the company even if they receive a better offer elsewhere. During hard times, such as recessions, the company and its employees are more likely to stick together: they want to weather the storm together.

In a commitment culture, a sense of trust develops between workers and employers. Employers trust their employees to do a good job and to help the company move forward. Likewise, employees trust their employers to have their backs, invest in their growth, and be tolerant of their mistakes (within reason).

This atmosphere of trust makes it easier for lean manufacturing to flourish. Workers are more likely to use the control they’ve been given, as they’re less worried about repercussions if their decisions don’t go to plan.

#### The Benefits of Commitment Cultures

In general, commitment cultures have proved to be hugely beneficial to companies. A study of Silicon Valley technology start-ups found that companies with a commitment culture vastly outperformed their peers in many ways:

  * None of the companies with this type of culture failed within the ten-year period of the study.
  * Their profitability ratios were higher than those of companies with other types of culture.
  * These companies went public faster than their competitors.
  * Within these companies, employees abandoned personal agendas and rivalries with colleagues in favor of remaining committed to the company and its aims.



Companies with commitment cultures also reap the benefits of having committed employees. Employee retention in such companies is often high, meaning companies don’t lose their workers’ expertise to a competitor. They also avoid having to spend time and money replacing their lost employees.

#### How Can You Create a Commitment Culture?

You can create a commitment culture using various methods. **Firstly, implementing lean manufacturing can lay the groundwork for a commitment culture to flourish.** Empowering people to make decisions is a way to show that you value them, are committed to their growth and success, and see them as important to the business. Having a small amount of control makes each worker feel like they can have an impact on the company’s success, which increases their commitment.

Likewise, lean manufacturing promotes the trust that’s key in a commitment culture. Every worker knows that they are trusted to do well. That’s why they were given power in the first place.

Outside of the principles of lean manufacturing, there are some other actions you can take to create a commitment culture. For example, the companies in the Silicon Valley study that successfully implemented commitment cultures took the following steps:

  * They invested in employee training. This is a way of demonstrating commitment to your employees’ growth. It also makes it clear that you want to retain your employees and their skills—you wouldn’t spend time and money training them if you wanted them to leave.
  * They offered benefits such as flexible working and generous maternity leave packages. This shows that you care about your employees as people, rather than just as cogs in a machine.
  * They were hesitant to lay off employees unless absolutely necessary, even during difficult times. This demonstrates that keeping your employees and providing them with security is more important than the quick-fix cash flow boost of redundancies.



### Example: Transforming the Fremont Car Manufacturing Plant

In the mid-1980s, General Motors and Toyota partnered up to reopen a car plant in Fremont, California. They called their new venture the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc., or NUMMI.

The Fremont plant had closed two years earlier due to a myriad of issues:

  * Workers had taken no care in the work they did and had sometimes actively sabotaged the cars.
  * Workers had drunk alcohol, taken drugs, and had sex while on the job.
  * Productivity was low due to a prevailing attitude of “the production line never stops.” Even if workers spotted an issue with a car part, they couldn't fix the problem until the car had reached the end of the production line. This often meant that the car had to be deconstructed to reach the faulty part and then reconstructed again—a time-consuming process.



Toyota planned to revolutionize the plant by introducing lean manufacturing. However, due to a union agreement, 80% of the reopened plant’s laid-off workers had to be re-employed. This meant Toyota had to introduce lean manufacturing to the misbehaving workers who’d become used to a completely different system.

##### Introducing Lean Manufacturing

As a first step, the Fremont plant’s employees were sent to a Toyota plant in Japan for two weeks to witness lean manufacturing in action. One such employee was Rick Madrid, who’d worked at the Fremont plant back in its pre-NUMMI days.

Madrid was shocked by what he saw in the Japanese plant. He witnessed the workers closest to a problem being empowered to make decisions on how to fix it. All workers had the power to stop the production line and fix issues as they spotted them. They simply had to pull on a hanging cord—called an “andon cord”—and the line would eventually grind to a halt.

Madrid also witnessed respectful collaboration between workers and their managers. If a worker was fixing an issue, they could give orders to their manager and the manager would help them. Such collaboration never would have happened at Fremont in its pre-NUMMI days, when managers had shown no respect to their workers.

Finally, Madrid noticed that workers at the plant were encouraged to suggest improvements to boost the productivity of the production line. For example, one worker suggested a new tool for installing struts. The next morning, all workers were given a version of the tool. In the past, managers at the Fremont plant had ignored their workers’ suggestions.

##### Building a Commitment Culture

While Madrid returned to Fremont full of optimism about lean manufacturing, not all of his colleagues were convinced. They were worried that their new-found power would come back to bite them. They feared retaliation if they made choices or suggestions that managers didn’t approve of. A commitment culture hadn’t taken hold at NUMMI yet.

Because of the workers’ doubts, lean manufacturing wasn’t yet working in the factory. This became evident during a visit from NUMMI’s president, Tetsuro Toyoda. Toyoda noticed that a worker was having issues while installing a taillight. He asked the worker to pull the andon cord and stop the production line so that he could fix the problem. The worker was reluctant to pull the cord: he, along with many NUMMI workers, still feared negative consequences if he did so.

Eventually, Toyoda convinced the worker to pull the cord and fix the problem. Afterward, rather than chastising the worker for resisting pulling the cord, Toyoda apologized to him for not fully explaining to the plant managers the importance of encouraging workers to pull the cords. Toyoda also assured the worker that he was a crucial part of the plant’s success.

This incident finally convinced NUMMI’s workers that their managers did value them. It showed that NUMMI’s leaders were committed to helping every worker succeed, rather than blaming them when things went wrong.

From this point onwards, things changed at NUMMI. Workers began to pull the andon cords, and productivity increased. Within a few years, the Fremont plant was more productive than any other General Motors manufacturing site. Productivity levels had doubled compared to the plant’s pre-NUMMI days. Lean manufacturing and a commitment culture had transformed the plant and its workforce.
