## Exercise: Use Data Productively, Part One

Learn how to absorb data effectively by interacting with the information.

* * *

Describe some data that you’ve been struggling to absorb. What type of data is it—numerical, written, or another form? What does the data relate to?

Why do you think this data is so difficult to absorb? For example, is there a lot of it? Is it very complex?

How could you interact with this data to make it stick in your brain more effectively? For example, could you explain it to a friend, write it out by hand, or plot it on a graph?
