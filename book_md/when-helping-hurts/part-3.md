## Part 3: Taking the Right Approach to Poverty Alleviation

In Part 2 we discussed Corbett and Fikkert’s advice on the importance of doing poverty alleviation with the right mindset and the various superiority complexes that you need to guard against in order to cultivate the right mindset. In Part 3, we’ll discuss their advice on how to practically approach poverty alleviation, including some common problems they've observed with current approaches and how to design more effective interventions.

### Let the Right People Craft the Approach

Corbett and Fikkert advise that sometimes other people or other organizations are in a better position to minister to a given community than you or your church are. If that’s the case, **you should let the people who are most qualified to do the project take charge of it** and either humbly ask them what you can do to help or turn your attention to a different need that you’re better equipped to meet.

The authors pose three questions to ask yourself before taking on any poverty alleviation project. If you can’t confidently answer “yes” to all three questions, don’t take the project.

**1\. Do you fully understand the situation, including relevant local customs and culture?** If not, don’t take charge of the project yourself. Instead, let a local church in the affected area or someone else who fully understands the situation take charge, and look for ways to support them on the project, such as by donating money.

**2\. Are local organizations incapable of meeting the need?** If they’re able to meet the need themselves, don’t intervene. The goal is to empower people to take charge of their own lives and communities. Trying to help when it’s not necessary ultimately undermines their agency—which causes harm.

(Shortform note: As we’ve discussed, Corbett and Fikkert point out that intervening—rather than letting local organizations handle a crisis—can harm aid recipients psychologically and take customers away from local businesses. Others point out that it can also harm their social and political systems by making the government less accountable to the people. This is because when an outside agency steps in to meet a need, it takes pressure off the local government to address problems that may have created or contributed to creating the need.)

**3\. Are you actually capable of meeting the need?** In situations where outside help is warranted because the local organizations don’t have the resources or qualifications to adequately address the situation, outside help is only beneficial when the outsiders have the necessary training, qualifications, and resources. If you try to help when you don’t know what you’re doing, you’ll just get in the way.

> **Are You the Right Person for the Job?**
> 
> Corbett and Fikkert’s assertion that you need to understand the situation and culture and need to be objectively capable of meeting the need before you intervene mirrors business consultant Gino Wickman’s advice about personnel management in business. Considering his advice provides some additional insight on this subject.
> 
> In _Traction_ , Wickman advises that for your company to be successful, you have to have the right people in the right positions. According to Wickman, the “right people” are those who are on board with your company’s culture and mission, while the “right positions” means matching job tasks to workers’ skill sets. Problems come up when either of these factors is off.
> 
> On the one hand, Wickman says someone could be the right person in the wrong position: She wholeheartedly embraces your company’s culture and mission, but she doesn’t have the right technical or interpersonal skills for the position. If that’s the case, she can’t thrive in that position and may end up causing problems for the company. Wickman says you need to move her into a position that matches her skill set, if there is one, or let her go if there isn’t.
> 
> Let’s apply this concept to aid work: If you answered “yes” to Corbett and Fikkert’s question about understanding the situation but “no” to their question about your ability to meet the need, that would make you the “right person in the wrong position” for that intervention. Applying Wickman’s advice, you should look for a different need that you’re better able to meet.
> 
> On the other hand, Wickman says someone could be the wrong person in the right position: He has the right technical skills to excel in his current position, but he doesn’t understand your company’s culture or doesn’t believe in the value of your product. In this case, Wickman says you need to let him go before he stirs up dissension within the company.
> 
> Similarly, if you answered “no” to Corbett and Fikkert’s question about understanding the situation but “yes” to their question about your ability to meet the need, that would make you the “wrong person in the right position” for that intervention. And this is even more of a problem in cross-cultural poverty alleviation than it is in business because the cultural differences are likely to be greater than the cultural difference between two companies. So, following Wickman’s advice, you don’t belong in that role. Instead, you need to find a role where you understand the culture and have the ability to make a difference.

### Provide the Right Type of Aid

Let’s suppose you’ve found a poverty alleviation project where you can answer “yes” to all three of Corbett and Fikkert’s questions above. As you prepare for the project, one of the first things you need to decide is what kind of aid to provide. The authors explain that there are three basic types of aid:

**Relief** consists of providing immediate assistance to people in a time of crisis, such as when their homes have been demolished by an earthquake, or they’ve had to flee their homes because of war. When correctly applied, relief temporarily provides outside resources to prevent a bad situation from getting worse.

**Rehabilitation** consists of helping people to recover from a crisis. According to Corbett and Fikkert, rehabilitation should take the place of relief as soon as the victims of the crisis no longer need urgent material assistance to prevent their situation from worsening. A key distinction between relief and rehabilitation is that relief is characterized by giving things _to_ people, whereas rehabilitation involves working _with_ people to help them recover. Rehabilitation efforts should end when recovery is complete, that is, when the crisis victim has recovered to where they were before the crisis struck.

**Development** consists of empowering people to improve their situation beyond what it’s been in the past. Development picks up where rehabilitation leaves off. The authors assert that development should involve a two-way relationship where both the provider and receiver help each other mend their broken relationships with God, self, others, and creation.

For example, suppose your neighbor's house was destroyed by a tornado. Letting him stay in your guest bedroom, free of charge, for a while is relief. Lending a hand as he rebuilds his house is rehabilitation. Spending time strategizing with him about how you can both be better prepared for the next tornado season is development.

> **Systems of Classifying Aid**
> 
> Corbett and Fikkert are often credited with originating the classification of aid into relief, rehabilitation, and development. While this system of classifying aid is widely used, some organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), use a slightly different and more complex system. It’s important to clearly distinguish which system a given source is using because different systems use some of the same terms to mean different things.
> 
> Instead of dividing aid into relief, rehabilitation, and development, the USAID system divides aid into relief, development, and institutionalization, and further subdivides each of these categories. Under this system:
> 
> **Relief** is the first stage of crisis response, and consists of three consecutive parts: First, “ _emergency response”_ consists of providing food, clothing, medical attention, and so forth to disaster victims. Second, “ _transitional shelter”_ consists of providing some kind of temporary lodging to protect victims from the elements. This could mean putting them up in hotels or public housing, if available, or it could mean giving them tents or similar temporary shelters. Third, “ _repair”_ consists of helping them salvage what can be salvaged in the aftermath of the disaster and restore infrastructure that was damaged but can readily be restored to working order.
> 
> This definition of “relief” is similar to Corbett and Fikkert’s, but slightly broader. They would probably consider the “repair” stage to be rehabilitation rather than relief.
> 
> **Development __** is the _second_ stage of crisis response in the USAID system. The first substage of development is “rehabilitation,” which in this system consists of getting essential local services (like water distribution) back up and running. The second substage of development is “rebuilding,” which encompasses the whole process of working with the locals to rebuild homes and infrastructure to the point where they are livable again after the disaster. The system identifies “reconstruction” as a subpart of “rebuilding” that focuses on the actual construction activities, while other aspects of “rebuilding” include assessing the damage, planning, and training the locals in construction skills.
> 
> Since “development,” as defined by USAID, is still part of the process to get back to pre-crisis infrastructure, Corbett and Fikkert would consider this work part of rehabilitation, not development. The only exception might be the training that the locals receive, if it has the potential to help them progress beyond their pre-crisis state.
> 
> **Institutionalization** involves moving away from direct involvement in reconstruction toward indirect involvement, like providing financial services to local construction agencies and training locals in finance and construction management.
> 
> Again, Corbett and Fikkert consider some of these training activities part of “development” in their system, and the emphasis on increased responsibility of the locals for their own success at the institutionalization phase also resembles their description of “development.” But in USAID’s system, the purpose of institutionalization is still primarily to get the community back to where it was before the crisis, so in Corbett and Fikkert’s system, “institutionalization” would still consist mostly of rehabilitation.

#### Don’t Provide Relief to People Who Need Development

Corbett and Fikkert advise that it’s important to consider which of the three types of aid the community you’re trying to help actually needs and provide the right type of aid. They observe that **many churches default to providing relief, but most poor people need development, not relief**.

At any given time, only a small percentage of the poor people in the world need immediate relief: victims of recent natural disasters, for example. But even in the case of a natural disaster, the authors observe that by the time a church has heard about the disaster on the news, planned a charitable mission to help the victims, raised funding to support the mission, and sent a missionary team to the affected area, the need for relief is typically over. By that time the victims need rehabilitation or development.

> **The Rising Need for Relief**
> 
> Some sources might contest Corbett and Fikkert’s assertion that efforts to help the poor need to shift away from relief toward rehabilitation and development on the grounds that the increasing frequency of natural disasters is increasing the demand for relief.
> 
> This perspective exists in both secular and Christian circles, although secular sources generally attribute the increasing frequency of natural disasters to human-caused climate change, while Christian sources often attribute it to the impending end of the world, as Christ prophesied in Matthew 24:3-8.
> 
> However, the increased need for relief doesn’t lessen the importance of providing the right kind of aid in any given situation, nor does it reduce the global demand for rehabilitation and development.

Moreover, as the authors explain, providing relief to people who really need rehabilitation or development may only delay their progress. If they receive short-term relief but _never_ _get_ the rehabilitation and development that they need, then when the relief ends, their situation may become worse than ever.

(Shortform note: Some medical analysts have brought a similar argument against the US medical industry: They say that current medical institutions focus too much on reactive treatments for medical conditions that rise to the level of a crisis for the patient, instead of helping people develop the healthy lifestyles that could prevent many health crises from occurring in the first place. And, like short-term relief measures that temporarily help a poor person but leave them even worse off when the relief ends, reactive medical treatments may temporarily resolve a medical crisis, but ultimately leave the patient more vulnerable to relapse or other complications.)

### Stop Focusing on Problems and Providing Outside Resources

Beyond providing the wrong type of aid, the other problematic approach to poverty alleviation that Corbett and Fikkert observe is when aid providers start by assessing the needs of the poor community and pairing them with outside resources to develop solutions. This approach often stems from a paternalistic superiority complex, as it comes down to telling the poor: “Tell us your problems, and we’ll provide a solution.”

This approach also implicitly **assumes that the poor community’s problems cannot be solved without outside resources** and focuses outside attention solely on their problems**.** As such, it reinforces their sense of shame, inferiority, and powerlessness, making their poverty worse.

To avoid these problems, Corbett and Fikkert advise taking a different approach that involves assessing the community’s assets before their needs, as we’ll discuss next.

> **The Weakness-Based Approach in Business**
> 
> Just as Corbett and Fikkert critique the practice of focusing first on problems when trying to help the poor, business experts at the Gallup Press argue that the common practice of focusing on employees’ weaknesses when trying to improve their performance is fundamentally flawed.
> 
> They observe that there is a popular belief that anyone can do or become proficient in just about anything if they identify and fix the weaknesses that are holding them back from success. They point out a number of problems with this view:
> 
>   1. If everyone has unlimited potential, then nobody really has a unique identity. As such, the practice of trying to help people advance by identifying and fixing all their weaknesses is ultimately dehumanizing.
> 
>   2. The idea that people can fix their weaknesses with hard work and perseverance conflicts with the reality that many people struggle for years to overcome certain weaknesses and never seem to make any headway. Furthermore, this idea implies that when this happens, it must be their fault for not trying hard enough, which is demoralizing to them.
> 
>   3. Focusing exclusively on correcting your weaknesses leads you to neglect using or developing your strengths, which is, at best, an inefficient use of time and effort.
> 
> 

> 
> These observations from the realm of business reinforce Corbett and Fikkert’s assertions and provide additional insight into why the needs-based approach tends to be demoralizing, dehumanizing, and generally counterproductive—both in poverty alleviation and employee development.

#### Assessing Assets Instead of Needs

Corbett and Fikkert recommend an approach called asset-based community development (ABCD). **This approach focuses on the poor’s assets, including individuals’ unique skills and talents, as well as the community’s existing resources.**

(Shortform note: ABCD was originally developed by an urban research center at Northwestern University when they recognized a gap in their researchers’ approach to studying neighborhoods: Research consistently identified community members’ needs and problems but not their capacities, strengths, and achievements. This realization inspired them to begin a new four-year effort to study neighborhoods’ assets, and their research later became a global movement.)

Corbett and Fikkert discuss a number of advantages of the asset-based approach. First, whereas a needs-based approach emphasizes what’s “wrong,” an asset-based approach emphasizes what’s “right,” which is more encouraging for all involved.

Second, an asset-based approach focuses on local resources first, thereby empowering the community and reducing the risk of developing dependence. Only when the community’s assets aren’t sufficient do outsiders offer additional resources.

Finally, using an asset-based approach can help the non-poor overcome feelings of superiority. This is because it emphasizes everything the poor have to offer, which combats the tendency to see them as helpless people.

> **Focusing on the Positive**
> 
> We could generalize the principle of assessing assets before needs as focusing on the positive to make changes for the better. Whereas Corbett and Fikkert present this as a strategic principle for poverty intervention, others have advocated it as a way to succeed in business or overcome obstacles in life. Since climbing out of poverty typically involves career development and overcoming a variety of obstacles, these other sources provide additional insight that’s relevant to poverty alleviation.
> 
> Arguably the first notable proponent of focusing on the positive side was Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote _The Power of Positive Thinking_. Like Corbett and Fikkert, Peale approached the subject from a Christian perspective. He argued that you can overcome any difficulty in life if you just _believe_ that you can, pray for God’s assistance, and don’t let negative thoughts discourage your belief.
> 
> More recently, Shawn Achor presented a similar argument from a purely secular perspective in _The Happiness Advantage_. Achor asserts that a positive mindset enhances your productivity, enabling you to succeed in your endeavors. As such, Peale and Achor agree that cultivating a positive mindset leads to success. The difference is that Peale ultimately attributes your success to divine assistance, while Achor attributes it to your own efforts.
> 
> Finally, in _Strengths Finder 2.0_ , Tom Rath argues that the best way to advance your career is to focus on cultivating your strengths, rather than on fixing your weaknesses. He asserts that it’s just not possible to fix all your weaknesses. And even if it was, it would be a wasteful use of resources: You can spend a lot of time and energy improving your abilities in an area of weakness, but chances are you’ll still only end up with average ability in that area. But if you spend the same amount of time and energy honing an ability that comes naturally to you, you’ll end up far above average.
