## Exercise: Examine Your Cultural Values

Examine your cultural values and how they influence your attitude toward people of other cultures.

* * *

Think about contact you’ve had with someone from another culture. This could be anything from a long-term relationship to a single interaction. Describe the person as well as the extent of your contact with them.

Now, consider the differences between you and this person, focusing on the cultural characteristics mentioned by the authors: perceived power over circumstances, and perceptions of authority, time, and the individual. Identify at least two ways in which you’re different.

How do these differences make you feel? In particular, can you recognize any feelings of frustration or judgment? Describe them.

Keeping in mind the spectrum of perspectives that the authors describe, how can you reframe these cultural differences from the perspective of that person’s culture instead of your own?

Moving forward, how can you modify your expectations of how the person will behave now that you have a better understanding of that person’s cultural perspective?
