## Part 2: Adopting the Right Mindset on Poverty Alleviation

As we saw in Part 1, many people misunderstand the nature of poverty, thinking it’s just a lack of resources, when in reality it’s a psychological state of shame and powerlessness. Corbett and Fikkert further observe that this misunderstanding is frequently compounded by a deep-seated and often subconscious belief that we’re better than the people we’re trying to help. We’ll refer to this unhelpful mindset as a “superiority complex.” In Part 2, we’ll first consider their general advice on developing the right mindset, and then look at the specific superiority complexes that they say you need to repent of.

### Overcoming Superiority Complexes

Corbett and Fikkert point out that superiority complexes get in the way of building relationships, which is crucial in poverty alleviation because, as we discussed in Part 1, the root cause of poverty is broken relationships with God, oneself, others, and creation. As such, they say **the key to cultivating the right mindset for effective poverty alleviation is to see the poor as equals** —fellow humans that you want to work with for mutual good, not inferior beings that you need to save from themselves.

(Shortform note: In _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard observes that top performers in any field tend to develop superiority complexes because they are better at something than their peers. But he also warns that this becomes self-defeating, because nobody likes to work with someone who sees them as inferior, and nobody can deliver their best performance without support from their colleagues. While Burchard doesn’t consider the field of poverty alleviation particularly, this principle may still apply because, as Corbett and Fikkert point out, the people who go on short-term missions to help the poor are typically at the top of their financial game, at least compared to the poor people that they’re trying to help.)

The first step to seeing the poor as equals is to acknowledge your own brokenness. As we mentioned earlier, the sins of Adam and Eve caused _all_ of creation to become broken—not just the relationships of the materially poor. So we all have broken relationships that need mending. The authors explain that this involves praying that God would give us discernment and humility to recognize and correct any misconceptions we harbor about God, ourselves, others, or creation and reality in general.

This especially includes misconceptions like superiority complexes that hinder our relationships with the poor. As God helps us repent of our superiority and mend these relationships, we’ll begin to recognize that people, no matter how poor, are all uniquely gifted and valuable. And our recognition of their unique value contributes to helping the poor by allowing us to combat their feelings of shame and helplessness.

(Shortform note: In addition to the positive effects that the authors describe, seeing poor people as equals with valuable talents may improve the success rate of your poverty alleviation efforts through the “pygmalion effect”: the principle that _expecting students to succeed actually makes them more likely to succeed_. Studies indicate that in educational settings, if the teacher has higher expectations of a particular student, that student will tend to rise to her expectations. In this case, the more you recognize a poor person’s value and talents, the higher your expectations of him will naturally be, improving his chances of success in whatever program of poverty alleviation you’re running.)

### Classifying Superiority Complexes

Let’s now look at how the authors identify and classify different superiority complexes to provide a sort of checklist for the process of self-examination. Corbett and Fikkert identify two main superiority complexes that we need to repent of to minister effectively to the poor, especially in cross-cultural missions: cultural superiority and paternalism.

#### Cultural Superiority

The authors point out that every culture has a system of values that govern people’s behavior within that culture. **A cultural superiority complex consists of failing to respect another culture’s value system when you interact with people of that culture**. Whether you disregard the other culture’s values because you consciously view them as inferior and unimportant or you’re just oblivious to the differences, such disregard will cause misunderstandings and hinder relationships.

Cultural superiority complexes can be a problem any time Christians minister cross-culturally. The authors observe that the effect is greatest on mission trips to countries with very different cultures, but even different ethnic groups or neighborhoods within the same city sometimes have sufficiently different cultures to cause misunderstanding and friction.

> **Addressing Allegations of Hypocrisy**
> 
> As we showed in Part 1, Corbett and Fikkert affirm that the Christian worldview is objectively superior to other worldviews and that teaching the Christian worldview is a crucial part of alleviating poverty because of the advantages that the Christian worldview provides. Does this mean that they have a cultural worldview superiority complex? And since they themselves point out the problems that superiority complexes can cause, does this make their position hypocritical?
> 
> Not necessarily. Although they don’t take time to explicitly refute this concern in the book, we can infer that they don’t see any hypocrisy in condemning cultural superiority complexes while maintaining the superiority of a Christian worldview because they believe Christianity (and thus a Christian worldview) can flourish in a wide range of cultures. They thus distinguish religion from culture: No culture is above another, but Christianity is above all religions.
> 
> As we’ll discuss more in the later parts of this guide, the authors assert that collaborating effectively with local, indigenous churches is a key element of ministering effectively to the poor. And to drive this point home, they emphasize that if you want to help a particular group or community, you should start by learning how and where God is already working in that community, not by assuming that you need to bring God to that community. This approach stands in contrast to approaching a community with a cultural superiority complex.
> 
> Thus, while the question of whether the authors’ faith in the superiority of the Christian worldview constitutes a superiority complex could probably be argued both ways, their views are at least self-consistent.

##### Classifying Cultural Values

Corbett and Fikkert identify four key values and the spectrum of perspectives that different cultures take on them. Let’s consider each of them in turn and the ways that a cultural superiority complex can be counterproductive to building relationships between the missionary and the poor of another culture (which is a prerequisite for helping to heal the poor person’s relationships with God, others, self, and creation).

**Cultural perspective on power over circumstances:** The authors observe that Western cultures tend to postulate that people control their own destiny, but people of some other cultures view the circumstances of life as being largely beyond human control. This can lead a Westerner with a superiority complex to regard others as apathetic and undeserving of assistance.

**Cultural perception of authority:** The authors note that Western culture tends to value giving all individuals equal social status, while some other cultures value certain hierarchies of social status. A Westerner with a superiority complex may ignore the social hierarchy of another culture, insulting people at the top of the hierarchy and asking others to do things that aren’t culturally acceptable in that context.

**Cultural perception of time:** Corbett and Fikkert explain that Western culture is strongly “monochronic,” meaning that Westerners view time as a limited resource. Meanwhile, the authors describe many other cultures as “polychronic,” meaning that they view time as an unlimited resource. A Westerner with a monochronic mindset and a superiority complex may become impatient or even offended when people show up late to meetings, fall behind schedule, and don’t seem to respect their time.

**Cultural perspective on individuality:** Corbett and Fikkert point out that Western culture is individualistic, emphasizing the unique value of each person and her contributions to a group or cause. By contrast, collectivist cultures emphasize the value of membership in a group and commitment to that group. A Westerner with a superiority complex may fail to grasp the significance of organizations such as the local church in a collectivist culture or the depth of relationships that people in that culture require for establishing trust.

The authors point out that the Western culture from which most North American missionaries come tends to land at one extreme on most of these issues. Coming from an “extreme” culture exacerbates the effect of a cultural superiority complex when dealing with people from cultures that lie toward the middle or near the opposite end of the spectrum.

> **The Spectrum of Cultural Perspectives Within the Christian Worldview**
> 
> We noted before how, in the authors’ view, believing a Christian worldview is superior is not a superiority complex because the Christian worldview deals with universal truths that are applicable in any culture. To further illustrate this point, let’s consider how the cultural differences that the authors describe are all present _within_ Christianity.
> 
> For a Christian ministering cross-culturally, understanding how these differences play out within Christian theology could provide a starting point for breaking out of cultural superiority complexes and connecting with fellow believers of other cultures.
> 
> **Power over circumstances:** There is a long-standing debate in Christian circles about how much free agency God gives humans. As Corbett and Fikkert point out, today it is commonplace for Western Christians to believe that they have considerable control over their circumstances, and, of course, over their actions. But this has not always been the case. For example, in the 1500s, John Calvin argued that God’s omnipotence and man’s fallen nature implied that humans have no power to choose to accept God’s forgiveness—rather, it is God who chooses to enlighten and empower people, enabling (and compelling) them to follow him and receive forgiveness of sins.
> 
> For a time, this “Calvinist” perspective was the majority view in Western protestant Christianity. Some people even extrapolated Calvin’s logic from salvation to the rest of life and argued that _all human actions are predetermined by God_ : Free will is an illusion and humans have no control over themselves, let alone their circumstances. This extreme view is known as “hyper-Calvinism'' or “Christian Fatalism.” While hyper-Calvinism has never been a majority view, it illustrates how Christian theology can span the entire spectrum of perspectives on how much control you have over your life, simply depending on how you interpret issues like the omnipotence of God.
> 
> **Perception of authority:** Consistent with the idea of individual equality, many evangelical protestant churches have a very flat hierarchy: Individual believers are accountable directly to God and only to God—the pastor and any other church officials serve more as advisors to teach individuals about God and provide wise counsel than as leaders of a coherent group. But Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches tend to have a much more hierarchical structure, with priests having authority over lay believers, bishops having authority over priests, and so on.
> 
> **Perception of time:** On one hand, the Bible does mention the importance of using time wisely, but it also teaches the availability of eternal life and even equates eternal life to having a relationship with God. So both monochronic and polychronic themes are reflected in scripture. Specifically, as Corbett and Fikkert point out, the New Testament makes a few references to “redeeming the time.” Arguably a better biblical reference would have been Psalm 90, where Moses reflects on the brevity of human life and prays that God would teach us to “number our days.” Meanwhile, in John 17:3, the Bible equates knowing God with eternal life, and the availability of eternal life is a major theme throughout the New Testament.
> 
> **Perspective on individuality:** Biblical passages like Romans 12:4-8 and 1 Corinthians 12:13-27 compare the church to a human body composed of many body parts, each with a unique function. Again, this seems to encompass the entire spectrum of cultural perspectives, emphasizing _both_ the unique value of each individual (as individualism does) and the unity of the church as a whole (as collectivism does).

#### Paternalism

The second type of superiority complex is paternalism. **Paternalism consists of treating other people like children** : deciding what’s best for them, providing for their needs, sometimes overruling their decisions for “their own good,” and so forth.

(Shortform note: Strictly speaking, paternalism is not always a bad thing. There are situations where it’s appropriate to treat people like children, such as when they _are_ children—especially if they're _your_ children. That said, even when you’re raising children, it’s important not to be excessively paternalistic, so that they have space to develop problem-solving and decision-making skills.)

Corbett and Fikkert observe that when we treat the poor paternalistically because we feel superior to them, this tends to inhibit forming working relationships with them and often leads to relief efforts that do more harm than good.

They define five specific variations of the paternalism superiority complex, which we’ll recount below. To show how each variant can negatively impact poverty alleviation, we’ll consider them each in turn for a hypothetical situation where a church sends a short-term missionary team to build a new house for a local family in an impoverished community where some of the houses are deteriorating to the point of being unlivable.

**1\. Resource Paternalism: Giving the poor resources such as food, clothing, or money.** In the case of this hypothetical mission, the missionaries bring their own construction materials along or make their own arrangements to purchase them. This not only reinforces the locals’ sense of helplessness by insinuating that they are incapable of providing or selecting the materials themselves, but it also hurts the local economy since now there’s no reason for the family to buy building materials from local suppliers.

**2\. Labor Paternalism: Doing work on behalf of the poor.** In this case, the missionaries do all the work constructing the house. Again, this not only insinuates that the locals are incapable of doing the work, reinforcing their sense of helplessness, but it also deprives them of an opportunity to put their skills to use (if they have them), learn new skills on the job (if they don’t already have them), or stimulate the local economy by hiring a local contractor to do the work (if others in the community have the necessary skills).

**3\. Managerial Paternalism: Making plans and decisions on behalf of the poor.** In this case, the missionary team designs the house or uses a standard floor plan that they brought with them, with little or no input from the family they’re building the house for. Once again, this reinforces the poor family’s impression that they have no control over their situation.

**4\. Knowledge Paternalism: Failing to adequately solicit input from the poor or assuming you know better than they do.** Even if you genuinely have more education or technical expertise than anyone in a group of poor people, they still have a better understanding of their situation than you do. In our example of building a house, this feeds into managerial paternalism. It also may result in poor decisions: The missionary team designs the house to use natural gas heat because it's efficient and cost-effective, but they don’t realize that the community doesn’t have a natural gas line to hook up to.

**5\. Spiritual Paternalism: Assuming a leadership role in church services or other religious functions conducted for the poor.** As with knowledge paternalism, it’s true that the typical affluent Western Christian has more academic knowledge about Christianity than the typical poor person. But academic knowledge does not necessarily equate to spiritual maturity.

In the authors’ experience, poor people often know better how to apply biblical principles to their situation than outsiders do. Moreover, poor people often have stronger faith in God than affluent people do because the poor actually rely on God for things that the wealthy can rely on their own resources for.

For example, suppose an upper-middle-class American and a poor African both get sick. The American goes to a doctor for treatment and relies on her medical insurance to pay for the incident. If she recovers without any complications, the episode probably has no effect on her faith in God or lack thereof. The African can’t afford to go to a doctor, so he prays that God will heal him. If he recovers, his faith in God is strengthened.

Finally, the authors point out that just as other forms of paternalism can undermine the local economy, spiritual paternalism can undermine the local church. They observe, for example, that when affluent missionaries host a children’s Bible camp in a poor area, local children abandon the local Bible studies that they’ve been attending to go to the camp and then don’t come back after the missionaries leave because the local studies aren’t as entertaining and don’t give out free stuff like the missionary program did.

> **Service Without Paternalism**
> 
> It’s worth noting that the five types of paternalism Corbett and Fikkert discuss are arguably examples of actions that may be motivated by a paternalistic superiority complex but may also be motivated by an entirely different mentality. And when done in the right spirit, some of them may actually be helpful instead of harmful. In this light, let’s reconsider each of the authors’ five types of paternalism in turn.
> 
> **1\. Resource Paternalism:** Corbett and Fikkert point out that giving people money or other resources can come across as an assertion that they are incapable of providing for their own needs. And indeed, monetary gifts can give this impression—especially when the giver has a superiority complex.
> 
> But in principle, a poor person could also interpret a monetary gift as a vote of confidence. It could be as if the giver were saying, “I know that you’re capable of improving your situation and that you’ll put any resources at your disposal to good use, so I’m giving you enough resources to make a quantum leap forward.” Studies have found that, at least in certain countries, poor people who receive cash transfers do indeed use the money efficiently to improve their situation. This could be taken to imply that at least some poor people interpret cash transfers positively in practice.
> 
> **2\. Labor Paternalism:** Similarly, doing work on someone’s behalf can imply that she’s incapable of doing the work, but it doesn’t have to. As a parent, you do things for your child that your child can’t do for herself. As an employee, you also do things for your boss that (hopefully) your boss could do for herself, but chooses to delegate to you.
> 
> If you’re an aid worker helping a poor person, your relationship to the person you’re trying to help would probably fall somewhere in between these two extremes. As you get to know the person, you may find things you can do for him that are genuinely helpful and not insulting. As we’ll discuss later in this guide, Corbett and Fikkert emphasize the importance of getting to know the people you’re trying to help as a prerequisite to providing effective aid.
> 
> **3\. Managerial Paternalism:** It’s more difficult to envision a situation where making decisions for a poor person wouldn’t be paternalistic, because making a decision on someone’s behalf generally implies that you have some kind of authority over him, especially if you make the decision without his input or consent. As such, making decisions for people may be more closely connected with a paternalistic superiority complex than most of the other actions that Corbett and Fikkert discuss.
> 
> **4\. Knowledge Paternalism:** In Corbett and Fikkert’s discussion, knowledge paternalism seems to be closely related to managerial paternalism, because failing to solicit input would usually happen in the context of making plans or decisions. By definition, you should always seek adequate input from the people you’re trying to help. But, as Corbett and Fikkert discuss later, sharing your knowledge with the poor through education and training can be an effective form of aid. You may indeed have superior knowledge in certain areas, and that can be beneficial for your aid efforts. But assuming you have superior knowledge in every relevant area is problematic and—as the authors point out—usually incorrect.
> 
> **5\. Spiritual Paternalism:** Is it ever helpful for a missionary to assume a position of leadership over a local church? If so, at what point, if ever, should the missionary step down and hand over leadership to the locals? These questions have been debated throughout Christian history, and different churches endorse different answers, as reflected in their organizational structure.
> 
> Some churches (the Episcopal church, for example) have a centralized structure: A central organization decides where to build local churches and sends pastors to lead them. When a church with this structure establishes a mission church in a new locality, they typically appoint a full-time missionary to lead it. As the local church grows, the central organization may appoint a new pastor for the church and send the missionary to a new mission. In the case of cross-cultural missions, they might eventually appoint an indigenous pastor but probably only after he had graduated from a seminary endorsed by the central organization.
> 
> Other churches (the Southern Baptist church, for example) have a decentralized structure: Local believers organize their own churches and select or hire a pastor. If any organization above the local church exists, it is made up of delegates sent from the local churches. When a church with this organizational structure sends missionaries to a new area, their goal is typically to make enough converts for an indigenous church to form, independent of the church that sent the missionaries. Sometimes the missionaries do play an active role in founding an indigenous church, but even in this case, they ideally hand over leadership to the locals as soon as the locals can take on the task.
> 
> Some might argue that the decentralized approach is superior because it is less susceptible to spiritual paternalism. But proponents of the centralized approach contend that, assuming the leaders sent from the central organization are well qualified to teach Christianity, their leadership will be empowering rather than disempowering because they can help new believers get up to speed in their faith faster. While this may be true in some cases, Corbett and Fikkert’s observation that locals often have stronger faith, despite having less academic knowledge of Christianity, partially counters this perspective.
