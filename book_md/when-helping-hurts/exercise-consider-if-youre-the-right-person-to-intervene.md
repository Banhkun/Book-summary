## Exercise: Consider if You’re the Right Person to Intervene

Ask yourself if you’re the right person to intervene in an impoverished community by answering Corbett and Fikkert’s three questions about your suitability.

* * *

Think of an impoverished community that you’ve recently heard about on the news or otherwise come in contact with. Describe the situation in as much detail as you can. How completely do you think you understand the culture of that community and the situation its people face?

What are the people or organizations in the community you described above already doing to remedy their situation? Do you think they can resolve their problems on their own?

Given the situation and the local resources, what training, qualifications, or knowledge do you bring that might directly help the community? How would you use these assets in service of the local population?

Now that you’ve answered the questions above, would it be appropriate for you, personally, to intervene in that situation or community? Why or why not?
