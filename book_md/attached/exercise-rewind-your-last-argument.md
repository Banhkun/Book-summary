## Exercise: Rewind Your Last Argument

Effective communication is useful in all kinds of situations, but it’s especially important during an argument. In this exercise, you’ll examine your communication skills during conflict.

* * *

Think about the last significant disagreement or argument you had with your partner. Briefly describe what the conflict was about and how it got resolved (or didn’t).

Now try your best to remember what you said during that argument. Did you show a genuine concern for your partner’s feelings? If so, what words did you use?

In addition to showing concern for your partner’s feelings, did you openly communicate your own feelings? If so, what words did you use?

If you could revise the words you used in that argument, what would you change and why?
