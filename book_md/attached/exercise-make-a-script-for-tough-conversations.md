## Exercise: Make a Script for Tough Conversations

To communicate effectively with your partner, think carefully about the words you'll use. Just like you'd prepare before giving a presentation to your boss, it's not overkill to prepare your words before an important relationship conversation.

* * *

Think about a specific conflict that occurred recently in your relationship—one that either resulted in an argument or just left you feeling uncomfortable or unloved. What were your partner's specific words or actions that hurt your feelings?

What actions could your partner take that would make you feel more at ease?

Using the answers to the first two questions, write a short “script” that focuses on that issue and communicates what you need. (Remember to apply the principles outlined above under “What Effective Communication Sounds Like.”)
