## Chapter 10: When and How to End Your Anxious-Avoidant Relationship

We've seen that anxious-avoidant partnerships result in unavoidable conflict. In the worst-case scenario, the chronic clashes between anxious and avoidant partners escalate to the point that the relationship is toxic and destructive. **This typically takes the form of verbal and emotional abuse.**

At this point, your only recourse is to end the relationship—for the sake of your own mental health. Unfortunately, anxious-avoidant couples often have an extremely hard time finding the strength to break up even when the relationship has become harmful.

### Avoidants May Withhold Sex

A common sign that an anxious-avoidant relationship is veering toward toxicity is the couple's sex life—or lack of it. For starters, avoidant attachers are more likely to cheat on their partners than secure or anxious attachers. B**ut even when an avoidant partner is faithful, sex may become problematic because the avoidant will withhold it from their anxious partner.** This may not be a conscious choice; the avoidant partner will just lose sexual interest in their partner. This in turn elevates the anxious partner’s anxiety.

Consciously or unconsciously, the avoidant is trying to do what he or she does in every scenario: Prevent the possibility of closeness. Meanwhile the anxious partner is simply trying to do what he or she does in every scenario: Find comfort in some type of positive affirmation from their avoidant partner.

### Avoidants See Their Anxious Partners as the Enemy

**Another common marker is that the avoidant partner's behavior may be completely different with the anxious partner than it is with the rest of the world.** For example, if Suzy is an avoidant, everyone in the neighborhood might think Suzy is the kindest person they know, but Suzy's anxious partner Bob will be privy to a very different side of her.

Suzy acts unkindly to Bob—and no one else—because **she sees him as the enemy.** He has gotten too close to her, and she feels suffocated.

#### How to Know If Your Partnership Has Become Toxic

If these statements apply to you and/or your relationship, your partnership has become harmful and possibly abusive:

  1. You don't want your friends and family to witness how your partner treats you. 
  2. Your partner has a reputation for being a wonderful human being—but this doesn't match up with what you see.
  3. Your partner is more concerned about how strangers view him or her than how you do.
  4. Your partner is nicer to other people than he or she is to you. 
  5. Your partner dismisses your opinion or insults your intelligence.
  6. You don't really know much about your partner's life, so you feel you have to spy on them to find out. 
  7. You don't feel confident that your partner would be there for you in an emergency situation. 



### Why Breaking Up Is Hard to Do

**If you're in an anxious-avoidant pairing that has become abusive or damaging, the first step is to admit it.** Many people feel ashamed of their predicament and try to brush it off by saying "no relationship is perfect" or "all couples have disagreements."

But even if you recognize the toxicity of your relationship, you still may find it nearly impossible to leave. And if you do leave, you'll immediately want to run straight back to his or her arms. That's due to the **"rebound effect."**

In Chapter 2, we discussed how evolution has wired our attachment system to prefer togetherness over going solo. Our brains' emotional circuits send out a message of "ouch, Mayday, severe pain ahead!" when we consider the prospect of breaking up with our significant other. In fact, **our brains register a relationship breakup the same way they register a hot stove we’re about to touch.** The brain sends a “don’t-do-it” signal.

From the standpoint of evolution, that's a good strategy. Our brains want to encourage us to stay connected to another human being (after all, they just might save us from the saber-toothed tiger). But there are no predators threatening us, just an unhealthy relationship that needs to end.

Unfortunately, once your brain registers the pain of the breakup, there's a snowball effect: **Your attachment system goes into overdrive, and your cognitive powers get hijacked.** Suddenly you can remember only the good times you've shared with your ex; the bad times fade out of view. Now breaking up seems like a terrible idea, so you stay. Or if you’ve already broken up, you return for a “rebound.”

### How to Break Up When You Think You Can't

If you need to end a toxic relationship but don't think you have the will to do it, rely on these strategies. These nine tips can help you get through a tough breakup:

  1. **Take a hard look at how your partner treats you.** Does he or she treat you like you're the most important person in their world or like you're the enemy? (If you’re not sure, refer to the list of questions above, "How to Know If Your Partnership Has Become Toxic.") 
  2. **Build a support team in advance of the breakup.** Tell your friends and family the truth about your relationship, and let them know you're thinking of ending it. 
  3. **Have a cozy, safe place to go for the first few nights.** If you can, stay with family or close friends. If you get the urge to go back to your ex, they'll be there to talk you out of it. 
  4. **Find comfort wherever you can.** You need to calm your overexcited attachment system, so indulge in whatever feel-good activities appeal to you (perhaps eating ice cream, getting a massage, or talking to a therapist). 
  5. **Don't feel ashamed if you “rebound.”** Since the dawn of time, heartbroken lovers have performed embarrassing stunts in the wake of a breakup. It would certainly be better if you didn’t phone your ex in the middle of the night (or drop by his or her apartment), but if you do, don't beat yourself up. That will only further activate your attachment system rather than calm it. 
  6. **Don't feel guilty for feeling deep pain.** You may start thinking you should stop “moping” and get on with your life, but be compassionate and patient with your pain. It's real. 
  7. When you’re overwhelmed by wonderful memories of your ex, **ask a friend to weigh in on what the relationship was really like.** Your perspective is distorted, so get an outside opinion. 
  8. **Make a list of all the reasons you left.** Write down what exactly occurred during some of the ugliest scenarios. This will help you to combat all those rosy memories that keep flooding your brain. 
  9. **Remember that this too shall pass.** It may not seem possible, but someday your broken heart will heal, and you will fall in love with a much more suitable partner.
