## Chapter 1: Understanding Attachment in Relationships

Many of the problems we face in our romantic relationships stem from our attachment systems, a mechanism in our brains that compels us to seek intimacy and closeness with a chosen partner—both physically and emotionally. Even though every human is wired with this urge for closeness, we respond to its pull in different ways. Some people feel the attachment urge and automatically want to resist it or suppress it. Others automatically embrace it. **If two partners’ attachment responses fall on opposing ends of the spectrum, clashes are inevitable. But by understanding how attachment drives us, we can achieve less conflict and more harmony in our relationships.**

Psychologists believe this brain wiring is an evolutionary adaptation. In prehistoric times, pairs of humans had a better chance of survival than any solo human, so genetic selection favored people who "attached"—or learned how to develop close bonds with others.

The fact that human attachment is an inescapable fact of biology gives rise to our differing methods of dealing with it. Although we all possess the innate desire to connect in a meaningful, nurturing way with a chosen partner, our beliefs and behaviors about intimacy fall into one of three diverse categories or "attachment styles"—secure, avoidant, or anxious.

### How Attachment Styles Affect Our Relationships

Whether your attachment style is secure, anxious, or avoidant determines how you function in intimate relationships. Here’s a brief summary of each style:

  * **If you're a secure attacher** , you're a nurturing, responsive, warm, and loving partner who is comfortable with intimacy. 
  * **If you're an anxious attacher** , you're preoccupied with making your relationship solid, and you constantly seek reassurance from your partner. 
  * **If you're an avoidant attacher** , you're more distant and self-reliant, and you see intimacy as a threat to your independence. You tend to keep your partner at arm's length. 



**Attachment differences manifest themselves in a wide range of partnership scenarios from budget-planning to raising children to daily chores to sex.** In fact, knowing someone's attachment style is an excellent predictor of how they will behave in any partnership situation.

**Every Human Has an Attachment Style**

Regardless of where in the world people live, what sex they are, or what culture or religion they belong to, slightly more than 50 percent of all people are secure attachers, about 25 percent are avoidant, and about 20 percent are anxious. The remaining 5 percent are combined anxious-avoidants.

In this summary, we’ll discuss how people develop these different attachment styles, and how they can change over time. We’ll explain how to determine your own attachment style as well as the attachment styles of your long-term partners or people you’re just starting to date. We’ll show how attachment needs affect our ability to thrive and why only some people will be able to meet your specific needs. We’ll also detail the emotional costs of getting attached to someone with a drastically different attachment style than your own. (And if you're already in this kind of challenging relationship, you'll learn techniques to make it less challenging—and even how to leave it, if necessary, with the least amount of pain and damage.)

Most importantly, you'll learn the skills that go along with a secure attachment style, such as how to communicate clearly and honestly with current or potential partners and how to resolve or mitigate conflict. No matter what your attachment style, you can learn the best behaviors and beliefs of the secure attachment style and use them to make your relationships more fulfilling and satisfying.

### Childhood Attachment Versus Adult Attachment

Researchers once assumed that your adult attachment style—how you interact with a romantic partner—was the result of your relationship with your parents during your youngest years. They saw adult romantic relationships as a mirror of childhood experiences:

  * If your parents were available, responsive, and sensitive to your needs, you would have a secure attachment style. Children who enjoy this kind of parenting learn that it's fine to rely on others; they're confident that other people will be available when needed. 
  * If your parents were inconsistent in their availability and responsiveness, you would have an anxious attachment style. 
  * If your parents were distant and unresponsive, you would have an avoidant attachment style. 



Over time, however, attachment theory has developed greater complexity. How your parents cared for you as an infant still matters, but it's only one of several factors. Other childhood conditions also have an impact, such as:

  * Whether or not you were born with a mellow temperament (making it easier for your parents and other people to love and care for you). 
  * Whether your parents were stressed out or well-adjusted.
  * Whether or not you spent much time with caretakers who were not your parents.



#### Parenting Is Only One Contributor to Attachment Styles

While it's true that children of parents who are sensitive to their needs are more likely to have a secure attachment style in their young years, when we look ahead 20 or 30 years to see what that child is like as an adult, the link is much weaker. Increasing evidence shows there's no single source that contributes to our attachment styles. Instead, it's a mosaic of factors that includes our early relationship with our parents, our adult romantic experiences, and possibly even our DNA.

**The research:** About 70 to 75 percent of adults remain in the same attachment style category throughout their lives, whereas the remaining 25 to 30 percent shift attachment styles at some point in adulthood. The change seems to be influenced by adult romantic relationships—healthy or unhealthy, good or bad—that are compelling enough to alter our basic beliefs about connectedness.

**In other words, under the right conditions in the right relationship, anxious or avoidant attachers can become secure attachers.** Of course, the flip side is also true—in the wrong relationship, secure attachers can become anxious or avoidant.

### DNA's Role in Attachment

Some research points to the idea that attachment styles may be strongly linked to DNA. For example, scientists at the University of Kansas have found that a specific dopamine receptor is associated with the anxious attachment style and another receptor is associated with the avoidant attachment style. These two genes play an important role in brain functions like emotional control and social behavior.
