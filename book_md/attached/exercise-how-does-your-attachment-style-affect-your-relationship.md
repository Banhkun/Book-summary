## Exercise: How Does Your Attachment Style Affect Your Relationship?

Once you’ve determined what your attachment style is, reflect on how you manifest that attachment style and what that means for your relationships.

* * *

List 3-5 of your common behaviors that clearly mark you as a secure, anxious, or avoidant attacher.

Now consider your present relationship (or most recent relationship if you’re not currently in one). List 3-5 ways that your attachment style affects your partner either positively or negatively. Consider phrasing your answers as: “When I do X, it probably makes my partner feel X.”

What ways could you adapt your behaviors to better suit the emotional needs of your partner?
