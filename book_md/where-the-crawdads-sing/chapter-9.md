## Chapter 9: The Past Comes Calling—1968 to 1969

One winter morning, Kya received a massive surprise while working on her third book, a guide to local mushrooms. From the kitchen table, she heard tires rolling over the gravelly lane to her shack. A red pickup pulled in, and she thought about running, her normal way of dealing with visitors, but it was too late. A man dressed in a military uniform was walking to her porch.

When Kya went to the door, something about the man struck a chord in her. He had a long, uneven scar running from his ear to mouth. Her mind left the moment and returned to another: the Easter Sunday before Ma had left.

That day, Kya and Ma had hidden painted eggs for the other children. When the hunt was over, each child had a basket full of pastel eggs and chocolate bunnies. Suddenly, Pa appeared drunk and angry. He grabbed Kya’s basket and raged at Ma about where she got the money for the treats. He accused her of lascivious acts and shook her by the shoulders.

Kya tried to intervene and received a hard slap across the face. Pa grabbed a fire poker and charged at Ma, slashing her in the chest. Then, Jodie was on top of Pa, wrestling him to the ground. Jodie yelled for his sister and mother to run, and Kya looked back to see Pa whip the poker across Jodie’s face. When they’d returned to the shack, Jodie was on the ground in a pool of blood. Ma stitched his face with her sewing needle, leaving a ragged scar.

**Back on her porch, Kya stared at the strange man for another second before saying her brother’s name for the first time in more than a decade.** Jodie moved to hug Kya, but she took a step backward and gestured for him to come in. Jodie had seen Kya’s book but wasn’t sure if it was her name on the cover. Now, looking around the shack at her collection, he knew positively that it was. He thought her book was amazing.

Over coffee, the siblings talked about Jodie’s tours in Vietnam and degree in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech. Kya told him about Pa leaving, and Jodie was surprised to hear that she’d been there all alone since shortly after he left. He apologized for leaving her with Pa and not coming sooner. When he returned from the war, he’d assumed she was already gone.

Kya looked at her brother with emotion. She didn’t blame him. He was a victim just as she was. She asked if he knew anything about their other siblings or mother. Jodie didn’t know anything about their brother or sisters, but **he’d found out a week ago that their mother had died two years earlier. Kya crumbled at the news**.

### The Long-Lost Matriarch

**Kya’s mother had suffered a breakdown after years of abuse from Pa.** Little known to anyone in the family, she’d been writing letters to her sister, Rosemary, about life in the swamp and being abused. The day she left, she made her way to her hometown of New Orleans and showed up on her family’s doorstep dirty and mute.

Kya’s maternal grandfather had tried unsuccessfully to get news about the children from the Barkley Cove sheriff. Over the next year, Ma lay in a stupor in her childhood bedroom. Then, one morning, she emerged in a panic, remembering the children she’d left behind. Rosemary helped her write and send a letter to Pa asking for the children to join her in New Orleans. **Pa had written back that if she tried to contact any of them again, he’d beat the children bloody.** Kya remembered the letter and the end of the good times with Pa.

Ma sank into a depression, knowing she had abandoned her children and feeling powerless to do anything about it. When she was diagnosed with leukemia, she refused treatment. Her body slowly deteriorated until her death.

Kya was overcome with grief for her poor mother. She still didn’t understand why she never came back for her, but she was able to use her understanding of biological development to start to forgive her. All creatures, even humans, are evolutionary remnants of their former ancestors. Early species did things to survive that would be unthinkable today, and those instincts get passed on through the generations. Maybe Ma had felt that primitive instinct for survival when she left. It didn’t make it right, but understanding it in this way made it less painful.

Jodie took Kya outside and showed her dozens of oil paintings, ones Ma had done during her years away, that Rosemary had given him. They were all of the children in the marsh. One painting struck Kya. It was of her and Tate as small children surrounded by marsh flowers.

Kya asked how Ma knew Tate, and Jodie told her that Tate had boated into their lagoon while Pa was abusing Kya. **At seven years old, Tate ran ashore and defended Kya, receiving a blow and death threat from Pa.** Still, Tate had picked her up and carried her to Ma.

### Reunited

Jodie stayed at the shack for a few days. During that time, he learned about Kya’s survival, which was largely due to the benevolence of Jumpin' and Mabel. Jodie couldn’t believe it. He asked why Kya didn’t have any friends from school and was astonished to learn she’d never gone and that Tate had taught her to read.

They took the boat exploring in the marsh, and Jodie reminisced about their siblings. Afterward, they ate a proper southern meal at the shack. Jodie noticed that most of Kya’s stories included Tate, including the fact that he was her first love and had recently confessed that he still loved her. **When Kya told him that she could never trust Tate again, Jodie tried to persuade her to give him another chance.**

Before Jodie left, he and Kya hung their mother’s paintings in the shack, giving it a more open and warm feeling. Jodie said he would try to visit as often as he could, and he gave Kya his address. After all this time, Kya finally had a way to connect with her brother. The last thing Jodie told Kya was to find Tate. He climbed in the truck, and Kya waved goodbye, tears of sadness and joy streaming down her face.

### A Game Revived

Seven months after Jodie’s visit, in July 1969, Kya found a copy of her new book on seabirds in the mailbox. She carried the book into the forest, where she planned to look for mushrooms, and a familiar sight made her stop dead in her tracks. On top of the old stump was a milk carton.

Inside the carton was an antique compass and a note. The note told of the compass’s previous owner, Tate’s grandfather. Kya hadn’t seen Tate since giving him the shell book long ago and had continued to hide when she saw him on the water. **She felt her heart opening, but she still felt the sting of abandonment.** She put the compass in her bag and thought about how she could repay him.

Despite herself, Kya often searched for Tate on the water just to see him. One morning, she watched as he passed unsuspecting in his boat while she lay undercover in the brush. His blonde hair glistened under a red cap. She recited a poem by Amanda Hamilton about the delusion of love.

### Prey

Early one morning, Kya motored to Cypress Cove, an area near town she rarely visited. She was looking for mushrooms in the cool, damp brush. She had Tate’s compass tucked into a pocket of her old backpack, and though a month had passed since receiving it, she hadn’t thanked him yet.

Kya sat on the ground drawing the mushrooms she’d discovered when she heard footsteps. **A voice followed and said, “Well, look who’s here. My Marsh Girl.” Kya stood to meet Chase.** She had no idea how he’d been able to sneak up on her. She hadn’t heard a boat. She gathered her items and told Chase to leave.

Chase reached for Kya’s arm. He apologized for the past, but Kya must have known they could never have been married. His breath reeked of whiskey. Kya pulled her arm away, but he grabbed it again, this time with force, and told her he knew she still loved him, and he wanted things to go back to the way they’d been. He pulled her in toward his body, and as Kya struggled, he kissed her.

Chase pushed Kya to the ground, got on top of her, and started to pull his pants down. Kya tried to push him off, but he punched her in the face. **Chase leered, saying Kya was his. He wasn’t going to let her get away again.** Chase held Kya with one hand and pulled down her pants with another. From somewhere deep inside, Kya’s survival instincts kicked in. She used all her force to push Chase off with her knees, then elbowed him in the face. She threw punch after punch until he was on the ground. She kicked him hard between the legs and in the lower back.

Kya pulled up her pants, grabbed her bag, and ran to her boat. As she started her boat, she saw Chase getting to his feet. She motored hard toward the open water, where another fishing boat sat, two men watching.

### The Aftermath

Kya stumbled into the shack, knees and face swollen from the attack. She cried on the floor knowing there was no one to help. Jumpin' would want to call the police, but she knew they’d never take her word over that of the former star quarterback. One thing she couldn’t stop seeing was the shell necklace around Chase’s neck. She couldn’t believe he still wore it. **His words drifted through her head—“You’re mine”—and she knew he would come after her again.**

Kya moved gingerly as she gathered food and supplies and headed to her boat. She motored through the channels to the secret cabin. Tate and Scupper had renovated it as a place for Tate to stay the night on his explorations, and there was now a bed, stove, and places to sit.

The first night, Kya sat outside listening for any disturbance in the brush. Satisfied that she was alone, she went inside and surveyed her body. Her legs, face, and arms were bruised and scratched, and her left eye was swollen shut. Her knees were bloody and enlarged. Kya cried, feeling the shame of having acted so promiscuously with Chase when they were together. Inside, she felt her actions had led to her current state.

Something about her bruised body made her understand for the first time what Ma’s life with Pa must have been like. **Kya vowed she would never live in fear of a man’s abuse again.** She went back to the shack, where she would stay until her injuries healed. She didn’t want anyone to see her discolored face.

### Learning to Heal

A week after Kya’s attack, she received a letter from her editor that he would be in nearby Greenville and hoped to meet her in person. He said the publisher would pay for everything if she could handle coming to town.

Kya didn’t know what to think, so she motored through the lagoon pondering it. Toward the far side of the estuary, she saw Tate collecting samples. She tried to hide, not wanting him to see her face, but he saw her and waved her over, tempting her with a new state-of-art microscope on board his research vessel. **Seeing Tate brought a slight relief to her heart.**

Kya climbed aboard, keeping her bad eye away from Tate. Tate was used to her distance, but this behavior seemed weird even for her. He finally understood why when she faced him, exposing the purple and yellow bruises. Tate didn’t believe her story about running into a door in the night, but he knew better than to push her. Instead, he asked about her new book.

Kya told him about her editor’s visit. She wasn’t sure if she would go to Greenville or not, but Tate urged her to go and promised to show her how to buy a bus ticket. The two talked a bit more about her book and Tate’s work. He would have talked about anything to keep her on the boat one minute longer.

When Kya finally stood to leave, Tate said it was too cold and tossed her his red stocking hat to keep her warm. Kya caught it and tossed it back. They continued tossing the hat back and forth as she ran over the sand to her boat, laughing. **Then, she and Tate grew silent staring into each other’s eyes.** Kya shook the moment off and motored away.

### Escape

Kya docked her boat in a different spot than usual after seeing Tate after a flock of gulls swarmed her, excited for their nightly feast. Kya walked to the beach and fed them bits of bread. The sound of a motor cut through the sky, and Kya knew it was Chase’s boat. He wouldn’t be able to see her boat where it was docked, but she was on display on the beach. She flattened her body against the sand and watched Chase motor by without noticing and enter the lagoon to her shack. His face was contorted with anger.

**Kya couldn’t believe her luck. If she’d gone home the normal way, Chase would have found her.** She also knew he would come to the beach when he didn’t find her at home. She got back in her boat and moved to a more hidden spot so she could see when he finally left. Thirty minutes after hearing the roar of his engine pass by, she finally went home.

That night, Kya jumped at each noise. She took her bedding to the beach and sat with the birds. Chase would keep coming back until he found her and taught her a lesson. She looked at the sea and wondered if she shouldn’t just walk in and let it consume her.

Going to Greenville seemed worthwhile in more ways than one now. She could get away for a few days and be safe, but she was also interested in meeting Robert Foster. Kya and her editor had corresponded like penpals for two years about her books, and a bond had formed. She wanted to meet the man who shared her love of nature and spoke of it with a similar poetry.

Kya went to Jumpin’s to get a bus schedule and told him about her possible trip to Greenville. But when she climbed back into her boat, Jumpin' saw the faintest hint of the bruise around her eye and asked what had happened. Like Tate, Jumpin' didn’t believe her story about the door, but unlike Tate, he didn’t let it slide. **Jumpin’ asked her point blank if Chase had done that to her, and Kya told him yes, surprised at betraying her secret.**

Kya begged Jumpin' not to tell. He protested, and she asked what would happen if a girl from Colored Town accused Chase of such a thing. The result would be the same. Jumpin' understood, but he didn’t like it.

Before Kya left, Jumpin' said if she ever needed a place to stay, she could stay with him and Mabel. He wanted to be updated about her trip plans because if she was gone and he didn’t know it, he’d be worried. If he didn’t see her for a few days, he was bringing a posse to her cabin to find out why.
