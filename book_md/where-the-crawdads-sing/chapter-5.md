## Chapter 5: Womanhood—1960 to 1962

**Kya’s body was changing in ways she didn’t understand.** Without a woman around for guidance, she’d moved through puberty without restriction. So when Mabel gave her a bra, she was surprised and embarrassed. Mabel said “it was about time she be needing one” and added that she was always available if Kya needed to talk about any other changes in her body.

A few weeks went by before Kya needed Mabel’s help again. She was in her boat on the open water when her stomach started to cramp. It was a pain like she’d never felt before and made her double over. She motored back to her beach and docked the boat. Right then, she heard the sound Tate’s boat motoring toward her. She cursed his terrible timing and hoped she wouldn’t have to run into the woods to let out whatever was causing her insides to twist.

Tate sat next to her on the sand and immediately noticed something was wrong. After Kya described her pain, Tate went quiet. He dug his toes into the sand and kept his gaze toward the sea. Then, Tate said it sounded like she was going through what girls her age went through and reminded her of a pamphlet he’d brought from school regarding the menstrual cycle.

Kya’s whole body burned with shame. Here she was, becoming a woman in front of Tate, and she had no idea what to expect. She left Tate on the beach and went home, but the first thing she did in the morning was motor to Jumpin's and ask for Mabel.

When Mabel arrived, she hurried to Kya with a brown bag in her hands. Mabel climbed into her boat and pulled Kya into a tight hug. She gave Kya the bag and explained what everything was for. **Mabel told her this was a natural part of a girl’s life. Kya was a woman now.**

### An Autumn Romance

Tate and Kya never spoke another word about that day on the beach. Their lessons picked back up where they’d left off. Fall had turned the sycamore leaves a golden hue, and Kya and Tate sat on their reading log underneath. Their lesson had ended a while ago, but Tate lingered.

Sitting in the silence, Kya found the courage to ask the question she’d been wanting to ask since finding that first feather—why he helped her and gave her all those gifts and materials. Shouldn’t he be spending time with a girlfriend from school? Tate said he preferred to be in nature than in town, and he liked how interested Kya was in marsh life. Most people never thought about all the living things in the marsh the way she did.

What he didn’t say was that he felt bad for the way she was alone. He’d heard the rumors about the Marsh Girl in town and knew boys dared each other to tag her house as a right of passage. He also didn’t tell her about the boys betting each other about who would devirginize her. There was more Tate wasn’t saying, like how**his feelings had grown from those of a protective brother to the strong desire of a man**. His feelings were so intense, sometimes they hurt.

Kya leaned close to Tate and felt her energy shift. She wondered if he felt it, too. At that moment, a heavy breeze blew through, sending thousands of yellow leaves from the surrounding sycamores cascading through the sky above them. Tate and Kya leaped up and chased the swirling leaves, trying to catch them before they landed. The two whirled under the leaves, falling like snowflakes, until they were face to face. Tate leaned in and kissed her, and**Kya felt the warmth of a new kind of connection, one she didn’t know existed.**

### In Full Bloom

Despite the age difference and their divergent lives in the community, love flourished between Kya and Tate. They still held their reading and math lessons, but the lessons were now accompanied by flirtatious games of tag along the beach, close embraces, and gentle kisses.

One day, Tate took Kya through the channels to a beach south of the shack. In his boat was a picnic basket. When they reached the beach, Tate revealed a two-tiered cake with her name written on top. He’d found out her birthday from the Bible and surprised her. **Kya hadn’t celebrated a birthday since Ma left, and she’d never had a birthday cake made just for her.**

Along with the cake were several presents wrapped in decorative paper. Kya unwrapped her presents as they ate cake with their fingers. There was a magnifying glass to examine her specimens, a jeweled barrette for her hair, and art supplies for her reproductions. Kya thanked him in wonder.

As fall moved into winter, Tate found it hard to visit Kya as much as he wanted. He was helping his father more on the boat and working through his final year of school. He thought about her constantly, keeping their relationship a secret, even from Scupper. He still made it to the shack now and then, sometimes just for a brief walk along the beach, but most of the time, he reminisced about kissing her and imagined what it would be like to be intimate with her. He would never push her, though. She was young and innocent, and he still felt a strong desire to keep her safe, even from him.

Kya also thought about Tate, but mostly she devoured every book she could get her hands on. Her reading progress was remarkable, and she could get through all of the science books Tate brought her from school. **She loved reading about biological development patterns and communication rituals of animals, the whole time wondering if she’d find some explanation for Ma’s abandonment.**

Christmas came and went as usual, with Kya spending it alone, but Tate had promised to come the next day to celebrate with her. Kya put on a peach chiffon dress she’d gotten from Mabel’s donations and waited on the cold beach with her present for Tate—a tuft of hair from the head of a male cardinal. When Tate arrived, he was sincerely touched by her gift. Together in the cozy warmth of the shack’s kitchen, Tate and Kya heated up his holiday leftovers. They ate dinner at the kitchen table, which Kya had decorated for the occasion.

Tate became aroused watching Kya cleaning dishes at the sink. He moved until he was behind her and engulfed her in an embrace. She leaned into his chest and closed her eyes. His hands roamed, surrounded her breasts. Kya experienced sensations in parts of her body that confused her. She didn’t want it to stop, but she also didn’t know what to do. Her instincts took over, and she resisted, but Tate whispered in her ear that everything was fine. **They stayed embraced, feeling each other’s chests moving up and down with each breath.**

### The Beginning of the End

Spring of 1961 burst forth from winter with startling beauty, and Tate and Kya took in the rebirth of warmth walking along the banks of a creek near the secret cabin.

One afternoon, Kya burst into giggles and fluttered away like a little girl, but Tate didn’t see a little girl anymore. He moved toward her and pushed her against a tree. They kissed, his body pressed up against hers. This was the most forward he’d ever been.

Tate pulled back and looked in Kya’s eyes, waiting for a sign to continue. Kya didn’t protest, so he undressed her, slowly so he could take in her beauty. Tate undressed himself and moved in close until he could feel her nakedness against his. Kya blushed and turned away, but Tate made her look him in the eye. She reached for him, and he reached for her. As he explored her body with his hands, Kya let out a soft moan. Suddenly, Tate came back to reality, his reason overtaking his passion once again.

Despite Kya’s pleas to keep going, Tate refused. He dressed her and carried her to the beach. Tate explained that he wanted her, but she was too young. **He loved her too much to risk the emotional or physical repercussions of their lovemaking.**

Over the next few months, their relationship was still physical, but Tate never let things get too far again. Then, in early summer, he told Kya that he would be leaving for college in Chapel Hill sooner than he thought to take a job in a biology lab over the summer. Kya, who had thought they’d have the whole summer together, was crushed.

Kya asked why he couldn’t stay, why he couldn’t just become a shrimper like Scupper. But she already knew. Tate wanted to be a research biologist and study the marsh. Kya understood his goals, but she also knew they would take Tate away forever. There were no jobs for biologists near Barkley Cove. Tate said he would never leave her, that he would visit often and come back for her when he was done, but she didn’t believe him. Everyone had left her and never came back. Why would Tate be any different? She jumped up and ran into the woods, hiding as she’d done so many times from the big scary world.

The next time Tate came to the shack, it was a week later. He motored onto her beach and took her to the reading log. **Things had changed in the last few days, and he was leaving for college immediately. He’d come to say goodbye.**

Kya couldn’t speak or look at him. All she could think was how she wanted to go back to the tree and give herself to him. She wanted him to make love to her just once in case he never came back. But Tate would be back for the Fourth of July, just over a month away, and he swore he would never forget her. Before he left, he gave Kya a long kiss goodbye. As he motored across the lagoon, he turned once and waved. Kya waved back, then brought her hand to her heart.

### Promises, Promises

Kya sat on the reading log on July 4, 1961, eager to hear the low hum of Tate’s motor approaching. She read throughout the day and only left the log once to rush back to the shack to eat something. The sun began to drop, and the sounds of wildlife started to fade for the evening. By the time the sky lingered between the last copper bloom of light and hazy blue of night, the marsh was quiet, tucked in for the night.

The next day, Kya took up her post on the log and waited again for the sweet sound of her love’s boat. This time, she sat out until the moon was high, blasting a cone of light across the channel. The next day was the same, as was the day after that. **Around noon on the fourth day of waiting, Kya screamed over the lagoon, yelling Tate’s name in disbelief.** She fell to her knees and let the tide wash over her.

For three days, Kya lay in bed with an aching heart. She didn’t even get up to feed the birds on the beach, something she’d done every day of her life thus far. She could hear their painful pleas from her bed and hoped their sadness might replace hers, but there was no way to repair the damage of abandonment this time.

What was wrong with her that made everyone leave? Ma, her siblings, Pa, and now Tate. When the other’s left, she had learned to survive, but with Tate, his absence was like the absence of breath itself. Tate had opened her up to a life of connection and showed her how to love. She didn’t just lose Tate, she lost the whole world Tate represented. **She vowed to rely on herself only from now on and never open her heart to love again.**

With this new resolve, Kya got out of bed. The first thing she did was take grits to the beach to feed the seagulls. Their joy at seeing her was felt in the way they swooped around her tall frame, coming close enough to brush her with their feathers. Kya felt a small reprieve from her agony, but it was momentary. She stayed hidden from the world for another month in the marsh.

After being sequestered for so long, Kya ran out of supplies. She took her boat to Jumpin’s, but unlike before, she simply filled up, bought her items, and headed home. **She didn’t want to talk with Jumpin’ or feel their connection. People couldn’t be trusted anymore.**

One morning, Kya took the boat out, explored, and added to her wilderness collection. She tried to focus on finding feathers, shells, and nests, but her thoughts always drifted to Tate. Months passed in this way. She’d take the boat out, collect her specimens, and paint illustrations of them at home. She went to Jumpin’s only when she absolutely had to and continued to keep an emotional distance.

During this time, her collection had taken on a grand air. She’d organized everything according to genus and species, age, size, and color. Every surface of the shack held a part of her masterpiece. She loved her collection and world, but she was lonelier than ever.

Time continued, and soon it was a year since she’d seen Tate. Though her life had gone on, the empty hole in her heart expanded with each passing month. **She longed for the sound of another’s voice, to feel someone near, to touch another’s flesh.** But keeping her heart safe was more important than companionship, and year after year, Kya settled into isolation.
