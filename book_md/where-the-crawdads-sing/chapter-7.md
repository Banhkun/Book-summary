## Chapter 7: The Barkley Cove Judge and Jury—1969

Patty Love entered the police station late in the afternoon. She wanted to know if the sheriff had any leads or other information about her son’s death. Sheriff Jackson thought it was surely foul play and said they were doing everything they could to find the person responsible. That was when Patty Love told them her news.

Patty said there was a shell necklace Chase had worn almost every day for four years. It was a single shell with a piece of rawhide laced through. She knew he’d been wearing it the night he died because he’d been over for dinner. **But when she saw Chase’s body, he wasn’t wearing the necklace, and it wasn’t part of his possessions held by the coroner.** She was certain the necklace wasn’t loose enough to have simply fallen off.

Ed was curious about the significance of the necklace. Why would Chase wear such a thing on a daily basis? Had someone special given it to him? Patty Love fell quiet. She knew rumors had spread around town about her son and the Marsh Girl carousing a year before he got married, but she’d never been able to talk about it—her son with such trash.

But now, it was different. She was sure that girl had done something to her boy. She told the officers about Chase’s affair and that the Marsh Girl had made the necklace. She was positive no one else would have taken it. **The Marsh Girl had obviously felt scorned that Chase had broken up with her and married another woman. If she couldn’t have him, no one could.**

After Patty left, Ed and Joe pondered this new information. It would make sense if someone from the marsh was involved, as they have little respect for the law. Also, marsh folk know more about the swamp than anyone else. They’d know how to cover their tracks out there. But he had a hard time imagining a woman having the strength to push a man like Chase off the tower. Still, it was the only lead they had.

The men agreed to drive out to the shack to talk to the Marsh Girl and find out what she knew. If they brought up the necklace and she seemed disturbed, there could be something to Patty Love’s theory.

The next morning, the men woke before dawn and drove to the shack. They wanted to try to catch Kya before she took off in her boat. When they arrived, they parked a ways down the lane and crept silently to the shack. Nobody answered when they knocked, and despite their early arrival, the boat was already gone. They tried another day and found the boat tied up on the shore, but nobody answered when they knocked. **They had an inkling that the Marsh Girl was hiding in the woods, but there was nothing they could do without a warrant.**

### The Marsh Girl

Because Chase Andrew’s murder was the biggest thing to hit Barkley Cove in decades, Ed and Joe couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with questions. After the last failed attempt to find the Marsh Girl at the shack, the men entered the Dog-Gone and got an earful. Townspeople asked if they’d found anything new, why there was no evidence, whether they’d considered certain people around town, whether they knew what they were doing.

At one point, a shrimper named Hal Miller asked to speak to Ed alone. Ed took the man to a corner away from the clamor. Hal seemed stressed as he told the sheriff he’d been haunted by information he hadn’t shared before and figured it was time to tell someone.

The night of Chase’s death, Hal was out shrimping with another man, Allen Hunter, and saw the Marsh Girl motoring at around 1:45 am. If she kept to the course she was heading, she would have reached the area surrounding the tower.

After Hal left, Ed told Joe what he’d just heard. **They both agreed this new information increased suspicion about the Marsh Girl.** If they had a little more, they might be able to get a warrant to search the shack.

### An Innocent Woman

It was raining outside when Joe walked into Ed’s office with news. Kya was still nowhere to be found, so the deputy had gone out to Jumpin’s to see when she might be coming next. Jumpin' had given Joe the most interesting news: **Kya was gone the night Chase was killed.**

Ed didn’t believe it. He knew the Marsh Girl never left the area, and he doubted she had any friends who would know about it if she did. But Joe said both Jumpin' and Dr. Tate Walker confirmed that Kya was over in the nearby town of Greenville for two nights, including October 30. Jumpin' said she hadn’t even heard the news when she came by the wharf a day later, and Tate was the one who’d helped her learn to take the bus to Greenville and back.

**Joe believed they were back to square one, now that their main suspect had a rock-solid alibi, but Ed wasn’t quite so sure.** What about Hal and Allen seeing her in the boat? He reminded Joe that sometimes a good alibi was too good. They agreed to wait until they confirmed the story before deciding what to do next.

Later that afternoon, Pansy Price knocked on the sheriff’s door. She’d heard around town, most notably from Patty Love, that the Marsh Girl was suspected of killing Chase, but she didn’t believe the rumors. She and her co-workers had seen the Marsh Girl get on a bus the afternoon of October 28 and get off the bus two days later, hours after Chase had died that morning. She’d be willing to testify to all of it.

Again, Joe assumed the investigation into the Marsh Girl was done, but Ed couldn’t be thwarted. If someone could take a bus to Greenville in the day, they could easily take one at night back to Barkley Cove. And it seemed too convenient that she allowed herself to be seen getting on and off the bus. If she was going to cover her tracks, she would have to have made her movements public. It was a brilliant plan, Ed said. The men looked at the bus departure times for Greenville. Sure enough, **the times indicated that going back and forth and back again in one day was not only possible, but easy. It was time to get a warrant.**

### The Red Threads

When Ed and Joe entered Kya’s shack without her knowledge, they stood dumbfounded at the sight of her enormous collection. They thought what most people from town thought: she had lost her mind.

The men searched every drawer, closet, and behind every specimen for a red woolen item, a diary, ticket stubs, anything that might help. After a while, Joe called Ed onto the porch. In his hand was a red wool hat. **Ed pulled out the baggy containing the fibers and held them up to the hat. They looked like a perfect match.** They took the hat for testing at the lab.

The day the report came back, both men celebrated the officially confirmed match. Kya’s hat had left the fibers on Chase’s jacket. The case against Kya was still tenuous. Her motive as a jilted lover was shallow at best, and there was her alibi to contend with. Still, they thought the fibers were enough to at least bring her in and possibly charge her.

In mid-December, Ed and Joe were in the office devising a plan to find Kya when Rodney Horn, a retired mechanic, came in. He told the officers about something he’d seen at the end of August that might have something to do with their case. He’d been out fishing with his friend Denny Smith and witnessed something at one of the nearby coves. **After he told the men his story and left, the two officers stared at each other. They finally had a proper motive.**
