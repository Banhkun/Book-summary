## Chapter 10: Truth and Lies—1969 to 1970

A few days before Christmas, Kya motored toward Jumpin’s before dawn. She was more cautious than usual, had been ever since the sheriff and deputy had started coming to her shack. When she got close enough, she could make out Jumpin' on his chair near the store. She waved as she normally did, but Jumpin' didn’t move or say a word. After a second, he gave the slightest shake of his head. Kya slowed the boat, turned quickly, and headed back to her shack. Appearing out of the fog were several boats, one with the sheriff at the helm.

Kya tried to lose the boats by heading out to sea. But there was no time. The boats surrounded her, and two officers jumped into her boat and detained her. **Deputy Purdue said she was under arrest for the murder of Chase Andrews and read her her rights.**

Kya was held in custody in the town’s holding cells for two months. On February 25, 1970, she was led into a courtroom in handcuffs with her lawyer Tom Milton by her side. Tom had taken over for the public defender after reading about Kya’s arrest. He was from the area and had heard stories about the Marsh Girl over the years. He took her case pro bono, coming out of retirement at seventy-one.

The courtroom was packed to the rafters with townspeople, everyone wanting a chance to witness the Marsh Girl in handcuffs, a possible death sentence looming over her head. Kya didn’t look at anyone as she took her place behind the defendant’s table.

Jury selection started after the presiding judge, Judge Sims, announced that Tom’s motion to have the trial moved for bias was denied. The judge turned to two rows of jurors and asked if they would have a problem sentencing Kya to death. No one raised their hands.

Kya recognized most of the jurors from town but didn’t know their names. Two, however, she knew: Sally Culpepper, the truant officer from Kya’s youth, and the preacher’s wife, who’d rushed her little girl away the night Kya and Pa ate at the diner. All the jurors agreed to not be biased.

Hearing about her possible death made Kya’s breath catch. It wasn’t that she was afraid to die. She was afraid of dying by appointment at the hand of someone else. **She’d never relied on anyone for anything, but the thought that her freedom would be hijacked at the last moment of her life terrified her.**

### The Burden of Proof

The prosecutor, a man named Eric Chastain, was called to present his case first. He had a number of witnesses to call, each with damning evidence against Kya.

He called:

  * Rodney Horn, who’d been out fishing when he and a buddy heard a woman screaming. They saw Kya, partially undressed, kicking Chase Andrews while he lay on the ground. **The last thing they heard was Kya screaming that if Chase touched her again, she’d kill him.**
  * The coroner, who testified about the injuries sustained by Chase and the red fibers found on his jacket. The prosecution focused on injuries that pointed to Chase falling backwards, as though pushed, and the match between the fibers on the jacket and those of the hat found at the shack. 
  * Sheriff Jackson, who testified about finding the body and the investigation. He said they determined it was foul play because of the lack of evidence at the scene. 
  * Larry Price, the bus driver between Greenville and Barkley Cove. Mr. Price confirmed that it was possible to travel between the two towns multiple times in one day. He also said none of the passengers on the bus the night Chase died looked like Kya. But there was a young white man, tall and thin, wearing a big blue cap. He said the passenger kept his head down and didn’t look at anyone. Mr. Price thought it was possible that Kya disguised herself to be that skinny man. 
  * Joe King, who’d driven the 2:30 am bus back to Greenville the morning of October 30. Again, Mr. King said Kya was not on the bus, but there was an older woman with gray hair. She was also tall. **Mr. King said he guessed it was possible that the woman could have been Kya dressed up to look elderly.**



Although these witnesses’ testimonies painted a bad picture regarding Kya’s guilt, Tom was not deterred. He questioned each witness expertly, creating doubt about their statements.

  * Rodney Horn admitted it was possible that Kya was in trouble and defending herself when they saw her kicking Chase. 
  * The coroner admitted that Chase’s injuries would be similar if he’d simply fallen. He also said that fibers can stay on a jacket, even with washing, for years. 
  * Sheriff Jackson was forced to defend the logic regarding the lack of evidence. There was no indication that footprints or fingerprints had been destroyed and it was possible the tide had washed out the footprints Chase had made. There was also no real evidence whatsoever that suggested Kya was at the tower. The last blow to the sheriff’s testimony was a letter he’d written to the Forest Service three months prior asking for the tower to be fixed. **The letter stated that the open grates were hazardous, and if something wasn’t done, a tragic accident could occur.**
  * Mr. Price admitted that he hadn’t thought the man on the bus was wearing a disguise until the sheriff suggested it and stated that the bus was late arriving to Barkley Cove that night. It was scheduled to arrive at 1:15 am but didn’t arrive until 1:40 am. 
  * Mr. King reiterated that Kya was not on the bus returning to Greenville and that there were no other buses making the trip that night. 



After Tom’s cross examination, court was dismissed, and Kya was taken back to her cell.

### The Love of Others

Shortly after returning to her cell, a guard came to take Kya to meet with her lawyer. Tom wanted talk options. Because of the town’s prejudice against her, it would be hard to win the case. If she plead guilty to manslaughter, saying that she’d been at the tower with Chase and he’d fallen as part of a horrible accident, she could probably get ten years and be out in six. **Kya outright refused. She wouldn’t say she was guilty and wouldn’t go to prison.**

Back in her cell, Kya went through the events that led her there. Her family leaving, Jodie leaving, Tate leaving. If any of them had stayed, she wouldn’t be sitting in jail. That fall, Kya had become more inclined to take Jodie’s advice about Tate, but since her arrest, she’d refused to accept Tate’s visits. She hadn’t called Jodie either. Imagine finding each other after so long and then telling Jodie she’d been accused of murder. She couldn’t ask for his support. Depending on people only led to trouble.

Court was out of session the next day, and the guard told Kya the same young man who kept coming to see her was back. Kya wouldn’t budge, but after the guard said there was nothing to do all day but be cooped up in there, she went to the meeting room, where Tate was waiting.

Tate jumped to his feet and tried to hide his emotions about seeing Kya in jail. He said he’d been feeding the gulls and promised that when Kya was free, they would explore the lagoons again, like they did when they were together.

**Kya told Tate to forget her, but Tate wouldn’t and never could.** He’d be in court every day until it was over. Kya pleaded with him to understand. It was too late. She couldn’t trust people, didn’t belong in his world, and didn’t want to. They could be friends, but that was the best she could do. Kya thanked him for coming and went back to her cell.

The next day, when Kya was led into court, she saw Tate, Jumpin’, Mabel, and Jodie in the front row. Despite what she’d said to Tate and to herself, seeing them there filled her with renewed strength.

### More Conjecture

The next witness on the prosecution’s list was Patty Love, and as she made her way to the witness box, **Kya realized the ridiculousness of ever thinking this woman would have accepted her as family**.

Patty Love told the court what she’d told Ed and Joe about the shell necklace. To back up her story, she had provided a journal she’d found in Chase’s room while cleaning. Kya had given Chase the journal as a gift. Inside, she’d painted scenes from their time together. In one of the paintings, Kya clearly depicted her handing Chase the shell necklace on top of the fire tower. The audience gasped. Out of respect for the grieving mother, Tom did not cross-examine her.

Next up was Hal Miller, who told of seeing Kya speeding in her boat the morning of October 30, the same story he’d told the sheriff at the bar. Hal said he was sure it was Kya because everyone knew what her boat looked like.

Under Tom’s keen questioning, Hal relayed that the moon rose the morning of October 30 after they’d docked for the night at 2 am. He admitted it was too dark out and they were too far away to see what Kya was wearing that night. When Tom asked how he could be sure it was Kya from so far away, Hal responded she cut a particular shape in the boat, one they were all familiar with. **But under pressure from Tom, Hal had to acknowledge that he could not positively say it was Kya he saw that night.** The prosecution rested its case.

### The Defense

The morning Tom began his defense, he called Mrs. Singletary, the clerk at the Piggly Wiggly, to the stand. Mrs. Singletary testified to seeing Kya getting on and off the bus on the afternoons in question. As she spoke, the grocery store clerk glanced at Kya and remembered the unkempt barefooted girl who didn’t know how to count. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Mrs. Singletary had slyly given Kya extra change all those years, taking the money from her own paycheck to cover the difference.

Tom’s intention was to support Kya’s alibi, but Mr. Chastain told the judge that there was no reason for the string of people slated to defend Kya’s boarding and unboarding of the bus to testify, for the fact of her riding the bus at those times was not in question. **The judge asked Tom if he felt the need to bring more testimony if Kya’s presence on the bus was not in question, to which Tom begrudgingly admitted he didn’t.**

Next, Tom called the owner of the Three Mountains Motel in Greenville, where Kya had stayed. The man testified that he’d checked Kya in and showed her the room. Kya was the kind of woman you don’t forget, and her room was directly across from his office, so he would have noticed if she’d left at any point the night of October 29. Kya watched the man, remembering how he’d leered at her and loitered in her room until she had to ask him to leave.

Mr. Chastain listed a number of events that night that could have taken the man’s attention from Kya’s room. Between leaving his post twice to use the restroom, a pizza delivery, and other guests checking in, wasn’t it possible he’d been too distracted at times to notice? The motel owner acknowledged that it was possible but reiterated that he hadn’t seen her leave.

The next witness was Kya’s editor, Robert Foster. **Kya was so embarrassed that this man she revered was witnessing her humiliation. He’d been the only person who didn’t think of her as the Marsh Girl.** Robert testified that he and Kya had gone out to eat the night of October 29, and he’d dropped her off at the hotel at five to ten. The next morning, he picked her up at 7:30, and the two had breakfast. He’d taken her back at 9 am.

Mr. Chastain forced Robert to acknowledge that the company had offered to put Kya up in a fancy hotel near the downtown district, but Kya had requested the remote motel. A map of Greenville showed the close proximity between the motel and the bus station. Before he sat down, Mr. Chastain proffered that if someone wanted to make a quick getaway by bus, the motel was a better option than the fancy hotel if they were on foot.

On redirect by Tom, Robert stated that Kya was a reserved and introverted person who preferred isolation in the wilderness. It had taken some effort to even get her to agree to come, so he could understand why she might avoid a crowded hotel. **He thought the choice of the remote hotel suited Kya’s character.** When Robert was finished, he took a seat behind Kya with the rest of her supporters.

### Losing Control

In the afternoon, with only two witnesses for the defense left, Kya started to unravel. **Where, once, she was able to distract herself with thoughts of marsh life, now she was consumed with images of prison and her possible death sentence.** She crumbled into her hands, prompting Tom to call a recess.

Kya begged Tom to go on without her. She couldn’t sit in that courtroom one more minute. But she had to attend by law, and it was easier for a jury to find an absent defendant guilty. When Kya went back to the courtroom, her mind drifted in and out of reality, and she could no longer focus on what was being said.

Tom recalled Sheriff Jackson and questioned him about the timing of Kya’s crime. With the testimony that the bus was late, the time it would take her to get to her boat, ride to the tower, perform the murder, and get back to the bus station was one hour seven minutes. But the bus to Greenville left fifty minutes after she would have arrived. There simply wasn’t time to do everything needed to commit the crime.

Ed speculated that she could have saved a minute or two here or there if she’d jogged, but he was flustered. The sheriff also suggested that maybe she hadn’t taken the boat. Maybe she’d run from the station to the tower by foot. At the prosecution’s table, Mr. Chastain burned with fury. The sheriff was dismantling his theory.****

To make up lost ground, the prosecutor explained that the water surrounding Barkley Cove was often caught in riptides and undertow currents that caused it to move faster. Someone could have taken advantage of a riptide and traveled to the tower faster than normal. But the sheriff had no proof that these events had occurred on the night in question.

### Last Chance

The last day of the trial began with Tom calling his final witness. It was Tim O’Neal, the owner of the shrimping company Hal and Allen worked for. He’d also been out that night in a separate vessel and seen the same boat as his crew members. But Tim explained that without the moon and no lights, it was impossible to make a positive ID about who was in the boat. Also, **Kya’s boat was one of the most popular styles, and many people in town had similar boats**. With that, the witness testimonies came to a close.

Closing arguments followed a short recess, and the prosecution was up first. Mr. Chastain reiterated the evidence against Kya, adding that her lifestyle in the wild gave her specific knowledge about how to navigate the water and land in the dark. From where he was standing, the case against Kya was clear and worthy of a conviction of first-degree murder.

Tom took a different approach. He started by locating himself as one of Barkley Cove’s residents who’d heard the stories and rumors about the Marsh Girl. His speech turned emotional when he spoke about the failure of the community to support a little girl left to her own devices, choosing to ridicule and ostracize her instead. He said only Jumpin' and his community stepped up to help Kya survive as a child. **If the community had stepped in and helped this girl, her life could have been different and a town full of people wouldn’t be prejudiced against her.**

Tom paused, preparing for his emotional ending. Despite her circumstances and lack of schooling, this woman, who Barkley Cove reduced to Marsh Girl, was now heralded as the Marsh Expert in scientific communities. He said it was time for this community to put aside their prejudices and see this woman for who she was. Let the persecution of this young woman finally be over.
