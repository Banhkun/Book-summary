## Chapter 4: Murder in a Small Town—1969

On the morning of October 30, 1969, two Barkley Cove boys climbed to the top of the old fire tower in the swamp outside of town. They stared at the landscape from the top until their eyes landed on someone lying in the mud below. After yelling to try to get the person’s attention, **they ran back down the stairs and found the dead twisted body of Chase Andrews**.

Normally, the town sheriff, Ed Jackson, didn’t bother with crimes committed in the swamp. He figured trash killing trash was beyond his jurisdiction, but when the boys told him who the victim was, he jumped into action. He and the town doctor drove out to the fire tower and examined the body.

Both men, along with everyone in town, knew who Chase Andrews was. He was a charismatic child who grew into a popular teen. He was the star quarterback in high school and had joined his father at the auto shop business as an adult. He was married and lived a charmed life. Chase’s parents would be devastated when they found out their only child was dead.

At first, both men assumed Chase had fallen from the tower. The top of the fire tower was made out of large metal grates. Different squares could be pushed up, creating an opening. **Chase had probably been up there drinking and fell through an open slat.** But what they couldn’t figure out was why nobody had known. Chase was always running with his pack of childhood friends. The only way he would’ve been up there without them was if he was with another woman, which wasn’t a stretch for the smooth-talking local hero.

### Suspicions Flare

Something was off about the scene where Chase was found. **There were no footprints in the mud near the body.** In fact, the only footprints they could find were their own and those of the two boys. Not even Chase’s footprints existed. How could that be?

The first order of business was to inform Chase’s family of his death. Then, his body was transported to the morgue for an autopsy. Sheriff Jackson told the doctor not to mention anything about Chase’s death or the strange circumstances to anyone in town.

Soon, Deputy Joe Purdue arrived, and the men went about investigating the scene. They were reluctant to call it a murder just yet, but they both agreed it was starting to seem like it wasn’t a freak accident. They photographed the body and surrounding mud. They climbed up the fire tower stairs and saw that one of the grates on the far side was open. Sixty feet below the open grate sat the outline of Chase’s body.

The open grate was odd. People might forget to close the grate over the stairs, but it was unusual for any of the other grates to be opened, let alone left open. Joe questioned why someone would leave the grate open if they had pushed Chase into the hole, but Ed understood. **If someone wanted his death look like an accident, the grate had to be open.**

For two hours, Ed and Joe collected fingerprints from the grate, the stair railing, and anything else someone might have touched. They collected blood and fiber samples from broken beams that had snapped as Chase fell through. They had everything they needed to start the investigation except a suspect and motive. True, Chase was wild and known as a Tomcat with the ladies, even after he was married. There were plenty of people who might have had a grudge against him, but how many of them would take it as far as murder?

### Evidence

The initial lab reports came back for what had been collected at the scene. Ed and Joe looked over the report and noted a distinct lack of evidence. **There were no fingerprints on the tower railings, no footprints, no traces of anyone being out there that night, not even Chase.** They also had a time of death, somewhere between midnight and 2 am.

A few days later, Joe met Ed at his truck in front of the station. He’d received more information from the lab. The doctor had confirmed that the blood and hair samples taken from the broken wooden beam belonged to Chase. The blow had caused internal bruising and damage to his brain, but what killed him was the force of hitting the ground, a force that had severed his spine.

Both men knew that the evidence was now conclusive that Chase’s body had not been dumped in the swamp. He’d fallen from the tower, a fact that now made the lack of fingerprints and footprints even more suspicious. **There was no more doubt that Chase had been murdered.**

Along with the report were samples of a red fiber found on the body. Ed held up a plastic baggy holding a small clump of wool fibers. For the first time, the lawmen had a lead. All they had to do was find the red wool garment, whether hat, scarf, or sweater, and match it to the sample.

### Secrets

Eight days after Chase’s body was discovered, Ed and Joe both announced they had a piece of interesting information. Over donuts, Joe said he’d heard that Chase had been sneaking out to the marsh for several years. Chase never told anyone what he was doing out there, but he was known to visit the marsh on his own. Joe thought maybe he was mixed up with drugs.

Ed argued that Chase was an athlete and not likely to do drugs, so Joe suggested maybe he’d been meeting a woman. Again, Ed dismissed the idea. Chase only mixed with the high-class women of Barkley Cove. He wasn’t likely to mess around with marsh trash. Both agreed the circumstances were unclear,**but the information did point to a secret side of Chase’s life that may help their case**.

When it was Ed’s turn, he relayed that Chase’s mother, Patty Love, had something important to tell them, something that might lead to a break in the case. Her story had something to do with a shell necklace Chase always wore. It wasn’t much of a clue, but with the way the swamp had swallowed up any other evidence, it was worth a shot.
