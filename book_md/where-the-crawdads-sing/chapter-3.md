## Chapter 3: Becoming Grown—1956 to 1960

By the time Kya was ten, Pa was a passing mirage in the shack. He’d stay out for weeks at a time, not bothering to leave any money. Soon, she was able to count several full moons since she last saw him. She imagined all the things that could have happened to Pa, like being beaten up during a poker game or falling drunk into the swamp and drowning. **Whatever had happened, Kya knew that Pa wasn’t going to come back.**

Unlike with Ma, Pa leaving didn’t make her feel abandoned, just lonely. She was also scared that someone would find out he was gone and take her to live somewhere else. The marsh was her home, and the birds needed her. Leaving wasn’t an option. To avoid the authorities, she’d have to pretend Pa was still at home.

The only saving grace was that Pa had disappeared on foot, leaving the boat behind. Kya survived by digging for mussels in the sand and smashing them into a spread on crackers for each meal. But she had no more supplies. The house was dark at night without kerosene for the lamps, and she only had a few matches left. **She had to find a way to get some money.**

### New Relations

Early one morning, Kya awoke before the sun and went mussel hunting up and down the coastline. After several hours, she’d collected two large sacks full. **She motored to Jumpin’s and offered him the bags of mussels in exchange for money and gas for the boat.** He gave her fifty cents and a full tank. She’d never felt so proud.

Kya had never been inside Jumpin’s store before, but on this visit, she wandered around and saw that he sold more than just fishing gear. There was food, kerosene, and toiletries, everything she needed to get by. With her fifty cents, she picked up a few supplies.

She asked Jumpin' how many bags she could bring each week. He told her he bought mussels every three days, but other people brought them in, too. If she wanted to sell hers, she’d have to be first in line. Kya thanked him and said Pa sent his regards.

**When Kya got back home, she felt grown up.** She’d made money and replenished what she needed to survive on her own. She unpacked the groceries and noticed a box of candy in the bag. Jumpin' must have slipped it in.

Kya started waking up earlier each day to collect mussels and oysters. Sometimes, she’d motor close to the wharf and sleep in the boat so she could be there first thing when Jumpin' opened. She was making decent money and never had to step foot in town again for anything.

### Unlikely Heroes

For a while, Kya was able to support herself with mussels money, but all the money in the world didn’t make up for a lack of human connection. **The days stretched long, and Kya’s loneliness stretched with them.** Ever since she’d seen Tate that day a few years ago, she’d caught glimpses of him now and then out in the estuary. She wanted to approach him, make contact with someone besides Jumpin', but she never did. She only ever watched him from afar.

Life at the shack had dwindled. Dishes went undone, her collection of feathers and shells were haphazardly strewn about the floor, and her clothes became tattered and rank. She had no shoes and no way of changing her circumstances without more money, which was scarce.

Many mornings, Kya pulled up to Jumpin’s only to discover others had beaten her there. After two weeks, she was out of money and supplies with no hope on the horizon. She decided to try a different tactic. She took the boat out and fished for eight hours, amassing a small pile of fish. She soaked them in a saltwater brine and smoked them in Pa’s smokehouse out back. The next day, she took the smoked fish to Jumpin's.

Jumpin' took one look at Kya’s mangled pile of fish and told her he’d sell them on consignment. However, that night, Jumpin' took the bag of fish home to his wife Mabel. Mabel, a large warm woman, took one look at the fish and decided something needed to be done about that poor girl. **Despite Kya’s efforts to pretend Pa was still around, Jumpin' and Mabel weren’t fooled.**

The next day, Kya pulled up to Jumpin’s and found Mabel sweeping the wharf. She’d never seen anybody at Jumpin’s before besides the proprietor. Mabel told Kya that members of her community had offered to trade some of their used clothes and other supplies for her smoked fish. She took Kya’s measurements and told her to come back the next day.

When Kya arrived the next morning, Mabel wasn’t there, but Jumpin' showed her two boxes of supplies his community had put together. There were jeans, blouses, sneakers, kitchen supplies, pantry essentials, and vegetables. Kya thought these items were worth more than her measly smoked fish, but Jumpin' said it was a fair trade.

On the ride back to the shack, Kya pulled her boat over and dug out one of the blouses. It was clean and had a lace collar and satin bow. **She pulled the blouse on over her dirty overalls and headed home, one hand caressing the lace as she glided over the water.**

### A Mysterious Benefactor

**Kya turned fourteen in 1960, and although her body was becoming that of a woman, she still had the mind of a child.** She hadn’t learned what came after twenty-nine and still couldn’t read. Life had continued much in the same way. She still dug for mussels and smoked fish to sell to Jumpin’, and with Mabel’s help, she’d learned how to make a garden. One of the only bad things about going to Jumpin’s was that other people saw her there. She was exposed, as was the fact that she was alone.

A year before, Kya had been lying on her porch bed when she heard voices in the night. The voices came closer to the shack, and she recognized the sounds of teenage boys, maybe five, hollering in the surrounding brush. She’d jumped from bed and tried to run out of the house before they reached her, but she was too late. The flicker of lights was already visible.

Soon, the heavy thud of hands slapping the front porch shook her heart. Each slap felt like a stab inside her body. She crouched below the solid base of the porch wall and waited. Finally, **the boys ran away, cheering about surviving the wicked Marsh Girl, or Wolf Child, as some called her**.

Because of this experience, Kya was quick to hide after seeing a boy slipping through the shadows of her forest one day. Crouching in the trees, Kya wondered if it was one of the boys coming back for her. She waited until he was gone, then made her way home.

When Kya came upon an old stump in the clearing, she stopped. Sticking straight up from one of the stump veins was a black feather. To the untrained eye, the feather looked like an ordinary crow’s feather, but to Kya, who’d become an expert on marsh wildlife from years of observation, it was a feather from the eyebrow of a great blue heron, a rare find for even the most ardent collector.

The way the feather was positioned to stick straight up was a sign that someone had been there. Kya panicked and looked around. Had the boy put it there to distract her? Was he watching her now? She ran home and locked the door behind her.

When first light broke, Kya woke with a strong urge to see the feather. It was so exquisite. The feather was still sticking out of the stump, so she grabbed it and took it home.

The next morning, Kya went back to stump and found another feather standing upright. A laugh escaped her, a rare occurrence these days, as she pulled it free from the stump. The feather was white and belonged to a tropicbird. Normally, these birds didn’t exist in this part of the coast, and **she wondered how the boy had come across it and why he would give such a rare thing away**.

Kya took the feather home and opened one of Ma’s old guidebooks with pictures of birds and insects from the region. Although she couldn’t read the names, Kya had inherited Ma’s artistic skills, and she drew pictures of the birds or shells that matched her specimens on brown bags. She placed each collectible on its corresponding picture and placed them on the shelves.

Another week passed before Kya found another feather in the stump. This time, the feather, long and striped, was a tail feather from a wild turkey, one of Kya’s favorite birds. **She smiled and took the feather home, happy the game this boy was playing with her was still on.**

### Exciting Prospects

Kya figured she would have to reciprocate if the game were to continue. The day after finding the turkey feather, she laid a tail feather from a baby bald eagle on the stump and anchored it with a rock. That night, she lay in bed excited about the boy finding her feather. **Everyone in her life had abandoned her, but this boy was intentionally trying to make contact.** She assumed he was an alright boy. No one with this much knowledge or appreciation for birds could be bad.

Reinvigorated by the prospects of actual human contact, Kya cleaned the entire shack from top to bottom. As well as the shack, she cleaned herself up. In Ma’s drawer, she found a pair of scissors. Her hair hadn’t been cut since before Ma left seven years earlier. It was a long unruly tide of black hair down her back. She took the scissors and cut it to her shoulders. Then, she scrubbed the dirt from her hands and face and brushed her hair until it was silky.

When Kya went back to the stump, she saw not just another rare feather, but a milk carton containing vegetable seeds, a spark plug for her boat, and a note she couldn’t read. The boy had upped his ante, and she knew she had to do the same. **Kya went home and grabbed a beautiful swan feather, but when she went by the stump to leave it, she was surprised to find the boy waiting against a tree.**

At once, she recognized the boy as Tate, even aged as he was at eighteen years old. His golden curls were longer, his face tan and handsome. He was staring at her with bronze and green eyes, watching like a heron gazing at its prey. Kya felt the urge to run, but Tate called to her and told her not to be afraid. He couldn’t help but be taken aback by the sight of her. She had grown into a striking young woman.

Not only Tate’s words, but also a warm sensation inside kept Kya from running. She held out the swan feather, her movements slow. With equally slow movements, so as not to startle her, Tate took the feather. They stood in awkward silence for a long moment before Kya finally admitted she couldn’t read his note. Before he left, **Tate said he would teach her how to read**.

For the next few weeks, Tate taught Kya how to read sitting on a log near the beach. He brought old grammar books from school and worked with her on the alphabet. She learned to write each letter and make their sounds. Slowly and patiently (Tate was always so patient), she was able to form words and sound others out.

When she was finally able to read a whole sentence by herself, Kya beamed. **Not only could she now read, but she’d never known that words could be put together to create meaning.** The way she lit up made something inside Tate light up, as well.

Kya was also feeling something stir inside her for Tate. When they would sit close going over a lesson, she longed to grab his hand. She wanted to know more about him and his home life, but she was afraid to bring up the outside world, afraid he’d come to his senses about hanging out with swamp trash.

Shortly after Kya learned to read, she asked Tate what came after twenty-nine. She was finally going to get her answer. Tate helped her learn to count higher, showing her all the different numbers and groupings. He never made her feel stupid during any of those lessons.

With her new skills, Kya labeled her specimens with the proper names and read everything she could get her hands on. One night, she opened the old Bible and saw the names of all the family members and their birthdates written inside. **For the first time, Kya learned the names of her siblings, the date of her birth, and her full name: Catherine Danielle Clark.**

### Deep Undercover

One morning, when Kya pulled into Jumpin’s, she was surprised to see the usually upbeat and kind expression on his face twisted with concern. Jumpin' told her some men had been asking after her, questioning whether Pa was still around and if Kya went to school. He said he thought they were from social services. Kya panicked, but Jumpin' told her not to worry. He’d send them on their way if they came around again.

Kya went home distraught. Would they find her and force her to leave her home? Live with a foster family? The idea was unbearable. When Tate showed up later that day, she confided in him about her fears. **They decided to find a different place for their lessons, somewhere deep in the forest where the crawdads sing so no one could find them.**

Kya had stumbled across an old cabin off the beaten path during her explorations. It was only a one-room structure, and most of one side was caving in, but the remaining logs were sturdy enough to hold. Over the course of summer, Tate and Kya met at the cabin most of each week. They continued their lessons, and Kya’s reading was getting better each day.

No one had come out to the shack, where she still returned to sleep each night, but she always kept one ear open for the sounds of car tires on the dirt lane. Her money was still coming from digging mussels and smoking fish,**** but**now Tate delivered her goods to Jumpin' and brought her supplies to the shack so she wouldn’t be exposed.**

### A Life of Meaning

Once Kya’s reading got to a certain level, Tate introduced her to poetry. He read her some of his favorite poems that had touched him. Kya loved the way the words rhymed and sounded like waves hitting the sand. After that, **she started working on her own poems, reciting them allowed as she motored around the lagoons**. At home, she found Ma’s old book of poetry and read through the ones marked as favorites. Each poem spoke to Kya as though they were messages from Ma, especially the ones that spoke of sadness and longing for freedom.

Tate also brought Kya more difficult books and educational materials from school. Tate never acted like the books were too advanced for her, so Kya didn’t know to think of them as such. She slowly made her way through each, picking up more and more every time. She especially loved the biology textbook.

With the fear of social services behind them, Tate and Kya stayed close to the shack instead of going to the cabin for her lessons. The late months brought darkness earlier, and when it became too cold to sit by the water, Kya invited Tate inside the shack. **It was the first time anyone but Kya had been in the shack since Pa had left.** He examined her collection of feathers, bones, nests, and shells with awe.

Reading kept Kya company on all the days and nights Tate couldn’t come. Loneliness was something she’d grown used to before Tate, but now she felt his absence palpably. One night, she picked up a novel from Ma’s books. It was a love story: _Rebecca_ by Daphne du Maurier. When she finished reading for the night, she put on the one dress of Ma’s she still had and swished in front of the mirror. **She imagined she was the character from the book and Tate was her handsome love interest asking her to dance.**
