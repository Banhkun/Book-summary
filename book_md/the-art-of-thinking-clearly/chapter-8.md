## Chapter 8: You Struggle to Understand Probability and Predictions

The next set of fallacies we’ll cover revolves around probability and predictions. Dobelli reminds us that **people hate uncertainty, and he says that they try to predict future events to reduce that uncertainty.** However, to make accurate predictions, you must understand _probability_ , which humans struggle with.

Thus, people’s predictions are usually inaccurate, even those from experts who make predictions for a living. Yet, despite their inaccuracy, people still rely on predictions to make important decisions, leading to logical errors and financial loss.

(Shortform note: As Dobelli notes, even though humans struggle with probability and predictions are unreliable, people still make a living estimating probability and making predictions. This is authority bias: Because the person is seemingly an expert at making predictions, you assume they know what they're doing. However, no matter how knowledgeable the person, they’ll still struggle to process the information needed to make accurate predictions.)

In this chapter, we’ll look at the following reasons people misunderstand probability and make inaccurate predictions:

  * Neglect of probability
  * Hindsight bias



### Neglect of Probability

The first fallacy we’ll cover is neglect of probability. According to Dobelli, people struggle to make good decisions because **they neglect to consider the probability or risk involved in those decisions.** Logically, they should choose the option with the highest probability of going well for them and the lowest risk of going badly. However, people instead choose the option that will have the biggest positive impact on them if it occurs, regardless of how likely it is to occur. For example, Dobelli argues that people are more likely to invest in a risky stock that _could_ have a huge return on investment than a safe stock that has lower returns.

(Shortform note: Dobelli claims that investors frequently invest solely based on the possible yield of an investment, rather than its risk, and uses this example to prove the validity of his claims regarding neglect of probability. However, this example isn’t accurate: Investors use various risk management strategies when investing, including analyzing the historical value of the stock to determine the risk of its value changing in the future.)

> **Denominator Neglect**
> 
> A type of neglect that Dobelli doesn’t cover is denominator neglect, which Daniel Kahneman describes in _Thinking, Fast and Slow._ If probability is a fraction, with the situation you’re evaluating on top and the total number of possibilities on bottom, people base their judgment of risk solely on the top number, or numerator, and ignore the bottom number, or denominator. This means they regularly misinterpret probability, since the numerator depends on the denominator.
> 
> For example, if you only considered the numerators when comparing a 1/100 chance of injury and a 100/10,000 chance of injury, you’d misinterpret the second scenario as much more likely to occur, even though the probability of injury is actually the same.

### Hindsight Bias

Another probability-related fallacy is hindsight bias. Dobelli says **hindsight bias makes unpredictable past events seem like they should have been easily predictable:** People see an obvious pattern of circumstances that led to a past event occurring, and they think people should have noticed that pattern and predicted the event. At the time, though, the pattern wasn’t clear, so people _couldn’t_ use it to predict the event. It’s only with hindsight that the pattern becomes clear.

For example, take the sinking of the Titanic. Looking back, there’s a pattern leading to the disaster, including weak construction and little lifesaving equipment. At the time, however, the pattern wasn’t clear. The construction seemed standard because no one anticipated extreme collisions, and the ship lacked equipment because the officer with the key to the storage room transferred off the ship. On top of these human influences, bad weather made conditions more dangerous. Thus, chance played a major role in the disaster. The “obvious” pattern of events people point to today is an example of hindsight bias.

**Hindsight bias encourages overconfidence** , Dobelli says. You think you’re good at detecting patterns when really, you’re not: You’re only seeing them because of hindsight. When you try to apply these pattern-spotting “skills” to predicting the future, you fail. (Shortform note: This overconfidence is dangerous when your inaccurate predictions affect your livelihood. For example, you might think you see successful patterns and invest in a company that fails. Because you were overconfident, you didn’t notice any warning signs that the investment wouldn’t work out.)

To avoid overconfidence, Dobelli recommends **journaling your expectations and comparing them to reality.** Because your expectations will often be incorrect, having a record of them forces you to accept your own inaccuracy. (Shortform note: Journaling also forces you to accept _uncertainty_ by making you realize that you can’t really predict things. The more accepting you are of uncertainty, the less hindsight bias affects you.)

> **Hindsight Bias and Memory**
> 
> Dobelli credits hindsight bias to people’s pattern-finding tendencies, but memory plays an important role in this fallacy as well. Hindsight bias changes your memories, making you think you always knew what was going to happen.
> 
> Your brain can alter your memories because of how it handles predictions: When shown two possibilities, your brain creates reasons why both are possible. Once Possibility A occurs, your brain doesn’t need to remember Possibility B. It forgets that information, making you believe Possibility A was obvious all along.
> 
> This altered memory also creates overconfidence. You forget any prior uncertainty or incorrect predictions, which reinforces your overconfidence about your pattern-finding and prediction abilities.
