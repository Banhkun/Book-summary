## Chapter 11: Miscellaneous Non-Evolutionary Fallacies

Now that we’ve looked at the major types of non-evolutionary fallacies, we’ll look at the following final miscellaneous fallacies:

  * Confirmation bias
  * Omission bias
  * Alternative bias
  * Incentive manipulation
  * Planning fallacy



### Confirmation Bias

When you suffer from confirmation bias, **you retain information that reinforces your underlying beliefs or desired conclusions while ignoring contradicting evidence.** Everyone has a tendency toward confirmation bias, Dobelli warns.

(Shortform note: Here, Dobelli references both underlying beliefs and desired conclusions. While confirmation bias can reinforce both, your underlying beliefs ultimately overpower your desires. For example, an anxious individual might _desire_ confidence in their friends, but they _believe_ their friends dislike them. Their confirmation bias takes neutral interactions and uses them as evidence to reinforce this belief, ignoring their desire.)

Some people manipulate others’ natural tendency toward confirmation bias, Dobelli adds. Fortune tellers, for example, give vague statements, trusting that your confirmation bias will latch onto the most fitting interpretation and reinforce your belief. (Shortform note: Avoid this manipulation by evaluating your sources’ reputation and whether they benefit from reinforcing your beliefs—fortune tellers earn money by making you believe their abilities, for example.)

Dobelli recommends avoiding confirmation bias by writing down your beliefs and finding evidence that disproves those beliefs. (Shortform note: Others are more specific, suggesting finding a minimum of four arguments against your position. These arguments must be _convincing_ : Using weak arguments is falling for confirmation bias, not combating it.)

### Omission Bias

Another non-evolutionary fallacy is omission bias: **When both acting and not acting have negative results, you’re prone to not acting.** This bias causes problems when acting could at least mitigate the negative results, Dobelli explains. In other words, both Option A (active) and Option P (passive) cause negative result X to occur. Even though taking Option A means X will be less serious, you’ll choose Option P because of omission bias.

For example, if Option A was "act to close a school" and Option P was "passively let the school slowly fail," many would choose Option P. This is illogical, as letting the school fail is a waste of time and money, the school’s educational standards will drop over time, and the students will probably suffer more than if you closed the school. If you took Option A, while the students would temporarily be stressed and their education disrupted, they’d quickly find a new school, likely one with no chance of closing and more consistent educational standards.

> **Omission Bias and Morality**
> 
> Why does omission bias occur? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others argue it’s because you feel guilty when your action causes negative results, but less guilty when your inaction causes negative results. Your brain alleviates mental strain by generalizing moral questions: Instead of having to assess the morality of every action and inaction, you classify inaction as better than action, making your decisions easier and alleviating guilt.
> 
> However, this heuristic is flawed because sometimes, inaction is worse than action. In fact, several major religions reject the idea that inaction is better than action. For example, Catholicism believes that failing to act necessitates forgiveness, and Buddhism says that sometimes even violent action is morally superior to inaction.

### Alternative Bias

Alternative bias is another non-evolutionary fallacy: **People hone in on two options—where Option A is “standard” and Option B is terrible—to the exclusion of every other option.** This bias can manipulate you to follow other people’s plans, Dobelli explains. It makes Option A seem like your only choice, when a different option could actually suit you better.

To counter alternative bias, Dobelli recommends **looking at underrepresented options.** Often, a more moderate third option may fit your situation better than the extremes of Options A and B.

For example, many people feel pressured to attend college. The situation is presented as Option A: Go to college and get a good job, vs. Option B: Don’t go to college and don’t get a good job. However, there are other options, including Option C: Go to trade school and get a good job, or Option D: Complete an apprenticeship and get a good job. Option A is considered “standard”, but high tuition can make college a hindrance rather than a help. **Looking at the underrepresented options can provide a more fulfilling and profitable experience than falling for alternative bias.**

> **Overcoming Alternative Bias Through Perspective**
> 
> Dobelli presents the solution to alternative bias as needing to expand your horizons and look to less conventional options. However, others argue that looking at more options isn’t enough to combat the bias. You can feel just as trapped choosing between three or four options as two, they point out.
> 
> To overcome this bias, instead of merely increasing the number of options available to you, consider both broadening your horizons _and_ changing your perspective to assess each option logically. Here are a few ways to change your perspective:
> 
>   * **Consider what you have.** For instance, Option A: College assumes you can afford tuition. Challenge those assumptions; see where you stand and how that affects your choice.
> 
>   * **Consider the gains and losses.** A loss in one option (for instance, trade school doesn’t have great job mobility) may be a gain in the other (college degrees provide greater job mobility).
> 
>   * **Consider what’s most important to you.** All decisions are somewhat uncertain. Determine what’s important enough that it must be certain, and consider that first when deciding.
>

### Incentive Manipulation

Another miscellaneous non-evolutionary fallacy is what Dobelli calls “incentive super-response theory,” but that we’ll call incentive manipulation for simplicity. People offer incentives to inspire hard work or better cooperation, Dobelli says. However, they don’t always consider the unintended consequences of incentives: Others will work hard for incentives, but they’ll also strive for those incentives however suits them best, even if their actions contradict the principle behind the incentive. Thus,**the people setting the incentives can hurt their own cause if they’re not careful.**

For example, a mother tells her son that when he cleans up his toys, he can have a cookie. She wants to encourage responsible behavior and sees the cookie as a reward that will encourage that responsible behavior. However, the son doesn’t care about learning responsibility: He just wants more cookies. Thus, the son manipulates the situation and makes more messes so that he can tidy up more often and earn more cookies, contradicting his mother’s original goal of teaching responsibility. **The mother’s incentive didn’t consider the potential for manipulation, so it ultimately harmed her attempts at teaching responsibility.**

> **Forming Good Incentives**
> 
> How can you avoid manipulation and set effective incentives? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others suggest that effective incentives use the other people’s intrinsic motivation. Having intrinsic motivation means you do things because they’re personally rewarding, in contrast to having extrinsic motivation, which means you do things because of an outside incentive.
> 
> Here are some tips for using people’s intrinsic motivation in incentives:
> 
> **1\. Give them tasks they’re passionate about.** The extrinsic motivation of an incentive can encourage people to work on tasks they dislike, but this leads to burnout and loses effectiveness over time. On the other hand, the intrinsic motivation of a task someone’s passionate about is fulfilling and long-lasting.
> 
> **2\. Provide positive feedback**. Positive feedback encourages people and increases their pride in their tasks, which in turn increases intrinsic motivation.
> 
> **3\. Give them tools to complete their tasks.** The more prepared people are for a task, the more confident and willing they are to complete that task, improving intrinsic motivation.
> 
> For our example, the mother might make her son more excited about cleaning by turning it into a game, providing plenty of praise, and making sure he knows where everything belongs. If she encourages this intrinsic motivation, she soon won’t have to provide any incentives at all, as her son will clean his toys unprompted.

### Planning Fallacy

Finally, we’ll cover the planning fallacy: **People make plans that fail because they believe themselves to be more capable than they really are.** They overestimate the benefits of their actions and minimize the risk and cost involved in their plans, Dobelli says. (Shortform note: Dobelli’s definition of the planning fallacy is unique because he includes factors like risk and cost in this overconfidence. In contrast, most definitions only include people’s overconfidence in estimating the time required to execute a plan.)

People never get better at realistic planning, Dobelli adds. One of the reasons you don’t improve is self-esteem: You want to feel good about yourself, so you exaggerate your abilities. (Shortform note: Basing self-esteem on your abilities means you’ll exaggerate when you need a boost, but you’ll feel worse when you struggle to meet those exaggerated standards. Instead, boost your self-esteem healthily by challenging self-criticism and forming relationships with positive people.)

Another reason you don’t improve at planning is life’s unpredictability. **You can’t account for surprise events** like bad weather or car accidents when planning. (Shortform note: Surprise events are called "Black Swans," and they can be positive or negative. While you can’t predict Black Swans, in _The Black Swan_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb says you can prepare for them by managing risk and maximizing your chances of positive Black Swans. When making an investment, for example, minimize risk for 90% of the investment, then take high risks with the remaining 10% to increase your chance of a positive Black Swan.)

Dobelli recommends mitigating the planning fallacy by estimating risks and costs higher than feels necessary and benefits lower than feels necessary. Also, **avoid the impulse to plan in detail. Narrowing your focus on details makes you more likely to be surprised by unexpected events, exacerbating the fallacy.** (Shortform note: Dobelli claims detailed planning exacerbates the planning fallacy, but others disagree. People are better at planning for small goals, so breaking a big project into its composite parts makes plans more accurate. In addition, setting intentions like the location and timescale in which to complete goals increases planning accuracy.)
