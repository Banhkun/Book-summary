## Chapter 2: You Pay Attention to the Wrong Things

Now that we've covered biases relating to humanity’s desire to fit in, we’ll examine the next set of evolutionary fallacies: those in which you pay attention to the wrong things.**Humans have evolved to pay attention to the most memorable or flashy information that comes up, rather than the most pertinent or helpful,** Dobelli explains. The more conspicuous and repeated a piece of information is, the more you’ll believe it.

(Shortform note: The brain has arguably evolved to do this for reasons of efficiency. Your brain rapidly stores information, and it takes it less time and energy to accept the flashiest information available than to evaluate the entire situation. This is especially true in the modern day, when you’re constantly bombarded with information from, for instance, social media.)

In this chapter, we’ll cover the following fallacies:

  * The salience effect
  * Story bias
  * Survivorship bias
  * False knowledge
  * The feature-positive effect
  * The illusion of attention



### The Salience Effect

The first attention-affecting fallacy we’ll look at is the salience effect. Dobelli notes that **your brain latches onto unusual or notable factors of a situation and gives these factors too much credit for causing the situation.** (Shortform note: The salience effect relies on your past experiences. You might notice certain unusual details due to, for instance, your career or past experiences, while someone else would notice different details.)

**Popular attention influences which factors the salience effect focuses on,** Dobelli adds. For example, many people talk about the importance of going to college to get a good job. If you meet a person whose business failed and they don’t have a college degree, your mind will latch onto that salient factor because it's at the forefront of your mind, and you’ll attribute the failed business to the person’s lack of a college degree. Meanwhile, the owner’s education might have had no impact on the failure of the business.

(Shortform note: Businesses try to draw popular attention to their products by standing out among their competitors. This is increasingly difficult as advertisements infiltrate all of modern life and people become adept at ignoring them. However, there’s a form of popular attention that is very common in modern life: star reviews. Whether it’s movies, restaurants, or an online purchase, people rely on this modern version of word of mouth when making decisions.)

Dobelli recommends avoiding the salience effect by **ignoring the easiest or most obvious information and looking for the less flashy causes behind situations.**

> **How to Overcome the Salience Effect**
> 
> Dobelli’s suggestion to look for the less obvious causes behind situations can be difficult to put into action, since you’re competing directly _against_ the powerful salience effect. Here are a few tips to make this easier:
> 
> **1\. Look for the less obvious causes** of a situation by asking a lot of “why”s, slowing down to consider the answers to these “why”s, and being critical about how much you really understand about the potential causes.
> 
> **2**. **Surround yourself with people from diverse backgrounds.** As discussed, past experience determines which facts you focus on. Knowing people who can bring different experiences to a situation means you can combine your assessments to see the whole picture.
> 
> **3.** **Provide real-time feedback.** If you want to combat the salient traits you initially notice, provide other salient information: For instance, focus on the possible consequences of your decision as you’re making it. If you’re buying a car, seeing how fuel costs affect your budget can help you look past the impressive paint job.

### Story Bias

Story bias is another attention-affecting fallacy: **People prefer entertaining fiction to boring facts** , Dobelli explains. Sometimes, this means following an interesting, story-based tangent while ignoring the central, factual issue; other times, it means incorrectly assigning a story and meaning to random events. (Shortform note: Why do we do this? Possibly because stories activate your brain’s sensory processing center. When your sensory center activates, it gives you a shot of oxytocin, which generates positive feelings of compassion, empathy, and trust. Meanwhile, facts activate the data processing center, which doesn’t provide this boost in positive feelings.)

**Stories are easier to remember than other types of information** , Dobelli adds, which is why we rely on them instead of facts. Humans have told stories to each other for entertainment and to explain life for millions of years, so our brains are wired to identify and store them.

How can you overcome story bias? Dobelli suggests picking stories apart rather than blindly consuming and accepting them: **Consider the story-teller’s intentions and what they might be hiding.** (Shortform note: In addition, be cautious about what kind of stories you consume. The stronger and more convenient the narrative, the more suspicious you should be of it, because strong narratives can distract from logical gaps in a person’s statement.)

> **The Psychology of Story Bias**
> 
> Why do people remember stories better than facts? Dobelli suggests an evolutionary explanation, but others argue it’s because humans naturally compress and consolidate information to make it more manageable. Your senses provide too much information to process, and to handle this workload, you simplify the information by creating relationships or patterns—in other words, stories. This is why songs are helpful memorization tools and smells can trigger memory: You remember things as a compressed, connected unit, rather than separate pieces of information.
> 
> While this compression is an important tool that allows your brain to function, it presents a problem. Any information that disturbs your attempt at compression because it doesn’t fit a pattern makes it harder for your brain to work, so when compressing, you discard any facts that don’t fit the story, and may thus fail to retain important information.

### Survivorship Bias

Next, let’s discuss survivorship bias: **the belief that you have a better chance of succeeding than you actually do because success stories are more widely publicized than failures.** Widely publicized information is easier to access, triggering the salience effect discussed above, Dobelli says: You _latch on to_ this information when making judgments about your chance of success, ignoring the many invisible stories of failure.

Survivorship bias is found in most fields, especially those in which success brings fame. For example, you might see seemingly inexperienced teenagers competing in the Olympics and therefore think it’s easy to qualify for the team. Meanwhile, the vast majority of athletes never qualify.

Survivorship bias doesn’t just affect people trying to succeed, Dobelli notes. When you’ve _already_ succeeded, **you’re more likely to attribute your success to traits you share with other successful people,** ignoring that those same traits can be found in many of the people who failed.

How can you avoid survivorship bias? Dobelli says to research statistics and examples of failure in the field you’re considering. This’ll give you a better idea of your chances of success. (Shortform note: Start your research by asking “What am I missing?” and looking for holes in your data. In addition, be careful when researching: If your sources are incomplete or suffering from survivorship bias themselves, they won’t help you ascertain reality.)

> **Survivorship Bias and Story Bias**
> 
> Dobelli attributes survivorship bias to how easy attaining information about success is, especially when success leads to fame. However, research suggests a deeper reason for this bias: humanity’s desire for storytelling, as discussed in the last section. You want a satisfying, logical narrative that explains how people found success so you can do the same. To create this narrative, you ignore the probability of failure, only taking information about success into account. You search for concrete explanations for other people’s success, even though success is often determined by luck.
> 
> This also explains why survivorship bias affects you even when you’ve achieved success: Your desire for a story (this time about how you succeeded) doesn’t change. In addition, self-serving bias plays a role: When good things happen, you credit _yourself_ for it. Your brain doesn’t want to credit your success to chance, and that, combined with your desire for story, pushes you toward perpetuating survivorship bias by attributing success to certain traits you share with other successful people.

### False Knowledge

Next, we’ll discuss the false knowledge fallacy. According to Dobelli, while real knowledge belongs to experts who work for their understanding, **false knowledge belongs to people who don’t know what they’re talking about but make it look like they do.**

TV hosts frequently use false knowledge, Dobelli says, as they simply read information others have gathered from scripts. However, because they’re the figurehead providing the information to the audience, they receive a high level of trust and respect. Rather than looking for the actual experts behind the knowledge, the audience attributes the knowledge to the person in front of them. This is dangerous because the hosts can exploit this unearned trust: They can share incorrect or harmful information that inspires bad decisions.

(Shortform note: While false knowledge can still fool viewers into trusting TV hosts, it’s a much less common phenomenon in recent years. Trust in news reporters hit an all-time low in 2015, and while it’s slowly increasing again, it still hasn’t fully recovered. This trust disappeared because the public realized that TV hosts not only use false knowledge but also blur the lines between fact, opinion, and entertainment.)

It’s easy to fall into sharing false knowledge yourself, Dobelli warns. **People overestimate their knowledge and expertise.** To avoid this, examine your knowledge honestly and draw a hard line between what you really do know and what you’re not sure about. If you couldn’t discuss the subject easily and factually with another expert, be careful discussing it at all.

> **False Knowledge: Information vs. Wisdom**
> 
> Dobelli treats false and real knowledge as polar opposites, but knowledge is arguably more of a sliding scale. Some people claim that there are four stages of knowledge:
> 
>   * **Information**. This stage is the same as Dobelli’s false knowledge: You have some information, but that information isn't being internalized or examined.
> 
>   * **Knowledge**. In this stage, you have a basic understanding of the information and can use it helpfully.
> 
>   * **Insight**. In this stage, you deeply understand the information and can work with it creatively to problem solve.
> 
>   * **Wisdom**. This stage is the same as Dobelli’s real knowledge: Information, knowledge, and insight come together with experience to provide overarching understanding.
> 
> 

> 
> While wisdom has never been easy to attain, in the internet age, it’s becoming even rarer. People consider themselves experts because they have easy access to information, but they never gain a deeper understanding of it. Furthermore, basic information lends itself to flashy graphs and shocking numbers, letting people rile up their social media followers without understanding the deeper meaning of the information they share.
> 
> Taylor’s advice for avoiding this trap echoes Dobelli’s: Before considering yourself an expert, look at the stages of knowledge. Only when you’ve reached the insight or wisdom stages can you be confident in your understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid to admit when you don’t know something: Doing so encourages your curiosity and lets you see the situation in new ways.

### The Feature-Positive Effect

Another attention-affecting fallacy is the feature-positive effect. Because you pay attention to the most flashy or ostentatious information around you, **you’re terrible at noticing when things _aren’t_ present,** Dobelli says. For example, if you’re distracted by being late for work, you might not notice your phone isn’t in your pocket. (Shortform note: The exception is when you’re an expert in your field. Experts notice excluded information based on past experience of similar situations, while novices and moderately knowledgeable individuals don’t.)

According to Dobelli, realizing this tendency can help you give better advice. **People better accept and implement advice that is framed in a positive way than a negative way.** This doesn’t just mean “positive” in terms of constructive: It means telling someone to do something is more effective than telling them to stop doing something. For example, “Eat more vegetables” is more effective advice than “Stop eating sugar” because the inclusion of one food group is easier for your brain to process than the absence of another.

> **Positive vs. Constructive Feedback**
> 
> Dobelli’s definition of positive feedback is unique. Most people define it as complimenting someone, but Dobelli defines it as discussing things that _should_ be done, rather than things that _shouldn’t_ be done.
> 
> Interestingly, constructive criticism is often (although not always) positive in the way Dobelli defines: Good constructive criticism is specific and actionable, which lends itself to describing what _should_ be done. To illustrate this, let’s look at an example of non-constructive, negative feedback and an example of constructive, positive feedback:
> 
> “Stop dragging your heels with the filing” isn't specific because it uses a metaphor, rather than describing a specific behavior. It’s not actionable because no specific action has been outlined, and it’s not positive because it tells you to _stop_ doing something rather than telling you to do something.
> 
> On the other hand, “Only reply to your emails in the morning so you can file five cases a day” is specific because it gives a particular behavior (replying to emails) and a reason for implementing it (so you can file five cases a day). It’s actionable because it provides a specific action (replying in the morning), and it’s positive because it talks about what should be done.

### The Illusion of Attention

The final attention-affecting fallacy we’ll look at is the illusion of attention. Dobelli says the illusion of attention means **humans tend to zone into specific elements of a situation, focusing only on the details they deem important**. Once in this focused state, you might not notice even obvious distractions: Your brain filters them out, deeming them less important.

However, the biggest problem with the illusion of attention is that **you believe your observation skills are great,** Dobelli argues. Because your brain doesn’t retain any information about “unimportant” observations, you think you’re noticing everything in your area and overestimate your abilities. This overconfidence means you don’t question your true abilities or challenge yourself to notice more.

The illusion of attention isn't a problem when you’re focusing on one activity and the rest of your surroundings continue as usual, such as reading a book while walking in a familiar area. In this case, your attention can split to handle the tasks of reading and walking, Dobelli explains.

However, **once an unusual event is introduced, your brain can’t handle all its tasks at once and starts to make mistakes due to your overconfidence** , Dobelli says. For example, if your dog walked in front of you as you’re reading, you might step on its tail. Because you believe your observation skills are stronger than they are, you aren’t careful enough to avoid stepping on it.

> **Why the Illusion of Attention Occurs and How to Combat It**
> 
> The illusion of attention occurs because your brain has a limited amount of sensory information it can process, called cognitive capacity. Once you’ve reached cognitive capacity, your brain can’t accept new information, even if the information is obvious or important. This inability to process is called **inattentional blindness.**
> 
> The senses most strongly connected to inattentional blindness are sight and sound: These senses take in so much information that they easily overpower your cognitive capacity. This is why you turn down your music when searching for a street: Your brain could handle the tasks of driving and listening to music, but adding the effort of hunting for a street pushes you over cognitive capacity, and you must lessen one sensory input to process another.
> 
> However, most of the time, you don’t realize you need to lessen one sensory input to process another. This is because, as noted above, your brain _filters out_ the new input: Its lack of cognitive capacity means it doesn’t notice the new input at all. Because you don’t realize that information didn’t register, you become overconfident in your observational abilities, thinking you caught everything. The only way to combat this overconfidence is to realize how much you don’t notice by getting other people’s input on situations and challenging your expectations and assumptions.
