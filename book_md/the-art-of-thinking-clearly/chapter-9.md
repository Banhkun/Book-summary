## Chapter 9: You Value Things for Arbitrary Reasons

In this chapter, we’ll cover fallacies that affect how you value things. According to Dobelli, **humans tend to value a person, situation, or item for arbitrary and illogical reasons.** We’ll look at the following arbitrary standards of value:

  * The endowment effect
  * Liking bias
  * The sunk cost fallacy
  * The contrast effect



### The Endowment Effect

The endowment effect is the first illogical shift in your valuation of an item. When you own an item, **you subconsciously increase its value simply because it's yours,** Dobelli explains. (Shortform note: Dobelli doesn’t explain why the endowment effect occurs, but others argue that it stems from loss aversion, discussed in Chapter 5. Once something is in your possession, you fear losing it, which makes you value the item more.)

The endowment effect makes buying and selling things difficult, Dobelli adds, because you inflate the value of an item to be higher than others value it. You’ll even turn down generous offers for the item because you’ve mistakenly increased its value so much.

The endowment effect also influences people who don’t own an item yet, Dobelli says. **Even the anticipation of owning an item can make you subconsciously increase its value** , especially if you’re in competition for the item. (Shortform note: This tendency is called “virtual ownership.” It’s manipulated through advertisements, which let you _imagine_ ownership of an item by showing you what it’s like to own it, and trial periods, which let you own an item for a limited time.)

How can you overcome the endowment effect? Dobelli suggests **thinking of your possessions as things you only have temporarily.** This lessens your sentimental attachment to the items.

> **Overcoming the Endowment Effect: Think Like a Vendor?**
> 
> While Dobelli believes the endowment effect influences anyone who owns an item, others argue that it only activates when you’re going to use the item. If you have an item for the sole purpose of exchanging it, the endowment effect doesn’t apply. This is how vendors are immune to the endowment effect and can sell goods at fair prices.
> 
> Since accurately valuing and selling items is difficult only when they’re personal items, if you avoid attachment by viewing your belongings like a vendor views their stock, you’ll have a more accurate idea of their value. However, avoiding connection to items in this way may harm your well-being. Valued belongings become an extension of your identity and a way to express your personality, and preventing those connections from forming can make you feel stifled and unable to be yourself.

### Liking Bias

Liking bias also affects how you value _people_ , specifically. **The more you like someone, the more value you put on their opinions and desires,** Dobelli says. This means you’re more likely to do something for an individual you like.

This bias is frequently exploited in marketing. According to Dobelli, there are three main components to liking someone that are manipulated in marketing:

**1\. Physical attractiveness.** You’re more likely to see attractive people as likable, which is why only attractive people appear in advertisements. (Shortform note: Attractiveness is subconsciously associated with good traits like kindness and generosity, which is why you’re more prone to like attractive people. However, the definition of “attractive” changes over time, meaning this subconscious standard of goodness—and the advertisements that take advantage of it—change just as quickly.)

**2\. Similarity.** You find people who look, sound, or have experiences like you more likable. Marketers manipulate this through “mirroring”: purposefully mimicking other people’s behavior and speech patterns so the other person will like them and be more likely to purchase their products. (Shortform note: Mirroring might be manipulated by marketers, but it’s also used by minorities. For instance, black people often feel pressured to mirror their white counterparts to avoid prejudice. Studies show that minorities who change the way they speak, how they wear their hair, and sometimes even their name to fit in with their white counterparts are viewed as more professional and likable.)

**3\. They already like you.** If someone is being friendly and makes it clear that they like you, you’re more likely to like them back. Marketers manipulate this tendency through flattery. (Shortform: It’s important to recognize when you’re being flattered because flattery’s goal is to control your behavior, _not_ give you an honest compliment. You can identify flattery by paying attention to the circumstances in which someone compliments you. Do they only compliment you when they want something or when they know you can hear them? If so, they’re probably using flattery. Lessen flattery’s control over you by weighing the sincerity of someone’s compliments rather than how they make you feel.)

Dobelli suggests avoiding liking bias by **separating the seller from the product.** Would you purchase the product if the person selling it to you wasn’t there, or if they were unlikeable?

> **Liking Bias and Alliances**
> 
> While Dobelli explains how people manipulate liking bias, he doesn’t say _why_ liking someone makes you value them more. Some experts say it’s because when you like someone, you form an alliance with them. Having a common goal (friendship) unites you and the other person, making you more likely to value them and, as Dobelli says, fulfill their desires.
> 
> The three methods Dobelli discusses all manipulate liking bias with the goal of forming alliances: Physical attractiveness is associated with goodness, as discussed above, and you want to form alliances with attractive, “good” people. Similarity takes advantage of you already being in one alliance with the other person—whether preferring the same sports team, being a member of the same race, or coming from the same city—to encourage you to form a different alliance with them. Flattery emphasizes that the other person wants to be in _your_ group, rather than making you join theirs, giving you a self-esteem boost and making you more likely to agree to the alliance.
> 
> Finally, Dobelli’s advice to avoid liking bias also operates on the alliance principle: Separating the seller from the product breaks the alliance.

### The Sunk Cost Fallacy

Another error in thinking that affects how you value things is the sunk cost fallacy. According to Dobelli, **the more time, effort, or resources you invest in something, the higher you value that thing.** You'll also be more resistant to parting with it, even if keeping it means losing more time, effort, or resources in the future. (Shortform note: The sunk cost fallacy stems from a fear of waste: Most people try not to waste time, money, or effort, and letting go of something you’ve invested resources in feels like wasting those resources. While this is technically true—it _is_ a waste of time, money, or effort—continuing to invest resources only creates more waste.)

People fall into the sunk cost fallacy because they don’t like admitting when they’re wrong, Dobelli adds. When they’ve invested resources into something that starts failing, **people hold tighter to that thing instead of admitting their mistake** ,**hoping the situation will improve and justify their decision.**

(Shortform note: People want to justify their decisions because they’re afraid their mistake could define their life. However, the opposite is true: If you accept your mistake, cut your losses, and move on, your mistake will be forgotten as you move forward and make better decisions. On the other hand, clinging to a mistake lets it define you.)

Dobelli suggests overcoming the sunk cost fallacy by **focusing on whether something is serving you in the present and will continue to do so in the future, rather than on what you’ve invested in the past.** (Shortform note: This doesn’t mean ignoring the past entirely: It specifically refers to ignoring past _investment._ In other words, consider the past to make good decisions about the future based on all the data you’ve collected, but don’t let past effort stop you from moving on.)

### The Contrast Effect

The contrast effect is another fallacy that changes how you value things. Humans aren’t good at objective judgments, Dobelli says, so **when something is presented as the better of two options, you see it as more valuable** than if it's presented alone.

For example, a salesperson shows you two TVs: one that’s $1,000 over your budget, while the other is $500 over your budget. The cheaper TV isn't a good deal on its own because it’s still over your budget, but it’s a good deal _in comparison_ to the more expensive option. Thus, instead of looking for a TV within your budget, you’ll probably accept the one that’s $500 over budget.

> **The Contrast Effect as a Heuristic**
> 
> Why do people fall for the contrast effect? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others argue that it’s because the contrast effect is a heuristic: It helps you make judgments faster while expending less energy. Your brain lessens energy usage whenever possible, so it prioritizes swift judgments between two options, even if those options aren’t the best available.
> 
> In fact, your brain prioritizes swift comparison so much that when choosing between two items that are similar and a third that’s different, your brain dismisses the third option because it’s not comparable. Salespeople can manipulate this tendency, as well. Returning to our example, if the salesperson wants you to purchase a flatscreen but you’re considering a projector as an alternative, they’ll show you Flatscreen A, Flatscreen B, and Projector. Because Flatscreen A and B are similar and thus comparable, your brain dismisses Projector as an option, guiding you to the salesperson’s goal.
