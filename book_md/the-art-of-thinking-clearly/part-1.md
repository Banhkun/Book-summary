## Part 1: Evolutionary Fallacies | Chapter 1: You Want to Belong to the Group

In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli explores 99 common fallacies that inhibit logical thinking. He explains how these fallacies form and how they can negatively affect your daily decision-making.

Dobelli warns that his book isn't a step-by-step guide to logical thinking. Rather, he takes the “via negativa” approach, explaining what _prevents_ you from thinking logically. If you’re aware of your illogical tendencies, you can work around them and make good decisions.

In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll cover evolutionary fallacies: traits stemming from humanity’s past as hunter-gatherers. In Part 2, we’ll cover non-evolutionary fallacies: traits stemming from other sources.

### What Are Evolutionary Fallacies?

According to Dobelli,**evolutionary fallacies are errors in thinking that occur because of the way humans’ brains evolved over millions of years**. Through evolution, humans’ thought processes were optimized for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. As we’ll see, in the modern industrialized world, these lingering thought patterns become pitfalls rather than benefits.

> **Evolutionary Psychology: How It Works and Why You’re Not Evolving Anymore**
> 
> Dobelli’s explanation of logical fallacies here uses evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology theorizes that creatures’ traits are determined by natural selection, where individuals with maladaptive traits die and leave the gene pool. Meanwhile, those with helpful traits survive and reproduce, passing their genes on. These helpful traits strengthen over time, and new traits are introduced from genetic mutations. This process led to thought patterns useful for hunter-gatherers persisting through millions of years of humanity.
> 
> But we’re not hunter-gatherers any more, so shouldn’t humans still be evolving to better fit their modern environment? Why do these logical fallacies persist if natural selection exists? There are three reasons:
> 
>   * **Humanity is too spread out.** When humans lived in small groups, beneficial genetic mutations could gradually expand through the group and then beyond. In the modern world, the human race is too large and spread out for genetic mutations to easily spread.
> 
>   * **There’s a lack of environmental pressure.** While global warming affects weather patterns, it isn’t extreme enough to trigger evolution. If a global disaster struck that drastically and permanently changed the weather or food supply, natural selection would become relevant again as humans would be forced to evolve to survive.
> 
>   * **It hasn’t been long enough for us to evolve again.** Humans were hunter-gatherers for almost 4 million years. It’s only been about 10,000 years since the invention of agriculture, let alone the industrial revolution. Thus, human brains have not had time to evolve further.

### You Want to Belong to the Group

Dobelli states that **one of the evolutionary traits that most influences you is the desire to be in a group.** For early humans, group membership was necessary for survival. Those who left the group died, while those who stuck to the status quo survived and reproduced. Thus, your brain is genetically wired to fit in.

(Shortform note: This may have been the original evolutionary reason to be in a group, but are there any other, modern reasons? Psychology suggests that as the protection groups offered became less important as human society evolved, other needs became more important: Group membership exposes you to others’ experiences and life skills and helps you develop empathy and a sense of self-worth.)

This desire for community causes problems in the modern world. In this chapter, we’ll cover the following fallacies resulting from a need to belong:

  * Social proof
  * Authority bias
  * The nonsense distraction
  * Fundamental attribution error
  * In-group, out-group bias
  * Reciprocity
  * Social comparison bias
  * Social loafing



### Social Proof

Social proof is an example of group instinct. **To fit in, you copy other people’s behavior and judge that behavior according to the number of people participating in it.** The more people participating, the “better” you judge the action, Dobelli says. This effect influences you at all times.

(Shortform note: While Dobelli describes social proof as constantly influencing you, others argue that it only works when you’re uncertain: If you know what to do, you don’t need other people’s guidance.)

This tendency was helpful in the past as it aided survival: If everyone else was building shelters and looking for firewood, you knew bad weather was coming and could prepare, Dobelli says. If everyone else ran away, you ran too because there was probably a predator nearby.

In modern times, though, your decisions don’t always fall into the dichotomy of “follow the group and live” or “leave the group and die,” Dobelli adds. **Modern humans have more physical security, so decisions revolve around more nuanced issues** like being happy. In these instances, following the group can lead you astray. For example, if everyone else pursues an office career, your brain assumes it’s safer and wants to do the same, no matter how miserable such a job might make you.

(Shortform note: As Dobelli notes, most people aren’t faced with the live-or-die dichotomy today, yet social proof and its negative consequences persist. Why? In the absence of external threats, your brain sees rejection as a danger. This fear of rejection leads you to people-please, hide your personality, and try to fit in by following the group.)

> **Social Proof: Collectivist vs. Individualistic Cultures**
> 
> The culture you come from—collectivist or individualistic —possibly influences how susceptible you are to social proof. Collectivist cultures focus on group membership: You’re defined by your group and your desires come second to the group’s. Individualistic cultures, on the other hand, focus on the individual: You’re defined by personal autonomy and focus on your own goals.
> 
> In one study, individuals from collectivist cultures were more susceptible to social proof, while those from individualistic cultures acted more in line with their past decisions. However, more research showed that susceptibility to social proof depended more on having a _personal_ collectivist or individualistic mindset than on a person’s overarching culture. While the culture you’re raised in affects your mindset and susceptibility to social proof, it can’t completely predict it.

### Authority Bias

Authority bias is another fallacy related to social proof, Dobelli says. However, **rather than being pressured by a group, you’re pressured by an authority.** An authority is anyone with power over you, whether through knowledge (they’re more knowledgeable than you) or political or social power. (Shortform note: This authority doesn’t have to be applicable to the situation. As long as you view the person as an authority in one field (say, a politician being an authority in government), you’ll listen to their advice or opinions in other fields too (such as medicine). This is because you attribute their authority to them _as a person_ rather than to their field of expertise.)

**Authority bias convinces you to act in ways you otherwise wouldn’t through respect or fear** , Dobelli explains. You assume that the authority must be right because of their position of power, or you’re afraid to disobey them because of that power. (Shortform note: In addition, you’re trained throughout your life to obey authorities. You form a “heuristic,” or a shortcut in thinking: When an order is given by an authority, your brain automatically accepts it.)

To overcome authority bias, Dobelli suggests asking yourself how authorities are influencing you and if you should let them continue to do so.

> **How to Overcome Authority Bias**
> 
> Authority bias primarily refers to actions that are morally reprehensible, as Dobelli implies. Even if you believe an action is wrong, authority bias can convince you to do it. Dobelli suggests overcoming this morally problematic bias by asking yourself how authorities are influencing you; however, this is easier said than done, as it's sometimes difficult to detect others’ influence on you.
> 
> Here are a couple of other suggestions for overcoming the bias, if Dobelli’s method doesn’t work:
> 
>   * **Distance yourself from the authority.** The pressure to obey lessens if the authority isn't physically present.
> 
>   * **Form a moral buffer.** If there’s a victim of the actions an authority pressures you into, form a connection with them. This emotional component makes it easier to ignore the authority.
>

### The Nonsense Distraction

The next bias we’ll discuss is what Dobelli calls the “twaddle tendency”—or, as we’ll call it for simplicity, the nonsense distraction. Dobelli notes that **people distract from their ignorance, uncertainty, or laziness by speaking long-winded nonsense.** This is an attempt to maintain group membership: Part of group membership is bringing some level of knowledge to the group. When people feel their membership is threatened, they pretend to have knowledge to protect their position in the group.

(Shortform note: Another word for nonsense is “pseudo-profound bullshit”: saying things that sound profound but are really meaningless. The goal isn't to educate but to disguise ignorance and to maintain verisimilitude. People do this because of a lack of self-worth: If they were confident in their self-worth, they’d feel secure enough to reveal their ignorance and learn from others.)

Anyone who’s watched a political debate has witnessed the nonsense distraction. A politician gives a rambling answer with lots of patriotic keywords, and you realize they didn't really answer the question.

Avoid this tendency by testing your ideas for logic and clarity, Dobelli advises. If you don’t know something, **it’s better to admit you don’t know than to hide your ignorance**.

(Shortform note: It's not always better to show your ignorance as Dobelli suggests. If you're in a position of authority, doing so may harm your credibility. Continuing our example, voters are more likely to dismiss a politician who admits ignorance than one who disguises their ignorance. Logically, the voters might know the honest answer is better, but the nonsense distraction makes them prefer a useless answer to none.)

> **24-Hour News: The Downfall of Fact**
> 
> One of the most pervasive examples of the nonsense distraction is 24-hour news. Back when anchors had to fit a news report into an hour or less, there was only time to present the facts. However, once the news cycle expanded to fill the entire day, news stations had too much time and not enough news. The internet exacerbated the problem, taking news to a minute-by-minute cycle.
> 
> This need to fill runtime led to sensationalism and opinion pieces. Facts are buried under overdramatized information, and instead of just sharing news, publishers tell you what to think about it. These opinion pieces use authority bias, discussed above: If the person is trusted to give an interview, you assume they’re qualified, even if they’re not.

### Fundamental Attribution Error

Another fallacy related to group membership is the fundamental attribution error. According to Dobelli, **people ignore outside influences on problematic situations, instead assigning blame for the problem to the most visible individual.** This is because your brain is designed to pay attention to the people around you—in other words, your present “group.”

(Shortform note: The fundamental attribution error also relates to collectivist and individualist cultures, as discussed above. Individualist cultures place high emphasis on individual identity, so members of these cultures naturally fall prey to the fundamental attribution error more than their collectivist counterparts, who place greater emphasis on the group and the circumstances.)

> **The Neurology of the Fundamental Attribution Error**
> 
> Why do people suffer from the fundamental attribution error? Dobelli doesn’t say, but scientists claim it’s because of a process called “mentalization,” which takes place in your social brain: You try to determine another person’s intentions by guessing at their thought process.
> 
> When mentalizing, you focus so much on what the other person is thinking and intending that you ignore external influences on their behavior. Thus, you’re more likely to blame _them_ for problems than the situation they’re in.
> 
> Mentalization happens mostly unconsciously: Your social brain is part of the brain’s default processes. So, it’s hard to recognize when the fundamental attribution error occurs. The best way to avoid it is to consciously challenge your social brain: Recognize when you’re mentalizing and look at the situation as well as the individual’s actions.

### In-Group, Out-Group Bias

Part of humanity’s desire to be in a group is **prioritizing your own group above others.** As Dobelli explains,**** this means you magnify your group’s positive traits and minimize those of other groups: a phenomenon called in-group, out-group bias. (Shortform note: Why do you prioritize your in-group? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others suggest that by categorizing yourself as a member of a group, you make that membership part of your identity and thus focus on its positive traits. In-group bias is stronger in people with low self-esteem, who rely more heavily on their group for a positive sense of identity.)

Dobelli notes that there are three components to believing your group is better than others:

1\. Groups frequently form around unimportant things, but **your brain locks onto those similarities and prioritizes them above any differences.** (Shortform note: These prioritized in-groups can change depending on the situation. If you’re driving and a pedestrian blocks the road, you’ll be annoyed at pedestrians. Your in-group is “drivers,” while “pedestrians” is an out-group. However, if you’re later a pedestrian and a car honks at you, you’ll be annoyed at drivers. Your in-group shifted to “pedestrians'' according to the situation, and your feelings likewise shifted.)

2\. When you’re in a group, your brain views the members of other groups as more similar than they are. **Your brain wants others to fit neatly into their opposing box, so it ignores any conflicting information.** (Shortform note: Research confirms that people can identify minor differences between in-group faces while missing differences between out-group faces. Your brain recognizes when individuals aren’t in your in-group and puts less effort into processing or remembering their faces, meaning it doesn’t register differences between these faces.)

3\. Groups usually form around people’s opinions, which means you spend a lot of time with other people who hold the same opinions as you. **Because everyone around you agrees, you believe your group must be right.** (Shortform note: On social media, this kind of group is called an echo chamber. Social media algorithms direct you to people with similar beliefs, which reinforces your underlying beliefs. In turn, interacting with those people reinforces the algorithm.)

In the modern day, Dobelli argues, group bias is a dangerous phenomenon that blinds you to the facts of a situation and enforces prejudice. (Shortform note: To counter this bias, spend time with members of out-groups. Focus on points of connection, rather than differences, and recognize when your groups are formed around arbitrary means.)

### Reciprocity

According to Dobelli, reciprocity is another tendency that forms out of humanity’s instinctual desire to be part of a group: **If someone does something for you, you’re more likely to do something for them in return.** This comes from a dislike of being in other people’s debt.

(Shortform note: How specifically you react to being in someone’s debt depends on your reciprocity style: You either only help others when it benefits you, and so are less affected by being in debt; help others for the sake of helping even when it means a loss for yourself, and so are highly affected by being in debt; or help others to the same extent they help you, where you have a more neutral reaction to being in debt.)

**Reciprocity is a vital part of life, Dobelli notes.** It inspires cooperation, creates and strengthens communities, and helps keep the group healthy. (Shortform note: Mutual aid is a form of reciprocity that inspires these factors. Communities unite to support the group, everyone helping and being helped in turn. Poor and marginalized groups have used mutual aid throughout history, and researchers have even observed the phenomenon in animals, pointing to reciprocity’s evolutionary origins.)

Unfortunately, Dobelli concedes, this tendency can be twisted. **Manipulating people into giving you something is easy if you first make them feel indebted to you.** (Shortform note: Often, manipulative people offer you some small benefit before asking for a larger favor. Even though the exchange is imbalanced, you still feel compelled to agree.)

Reciprocity also has a dark side: retaliation. Dobelli points out that when others are kind to you, you want to return the favor and be nice as well, but **if someone hurts you, you want to hurt them in return.** This cycle only escalates the problem.

(Shortform note: Though Dobelli argues that retaliation is dangerous, others argue that retaliation—or negative reciprocity—is a necessary part of cooperation. They clarify that Dobelli refers to _private_ retaliation, where an injured party carries out retaliation without supervision and frequently over-retaliates, prompting the initial aggressor to retaliate in turn. However, _public_ retaliation is the basis of the legal system: A proportionate form of retaliation is objectively determined and taken against the initial aggressor. Given this definition, retaliation is an important part of society, so long as it's objectively proportionate.)

### Social Comparison Bias

Another fallacy that forms from group membership is social comparison bias, Dobelli explains. **This involves refusing to help someone out of fear that they’ll take your spot in the group.** This is a defense mechanism:**** You don’t want to lose your position in the group, so you won’t help others even if doing so would help the group.

Social comparison bias is especially prevalent in the business world, Dobelli says. **People hire below their own skill level so they don’t feel threatened.** By hiring less qualified people, however, you ensure your business won’t excel: It’ll be limited by your abilities and the lesser abilities of your employees. Instead, improve your company by hiring the best, even if they’re better than you.

(Shortform note: A barrier to hiring the best people might be worry about how to manage people who are smarter than you. In this situation, focus on what you bring to the team and how to create an environment where your employees can best use their expertise. In addition, acknowledge the areas in which you fall short and learn from your more experienced employees.)

> **Upward and Downward Social Comparison**
> 
> While Dobelli defines social comparison bias as refusing to help others out of fear of being outclassed, other sources define it more generally as a sense of competitiveness and dislike stemming from comparison. They break social comparison into two categories: upward and downward.
> 
> Upward social comparison means comparing yourself to those who are better than you. This can either motivate you to improve or lower your self-esteem. Meanwhile, downward social comparison means comparing yourself to those who are somehow worse than you. This either boosts your self-esteem or leads to the problems Dobelli explores above.
> 
> So how can you get the benefits of healthy competition without damaging your self-esteem or ruining your company?
> 
>   * **Be humble.** It’s difficult to admit that someone else is better than you, but doing so helps you in the long run.
> 
>   * **Approach upward social comparison withcuriosity rather than jealousy.** Look at how others became successful and how you can use that knowledge.
> 
>   * **Seek out your betters, rather than running from them, so you can learn from them.** This gives you an advantage over your competition and helps you excel.
> 
> 


### Social Loafing

In this final section about group biases, we’ll discuss social loafing: **When added to a group, individuals lessen the effort they exert, both physically and mentally. This allows them to save energy.** Dobelli says this is a _feature_ of groups, not a bug: Early humans formed groups because the responsibility for survival was spread out rather than concentrated on each individual.

When a member puts too little effort into the group’s actions, however, they are looked down upon and sometimes expelled from the group. Thus, Dobelli notes, **social loafing is a careful balancing act, with each team member putting in enough effort that their slacking isn’t noticed.**

While social loafing is a rational behavior on the part of the worker, it's a problem for employers, Dobelli argues. Social loafing means **teams are more willing to take bigger risks than the individuals that compose them.** They do so**** because the shared responsibility involved in group membership means they won’t be the sole focus of the blame if things go wrong.

(Shortform note: Interestingly, most definitions of social loafing don’t include the idea that groups make riskier decisions than individuals. This is considered a separate phenomenon called “risky shift.” However, Dobelli’s inclusion of risky shift as an element of social loafing makes sense, as diffused responsibility is the cause of both phenomena.)

**The best way to combat social loafing is to make sure that the group can trace everyone’s individual contributions back to them.** This increases personal responsibility and requires all the team members to put their full effort forward, Dobelli says. (Shortform note: You can also manipulate in-group bias, discussed above, to avoid this fallacy. When people feel a sense of kinship with their group, they’ll work harder to benefit said group.)

> **Social Loafing: How It Forms and How to Prevent It**
> 
> While Dobelli stresses the evolutionary causes of social loafing, there are a couple of other factors that influence it:
> 
>   * **Your expectations.** If you expect your coworkers to lower their effort or feel that your contributions to the group won’t be important, you’ll lower your own effort because you don’t want to work hard by yourself or for something unimportant.
> 
>   * **How you value the goal.** If you’re passionate about the project, you’ll work harder. If you only care about the reward, which will be shared among the group, you’ll work less.
> 
> 

> 
> Prevent social loafing by encouraging peer accountability, as Dobelli discusses. By making your group members more aware of when someone isn’t pulling their weight and empowering them to hold that person accountable, social loafing lessens.
