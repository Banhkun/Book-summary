## Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Evolutionary Fallacies

Now that we’ve covered the main groups of evolutionary fallacies, we’ll look at the following final, miscellaneous fallacies of this kind:

  * Ambiguity aversion
  * Action bias
  * Loss aversion



### Ambiguity Aversion

According to Dobelli, ambiguity aversion is**the human tendency to dislike uncertainty.** Uncertainty is a lack of concrete facts about an outcome. For early humans, lacking facts was deadly: If you didn’t know which plants were edible or where predators lived, you died. Thus, humans evolved to avoid uncertainty.

(Shortform note: Ambiguity aversion is the root of the colloquialism “Better the devil you know.” Even if your situation is bad, you’d rather stay in that situation than face the uncertainty of leaving. For example, say you’re stuck in a job you hate and are offered a new job in a field you know nothing about but _might_ like—you’re not quite sure. Despite not enjoying your current job, you’ll probably choose to stay: Your fear of uncertainty over the new job makes you choose the unhappiness you know.)

However, **uncertainty is very prevalent and thus unavoidable in modern society.** While the ideal approach to this rampant uncertainty would be to**** learn to accept and work with it, Dobelli argues, this is near impossible: Your tolerance for uncertainty is pre-determined by how your amygdala, which processes emotions, forms. (Shortform note: Dobelli claims uncertainty resilience is biologically determined. However, others argue that you can increase resilience through “flooding,” during which you expose yourself to increasing amounts of uncertainty. After the initial exposure period, your brain becomes bored with the uncertainty and accepts it.)

### Action Bias

Another miscellaneous evolutionary fallacy is action bias: **the tendency to take action rather than waiting for a better opportunity or more information** , Dobelli explains. For early humans, delaying action could mean death (for instance, if a predator approached). While this is much less often the case for modern humans, we still instinctively want to act in all situations. However, this instinct causes problems in today’s complex world, when impulsive actions are more likely to cause problems than waiting and thinking things through. For example, impulsively deciding to invest in a fund without waiting and researching its likelihood of growth may lead to you losing money.

**While the need for patience has grown, society's tolerance of it hasn’t** , Dobelli says. People praise those who take action, even if that action was reckless or hasty, while accusing those who choose to wait and gather information of cowardice. (Shortform note: Others argue that Dobelli is only partially right. Studies show that people praise leaders who quickly make positive decisions (like promoting someone) and see them as more trustworthy than those who wait. However, they see leaders who quickly make _negative_ decisions (like cutting someone’s pay) as less trustworthy. Thus, society’s tolerance for quick decisions is situation-specific, rather than uniform as Dobelli implies.)

> **Action Bias and Manipulation**
> 
> While Dobelli acknowledges that action bias causes problems in the modern world, he doesn’t cover a specific issue that can have major consequences: People, or even governments, manipulating action bias to fulfill their own goals.
> 
> In his book _Factfulness_ , Hans Rosling argues that salespeople, politicians, and activists manipulate action bias by using time limits and worst-case scenarios to spark panic. In the wake of this panic, they encourage people to take drastic actions rather than waiting to gather more information—in other words, to give in to action bias. Simultaneously, they withhold information from the public because it’s easier to inspire panic when the public has little information or experience. Panicking and ill-informed, the public makes hasty decisions that can be disastrous.
> 
> For example, say a politician’s running for president. He encourages people to vote for him by saying war with another country is inevitable—a worst-case scenario— and he can mitigate the damage by attacking first. He presents the other country as highly dangerous and emphasizes the need for immediate response. He also exaggerates the consequences of _not_ acting—for instance, that their country’s way of life will be destroyed. This sparks panic among the public. The politician then limits the distribution of any opposing information, so the public can’t allay this panic through research. Thus, the panicking public votes the politician into office, no matter how unjustified or disastrous doing so actually is.
> 
> No matter the source, overcoming action bias is important. Dobelli doesn’t explain how to do so, but Rosling suggests the following tips:
> 
>   * **Collect information.** Examine all facts and evidence before jumping to conclusions.
> 
>   * **Don’t panic.** Remember that most problems don’t have a “now or never” deadline.
> 
>   * **Mind probability.** Focus on the most probable scenario instead of the worst case scenario.

### Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is another miscellaneous evolutionary fallacy in which **people are affected far more strongly by loss than they are by gaining things. They consequently prioritize not losing things over gaining new things,** Dobelli states. Even when the things you lose and gain have the same value, you react to the loss twice as intensely as the gain. (Shortform note: Some people think the more you have, the less this tendency affects you because the loss isn’t as important. This isn’t the case. Rich people are just as anxious over losing their wealth or belongings as poor people—maybe more so, as they have more to lose.)

Loss aversion is an evolutionary trait passed on from early humanity, when losing something—be it belongings, weapons, or food supply—was often fatal, Dobelli explains. Being cautious and avoiding loss kept early humans alive and able to procreate, meaning their cautious genes survived to the current day.

(Shortform note: Evolutionary instincts also determine which losses matter more to you. Losing something you physically had hurts more than losing something you had in a more abstract way. For example, losing $100 cash hurts more than losing $150 electronically, even though you lose more money electronically. Your brain sees the cash as more “real” and thus worse to lose because it hasn’t evolved to deal with abstract, non-tangible items.)

**People can use loss aversion to their advantage by framing their pitches negatively rather than positively** , Dobelli says. If an ad says “Act now or lose these savings forever!” it's twice as effective as an ad that says, “Act now and get these savings!” (Shortform note: Negative pitches work by building anticipatory regret: They make you imagine a loss and the feeling of regret that comes with that loss. These imagined feelings are strong enough to trigger loss aversion. Anticipatory regret is more effective at boosting sales than excitement or curiosity, making it a valuable tool for marketers.)
