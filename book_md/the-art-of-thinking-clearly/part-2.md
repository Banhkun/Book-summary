## Part 2: Non-Evolutionary Fallacies | Chapter 6: You Misinterpret Cause and Effect

Now that we’ve covered evolutionary fallacies, we’ll look at non-evolutionary fallacies. These are fallacies that Dobelli doesn’t classify as having an evolutionary basis: Rather, they have other causes, such as past experience, limited perspective, or information overload.

In this chapter, we’ll cover how misinterpreting cause and effect damages your judgment. According to Dobelli, **humans struggle to interpret cause and effect because they confuse correlation and causation.** When two events coincide, people assume there’s a causal relationship between the two of them, even when there’s not.**** For example, if a person gets the flu after they start taking vitamins, they might assume a causal relationship—taking vitamins gave them the flu—simply because the timing coincides.

(Shortform note: How do people make these mistaken links? They take their knowledge of the effect and look for any similar events that might point to a cause, regardless of the likelihood of that similar event actually _being_ the cause. In other words, they look for possible _correlations_ between the events and mistake this for one _causing_ the other. For example, both vitamins and the flu are related to your health, so they’re correlated _._ Because the timing coincided between taking the vitamins and getting the flu, you confuse the correlation for causation.)

We’ll cover the following fallacies that arise from misinterpreting cause and effect:

  * The result illusion
  * Ignoring coincidence
  * Association bias
  * The fallacy of the single cause



### The Result Illusion

One instance in which people confuse the cause-and-effect cycle is the result illusion, which Dobelli calls the “swimmer’s body illusion.” In this bias, you look at the traits of people who do a certain activity and think the activity _causes_ those traits. In reality, **the people participate in the activity because they _already have_ those traits. The traits are the cause, not the effect. **For example, you might look at a professional swimmer’s toned body and think you can gain that same appearance by swimming. However, these individuals are so good at swimming because they _already had_ that kind of body.

Dobelli suggests using your knowledge of the result illusion to **make realistic goals.** If you confuse the cause (swimmers’ body type) with the effect (they’re good swimmers), you might set unrealistic goals, like swimming to gain a different body type. If you realize the swimmers were born with that body type, you can set healthier goals for exercising that fit your own body type.

> **The Result Illusion: Nature vs. Nurture**
> 
> The result illusion is part of the nature vs. nurture debate: It’s hard to determine if people's genetics or upbringing dictate their characteristics. When you fall for the result illusion, you confuse the person’s _nature_ —natural traits—with how they’ve been _nurtured_ —traits they gained through their activities.
> 
> Dobelli implies that people’s traits are primarily assigned by nature, and thus that nurturing doesn’t have as large a role. However, others argue that the divide of importance between nature and nurture is more even: While it's true that some people do naturally have an optimized body for swimming, you can also gain some of those traits by training.
> 
> For example, height and long limbs are traits that are dictated by nature. People with these traits are better swimmers due to a natural advantage. However, other traits such as broad shoulders or strong legs are the result of training. Anyone can gain these traits through long hours of swimming.
> 
> You can still use this knowledge to set realistic goals, as Dobelli suggests. Consider the traits you want to have and whether they’re dictated by nature or nurture. Let go of impossible goals revolving around natural traits, but don’t give up on those surrounding things you can change.

### Ignoring Coincidence

Another way people misinterpret the cause-and-effect cycle is by ignoring coincidence, Dobelli states. **People attribute strange events to the supernatural** —for example, believing someone getting struck by lightning twice is a message from God or the universe—because **they think such events are impossible and can’t be the result of coincidence**.

In reality, these strange events _are_ possible, though unlikely. People can’t accurately estimate probability (which we’ll discuss further in Chapter 8), so they think strange events are less likely than they actually are. Continuing our example, someone getting struck by lightning twice seems impossible, but with 7.7 billion people on earth and 1.4 billion lightning strikes per year, it’s bound to happen eventually.

Thus,**don’t get too excited when something unusual happens,** Dobelli suggests. Hardly anything is impossible, and the probability of any event occurring is likely higher than you think.

> **Coincidence and the Law of Very Large Numbers**
> 
> Dobelli’s explanation that coincidences are more likely than you think is supported by the law of very large numbers: When your sample size is very large, “impossible” events are inevitable. For example, if the chance of being struck by lightning twice is one in 3 million and there are 7.7 billion people on earth, 2,000 people will be struck twice _by coincidence_.
> 
> So why don’t people take the law of very large numbers into account? It’s because humans can’t visualize very large numbers. Since early humans didn’t need to understand such large numbers, your brain didn’t evolve the instinctive ability to do so. Humans’ ability to understand just how large a number is starts to degrade after 100, and it breaks down completely for numbers above a million.
> 
> Thus, when people try to estimate probabilities that involve very large numbers—for instance, the size of the human race—they underestimate their sample size and don’t take the law of very large numbers into account. For example, you can’t visualize how big 7.7 billion _or_ 3 million are. You think those numbers are closer in size than they really are, so you assume the chance of being struck by lightning twice is much lower than 2,000. Thus, when it happens, you search for another explanation, attributing it to supernatural intervention.

### Association Bias

In this section, we’ll discuss another misrepresentation of cause and effect: association bias, or **the brain’s tendency to make connections where none exist.** Dobelli says this misrepresents cause and effect by forming _false knowledge_ , where you falsely causally connect two unrelated things.

Superstitions form this way, Dobelli explains. For example, say you bring rainboots when camping, and the weather is perfect. The next time you go camping, you leave the rainboots behind and the weather is awful. The next time you bring them, the weather is wonderful again. After a few of these experiences, your brain connects the boots and good weather, even though it’s just a coincidence that the weather improved when you brought the boots.

**Association bias is also involved in traumatic experiences,** Dobelli adds. Say you step in a hole and break your leg while playing soccer. Your brain makes a connection between soccer and pain, and you may refuse to play soccer again. Because these connections have stronger inciting incidents—breaking a leg is more memorable than bringing boots—they can be very strong even after a single incident, while more innocuous connections must be reinforced over time.

> **Association Bias: Why It Happens and How to Overcome Unhealthy Connections**
> 
> Why does association bias occur? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others argue that association bias is a defense mechanism: Making connections helps you form “protective frames.” These are practices or support systems that let you evaluate risk (for example, the risk of it raining when you go camping). Most of the time, these frames are helpful or harmless, like our rainboot example. However, connections made through traumatic experiences are maladaptive and grow stronger over time. For example, your fear of soccer may expand to fear of walking on any grass as you think it’ll put you at risk of more pain.
> 
> Though these connections grow stronger over time, you can change them. One method of changing the connections your brain makes is through exposure therapy, where you gradually expose yourself to the object of your negative connection. This replaces the connection between the object and your negative experience with a positive or neutral experience. For example, you might watch a soccer game or walk around on a soccer field. Your brain takes those positive experiences and forms a new connection to soccer which overrides the negative experience and the feeling of risk.

### The Fallacy of the Single Cause

In this section, we’ll cover the fallacy of the single cause: **To make a simple pattern of cause and effect, people oversimplify chains of events,** Dobelli says. They do this because, as previously mentioned, humans dislike uncertainty, including uncertainty over how events transpire. Looking for simple patterns reduces uncertainty because the fewer elements involved in a situation, the easier it is to understand the chain of events.

(Shortform note: As Dobelli implies, a single-cause pattern provides a sense of understanding. When people understand a situation, not only are they less uncertain, but they can also better withstand any uncertainty they _do_ feel. In addition, understanding something increases confidence and positive feelings, which further encourages people to simplify the cause-and-effect cycle.)

This mindset is dangerous because **everything is affected by a complex web of influences and causes,** Dobelli adds. There’s never a single cause for large, complex effects like crime or success. Trying to find one leads people to pin responsibility on a single person or group. Blaming a single person or group alleviates everyone else's guilt without addressing systemic problems, which lets the problems continue unhindered.

#### Overcoming the Fallacy of the Single Cause

**You can use the knowledge of this complex web of causes to your benefit,** Dobelli says. When trying to determine how to make a project successful, don’t fixate on a single cause of success. Rather, examine all potential influences on your project. Focus on the factors you can influence, and experiment with _how_ you can influence those factors. By experimenting with these factors, you can determine the most influential factors and use them to be more successful. For example, if you run a pizzeria, you can influence the quality of the food and staff you hire. By experimenting with these factors, you might learn that a skilled cook matters more than ingredients to customer satisfaction, so you focus more effort and money on hiring good cooks.

(Shortform note: These experiments are important even if you’re already experiencing success. People who experience success usually fail later because they attribute that success to their own actions without looking deeper. They don’t account for chance or evaluate the factors they influenced in gaining that success, which means they can’t replicate it. The only way to maintain success is to discern its cause and develop your ability to control said cause.)

> **Occam’s Razor and the Fallacy of the Single Cause**
> 
> While Dobelli cautions against oversimplifying a situation, others warn against _overcomplicating_ it. For instance, Occam’s Razor states that when presented with two options, the simpler one is better. In this case, “simpler” means whichever option requires fewer assumptions.
> 
> For example, consider these statements: “I have a headache because I didn’t drink water” and “I have a headache because I have a deadly disease.” The former requires two assumptions: You didn’t drink water and not drinking water causes headaches. The latter requires three assumptions: You have a disease, the disease is deadly, and the disease causes headaches. The first statement is simpler and therefore better.
> 
> Doesn’t this contradict Dobelli’s point? If simple answers are better, isn’t simplifying logical? No, because there’s a difference between “better” and “accurate.” Simpler explanations are _better_ , in that they are easier to understand, good for getting a basic understanding of complicated matters, and more probable. However, simpler explanations are not always _accurate:_ Sometimes the complicated explanation is correct, if less likely.
> 
> By this logic, ignoring information to create single-cause patterns trades accuracy for simplicity. As Dobelli says, this leads people to assign too much responsibility to an individual or group, but you also assign too much responsibility to single solutions. If you believe that high illness rates are due to unaffordable healthcare, you’ll work to make healthcare affordable. This singular focus means you won’t realize that you must address other factors like safe housing and income too.
