## Exercise: Overcome the Affect Heuristic

Affects are immediate judgments of like or dislike. Your brain makes these very quickly and relies on these affects rather than logical risk-benefit analyses. It’s important to overcome the affect heuristic because these instinctive judgments aren’t always accurate.

* * *

Identify three instinctive judgments of objects or actions that influence your behavior. (Common affects include seeing sugary treats as better than healthy food, seeing intimidating items as more dangerous than they are, such as nuclear power plants, or seeing attractive items as more beneficial than they are, such as motorcycles.)

Next, make a table with two columns: one for “Risks” and one for “Benefits” of the thing you’ve judged. Fill in the columns for each affect. (Be as objective as you can and don’t be afraid to research: The goal is to see where your affects may be misleading you.)

Next, reflect on your opinions from the first question. Have they changed at all since completing the above exercise? Why or why not?

Finally, make a plan for the next time an affect impacts your decisions. (For instance, you might take some time to do a risk-benefit analysis like above or talk to someone with different opinions than you about the thing you’ve judged.)
