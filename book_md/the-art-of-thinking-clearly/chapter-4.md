## Chapter 4: You Struggle to Understand Complex Math

The next set of fallacies we’ll look at revolve around complex math. **Your hunter-gatherer brain isn’t designed for complex math** , Dobelli says: Because your ancestors didn’t need this math to survive, you can’t instinctively grasp concepts like averages, statistics, and exponential growth. However, understanding these concepts is important for modern life.

(Shortform note: Some people argue that people’s difficulty with complex math concepts isn't a biological limitation but a result of how math is viewed. People internalize the idea that math is difficult and define themselves as “a math person” or “not a math person.” Thus, those who struggle with math concepts stop trying to understand them. If people treated math like a second language, which takes a lot of practice and repetition to learn but can be learned by anyone, people would learn complex math easier.)

In this chapter, we’ll look at the following examples of complex math concepts and how not understanding them causes logical errors:

  * The distribution of averages
  * Self-selection bias
  * Exponential growth



### The Distribution of Averages

Averages are one of the complex math concepts your brain isn't evolutionarily prepared for, Dobelli explains.**** When averaging, you add together a group of numbers then divide by the number of numbers. For example, to find the average of 5, 9, 12, and 14, you would add them together to get 40 then divide by four to get 10.

**One of the biggest pitfalls when working with averages is ignoring the distribution:** the original numbers used to calculate the average. The distribution of the average is important because averages are misleading: **Your brain focuses on the average and doesn't consider possible outliers in the distribution.** Outliers are**** the extremes at either end of the scale that drastically change the average, Dobelli adds.

For example, a waiter could serve an average of 20 tables a day. Your brain instinctively limits the range of possible tables waited per day to a range close to 20, such as 15 to 25. However, there might be slow days where the waiter only serves 5 tables, or busy days where they serve 40. The average hides these outliers, so if you ignore the distribution, you don’t have a true idea of the waiter’s workload.

**To get a true idea of the workload, you must remove the outliers,** Dobelli says. This isn’t instinctive, but it’s important for modern life because outliers are increasingly common.

> **Averages and Scalable Events**
> 
> Dobelli’s discussion of distribution and outliers finds parallels in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s _The Black Swan_. Taleb sorts events into two categories: scalable and non-scalable. Scalable events have no defined limits, while non-scalable events have defined limits. (Taleb notes that Black Swan events—events that are unpredictable yet highly influential—occur solely in scalable situations.)
> 
> Most natural events are non-scalable. For example, there’s a defined limit to how much weight a human can lift; strength and weakness revolve around an average, and there are few outliers in that average’s distribution.
> 
> On the other hand, many man-made situations and ideas are scalable, with outliers in their averages’ distribution. There’s no upper limit to wealth, for example, which allows for the existence of billionaires—outliers in the distribution of global wealth. The presence of a single billionaire can significantly raise the average wealth of a town, making this average misleading—most people will earn well below the skewed average. Thus, when dealing with scalable situations, understanding averages and their distribution is important to gain an accurate picture of the situation.

### Self-Selection Bias

Statistics is another area of complex math that you’re not primed for, Dobelli says. One common statistical error is self-selection bias, in which **the nature of the participants in a study influences its outcome.** Specifically,**** people only join studies they’re comfortable responding to, which alters your data, Dobelli says. Those who might provide embarrassing or somehow “undesirable” responses simply won’t take part, narrowing your study’s scope and skewing the results.

Say, for example, a school does a survey on alcohol and drug use. Only students who are comfortable discussing their usage will respond. Students who use alcohol and drugs more are less likely to participate either out of fear of penalization or because they’re ashamed of their usage. This means your results will skew toward lower alcohol and drug usage and not reflect the true usage at the school.

> **Working Around Self-Selection Bias**
> 
> How can you avoid self-selection bias? Dobelli doesn’t say, but others say the only way to completely eliminate self-selection bias is studying people who don’t know they’re being studied. However, uninformed research is unethical. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Psychological Association require researchers to receive informed consent from all study participants.

> However, you can _limit_ self-selection bias. Most studies do this by collecting demographic information: Researchers look for patterns in the demographics of people who chose to participate, and alter how they weigh the responses to reduce self-selection bias. Specifically, they give greater weight to results from those less likely to self-select, and lesser weight to results from those likely to self-select.
> 
> Returning to our earlier example, if you notice that many A- and B-students respond to your survey, reporting low drug and alcohol use, but only a few C- and D-students respond, reporting higher drug and alcohol use, you might weigh those C- and D-student responses more heavily than the A- and B-student responses. The C- and D-students would be less likely to self-select and participate in the study due to shame around their grades and substance use. Weighing the responses of those that _do_ respond more highly will counteract the impact of this lack of self-selection.

### Exponential Growth

Exponential growth is another complex math concept that people don't instinctively understand, Dobelli says. **Most things in nature increase linearly, where a number increases by the same amount at regular intervals.** For example, if you add one rock to a pile every day, on the 15th day, you’ll have 15 rocks. This is a basic concept that early humans encountered, so your brain naturally understands this kind of growth.

However, **exponential growth means that a number _doubles_ at regular intervals**, Dobelli explains. For example, you add one rock to a pile on day one, two rocks the next day, four rocks the next day, and so on. By day 15, you’ll have 16,384 rocks. This is not a concept that early humans encountered, so your brain struggles to grasp it. However, it’s increasingly common in the modern world and thus crucial to understand: Everything from investments to product sales can grow exponentially.

> **Exponential Growth in Nature and Modern Life**
> 
> While Dobelli is correct that exponential growth was rarely observed by early humans and is now much more observable in modern fields such as finance, exponential growth is still possible in the natural world that early humans would have experienced. For example, if two dogs have six puppies, and each puppy also has six puppies, the dog population would experience exponential growth. However, natural exponential growth is limited by resources: The dog population can only grow exponentially until it reaches “carrying capacity,” the maximum number of dogs the environment can support. Thus, while natural exponential growth is possible, it's rare.
> 
> Furthermore, early humans may not have identified natural exponential growth because it’s only noticeable if you keep track of all members of a species, which wasn’t possible millions of years ago. However, it’s easier with modern technology. Once you’re tracking the species, you can spot exponential growth by finding the “doubling time”: If the population of a species doubles within a week, for example, see if it doubles again next week. If the population continues to double within the same time (or faster), it’s experiencing exponential growth.
