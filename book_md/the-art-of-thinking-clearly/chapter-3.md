## Chapter 3: You’re Using the Wrong Kind of Thinking

The next set of fallacies we'll look at revolve around using the wrong type of thinking.**There are two main kinds of thinking: fast and instinctive, and slow and logical.** Both play important roles, Dobelli explains, but both cause logical fallacies when used in the wrong situation. (Shortform note: These types of thinking are also called hot and cold cognition. Instinct and emotion dictate hot cognition, while logic and reasoning control cold cognition. Hot cognition uses little mental energy, doesn’t turn off, and inspires impulsive decisions, while cold cognition uses a lot of mental energy and can overwhelm you with information.)

So when is it better to rely on fast, instinctive thinking?**When actions are familiar or something you’ve been evolutionarily optimized for** , Dobelli says. If you’ve ever thought too hard about the way you’re breathing, you’re using slow thinking when instinctive thinking is better. **When you’re trying something new, or are in a situation you’re not instinctually prepared for, use slow logic** , Dobelli concludes.

> **Other Perspectives on When and How to Think Instinctively**
> 
> In _Blink_ , Malcolm Gladwell argues that you can use your instinctive thinking more often than Dobelli suggests—for instance, even in unfamiliar situations—as long as you train it correctly to avoid coming to incorrect snap judgments. You can improve the accuracy of your instinctive thinking by expanding your worldview, so that your instincts have more experience to draw on, as well as by paying attention to context, so that you know what _type_ of experience to draw on.
> 
> That said, thinking instinctively may feel uncomfortable to you—Gladwell notes that people prefer instinctive thinking to logic, which makes it hard to engage your logical thinking. In _Thinking Fast and Slow_ , Daniel Kahneman notes that you can encourage logical thinking by increasing the difficulty of your task. For example, if you’re reading an article, making the font smaller increases the effort you put into the task, triggering your logical thinking and helping you analyze the article.

In this chapter, we’ll look at the following logical errors that come from using the wrong kind of thinking:

  * The conjunction fallacy
  * The affect heuristic
  * Hyperbolic discounting



### The Conjunction Fallacy

The first incorrect use of thinking we’ll explore is the conjunction fallacy: the human **tendency to prefer a _plausible_ story to a _probable_ one.** In other words, Dobelli explains, when a story makes sense to you, you’re likely to believe it even if the true probability of it occurring is low.

For example, consider a girl named Katrina who loves musicals. Now consider these statements:

  1. Katrina performs on stage.
  2. Katrina performs on stage in a musical.



**Many people pick the second option as most likely because it makes a better story** : Katrina loves musicals, so she’d perform in a musical. However, the _first_ option is actually more likely in terms of probability because it’s broader: It has just one condition (Katrina being on stage) rather than two (Katrina being on stage _and_ in a musical).

The conjunction fallacy occurs when you use fast thinking instead of slow, Dobelli says. While your logical brain is still calculating the probability of an event, your instinctive thought process makes connections to explain why the event might occur. **The connections it finds often form a plausible story, so you accept the instinctive connection rather than waiting for the logical probability.**

> **Is the Conjunction Fallacy Really as Problematic as Dobelli Claims?**
> 
> While Dobelli presents the conjunction fallacy as something common, others argue that he exaggerates the danger of this fallacy. Dobelli based his understanding of the conjunction fallacy on the initial study that defined it. However, other studies were unable to replicate this initial study’s results—they found that the conjunction fallacy isn’t as common as the original researchers suggested. Only 45% of respondents succumbed to the fallacy, compared to 85% in the original study.
> 
> In addition, while Dobelli doesn’t offer a solution to the conjunction fallacy, this later research does: Discussing a situation with other people drastically reduces the likelihood of the conjunction fallacy taking root. Thus, it’s possible that overreliance on quick, instinctive cognition—which Dobelli credits with causing the conjunction fallacy, as discussed above—can easily be overcome.

### The Affect Heuristic

In this section, we’ll discuss the affect heuristic: part of humanity’s fast, instinctive thinking. Dobelli says the affect heuristic is a mental shortcut in which your brain makes **rapid subconscious judgments of like or dislike.** These “affects” influence your risk-benefit analyses: If your immediate judgment is good, you’ll focus on the benefits of a situation, while if the affect is bad, you’ll focus on the risks.

(Shortform note: Heuristics like the affect heuristic aren’t necessarily negative. They keep your brain working efficiently and help you make decisions. The affect heuristic was particularly helpful to early humans because it quickly provides more data for risk analysis, and early humans faced regular life-threatening risks—for instance, being attacked by wild predators. However, the information required for a good risk-benefit analysis in modern times is too complex for the affect heuristic to assess adequately, especially when emotions are involved. Rather than being beneficial, the heuristic can lead you to make a risky decision merely because you’re excited or delay a good decision because you’re sad.)

Allowing affects to control your behavior is dangerous because they’re manipulatable, Dobelli warns. **Images and situations alter people’s affects** , changing the way you judge items or situations. For instance, marketers use cheerful pictures to give you a positive affect of their product.

(Shortform note: You might assume that only _people_ have affects based on appearance, but any object can have them. Machines that look intimidating, like a nuclear power plant, make people wary even if their benefits outweigh their risks. On the other hand, people downplay the risks of enticing items, like a motorcycle, even though they’re extremely dangerous.)

### Hyperbolic Discounting

Another incorrect use of cognition is hyperbolic discounting: **the tendency to crave immediate gratification and the willingness to sacrifice an unreasonable amount of money, time, or effort for that immediacy.** It's difficult for people to wait for things, Dobelli says, a tendency that accelerates the closer you come to attaining gratification.

(Shortform note: While Dobelli doesn’t define it as such, this is an example of overused hot cognition and underused cold cognition. People who can delay gratification have better-developed prefrontal cortexes, the part of the brain that handles cold cognition. Thus, they delay gratification by using their prefrontal cortexes to engage cold cognition. Meanwhile, those with less developed prefrontal cortexes are more susceptible to the instinctual desire for instant gratification.)

Dobelli says this is an instinctive trait from times when humans were more animalistic, noting that animals display this trait too. Consider wolves, who eat almost half their body weight at once. They can’t delay gratification because they don’t know when they’ll have another meal. However, humans no longer need instant gratification to survive, so hyperbolic discounting just inspires bad decisions, like paying a high amount to get something quicker.

> **How to Avoid Hyperbolic Discounting**
> 
> How can you avoid hyperbolic discounting (and, therefore, bad decisions)? Dobelli doesn’t say, but one solution is priming. Priming means exposing yourself to certain stimuli that encourage your brain to respond to later, different stimuli in a desired way. In the case of hyperbolic discounting, you’d expose yourself to stimuli that encourage you to delay gratification the next time you encounter a choice between delaying and immediacy.
> 
> There are two ways to prime yourself to delay gratification:
> 
>   * **Talk about your future plans.** Using the words “future” and “self-control” can prime you to delay gratification later on. Combining these words with a broader discussion of your plans reinforces your goals and makes you more likely to carry them out.
> 
>   * **Imagine talking to your future self.** This exercise lets you see a possible result of your decisions. Focus on avoiding instant gratification in the long-term by imagining a positive future for yourself if you make good long-term decisions. Imagining a negative future that comes from instant gratification also works.
