## Exercise: Overcome Social Proof

According to Dobelli, social proof pressures you to copy other people’s behavior. This is a defense mechanism to maintain your group membership, but it can lead you to make bad decisions. Every person has unique wants and needs, and following the status quo might keep you from happiness.

* * *

Think of the last time you did something because you felt pressured to by your group. (This group could be family members, friends, religious or political groups, and so on.) What happened? Did your actions make you happy or unhappy, and why?

Next, describe how you might have acted differently without that group pressure. How might you have been happier if you’d chosen your own path? (Be realistic: Making your own path can have negative consequences as well as benefits.)

Finally, write out a plan for the next time you encounter social proof. (For instance, you might take some time for yourself away from your group and make a pros and cons list to figure out what you really want.) Be specific, with actionable steps.
