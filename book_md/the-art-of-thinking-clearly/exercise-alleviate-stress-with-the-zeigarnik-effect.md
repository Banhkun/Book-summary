## Exercise: Alleviate Stress With the Zeigarnik Effect

The Zeigarnik effect impacts how your brain handles tasks, Dobelli says. Before a task is completed, it stays in the forefront of your mind, often causing stress. Once you’ve completed the task, though, you forget it. You can manipulate this tendency to clear your mind of pressing tasks and alleviate stress.

* * *

Make a list of your three most pressing unfinished tasks that are clogging your mind and causing you stress.

Next, make a plan to deal with each task on the list. Be specific, with actionable steps. (Break complicated steps down further. For example, if your task is “Clean the house,” be more specific with your steps than “Clean the living room.” Instead, you might write, “Vacuum the carpet, clean the windows, and sweep.”)

Finally, reflect on your mindset: Are you feeling more at peace, less at peace, or the same since making your lists? Why? (If you’re not feeling at peace, try adding more concrete and specific steps to your list and then come back to this question.)
