## Exercise: Make a Plan for Cultivating Meaningful Desires

Burgis argues that you can improve your life, society, and others’ lives by understanding how mimetic desire works and pursuing meaningful desires over misleading ones.

* * *

First, make a list of at least five strong desires you have, whether they’re meaningful or misleading. (For example: owning a larger home, having a child, building stronger relationships with colleagues, getting a promotion, and learning about your heritage.)

Run each of the desires you listed through the “meaningful desire test.” For each desire, ask yourself the following questions: 1) Does it improve others’ lives? 2) Will it produce long-term satisfaction? 3) When you’re on your deathbed, will you be glad you pursued this desire? Then, choose at least one of the desires that you deemed meaningful and share your answers to those three questions here.

Identify at least one trustworthy model for that meaningful desire, and describe why you think they’re a positive example for you. Consider both nearby models (such as family members or colleagues) and faraway models (such as celebrities or historical figures).

Describe a misleading desire you have that might interfere with your pursuit of that meaningful desire. (For example, the misleading desire of impressing your superiors and winning the “employee of the year” award might get in the way of your meaningful desire to build stronger relationships with your colleagues.)

Finally, make a plan for how you’ll resist that misleading desire so you can focus on pursuing more meaningful desires. (For example, you could set boundaries with a colleague who models that misleading desire.)
