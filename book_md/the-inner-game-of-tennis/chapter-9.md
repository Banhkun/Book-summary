## Chapter 9: On Competition

Once we find out what game we are playing, we have to figure out what winning means to us. **What’s most important is to disentangle winning and losing from our understanding of our self-worth.** The worst kind of competition is usually when the participants are using it to derive their self-worth.

There are two contradicting views on competition in the West: **Some believe it is responsible for society’s success, others that it is divisive and responsible for failure.**

  * Many children are brought up believing the former, and so every point becomes life or death. These children often turn into adults who want to succeed so much that they lose sight of everything else. 
  * Others rebel, pointing out the cruelty in this sort of society. In young people, this can manifest in a wish to fail. They don’t care that they lost because, according to them, they didn’t try. But even in this case, there’s an understanding that if they _did****_ try and lose, that would be a measure of their self-worth. 



If we don’t use competition to derive our self-worth, though, **what kind of meaning should we be finding in competition and winning? And how can playing better help us in the broader scheme of our mental health?**

This question is a difficult one—after managing to decouple competition and his self-worth, Gallwey himself had trouble finding motivation to compete.

To begin to answer this complex question, find the value in challenges and overcoming obstacles. The most accomplished someone can feel is when they have successfully used all of the skill, concentration, and general capability at their disposal.

**Winning is only valuable if it helps you achieve a meaningful goal.** Find goals that force you to exert yourself, mentally or physically, and then attempt to overcome the obstacles necessary to get there.

  * Consider a surfer’s goals. She is there to find her way all the way to shore in an attractive way, but she doesn’t take every wave that comes her way. She waits for a wave that’s going to be a challenge and fun to ride. 



Your opponent can become a friend because she is doing her best to be a difficult obstacle, thus making the goal of winning valuable. Competition, in this way, can be **indistinguishable from cooperation.** Each player benefits from the other’s attempts to make goals difficult to reach.

Understanding this can also make you a better player: If you have worries or qualms about being competitive or trying your hardest, understand that in a sense, iron sharpens iron. Beating someone does not increase your self-worth or decrease hers.
