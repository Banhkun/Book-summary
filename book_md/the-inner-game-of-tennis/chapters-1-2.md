## Chapters 1-2: Tennis as a Mental Game

In _The Inner Game of Tennis,_ tennis pro and educator Timothy Gallwey explores the mind games that exist both in tennis and the rest of our lives.

He argues that we aren’t practicing and learning correctly and suggests a new method that is based on the concepts of playing **an inner and an outer game** , governed by two selves, one that relies on instinct and the other that governs the thinking mind.

**While the greatest tennis players in the world are remarkable physical athletes, tennis is primarily a mental game. It is almost always your mind that keeps you from unlocking your true potential.**

Most pro tennis players don’t complain about any sort of physical limitations. Rather, they complain about mental limitations, their Inner Game: They play better in practice than in games, or they get nervous and lose concentration during big points.

However, most pros focus on the Outer Game. Consider the typical tennis lesson:

  * The tennis pro, not wanting to disappoint her client, will give her technical advice on basically every stroke.
  * The client, now constantly overthinking about how she can improve her game, will have dozens of technical lessons spinning in her head at the same time.



Now, consider the lesson where the pro scales back her comments significantly:

  * Strangely, issues that she notices but doesn’t comment on begin to fix themselves. Sometimes, the verbal commands actually **harm** rather than help. Why is this?



Commentators often describe players who are playing particularly well as playing “out of their mind” or “over their head.” Think about a lower seed in a tournament who upsets a great player by simply outplaying them. There’s an understanding, even if it isn’t said out loud, that when someone is playing “unconsciously” they’re actually more aware of their surroundings. What they’re not doing is thinking too actively or “over-trying.”

So the Inner Game is all about learning to play unconsciously without trying too hard to do just that.

### Two Selves

To understand the two selves, consider what players often say to themselves on the court—it’s all technical:

  * Keep your forehand level.
  * Meet the ball in front of you.
  * Get up for the ball.
  * Bend your knees.



When players fail at these technical instructions, they start scolding themselves.

When players talk to themselves this way, the “I” doing the talking and the “self” listening are, in essence, **two different selves. We’ll call these “Self 1” and “Self 2,” and they are at the very center of learning the Inner Game.**

  * **Self 1** is the “I” or the “ego-mind”—the part of the brain that questions the actions of the body and chastises the body for mistakes or rewards it for success. 
  * **Self 2** is the “myself” or the body—the physical self that is able to perform remarkable actions on a regular basis.



The **key** to improving your tennis game (and the rest of your life) is to improve your relationship between Self 1 and Self 2.

Think about Self 1 and Self 2 as two distinct humans:

  * Self 1 is constantly repeating itself and yelling at Self 2, even though Self 2 knows what to do and has heard it before.
  * Self 1 is also creating actual physical stress in Self 2: cheek muscles tightening and lips pursed.
  * Self 1 doesn’t trust Self 2 and then gets angry when Self 2 screws up.



### How Much Relaxing Is Too Much?

If this problem is related to trying too hard, and the answer is to relax, how far should we go? How much “trying” is enough? The answer is that there is a significant difference between “trying hard” and physical effort. We can think of “trying hard” as Self 1 castigating Self 2, while “effort” is the physical exertion it takes to do well. Think about the following example of Joan hitting a forehand:

> **Example: Joan’s Forehand**
> 
> Joan comes in for a tennis lesson complaining that she is constantly hitting the ball on the frame rather than nicely on the strings. Her eyesight is fine and she appears to be limber enough. But when her coach serves her 10 forehands, she hits eight on the frame.
> 
> Next, he asks her to try very hard to hit all 10 on the strings, expecting worse results. She actually manages to do a little better, hitting only 6/10 on the frame. After that, he asks her to _try_ to hit balls on the frame. She hits 4/10 on the frame and takes this at first to mean that she can never do what she tells herself to. She says this in frustration, but it actually might be the key to improving her game.
> 
> Next, he asks her to focus on the seams of the ball and not on the frame or the center of the racket at all. She hits 9/10 well, only 1/10 on the frame.
> 
> Joan didn’t exert less actual physical effort, she just exerted herself in a more productive way. She trained her focus on the ball rather than on not screwing up.

Players who successfully master the Inner Game are good at three specific skills:

  * First, figuring out **their own desired outcome:** You decide that you want to start hitting all of your shots deeper in the court. 
  * Second, **trusting Self 2 and not interfering too much:** You allow your body to do the work and develop the habits necessary to make your shots go deeper. 
  * Third, **thinking about themselves “nonjudgmentally”** —noticing what is happening without passing a value judgment on their performance: Even if you aren’t hitting all of your shots better right away, you don’t chastise yourself but you do recognize where your shots are going.



Each of these adds up to “**relaxed concentration,** ” which is the Platonic ideal of a successful tennis player: fully in control and fully relaxed at the same time.
