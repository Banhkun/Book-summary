## Chapter 4: Believing in Self 2

Now that we’ve discussed getting rid of self-judgment and quieting Self 1, we’ll move to finding self-confidence. This will allow you to give yourself over fully to Self 2.****

Your body performs all kinds of effort unconsciously—talking, reading, doing the necessary things to survive. All of this is completely removed from Self 1—you don’t have to actively tell yourself to do any of these functions.

Think about this in relation to tennis—there are all kinds of calculations that Self 2 does just to do something like return a serve: calculate speed, wind, direction, how quickly to swing, and so on. This is all done in somewhere around a second. **The human body can clearly do remarkable things on and off the tennis court—you just have to use it correctly.**

**We should be proud of the incredible things we can do rather than embarrassed by the things we cannot.** It doesn’t make much sense to be denigrating ourselves all the time for failing to complete actions that are remarkable. Additionally, Self 2 can pick up new skills very quickly. We should get excited about the new skills that we are learning.

### Respecting Self 2

Most of the problems previously described here, like giving too much self-instruction or trying too hard, come from Self 1 not acknowledging Self 2’s capabilities.

The maxim that we should all instead live by is “trust thyself.” This is not positive thinking. Rather, it is just allowing your body to hit the ball, or letting**** Self 2 do something like hit a powerful backhand.

#### Trusting Relationships

Self 1 and Self 2 are a bit like parent (Self 1) and child (Self 2). Trusting parents will let their children try things and make mistakes because it helps them grow.

If there is no trust between Self 1 and Self 2, we will see the physical tightening previously discussed. If you exert too much effort, you use more muscles than are necessary. This both wastes energy and interferes with the action, because some tightened muscles don’t allow others to relax that need to.

This is clear in tennis—a relaxed wrist allows for a snap and more torque, adding more power to the ball. If muscles are too tight, the ball will be less accurate and slower.

We should trust tennis strokes like capable parents trust their kids to learn to walk. Don’t _identify_ with the stroke, in the same way the parent wouldn’t identify with the child who’s unable yet to walk.

### Letting Yourself Learn

If your body already knows how to do something like hit a forehand, you should **let it happen.** If not, you should **let it learn.** The more Self 2 practices, the more the body learns. The brain picks up and stores things like what a nice stroke feels like, how quickly the ball comes at you, and so on.

Think about this like learning a dance:

  * If you have to learn something like the foxtrot and are taught all of the steps, it takes forever to figure out.
  * On the other hand, if you’re out one night and you’re watching your friend do a dance, which is probably much more complicated than the foxtrot, you can often pick it up right away, because you absorb the visual in front of you and then feel what it’s like to imitate that image.
  * **If you’re asked to explain how to do that dance, you probably wouldn’t be able to, but you could demonstrate. By contrast, most tennis players can give a very detailed explanation of how to hit a ball properly, but can’t do it on a consistent basis themselves.** This shows we’re learning the game of tennis all wrong.****



Use **imagery** to communicate with your body. Here are three strategies:

  * **Ask for results:** Imagine the result that you want—in tennis, hitting a forehand deep into the court with power. 
  * **Ask for form:** Imagine a change in the way that your body should move—for example, if you know you’re rolling over too much on the ball, think about exactly how you want your stroke to look. Consider shutting your eyes as you practice this. 
  * **Ask for qualities:** Pretend to be someone other than yourself—in the case of tennis, be a professional, and try to play like her. Or, adopt a style of playing tennis entirely different from the one you’re used to: if you’re a defensive player waiting to make a mistake, try to hit lots of winners. If you’re a more formal player, adopt a scrappier style. This will help you realize that you can rely on all of these qualities as a player. 



> If you have access to tennis courts, try these experiments:
> 
> Using these strategies, try to hit a stationary target with a tennis ball. Once you’re successful, move the target around to other places on the court, keeping in mind everything about not trying too hard and imagining the ball hitting the object. The ball will either hit the target or not—every time, notice where it lands, without passing judgment.
> 
> Choose a bad habit that you know you have on the court. Try the way you are used to trying to correct the habit and have a friend watch you and let you know if there are any changes. Then, don’t make any attempt to change your habit and just closely observe your results while hitting. Finally, use the imagery strategies just discussed—ask for results, form, qualities, or all three—and watch your results closely without judgment.
