## Chapters 5-6: Finding Proper Technique and Making It Permanent

**Physical technique is also, of course, an important part of a successful player’s game. Trusting Self 2 can improve your physical as well as your mental game.**

At times, you’ll have to and want to give your body instruction. This should be based on the natural learning your body does already. You already know how to learn, so don’t try to interfere with that process.

  * Think about animals: Young animals are taught how to walk or swim or run by their parents, who give them only the slightest amount of instruction and some encouragement, and then allow their young to repeat and learn the activity themselves. 



Technical instructions are a modern innovation. Experience had to proceed instruction or technical knowledge, because how would that knowledge have been acquired in the first place? Verbal instruction comes from people with experience, but when it’s passed on to people with no experience, it’s harder to understand. There’s a huge split between mind and body.

Words can give an approximation or a description of actions or ideas or experiences, but they are not the actions or ideas themselves. This is why we learn so much better when our mind allows our bodies to lead.

Verbal instruction can sometimes lead to tennis players hitting good shots but thinking that they are doing something wrong because their form is different from what they’ve been told it should look like. This overcorrection can set people back very far in their games. Thus, we have to trust feeling more than verbal communication.

Nevertheless, some instructions are useful, so long as they guide one’s own discovery process. Think about the suggestion: “Keep the wrist tight while hitting the backhand.”

  * The wrist can be not tight enough but it can also be too tight. So allow this instruction to guide your own discovery and **experiment with wrist tightness** rather than being sure it needs to be tighter. Hit shots with a tighter grip and then a less tight grip.**** What feels good and what doesn’t? What’s the level of tightness, based on observation, that is comfortable and works best? 
  * This can also be applied to watching pro tennis: What are they doing that you’d like to do? What specific moves work with your own body or Self 2?



Gallwey includes some technical instruction here that he pairs with some awareness teaching. Consider here some common instructions for ground strokes, serves, and volleys, and how you should use observation to your advantage. Remember to use the instruction as a starting point, but to rely primarily on your own observations to figure out what works for you.

(Shortform note: Since the book was published in 1974, some of these techniques are outdated.)

| **Instruction** | **Observation**  
---|---|---  
**Ground Strokes** | Follow through at the level of your shoulder.  | Notice where you’re following through and how close it is to your shoulder.   
| Bring back the racket early.  | Notice where your racket is usually when the ball bounces.   
| Bend your knees and get down on the ball.  | Observe how much your knees are bending when you hit.   
| Swing up on the ball to produce more topspin.  | Watch where your racket is connecting with the ball and how much topspin you’re creating.   
**Serve** | Extend your arm.  | Feel how much your elbow is bending.   
| Toss the ball so that you connect with full extension.  | Watch how high you’re tossing the ball, practice tosses without hitting the serve.   
**Volley** | Connect in the center of the racket.  | Sense without looking where you’re connecting.   
| Plant the back foot.  | Feel your weight and how much of it is on the back foot.   
| Connect with the ball in front of you.  | Observe where you’re connecting.   
| Volley deep in the court.  | Observe where the ball is landing.   
| Don’t bring your racket back too far; punch at the ball.  | Discern the minimum amount you can bring your racket back.   
| Hit the ball before it drops to net level.  | Think about how much space there is between the net and the ball when you connect.   
  
### Fixing Bad Habits

**Even once we start learning about Self 1, Self 2, and the Inner Game, it's easy to fall back into bad habits.**

Tennis players (or golf players, or anyone else) will “groove” strokes: They’ll start swinging one way and then continue to swing that way, creating a deep habit or “groove” that becomes harder to change the longer it’s done. These patterns do serve a function—getting the ball over the net—and their success at getting the job done reinforces the pattern. However, although the habit might accomplish the goal, it often doesn’t do it efficiently or consistently.

When players are attempting to break out of grooves they don’t like, you’ll see them exerting a ton of energy, starting to do the thing they don’t want to and then gritting their teeth and correcting themselves.

Let’s consider the usual process of learning, which goes something like this:

  1. **You criticize yourself for your past behavio** r: “You’re rolling over your forehand again. You always do this. How many times do you have to be taught to stop?!”
  2. **You verbally argue with yourself about the need for change** : “Hit the ball out front! Follow through!”
  3. **You exert yourself to make sure you’re doing the new thing correctly** , using all of your Self 1 energy to focus on your issue. 
  4. **You create a vicious cycle as you criticize yourself when you don’t immediately see results** : “What’s wrong with you?! You can’t even fix your problems!”



### Building New Grooves

So, how do you fix these grooves? The best way to learn is not to try to break out of bad grooves but to **start new ones.**

  1. **Observe without judgment:** Begin by swinging without any conscious control: Don’t try to change anything and let yourself fall into any grooves you have. As you’ve been taught earlier in this book, just observe carefully. You might see that you’re serving a lot of balls into the left side of the net. 
  2. **Identify your patterns and rhythm:** Then get in touch with the rhythm of your stroke. It’s quite possible that just by doing these things, your stroke will begin to change. Let this happen. You might notice that you’re not following through much on your serve, for example. 



If you do these first two things, you should have a good idea of what you want to change in your stroke, such as more spin on your serve or more power that allows you to hit further into the service box.

  1. **Imagine the desired outcome:** Next, picture the result you want: The ball going across the court with better accuracy and power or to a specific spot. Think about hitting a serve so that the ball barely clears the net and hits right in the back corner of the service box. 
  2. **Swing with a picture:** Then, begin to hit again with this picture in your mind. If you don’t reach your desired outcome, ask yourself what’s wrong. If you can’t diagnose it yourself, you can ask a pro, who should _show****_ you how to improve your swing, not just _tell****_ you what you’re doing wrong.
  3. **Try out different feelings:** Experiment with what the pro tells you. For example, hold your racket tighter or less tight and see what happens. Don’t try too hard at a _fix,_ though, just experiment with different grips and observe the outcomes without judgment. It’s common for this process to lead to inconsistency at first, because you’re experimenting with lots of new habits and making lots of quick changes to your swing. Don’t worry or get down on yourself! You’ll start to develop new grooves that are better soon enough. 



In following this process, you can see new outcomes or habits and start to form better grooves.

This Inner-Game process is focused on nonjudgmental observation and manifesting better results. The criticism that’s so essential to the usual learning process is totally gone. Instead of trying _really hard_ to learn things with Self 1, we let go and allow Self 2 to learn.

The great thing about this is we **already know how to do this.** Think about how children learn: When they’re learning to walk, they don’t chastise themselves for not knowing how, they just replace their habit of crawling with walking slowly. Sure, they fall down a lot at first, but who cares?

#### Avoiding Self 1’s Return

One potential pitfall here is the return of Self 1:

  * After making progress, students will sometimes go back to their old habits the next day, and won’t seem to mind, even though they are playing worse.
  * This is because the kind of effort that is involved in Self 1-controlled players is driven by ego. It’s easy to believe in your own head that you deserve more credit when you exert energy than when you just let good results happen. Then, if you start to exert yourself more than is necessary, you’ll get back into your own head rather than allowing your body to move. 
  * This is often accompanied by the feeling that you understand the “secret” to playing well is “relaxing.” But relaxing won’t happen if you try really hard to relax.
  * Instead, just give Self 2 the credit! Realize that your body is helping you succeed.
