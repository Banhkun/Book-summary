## Exercise: Which “O” Are You?

While Gallwey’s examples are concerned primarily with tennis, his categorizations work for many things in life. In this exercise, you’ll consider your own motivations.

* * *

Choose a sport or activity that you do frequently and consider “Good-o,” “Friends-o,” and “Health-o-Fun-o,” along with their subgames. What games and subgames do you play? Why?

How have the subgames that you play affected your life positively?

How have they presented challenges?
