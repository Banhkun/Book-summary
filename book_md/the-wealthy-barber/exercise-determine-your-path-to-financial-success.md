## Exercise: Determine Your Path to Financial Success

When it comes to financial planning, Chilton emphasizes starting as early as you can, so you can take advantage of compound interest, dollar-cost averaging, tax deductions, and other methods for saving money and accumulating wealth. Consider where you are on your path to financial success, and what additional steps you want to take.

* * *

Describe where you are on the path to financial success. Are you just starting out? Do you have the fundamentals down, but feel you need to do more? Do you have a plan in place, but think it might be too heavy on certain types of investments?

In light of where you are on your financial journey, what additional steps do you want to take to achieve financial success (for example, saving for retirement, minimizing your taxes, making a will)?

How do you plan to implement those steps (for example, researching index funds, hiring a financial advisor, contributing to a Roth IRA, paying off your debts, and cutting up your credit cards)?
