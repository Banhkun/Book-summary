## Exercise: Plan Your First Steps Toward Productivity and Fulfillment

Reflect on what you’ve read to see how Bullet Journaling might improve your life.

* * *

After reading about the Bullet Journal Method, how do you think it has the potential to improve your productivity? (For example, perhaps you struggle with time management and think the time blocking method could help you get more done.)

Similarly, how do you think it could improve the overall quality of your life? (For instance, maybe you’ve realized you aren’t as self-aware as you’d like to be, and you feel that taking notes on your interactions with friends could positively impact your social life.)

With those considerations in mind, name three to four goals you can set for yourself to improve your productivity or overall quality of life. (For example, you could set a goal to use the time blocking method to finally finish that painting commission you’ve been procrastinating on.)

What is one specific action you can take to ensure that you make progress toward each goal? (For instance, you could commit to blocking off one hour of your day tomorrow to work on your painting.)
