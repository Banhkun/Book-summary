## Shortform Introduction

_The Bullet Journal Method_ is a beginner’s guide to using the Bullet Journal Method: a single-notebook system designed to help you get organized, live in the present moment, and gain clarity about what’s important to you through comprehensive planning of and reflection on tasks and events. In addition to describing how the method works and what you need to get started, the book explores how maintaining a Bullet Journaling practice can improve your productivity and quality of life.

### About the Author

Ryder Carroll is a digital product designer from New York. Throughout his career, he’s worked with notable companies such as Adidas, American Express, Cisco, IBM, Macy’s, and HP.

After he was diagnosed with learning disabilities in high school, Carroll was determined to find a strategy to improve his focus and productivity. Following years of trial and error, he used his experience with scrapbooking, journaling, and web design to develop what he called the Bullet Journal Method. Although Carroll initially kept the method to himself, he later streamlined it and introduced it to the public through a website launch in 2013.

After the site went viral, Carroll’s method rose in popularity and was featured by the _New York Times_ , the LA Times, _Forbes_ , the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, _Vogue_ , _Fast Company_ , and _Bloomberg_ , among others. When he realized just how much it had impacted people’s lives, he decided to write a book, _The Bullet Journal Method_ , to demonstrate how you can use the method to tackle not only productivity but also many other of life’s biggest challenges.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Portfolio, a division of Penguin Random House

_The Bullet Journal Method_ was Carroll’s first (and, thus far, only) book. It was published in 2018 following the success of the launch of the Bullet Journal Method website. Carroll wanted to write a book to explore how to use the method as a practice in mindfulness and intentionality rather than just productivity.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

While the Bullet Journal Method is a unique system, its usefulness arguably stems from the way it combines many journaling and productivity tools into one streamlined method. To take full advantage of the method’s customizability, Carroll recommends that readers call on existing resources such as lists, calendars, schedules, habit trackers, gratitude logs, and creative journaling.

In addition, although Carroll dedicates a large part of the book to the Bullet Journal Method itself, he also pulls from a variety of philosophies to explore how the method can help you overcome challenges like maximizing time, cultivating gratitude, and letting go of what you can’t control. In particular, Carroll references the Greek and Greco-Roman philosophies of Eudaimonism and Stoicism, the Japanese concepts of _ikigai_ and _kaizen_ , and problem-solving techniques like sprints and rubber ducking from the field of software development.

#### The Book’s Impact

Given that the Bullet Journal Method was already popular before _The Bullet Journal Method_ ’s publication (having already garnered significant followings on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube), the book was well-received, which helped extend the method to an even wider audience. It became a New York Times and international best seller and has been published in more than 28 languages. In addition, following the book’s publication in 2018, there was not only an 18% increase in the sale of unruled notebooks in the US from the year before but also a significant growth in the sale of other stationery products.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Overall, reviewers agree that _The Bullet Journal Method_ provides valuable insight to both those who are new to the method and those who consider themselves veterans. This is because the book covers not only the system itself but also ways you can use it to improve your life.

As for the book’s general audience, those who enjoyed it agree that reading it would benefit everyone interested in productivity and self-improvement, whether or not they’ve used the Bullet Journal Method before. They praise how the book utilizes anecdotes and data to back up the author’s claims as well as useful diagrams to demonstrate how the method works. Additionally, they like that the book focuses on both _how_ and _why_ to use the method. Overall, they feel that it helped them reconnect with what truly matters to them.

On the other hand, critics of the book think it focuses too heavily on self-improvement and too lightly on the details of how to use the method. In addition, they claim the book is poorly written and that the author’s recommendations are weak and easily discernible without the help of his book. Moreover, some artistically-inclined readers say the book fails to provide creative inspiration.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Carroll’s demonstration of the Bullet Journal Method system and how to customize it is effective. He consistently pairs written descriptions of the system with relevant examples, visual aids, and diagrams that help clarify any uncertainty about how the method works. One potential exception is Carroll’s description of “threading,” a technique that’s supposed to reduce the time you spend searching for pages of related content. Even with a visual aid, it’s difficult to grasp how to implement the technique.

Meanwhile, Carroll’s discussion of how to use the Bullet Journal Method to increase productivity and improve your life has positives and negatives. On the one hand, his anecdotes and references add credibility to his ideas and make compelling arguments for why you should use his method. For example, in the section titled “Imperfection,” Carroll first introduces the Japanese concept of _wabi-sabi_ (beauty is found in imperfection), as well as the Japanese culture’s focus on mastery over perfection, to inspire readers to see themselves and their efforts in a different light that eschews perfectionism. Then, he provides an immediate opportunity for application by describing how readers can implement these ideas into their Bullet Journal practice.

On the other hand, Carroll’s flow of ideas tends to meander and repeat, making it somewhat difficult to identify his main point. For example, in the section titled “Meaning,” Carroll alternates between the idea that we’re searching for fulfillment in the wrong places and the idea that we can find happiness by doing what’s meaningful. In doing so, he ultimately buries the main point—that fulfillment comes from doing what we find worthwhile. While readers may eventually deduce Carroll’s primary idea, the structure of his argument makes reaching this conclusion burdensome.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

At surface level, the book’s organization is logical. Carroll divides it into parts that establish a foundational understanding of the Bullet Journal Method before exploring how to make the most of the practice. Specifically, he ensures that readers grasp the basic components of his method before diving into how they can tailor their journals to their needs.

However, some of Carroll’s within-part organizational choices interrupt the flow of his ideas. For example, in Part 1, although he begins intuitively by discussing how he developed the Bullet Journal Method, why readers should use it, and what to expect from the book, the organization then becomes less coherent. Instead of exploring how to get started, he backtracks to provide additional justification for why you should use his method. Then, he changes topic twice more by introducing a mind-decluttering exercise before discussing why notebooks are fundamental to Bullet Journaling and how handwriting is beneficial.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve modified the book’s original organization in three ways. First, we’ve rearranged the book’s parts to progress from concrete to abstract ideas. Specifically, we’ve switched the order of Parts 3 and 4—whereas Part 4 discusses concrete strategies for customizing the design of your journal, Part 3 more broadly discusses how to put Bullet Journaling into practice to tackle life’s challenges. Therefore, we felt that Part 3—which focuses on big-picture application—would be better positioned as a concluding culmination of the ideas presented in the book.

Second, we’ve created new subdivisions within parts that clearly separate ideas we felt were distinct. In particular, we’ve divided Carroll’s Part 3 into two (Parts 4 and 5 in our guide) to differentiate between two themes: productivity and living a high-quality life. Similarly, we’ve split Part 2 into sub-parts that divide Carroll’s ideas into two topics: how to get started with Bullet Journaling and the role of reflection in the system.

Finally, we’ve shifted the order of certain sections and ideas to better suit our guide’s revised organizational structure and progression of ideas. For example, in Part 2, instead of discussing the Bullet Journal Method’s basic components in isolation from how to create those components in your journal (as Carroll does), we’ve chosen to integrate his instructions into the description of each component.

In addition to these organizational changes, we’ve included commentary that offers counterpoints to Carroll’s arguments, expands on his claims with scientific research, and supplements his design recommendations with ideas from the Bullet Journaling community. We also compare some of Carroll’s ideas to those explored in other self-improvement and productivity-themed works, including _Tiny Habits_ , _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ , _Goals!_ , _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , and _The Happiness Project_.
