## Part 4: Putting Productivity Into Practice

In Part 3, we discussed the different tools you can use to customize your Bullet Journal according to your individual needs. In Part 4, we’ll explore several ways in which Carroll suggests you can put Bullet Journaling into practice to become _truly_ productive. Specifically, we’ll talk about Carroll’s strategies for setting goals, pursuing continual improvement, maximizing your time, breaking down challenges, and finding inspiration when you feel stuck.

### Setting Goals

Goal setting is a fundamental component of productivity. However, Carroll argues, **if we don’t have continued personal investment in the goals that we set for ourselves, we’re likely to lose motivation** and ultimately face disappointment.

(Shortform note: According to a popular theory of goal-setting developed in the 1990s, personal investment is just one of five principles of successful goal setting. The other four principles are the goal’s specificity, level of challenge, and level of complexity, as well as the presence of feedback.)

Unfortunately, Carroll says **we tend to set goals based on misguided parameters that lack meaning** , which makes personal investment difficult or impossible. In particular, we choose goals based on others’ experiences (like aiming to save for a house because that’s what your peers are doing), goals that are reactionary (like deciding to run a marathon because your friend said she thought you couldn’t), and goals that are too lofty (like trying to open a tattoo parlor with no prior experience).

(Shortform note: Setting goals based on meaningless parameters isn’t the only goal-setting obstacle we can run into. In _Goals!_ , Brian Tracy crucial goal-setting pitfalls to avoid to ensure you choose relevant and fulfilling goals. Specifically, he advises that you steer clear of goals that are too vague or unquantifiable, goals that fail to push you out of your comfort zone, goals that have no time frame for completion, and goals that conflict with each other. Even if you avoid the misguided parameters Carroll notes above, you likely won’t successfully meet fulfilling goals if you fall victim to any of these pitfalls.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

To help you be more intentional about choosing goals that genuinely motivate you, Carroll suggests a series of exercises that encourage you to explore what sparks your curiosity, prioritize what matters most, and devise a plan for how to take action. First, he recommends that you **brainstorm a list of personal and professional goals and add them to a goals-focused customized section**.

Next, Carroll suggests that you **set timelines for your goals by categorizing them as short, mid, or long term**. This helps you reflect on the effort required to accomplish them, which is important for maintaining motivation. To do this, he recommends that you open to the spread of pages following your goals section and label the left side “personal” and the right side “professional.” Then, divide each side into five rows that represent progressively shorter periods: years, months, weeks, days, and hours. Finally, transfer the goals from your goals section into one of the five time periods on either the personal or professional side.

Once you’ve categorized all of your goals according to your desired timeline, Carroll says **you should** **prioritize them even further, because committing to too many goals at once can cause overwhelm and decreased motivation**. First, he advises that you reflect on whether each goal is worth the effort. If it’s not, cross it out. Next, mark your highest priority personal and professional goal with a signifier (*) in each of the five rows, which will leave you with 10 goals in total. Finally, transfer the four goals you want to complete in the next several hours and days to your daily record, marking them with a signifier to ensure that they receive your focus.

(Shortform note: In addition to causing overwhelm and decreased motivation, setting too many goals can negatively affect your ability to prioritize. According to management experts, when we have many different goals, we’re prone to prioritizing the easiest ones. As a consequence, we ignore or abandon the goals that are more difficult to achieve—but are potentially the most worthwhile. Therefore, aim to focus on a limited number of goals at any given time.)

> **Additional Tips for Setting Goals**
> 
> Carroll’s recommendations are a good place to start, but he doesn’t cover every step of the goal-setting process in detail. To help you dive a little deeper, here are a couple of additional goal-setting suggestions.
> 
> First, to help you brainstorm a list of goals for your customized section, there are several methods you can try. The first is to write down every goal you can think of in stream-of-consciousness fashion. Another is to ask yourself goal-specific questions to inspire additional steps or ideas (for example, if your goal is to knit a scarf, asking yourself what specific skills you need can lead to a preliminary goal of mastering the garter stitch). Or, if you prefer something more visual, you can try mind mapping, which involves drawing a “map” that starts with one central goal and branches out to related goals.
> 
> In addition, as an alternative to dividing your goals into just two categories (personal and professional)—which may not allow for a thorough assessment of how you intend to allocate your time and energy—you can choose to organize your goals into several more specific categories, such as career, health, family, money, spiritual, and personal. Using this strategy, you can better assess where your focus is, try to strike a balance between all areas of your life, and maximize your individual growth.

### Pursuing Continual Improvement

Carroll says that another key to productivity is continual improvement. **When we focus on making progress one step at a time, we’re not only more likely to succeed but can also enact large amounts of change gradually**.

(Shortform note: Why are small adjustments more conducive to behavioral change? In _Tiny Habits_ , BJ Fogg argues that change is more successful when we’re feeling positive, and positivity is more easily cultivated when we experience the small successes that come from gradual change.)

Despite the benefits of focusing on continual change, Carroll argues, **we often make the mistake of trying to enact big, immediate changes**. While it’s understandable to want to improve, great accomplishments require great effort, and such enormous undertakings can cause us to feel overwhelmed and even paralyzed by fear. What’s more, he adds, when we can’t make the changes we were hoping for, we tend to see it as a personal failure.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll observes that we often try to make sweeping changes, he doesn’t explore _why_ this might be the case. Experts say that the reason we attempt to enact big, immediate changes is that we psychologically view change as a straightforward progression. In reality, however, change isn’t linear. Instead, we progress through a series of stages in a back-and-forth fashion, repeating certain steps again and again until change successfully occurs.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

To shift your mindset to continual improvement, Carroll recommends that you **break down large goals into smaller, self-contained projects**. Doing so can help you see your progress and therefore motivate you to keep moving forward.

(Shortform note: Motivation isn’t the only benefit that comes from tracking your progress. According to the American Psychological Association, frequently monitoring progress toward your goals directly increases your chances of success. What’s more, those chances increase even more if you record your progress or report it publicly.)

For each of your goals, Carroll recommends **creating a separate customized section in which you can break it down into different projects** —whatever makes sense for the particular goal. For example, if your overarching goal is to learn to speak Portuguese, you could break it down into a series of smaller projects beginning with memorizing the most-used words in the language.

**To determine the appropriate tasks for each self-contained project** , Carroll advises that you **ask yourself simple questions** like “What small step can I take to move forward right now?” The easier the step is, the more likely you are to follow through. To continue the example, you could break down the project of memorizing the most-used words in Portuguese into smaller tasks like learning verbs, nouns, adjectives, and so on.

(Shortform note: Carroll’s recommendation to break projects down into actionable steps is especially helpful when you’re not sure how to achieve a goal. In other cases, however, it may make more sense to divide goals using a simple unit of measurement like time or quantity. For example, if your goal is to organize your garage, you could commit to spending 30 minutes per day decluttering until it’s finished. If your goal is to learn to make bread, you could plan to bake one loaf every week for a year.)

### Maximizing Time

According to Carroll, true productivity requires that we take full advantage of the time we have. He says that **while we only have so much time available, we have the power to make our time more valuable** by being mindful about how we spend it.

(Shortform note: Carroll suggests that we can make our time more valuable—but what does “valuable” actually mean in this context? Would everyone agree on what is a “valuable” use of time? Arguably not—for example, for some, time is worth the most when they use it to make money, which is evident in Western culture’s use of the phrase “time is money.” For others, time is most valuable when spent with loved ones, or when pursuing a hobby. It’s therefore down to you to decide what constitutes a valuable use of your time.)

Sometimes, however, it feels as if this is easier said than done. In addition to the endless task lists and distractions that cause us to feel perpetually busy and lose track of time (as previously discussed), **there are moments when we worry that we don’t have enough time left** and are wasting it away. Especially in Western culture, we fear death and the change that comes with it.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll mentions Western culture’s fear of death, he doesn’t explain what causes these fears and how they impact perception and behavior. While almost every culture experiences some extent of anxiety surrounding death, they differ in how they manage it. Western cultures are considered “death-defying,” which means they have a strong aversion to death. On the one hand, this helps people in Western cultures by causing them to do anything it takes to stay alive and therefore pour more energy into leaving a lasting legacy. On the other hand, it influences negative and even potentially destructive behaviors, such as avoiding confrontation with dying loved ones or participating in risky activities like skydiving, as acts of defiance.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Fortunately, time doesn’t have to be your enemy. Carroll says that **to increase the impact of your time, be more strategic about how you spend it**. He recommends two methods to help you do this: time boxing and scheduling.

According to Carroll, **time boxing** **is a method in which you allot a specific amount of time to complete or make progress on a task**. (For example, if you need to write a blog post for a client, you would block off 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and commit to finishing the blog post within that window.) Carroll argues that this method is beneficial because it forces you to remain focused to accomplish your goal within the allotted time period. Not only does this prevent your responsibilities from dragging on unnecessarily, but it also frees up time to spend on other things you want to do.

(Shortform note: In his explanation of time boxing, Carroll focuses exclusively on its advantages. However, there are some disadvantages to be aware of when choosing whether to use the strategy. One downfall of time boxing is that it forces you to stop working on a task once the allotted time has passed, and this can be disruptive if you’re in a state of flow. Additionally, time boxing can pressure you to rush tasks that require time and focus, therefore reducing the overall quality of your work. Finally, it’s not always easy to select an appropriate amount of time to work on a task—too long and you lose focus, too short and you don’t accomplish what you intended.)

Second, Carroll explains that **scheduling is a method in which you plan to complete the most challenging tasks during your most productive time of day**. (For example, if you know you work best in the morning, plan to do the most difficult task of the day first.) By working _with_ your energy levels rather than _against_ them, Carroll argues, you can complete challenging tasks more easily and therefore build motivation to work on other projects.

(Shortform note: While it can be useful to know your most productive time of day, it’s not always easy to recognize. Although Carroll doesn’t give any tips for how to determine when you’re most productive, there are resources that can help. For example, chronotype theory, which assigns each person to one of four animal-based categories based on their internal clock, can give you insight into your productivity patterns and help you plan your day-to-day schedule more wisely.)

### Deconstruct Challenges

Another fundamental component of productivity is learning to face our challenges. Carroll argues that **the key to overcoming obstacles is breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components that empower us to take action**.

However, Carroll says that despite having the power to make choices that can alter our circumstances, we tend to see them as entirely outside of our control and therefore feel powerless. For example, being obligated to pay down student debt can make you feel powerless over your financial situation because having high interest rates outside of your control hinders your ability to save money.

(Shortform note: While Carroll’s argument that we always have the power to act is an attractive theory, it may not always be realistic or straightforward. Victims of systemic oppression, for example, don’t necessarily have access to the same level of resources and opportunities as the average person. Therefore, although everyone has the power to make choices, the impact of those choices may not be as significant for those who face high levels of inequality.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

To take your power back and address your challenges head-on, **Carroll recommends that you create a new customized section and use the “Five Whys” method**. The founder of Toyota, Sakichi Toyoda, created the method to uncover problems and find solutions.

**The method: Choose a problem and ask why it’s occurring five times**. For example:

  * I’m struggling to lose weight → _Why?_
  * Because I don’t have time to exercise → _Why?_
  * Because I’m really busy at work → _Why?_
  * Because I’m working alone on a big project → _Why?_
  * Because my boss thinks it’s a one-person job → _Why?_
  * Because I’ve done similar work in the past, even though I got burnt out



(Shortform note: In addition to uncovering the root of a problem, you can use the Five Whys method to help you discover your underlying motivation. Instead of asking “why?” to solve a problem, you can instead ask “why do I want this?” to find the purpose of a goal.)

Carroll says that by asking these questions, you can see beyond the superficial to everything that’s involved in the problem. What’s more, **once you’ve broken the problem down into parts, you can start to find solutions targeting each component**. For instance, if you don’t have time to exercise, you could wake up earlier, meal prep on the weekends, bike to work, and so on.

(Shortform note: Although Carroll suggests the Five Whys for uncovering the root causes of a problem, he doesn't mention the Five Hows, which is an accompanying technique used to develop a solution to that problem. Just as with the Five Whys, you can begin with an initial solution and ask yourself “how?” to brainstorm the details of that solution. For example, if your solution to having no time to exercise is to wake up earlier, by asking “how?” you can identify an action that will realize that solution, such as “go to bed earlier the night before.”)

### Finding Inspiration

When it comes to productivity, Carroll argues that **the right tools can help us find inspiration and pick up momentum when we feel stuck**. When working toward our goals, it’s common to feel as if we’re not moving forward due to things like lack of motivation or imperceptible progress. For example, while training for a marathon, you may begin to feel stuck when you don’t see consistent progress in your mile time.

(Shortform note: In addition to preventing us from reaching our goals, feeling stuck can have negative psychological consequences. In particular, feelings of stagnation often mask more severe feelings of anxiety. They can also cause irritability, lethargy, frustration, or even numbness. What’s more, feeling stuck can worsen our tendency to procrastinate because we desperately want to escape our difficult feelings so focus on more pleasurable things.)

#### The Bullet Journal Solution

Carroll recommends two strategies for finding inspiration and getting unstuck. The first is to **explain your problem or challenge to someone else**. By describing your problem in detail to another person, you’ll likely begin to see it from a different perspective and uncover potential solutions.

However, because there may not always be someone available to talk to, Carroll suggests using your journal to recreate the experience. To do this, begin a new customized section and pretend to write a letter to someone—whomever you feel like. As you write, take time to explain your problem as if they’re there in front of you. Importantly, Carroll says you should assume the person has limited information so that you’re forced to describe every aspect of the problem. **Talk about what it is and why it’s happening, the solutions you have and haven’t tried, and what you want the outcome to be**.

The second of Carroll’s strategies is to **divert your attention from your current problem to a mini-project that can inspire fresh ideas and motivation**. He says the mini-project should be related to something you’re curious about (rather than an obligation), unrelated to your current problem or project, and possible to complete in two weeks or less. To plan out the mini-project, Carroll advises that you choose a goal from your goals-focused customized section and break it down just as he described when discussing continual improvement.

(Shortform note: Neuroscience research seems to support Carroll’s recommendation to divert your attention to find inspiration. According to experts, the brain thrives on wandering into new and unexpected ideas and experiences. This is because the more information you expose to your brain, the more connections it can make. By temporarily shifting gears and focusing on an entirely different project, you’re giving your brain the opportunity to stumble into innovative ideas.)

> **Talking Your Way to a Solution**
> 
> Others disagree with Carroll’s claim that you can recreate the experience of explaining a problem to someone by writing in your journal. For instance, in _Consciousness Explained_ , cognitive philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that simply thinking about problems isn’t as effective as talking about them out loud. He theorizes that the reason for this is that thinking doesn’t engage as many parts of the brain as speaking, and therefore you’re less likely to come up with solutions without real discussion.
> 
> Research in the field of neuroscience provides some support for this theory. During conversations, our brains experience neurochemical reactions that change our body’s chemistry. What’s more, we can influence each other’s nervous systems in a positive way, increasing understanding, trust, compassion, and cooperation. In other words, by having conversations with others, we can create an environment that’s highly conducive to problem-solving. This may mean that Carroll’s journaling alternative won’t be as effective as conversing with a real person.
