## Exercise: How Viable Is Your Business Idea?

Ali and Kubba say a good business idea solves a problem that you’re passionate about _and_ matches your unfair advantages.

* * *

Briefly describe one business idea you’ve been considering. What problem does it solve? Who’s your target audience?

What clues have you gotten that there’s sufficient demand for your idea? For example, maybe you’ve observed people struggling with a routine task, or you’ve been frustrated by a subpar product or service.

Which unfair advantages do you have that will help you achieve success with this idea? Write down two or three ways you can leverage each unfair advantage to advance your idea.

What competition exists for your idea? How can you stand out from the competition?
