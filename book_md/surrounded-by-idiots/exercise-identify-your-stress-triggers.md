## Exercise: Identify Your Stress Triggers

The way we react to stress is part of our innate personality, unless we actively work to change it. By recognizing your triggers and response, you can control and modify your behavior.

* * *

Think back to the last time you felt stressed by a situation. What was going on, and how did your stress manifest? (For example, did you yell or find somewhere to be alone? Did you feel paralyzed or did you launch into action?)

Describe a time when your coping mechanism for stress caused a conflict or misunderstanding with someone else.

Write two sentences that you can deliver to a colleague when you need to cope with stress. In the first sentence, declare your state of being. In the second sentence, state what you’ll do to resolve the stress. (For example, “I’m feeling overwhelmed. I’m going to go for a walk to clear my head.)
