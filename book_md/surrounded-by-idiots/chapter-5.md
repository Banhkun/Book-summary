## Chapter 5: Communication Styles

So far, Erikson has explained the four personality types and discussed their traits, behavior patterns, and how others perceive them. **In this chapter, Erikson focuses on how each color communicates** **using their** **body language, vocal cues, and style of writing**. Remember, communication happens on the listener’s terms, so when you’re able to identify a person’s personality type using clues in their communication style, conversations become more effective.

### Body Language

In this section, Erikson discusses **each personality’s unique use of body language.** By recognizing each color type’s physical patterns, you should experience a greater ease in communication and fewer misunderstandings.

#### Red Personality Type’s Body Language

According to Erikson, everything about a Red personality’s body language is direct and aggressive, especially if they’re trying to make a point (which happens often). **They shake your hand firmly, look into your eyes, lean forward when speaking, and use sharp hand gestures**. He says Red types often wear serious, focused facial expressions unless actively engaged in a fun activity. They tend to keep others at arm’s distance and are**** not big on hugging (even in social situations).

(Shortform note: Erikson says that people with dominant personalities exhibit specific body language characteristics, but do some people _weaponize_ body language with an intent _to dominate?_ _Psychology Today_ describes how some men use body language to control others (especially women). Lingering and intense eye contact, invasion of personal space, and non-consensual touching (such as shushing someone by touching their lips), are all warning signs that someone is attempting to intimidate you.)

#### Yellow Personality Type’s Body Language

Erikson says that while Yellow personalities are similar to Red types in many ways, they have different body language styles. Where Red-dominant people are physically standoffish, he says **Yellow personalities have little to no sense of personal space**. They have no problem sitting close to another person, they enjoy hugging, and they touch people frequently. He says this might look like a knowing hand on the shoulder or a joking slap on the back. They smile without obvious reason and have a relaxed, comfortable posture.

(Shortform note: If this is your body language style, it’s helpful to know when another person is feeling uncomfortable by your proximity. If a person feels that their personal space is being invaded, they might back up, clutch a drink or bag against their chest, or crane their neck backward. If you are in an unfamiliar culture, observe those around you to see what is considered “normal” spacing for where you are.)

#### Green Personality Type’s Body Language

Erikson says a Green-dominant person’s body language is similar to Yellow type’s, but on a much more subtle level. **Green personalities maintain friendly eye contact, a gentle smile, and aren’t averse to hugging**. Green types are OK with touching if they know you well, but they prefer personal space when it comes to strangers and acquaintances. Erikson says Green personalities tend to lean backward when sitting and generally maintain a relaxed posture. They don’t draw attention to themselves with hand movements, preferring instead to blend in with the crowd.

(Shortform note: Erikson says people with this personality type are great listeners, and their body language supports the theory. To show that you’re listening, experts recommend many of the behaviors listed here (relaxed posture, eye contact, occasional smiling, and touching). They also suggest using head movements—for example, nodding signals that you understand, and a slight tilt of the head communicates curiosity.)

#### Blue Personality Type’s Body Language

According to Erikson, **Blue personalities exhibit the least amount of motion in their body language of all the personality types**. They’re able to sit and stand perfectly still and deliver a message without hand gestures. Their facial expressions are subtle and controlled. Erikson explains that a Blue-dominant person may be experiencing great joy but only show a simple smile. They have no trouble maintaining eye contact, but without accompanying body language, it can come across as intimidating. Erikson says Blue types prefer to have a great deal of personal space, and if they feel that you’re getting too close,**** they’ll cross their arms or legs to signal their discomfort.

(Shortform note: “Closed off” body language can be attributed to several factors outside of personality. For example, crossed legs and arms can signal that a person is uncomfortable, nervous, or even just cold. A person might control her facial expressions when she is distracted by something, focusing on appearing professional, or listening intently. When assessing a person’s body language as it relates to personality, it would be wise to observe them in multiple situations over a significant period of time.)

> **Use Body Language “Matching” to Secure a Sale**
> 
> In _Way of the Wolf, _sales trainer Jordan Belfort (known as the “Wolf of Wall Street”) describes how salespeople can use body language to their benefit. One method he recommends is body language matching—the conscious act of adapting your body language to that of the client.
> 
> For example, if your client is leaning forward, smiling, and making eye contact, match his energy, and feel free to use a friendly slap on the shoulder while talking. However, if he is sitting with closed arms and legs, maintain your own personal space, and stay out of his.
> 
> As Erikson’s book contends, we tend to trust people who are like us. By matching a client or colleague’s body language when you’re pitching an idea or product, you’ll encourage him to let his guard down and listen to what you have to say.

### Vocal Cues

**A vocal cue is a variation in someone’s voice when speaking, such as tone and speed.** According to Erikson, each personality type displays distinct vocal cues, and by listening carefully, you can learn a lot about who they are.

#### Red Personality Type’s Vocal Cues

Red types exude confidence, and Erikson points out that this is evident in their tone of voice. Even when they’re nervous or unsure of themselves, **Red personalities speak in a voice that’s loud and clear**. He explains that they won’t stumble over their words, and they rarely pause. In other words, they speak**** quickly and articulately.

#### Yellow Personality Type’s Vocal Cues

Have you heard the expression, _he wears his heart on his sleeve_? Well, Erikson says a Yellow-dominant person wears his heart on his tongue. When a Yellow personality type speaks, you immediately know what he’s feeling because **his tone of voice is full of expression**. Erikson explains that Yellow personalities speak quickly like Red types, but unlike the articulate Reds, **Yellow-dominant people often stumble over their words** because there isn’t much of a filter between their thinking and speaking.

#### Green Personality Type’s Vocal Cues

Erikson says **Green personalities speak in controlled, gentle, and soft tones**. Their speed is on the slower side, but not as slow as a Blue personality. While fine in small groups, Erikson explains that when a Green-dominant person is speaking to a crowd, she might be asked to raise her voice so everyone can hear. One of the reasons why they’re a calming force, he says, is because their voices ooze warmth and comfort.****

#### Blue Personality Type’s Vocal Cues

Erikson says that **Blue personalities speak slowly and have little variance in tone**. They pause more than other people because they think through everything that they want to say and are deliberate with their words. He says Blue types may come across as dry or uninterested because of the lack of inflection or passion in their voices.

> **The Vocal Cues of Great Public Speakers**
> 
> Of these four ways of speaking, is one better suited for public speeches than the others? The answer depends on a few factors:
> 
>   * **The topic and purpose** of the speech
> 
>   * **The setting** in which the speech is given
> 
>   * **_Who_ is delivering** it
> 
> 

> 
> For example, a speech given by the President about war shouldn’t be delivered in the same way that a tech entrepreneur would unveil a new product. For this reason, some people’s natural way of speaking might be better suited for certain topics. However, **the most important factor is authenticity.**
> 
> Communications coach Carmine Gallo explains in his book, _Talk Like TED, _that an audience can instantly detect inauthenticity. If you naturally speak with little variance in your tone and try to sound enthusiastic, it will ring false. If you genuinely feel __ enthusiastic, on the other hand, let this emotion shine through. To keep an audience’s trust and attention, you must be true to yourself.
> 
> If you find yourself tasked with delivering a public speech, _don’t_ try to change your personality, but _do_ consider the context of the speech and deliver it accordingly. ****

### Written Communication

You can now identify a person’s personality type using body language and vocal cues. However, this only works if you’re face-to-face. Erikson points out that **in today’s world, collaboration from a distance isn’t unusual, and there will be times when you have to meet and work with someone via writing**. In these situations, he says it’s helpful to know the personality type of the person you’re dealing with, and how to respond accordingly. Luckily, each type has distinct writing characteristics.

Using Erikson’s identification and response techniques, in this section we use a hypothetical scenario to study each personality type’s written communication style. Consider how each of the colors might send an email regarding an upcoming company party:

#### Red Personality’s Email

_Reminder, the party is at 7 on Saturday. No need to bring anything._

_—Janet_

**Characteristics:** The email is short and to the point. There is no opening greeting or closing words, and definitely no small talk. Emails from Red-dominant people often contain sentence fragments.

**How to Respond:** Erikson says to answer the email immediately, and keep it short and sweet. “Thanks, see you then” would suffice.

#### Yellow Personality’s Email

_Hey everyone! Just a reminder, the company party is this Saturday at 7 p.m. Yay! I can’t wait! There will be all kinds of drinks, lots of food, and the best DJ in town (I’ve known him forever, and he DJ’d my friend’s birthday party, so I’ve seen him in action, and he’s great!). Everything is provided, but feel free to bring good vibes, haha! See you there!_

_Thanks, Janet_

**Characteristics:** In this email, there is an opening greeting as well as a closing. She uses animated language, exclamation points, and casual words. She sneaks in a personal anecdote about the DJ that’s a bit tangential. You can feel her emotions coming through the page.

**How to Respond:** Erikson says Yellow personalities don’t expect an immediate response like Red types do, but don’t forget to answer or she will feel self-conscious. While you don’t have to sound as excited as she does, he recommends you show appreciation for the reminder using a friendly tone.

#### Green Personality’s Email

_Hi team, I just wanted to remind you that the company party will start at 7 on Saturday. Food and drinks will be provided, but you’re welcome to bring something if you feel inclined. If you haven’t done so already, please remind me by the end of the day if you have any food allergies so I can alert the caterer. See you all there!_

_Sincerely, Janet_

**Characteristics:** This email is friendly but polished. The tone is soft and approachable like the Yellow type’s. Unlike the Yellow-dominant person, however, the Green personality is careful with punctuation and word choice to sound professional but not cold. Note that she asks about food allergies so that everyone is accommodated.

**How to respond:** Erikson says Green types like to feel appreciated, so respond in a friendly manner and thank her for her hard work on the party and for the emailed reminder.

#### Blue Personality’s Email

_Good morning everybody. This email is a reminder that our annual employee appreciation party will be held this Saturday at 7 p.m. at the convention center (the same location as last year). I have included driving directions and parking instructions as attachments to this email. The party will end precisely at midnight. Please be prompt in your departure, as we have a cleaning team hired to begin at exactly midnight._

_Regards, Janet_

**Characteristics:** This email has no emotion attached and is instead all about conveying practical information. She included driving directions even though the employees are familiar with the location, and it’s important to her that the employees leave on time. The language is professional, and there are no exclamation points.

**How to respond:** First, recognize that Janet assumes you read the email and attachments in full, so don’t respond with any questions that she’s already answered. Erikson recommends you respond with a short email confirming that you received and understand the email and attachments.

> **How to Effectively Request a Favor via Email**
> 
> Regardless of your personality type and your recipient’s, there are a few universal strategies you should use when requesting a favor via email. To win anyone’s favor, the request must come across politely and professionally. Here are a few tips:
> 
>   * **Use a formal tone** when you don’t know the recipient well, or if she holds a higher status than you. For example, instead of saying, “Hi Joan!” you might opt for, “Good afternoon Professor Jennings.”
> 
>   * **Put her schedule and needs above your own**. After all, you’re the one needing the favor. For example, if you are asking a colleague to help you with a project, you could say, “If you’re able to help, I would be happy to work around your schedule and bring coffee.”
> 
>   * **Don’t elaborate on excuses** when asking for a time extension. Keep the reason for the request short and simple, and instead focus on what you are requesting.
> 
>   * **Show appreciation** but don’t overdo it. Always thank the recipient for her time and for honoring the request, but don’t ingratiate. Too many thank yous will come across as unprofessional.
