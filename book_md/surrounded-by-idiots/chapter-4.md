## Chapter 4: Negative Perceptions of Each Color

So far, Erikson has taken you through an overview of how each personality thinks and behaves. This chapter discusses **_what others_ _perceive_ to be weaknesses of each color. These perceptions aren’t always accurate and don’t take each personality type’s intentions into account.** However, Erikson asserts that the way you’re perceived by others is important, because it influences how your messages are received.****

Although this section deals specifically with negative perceptions, Erikson emphasizes that **no single personality type is better than another.** There is no “ideal” personality. Also, he points out that 95% of the population is a combination of two or more personality types.

### Negative Perceptions of Red Personality Types

In the DISC model, Erikson’s “Red” aligns with the “Dominant” personality, which can be overwhelming to some people. Erikson says others may view this personality type as overbearing, insensitive, and self-centered.

#### The Perception: Red Personalities Are Overbearing

**Red-dominant people like to be in control**. Erikson reiterates that they are not detail-oriented people, and therefore they have no interest in micromanaging your work. However, they do like to be in charge, so if there is a decision to be made it will be their way or the highway. As a result, Erikson says **those working with Red types often feel controlled and resent the lack of autonomy.**

(Shortform note: There is a theory that the desire to control others begins with “conditioned helplessness” in childhood. A child who isn’t taught to solve problems herself and is instead catered to by her caregivers is likely to grow into an adult who demands more of the same. In these cases, bossing other people around keeps anxiety and low self-efficacy at bay.)

#### The Perception: Red Personalities Are Insensitive

Erikson asserts that **Red-dominant people avoid long conversations** unless they’re truly interested in the topic, and **they’re not subtle when expressing boredom**. To be polite, they might ask about your weekend—but if you start _actually_ telling them about your weekend, watch as their eyes glaze over or they check their watch. They might even stop the conversation entirely and walk away. Erikson says most **people perceive this type of behavior as cold-hearted and rude.** In reality, Red types don’t lack empathy, they just “get the picture” very quickly in the conversation and have no need for the details.

(Shortform note: In _The Fine Art of Small Talk, _Debra Fine gives advice on how to gracefully end a conversation. Rather than ending it abruptly, as the Red personality is inclined to do, Fine recommends you thank or compliment the person, give a reason for your departure, and then follow through with the excuse. For example, let’s say you go to a coworker with a question and find yourself in a conversation you’d like to end. Try saying, “Thank you so much for answering my question, I need to go make some copies now,” and then let him see you walk toward the copy room.)

#### The Perception: Red Personalities Are Self-Centered

Red types will fight for what they want, and they’re not shy about it. Erikson says because Reds start so many statements with “I” (like, “I want this” and “I believe that”), **they come across as preferring themselves over the team.** He points out that Green types are especially bothered by this, because they believe in the group over self. Erikson says Red personalities meet their own needs before helping others, and they’re willing to step over other people to get what they want. As a result, they often alienate others and lose friends.****

(Shortform note: If you have no trouble advocating for yourself at work but don’t want to be perceived as selfish, one simple strategy can make a big difference. After stating what you want, end by asking the others for their opinion. For example, if the office is choosing a new software program, you could say, “I strongly prefer Product A because of reasons x, y, and z, but what do you all think?” By using this formula, you have made your position clear while also communicating that you value others’ opinions as much as your own.)

### Negative Perceptions of Yellow Personality Types

In the DISC model, Erikson’s “Yellow” aligns with the “Inspiring” personality, which is typically pleasant in small doses but can be too intense for some. Erikson says others may view this personality type as overly talkative, scatterbrained, and childish.

#### The Perception: Yellow Personalities Talk Too Much

Yellow-dominant people live for conversation, and they’re the most gifted speakers of all the personality types. Erikson says there is rarely a filter between what a Yellow type thinks and what they say, so their speech is often a never-ending stream of consciousness. Because of this, **Yellow personalities tend to dominate every conversation,** and other personality types struggle to get a word in edgewise. Erikson says the other color-types (especially the introverted Blue personalities) quickly grow tired of listening to the nonstop talking.****

(Shortform note: If you worry that you dominate conversations, try using the traffic light rule: In the first 30 seconds of speaking, you have a green light (your listener’s attention). In the following 30 seconds, you have a yellow light (you may or may not have your listener’s attention). After one minute of speaking, imagine you have hit a red light—stop and give your listener a chance to speak. If she wants you to continue, she will ask probing questions. If she doesn’t, then you have stopped at just the right time.)

#### The Perception: Yellow Personalities Are Scatterbrained

Erikson reiterates that Yellow types are more interested in ideas than in execution, and they can’t be bothered with details. As a result, **Yellow-dominant people start a lot of projects that they don’t finish.** He adds that they hate to follow convention and tend to have their own organizational systems that others can’t understand. For example, while you might look at a messy room and think it’s disorganized, a Yellow personality type can tell you (without looking) that her notebook is under the purple pillow next to the pile of laundry. Erikson explains that **Yellow-dominant people are often late and they frequently forget deadlines and appointments** —often because they try to store everything in their heads instead of using a calendar. For all of these reasons, others perceive them to be scatterbrained.

(Shortform note: Society tends to look down upon disorganization and messiness, but recent studies draw connections between clutter and creativity. In one experiment, participants were divided into two groups and asked to come up with new uses for a ping pong ball. The first group was given a clean and organized space to work in. The other group was placed in a messy room. The group in the messy room came up with more innovative ideas for the ping pong ball than did the group in the clean room, leading researchers to believe that disorganized environments are beneficial to the creative process.)

#### The Perception: Yellow Personalities Are Childish

Erikson says that Yellow-dominant people exhibit many behaviors that are common among children: **They prefer speaking over listening, they need conversations and activities to be fun or they lose interest, and they push boundaries until redirected**. Yellow types are often the most entertaining and engaging people in the room, but when it’s time to focus or be serious, their antics can be perceived as annoying and childish.****

(Shortform note: Where is the line between harmless childlike behavior and true emotional immaturity? Psychologists say that emotional immaturity exists when a person hasn’t yet developed the ability to deal with adult emotions. A good test of this is how someone responds to confrontation. Do they listen to understand and look for a solution, or do they blame others, deny involvement, and lash out emotionally?)

### Negative Perceptions of Green Personality Types

In the DISC model, Erikson’s “Green” aligns with the “Stable” personality, which is comforting at times and frustrating at others. Erikson says others may view this personality type as overly lazy, stubborn, and two-faced.

#### The Perception: Green Personalities Are Lazy

More than any other personality type, Green-dominant people are slow to warm. Erikson explains that **Green types take their time mulling over decisions** and **they live more inside their minds than in the outside world**. They prefer staying at home and reading a good book over going out in search of adventure. Red and Yellow personalities struggle with this because they can’t understand why a person would choose the same activity day after day.

Along the same lines, Erikson adds that**Green-dominant people aren’t particularly ambitious**. If they have a solid job that meets their needs, they’re unlikely to reach for more. He says Red personalities, in particular, can’t wrap their minds around this. Bottom line: Of all the colors, Green types are the least motivated to _move_ , literally and figuratively. This leads the other personality types to characterize them as lazy.

> **Americans and Hustle Culture**
> 
> The correlation between stillness and laziness is an American sentiment not shared by all cultures. Americans are often characterized by other nations as ambitious workaholics who don’t know how to relax. Statistics back this up:
> 
>   * Americans work almost 500 more hours per year than the French.
> 
>   * More than 85% of men and 66% of U.S. women exceed 40 hours of work per week.
> 
>   * The US is the only industrialized nation without legally mandated annual leave.
> 
> 

> 
> Other countries encourage and celebrate leisure. Italy, for example, has a well-known phrase: _bel far niente_ —“the beauty of doing nothing.”

#### The Perception: Green Personalities Are Stubborn

Because Green-dominant people take so long to make decisions, Erikson warns that **it’s difficult to change their minds about any given topic.** Where a Red type will change her mind if presented with compelling evidence, a Yellow type will change based on gut feeling, and a Blue-dominant person will change after enough research, a Green personality is generally set in her ways. There are ways to change a Green type (see “How to Persuade a Green” in Chapter 7), but it isn’t easy, so other colors view Greens as simply stubborn.

(Shortform note: Sometimes a person is stubborn not because they believe in their decision, but because they fear change. Tim Ferriss, author of _The 4-Hour Workweek, _is famously quoted as saying “People will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.” Fear of the unknown is a powerful motivator to stay stagnant, but it can keep you from growing and achieving fulfillment. If you find yourself refusing to budge, start by evaluating whether you’re actually happy with where you are, or if you’re avoiding change.)

#### The Perception: Green Personalities Are Two-Faced

Erikson emphasizes that **Green personality types avoid conflict like the plague**. They care deeply about how others perceive them, so they’re careful not to rock the boat. Erikson notes that this doesn’t mean that Green-dominant people don’t have opinions of their own. Rather, instead of communicating their grievances directly, they often complain behind the other person’s back. Ironically, in their attempts to avoid conflict, Greens come across as fake and untrustworthy.

(Shortform note: If you discover that a coworker has been complaining about you behind your back, it’s natural to feel hurt or angry. You might even vow never to trust that person again. Instead of lashing out or participating in the gossip, start by asking yourself if you contributed to this behavior. Was there something you did or said that made you unapproachable? Confront the person in a straightforward manner but with empathy, ask why he felt he couldn’t come to you directly, and then listen without judgment.)

### Negative Perceptions of Blue Personality Types

In the DISC model, Erikson’s “Blue” aligns with the “Compliant” personality, which is reliable but leaves little room for flexibility. Erikson says others may view those with this personality type as cold-hearted and negative know-it-alls.

#### The Perception: Blue Personalities Are Cold-Hearted

**Blue-dominant people like to have space—physically and emotionally.** People with this personality type need to know someone really well before opening up about their own lives. They tend to have a few close friends rather than a large social circle, and they prefer to spend time alone or with their families. Their body language is quite closed off****(don’t expect a hug) and they aren’t ones for small talk. For these reasons, others often perceive Blues to be cold and emotionless.

(Shortform note: “Avoidant attachment” is a term psychologists use to describe people who either avoid relationships or keep their partners at arm’s length. They might even sabotage their relationships as a defense mechanism against being left first. This attachment style is often the result of unresolved childhood trauma, such as abandonment. There is an important distinction, however, between avoidant attachment and the personality trait Erikson describes here: Blue personality types are closed off until they form a deeper relationship, and people with avoidant attachment are closed off _within_ their deepest relationships.)

#### The Perception: Blue Personalities Are Negative

**Blue personalities call themselves “realists,” but Erikson says other color types view them as pessimists**. This is because Blues are quick to identify problems but rarely offer solutions****(that’s Red and Yellow types’ territory). For example, imagine you present a project proposal in a meeting and ask for feedback. The Green personalities will stay quiet, the Red and Yellow personalities will offer next steps, and the Blue types will point out all the areas you went wrong. This behavior can drag down morale, but Erikson says the Blue personalities believe they’re being helpful.

(Shortform note: There is a common adage in business: “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.” The goal is to avoid a culture of toxic complaining, but while well-intentioned, this approach creates unique problems. The more complex an issue, the harder it is to come up with a solution, and some problems need an all-hands-on-deck approach. “Solution-only thinking” stifles cooperative problem-solving and intimidates employees into not bringing up an issue until it’s a full-blown crisis. When you create a safe environment to discuss problems, more effective solutions can come to light while the issue is still small.)

#### The Perception: Blue Personalities Are Know-It-Alls

Erikson says that because Blue-dominant people are**** so research-oriented, they know a lot about every situation they enter ahead of time. **This preparedness leads Blue personalities to distrust or dismiss other people’s advice**. For example, if a Blue type has decided to run a marathon for the first time, she’ll research the best shoes, the most optimal training schedule, the requirements for entering the race, and so on—all before she goes on her first run. So if you—an experienced runner—try to give her advice, don’t be surprised if she waves you off. Erikson says **Blue personalities only take advice from those they deem to be experts** , and it takes a lot for them to consider someone an expert.

(Shortform note: If someone asks for your advice on a personal matter but doesn’t take it, should you be insulted? Psychologists say no. Nine times out of 10, they say, when someone asks for your advice, she is really attempting to _feel_ better. Often, she’s either seeking validation for what she’s already decided, or using the opportunity to vent. Only about 10% of the time is the person actually taking your opinion into consideration.)
