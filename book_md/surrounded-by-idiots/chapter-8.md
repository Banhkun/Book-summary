## Chapter 8: Delivering Negative Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback is an uncomfortable but necessary part of life. In this chapter, Erikson focuses specifically on**how to provide negative feedback to an _employee_ based on his or her personality type. **

### Giving Feedback to a Red-Dominant Employee

**Prepare for battle.** Erikson warns that a Red personality type won’t sit quietly and listen to feedback. Instead, he will argue with you on every point and assign a scapegoat for every criticism. For this reason, Erikson advises you to give the feedback at a time when you’re feeling strong. For example, if you’re always tired at the end of the workday, schedule your meeting for the morning. You need to be energized and mentally prepared for a strong reaction.

(Shortform note: When it comes to criticism, the sooner you give feedback, the better. This is even more true for dominant personalities, because there is less room to argue when the behavior in question is still fresh in everyone’s mind. If you address the issue right away, you also eliminate the argumentative question of, “Why is this an issue _now?_ ”)

**Be direct.** Erikson reminds us that Red personalities don’t mince words, so skip the small talk. Also, he advises against using a “compliment sandwich” (a compliment before and after the criticism), because Red types recognize and hate when things are sugar-coated. Instead, Erikson says, tell them exactly what the problem is, using the fewest words possible.

(Shortform note: You can offer straightforward criticisms in a way that doesn’t bruise the ego by drawing on the employee’s expertise. Rather than saying, “Your presentation appeared rushed and had many mistakes,” ask him, “What do you think you could do to minimize errors in future presentations?” Using this method, you aren’t sugar-coating the issue but you’re showing that you trust that he knows how to fix it.)

**Give examples.** Whatever you’re critiquing, Erikson says a Red-dominant person won’t just take your word for it. Be prepared with specific, concrete examples of the behavior in question. If you aren’t ready with more than one example, they will dismiss the criticism altogether.

(Shortform note: Almost everyone experiences an internal defense mechanism when receiving negative feedback. We assume that the person doing the criticizing is either misinformed or doesn’t like us. This is rarely the truth, however, and examples can help the recipient see that the critique is based in reality.)

**Leave feelings out of it.** Erikson says it’s a waste of time to tell Red personality types how they made someone else feel because they don’t believe other people’s feelings are their responsibility. Red personalities are task-driven (not relationship-driven), so Erikson says you’ll have better luck if you explain how their actions affected the person’s _performance_.

(Shortform note: To keep the feedback objective and not opinion-based, provide a specific actionable with each critique. For example, instead of saying, “Your colleagues have trouble working with you because you’re overbearing,” say, “I’d like to see some more flexibility in your collaboration, so on the next two projects, I want you to practice being the second lead instead of the first, and we’ll debrief afterward.”)

**Make them repeat the plan.** At the end of the meeting, Erikson recommends you give Red-dominant people hypothetical scenarios and ask how they’d handle them. Go through each one together and make sure they have a plan for how to behave appropriately. Remember, Red personalities are problem-solvers, so this activity should feel satisfying to them while reinforcing what was discussed.

(Shortform note: Consider closing a feedback session with a joint action plan. What change needs to take place? How will progress be measured? When will a follow-up meeting take place? These questions should be discussed and the answers agreed upon before adjourning the meeting.)

### Giving Feedback to a Yellow-Dominant Employee

**Lead the conversation.** Erikson reminds us that Yellow personalities tend to take over conversations, so be prepared to keep the exchange on track. He suggests you have a plan for how to open and close the conversation and know which points you want to make, with an example to go with each one. When they try to steer to a tangential topic, Erikson recommends being deliberate in refocusing the conversation.

(Shortform note: Use your opening to connect and align with the other person, use the body of the conversation to discuss the issues, and use the closing to clarify future expectations and plan a follow-up.)

**Prepare for a dramatic response.** Remember, Yellows take criticism personally and speak in dramatic hyperboles, such as “Nobody likes me,” “I always mess up,” and “I should just go away.”. Erikson urges you not to take these words to heart; they just need to lick their wounds for a bit before bouncing back.

(Shortform note: Crying because of performance reviews is more common than you might think—25% of men and 18% of women say they’ve cried after a performance review, and more than a third of Millennials say they’ve cried _during_ one. If an employee sheds tears during your feedback session, experts say you should ask yourself three questions: Was the review result surprising? Was it communicated professionally? And, did the employee have a chance to defend herself?)

**Use specific examples.** Yellow types see the world through rose-colored glasses, so when you explain the problem behavior, Erikson says to prepare for them not to believe you. He recommends you have specific examples ready to reinforce your argument. For example, if you tell a Yellow personality type that she’s talking too much during staff meetings and she argues, reply, “At Tuesday’s meeting, you spoke for 15 minutes during the Q&A. On average, others speak for one to two minutes.”

(Shortform note: If you’re going to provide examples, be sure that they are recent. If an employee hears that his problem behavior started a long time ago, he’ll feel embarrassed and resentful that it wasn’t brought to his attention sooner.)

**Massage their ego.** Erikson reminds us that Yellow personalities can be sensitive, and they care a lot about what others think of them. For this reason, it’s helpful to reassure them that you’re _not_ critiquing them _as a person_ , you’re speaking only about their behavior. Unlike with Reds, flattery goes a long way with Yellow personality type. Erikson suggests you remind them of all the reasons they’re liked and respected.

(Shortform note: Even for those who enjoy praise, the “compliment sandwich” is so predictable and formulaic that it’s become a cliché. A better approach is to weave accurate and specific praise throughout your conversation. Rather than saying, “Clients love you,” be specific: “At least once a week, I receive compliments about you from our clients. They say that you’re friendly, great at explaining things, and have a fantastic memory.”)

**Ask her to repeat the feedback and prepare for inconsistencies.** At the end of the conversation, Erikson says to ask the Yellow-dominant employee to recap the meeting. Because they’re not great listeners, it’s likely that she ran what you said through their own filter and interpreted the meaning incorrectly. For example, if you told her that she talks too much during meetings and needs to give others a chance to speak, she might repeat it as, “You told me that what I’m saying during meetings isn’t helpful, so I need to prepare my responses better.” When you hear the inconsistencies, Erikson advises you to go over the issue again and make sure she clearly understands the problem and proposed solution.

(Shortform note: To get a better understanding of what was interpreted, you can ask the employee to recap the conversation in her _own_ words. By doing this, any hidden meanings that she’s attached to your words will be revealed. For example, if your exact words were, “I need you to make sure that all of your projects are on time,” and she rephrases it as, “Your projects are always late,” this gives you the chance to clarify that you don’t believe she is _always_ late.)

### Giving Feedback to a Green-Dominant Employee

**Use a gentle approach.** Erikson advises you to keep in mind throughout the feedback session that Green personalities are sensitive and self-critical, so whatever you say, they will compound it in their mind. Receiving negative feedback is torturous for them, so approach everything softly—use a kind voice, provide lots of reassurance, and choose your words carefully. Erikson says to make sure they know that you’re critiquing the behavior, not the person.

(Shortform note: If your body language is nervous or dominant, your feedback recipient will feel uncomfortable and likely miss out on what you have to say. Body language that signals nervousness includes: avoiding eye contact, crossing your arms, looking around the room, and fidgeting. Dominant body language includes: standing while the other person is sitting, maintaining intense eye contact for too long, furrowing your eyebrows, and making aggressive hand gestures.)

**Focus on feelings.** Green types care deeply about how others feel, and Erikson recommends using this as a tool during the feedback session. As usual, Green personality types are the opposite of Reds in this way. With Red personalities, Erikson says to focus on the behavior’s effect on _performance_ , but with Greens he says it’s better to focus on how their behavior affects others’ _feelings_. For example: “When you didn’t complete your assignment on time, the rest of the team felt let down,” will be more effective than, “When you didn’t complete your assignment on time, the entire project timeline was delayed.”

Erikson stresses this caveat:**** Don’t _exaggerate_ how the behavior affected others**** because the Green-dominant personality will already inflate it in his own mind. Instead, be honest and straightforward.

(Shortform note: If you’re going to share how another employee felt in a situation, ask them first if they are comfortable with you discussing it. Because the Green personality type is unlikely to confront people directly, you don’t want to inadvertently start behind-the-back drama between these two employees.)

**Don’t backpedal.** According to Erikson, you will quickly see the Green-dominant employee’s distress when you give negative feedback. He encourages you to resist the urge to justify the behavior as a way to make him feel better. Instead, Erikson says to use body language and vocal tone (for example, a kind voice and relaxed face) to reassure him that he’s still liked while holding your ground on the issue. This gives him nonverbal reminders that the feedback is about his behavior, not about him as a person.

(Shortform note: With sensitive employees, it’s crucial to have your meeting face-to-face. If you deliver a criticism via email, for example, there is a lot of room left for interpretation and amplification. The employee could read more into your comment than is actually there, and he will be less likely to ask for clarification. When you meet in person, on the other hand, you can read his body language and respond accordingly.)

**Expect an overcorrection.** Because Green types are so self-critical, Erikson says it’s common for them to dramatically overcorrect their behavior (temporarily) when they experience criticism. For example, after telling your employee that you’d like him to contribute more to the team project, don’t be surprised if for the next month he comes to work early and completes several tasks before anyone else arrives. This behavior won’t last forever—according to Erikson, it will continue only until the Green-dominant employee feels reassured that you don’t hate him. After that, be on the lookout for the original problem behavior to resurface.

(Shortform note: If you want to let your self-critical employee know that everything is fine, resume all normal activities and behaviors. After a performance review, your sensitive employee will feel spotlighted by any extra attention (even if it’s positive), and this is very uncomfortable for someone who just wants to blend in.)

**Ask him to repeat the feedback.** At the end of the meeting, Erikson advises you to ask the Green-dominant employee to summarize the conversation for you. He says you may find that he has added criticisms to the list himself. For example, if the point of the meeting was only to address the Green’s tardiness, and you ask him to recap, he might say, “I have been late to work a lot, and also I haven’t been completing my reports on time. I haven’t been the best teammate,” and so on. Reiterate that the only behavior he needs to adjust is the one you discussed.

(Shortform note: Because people with this personality type prefer criticizing themselves over receiving feedback from others, you might ask your employee to write out a few goals based on your conversation to be used as a metric in the next performance review. By allowing your employee to write the goals in his own words, he’ll have ownership of the behavior and will be less likely to feel embarrassed or resentful.)

### Giving Feedback to a Blue-Dominant Employee

**Prepare, prepare, prepare.** Erikson insists that you must have all of your facts straight before approaching a Blue-dominant person with any type of criticism. He advises you to spend time preparing before the meeting by consulting several sources (rather than taking one person’s word for it), and write down exactly what is said. Review your policies, and be ready to cite them.

(Shortform note: One of the most effective ways a manager can prepare for a performance evaluation is to give feedback throughout the year. Your employees should not be surprised by anything they hear at their review. If problem behaviors are addressed right when they happen, your employees will be less likely to argue with you when they are discussed in more detail at a formal meeting.)

**Provide everything in writing.** Erikson reiterates that Blue personality types value preparation; for this reason, they trust written words more than spoken ones because they aren’t spontaneous. Said another way, Blues trust only what has been carefully considered. Before the meeting, Erikson suggests composing a written document that details the criticisms and includes concrete examples. He says to provide a copy of this document, and go through each point together, one by one, avoiding any detours.

(Shortform note: Along these same lines, it’s wise to collect documents throughout the year that support your praises and criticisms, like attendance records, customer feedback, and examples of good and bad behavior, which can all be kept in a folder. Anything concrete that you can show your employee will strengthen your words and support your observations.)

**Focus on results, not relationships.** According to Erikson, Blue personalities are similar to Reds in that they don’t care too deeply about how their behavior affects others. He says to stay away from emotional language and instead focus on how their actions affect progress. Be extremely specific. “Your pace of work is too slow,” won’t accomplish much. Try this instead: “You spent 25 hours on your report when it could have been done in 10. Because you took more than twice as long as is customary, the next phase of the project was delayed by two days, and it cost the company $2,500.”

(Shortform note: For every area of improvement you bring up, you should have data to support it. Without facts and figures, your words will sound like an opinion and won’t be respected. It’s recommended that you always _begin_ with the data before making an explicit comment about the behavior. This allows the employee to draw his own conclusion before you do.)

**Ask her to repeat the feedback.** As always, Erikson says it’s good practice to have the recipient repeat what she’s heard at the end of the meeting. A Blue-dominant employee will likely repeat back to you _exactly_ what was said, but this doesn’t mean that she believes you or is going to change her behavior. In fact, Erikson says it’s likely she just wants the meeting to end so she can get back to work. He recommends you follow up soon after to make sure she follows through with what was agreed upon.

(Shortform note: It’s helpful to schedule a follow-up meeting at the end of the current meeting rather than leaving it vague. This ensures that it won’t fall through the cracks for either of you, and it tells the employee that she’ll be held accountable for the agreed-upon plan.)
