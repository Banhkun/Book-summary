## Part 1: Identifying Personality Types | Chapter 2: The Extroverts—Red and Yellow

In this section, Erikson explains the **mindset and behavior characteristics of Red and Yellow personality types, which he calls extroverted colors.** He defines extroversion as being more active in the external world than the internal. In other words, extroverts spend more time acting than thinking. Throughout the book, Erikson expands on the information provided in the overview here.

(Shortform note: Myers-Briggs agrees that extraverts (note their difference in spelling) prefer to be active in the external world. They add that extraverts are energized by other people, so they seek larger social gatherings than introverts do.)

### An Overview of the Red Personality Type

According to Erikson, **Red personalities are unapologetically ambitious and self-confident.** They like to be in charge and are comfortable taking risks. People with this personality are extroverted and not afraid to speak their mind, even when it causes conflict. Erikson notes that **Hippocrates calls this behavior type “choleric.”**

#### A Red Personality’s Ambition Is Unmatched

Erikson explains that **Red personality types enjoy competition more than the other personalities, and they are constantly pushing themselves to exceed expectations.** In games, Red types can be sore losers and will usually ask for a rematch. In work, you will find them intentionally outperforming their peers. While this competitive spirit helps Red personalities achieve great things, Erikson warns that it can be aggressive and off-putting to the other personality types.

People who are dominated by Red traits are not afraid of challenges—in fact, they love them. Erikson says Red types are fearless in unchartered territory. He adds that most entrepreneurs are Red because they push through setbacks, where others may falter.

**Because Red personalities are so driven and have high expectations, they’re often in leadership roles.** Oddly enough,**** Erikson points out, power and prestige are not important to them. He explains that autonomy is what they’re after—nobody is going to tell them what to do, because (in their minds) they already know how to do it better and faster.

> **Is Ambition Determined at Birth?**
> 
> Erikson argues that people with the Red personality type are born ambitious. Whether or not genetics affect a person’s ambition is still undetermined, but psychologists do believe _when_ you are born makes a difference.
> 
> Numerous studies point to birth order as one indicator of ambition. They’ve determined that first-born children are generally more ambitious in their careers than their younger siblings. The leading theory is that parents are the most strict with their first child, and this breeds high expectations. The parents worry about their first child reaching milestones on time (such as walking by one year), and will actively work with their toddler to meet them. With each child afterward, they relax and let the child develop at a natural pace. As a conditioned result, firstborns push themselves harder than their siblings.

#### Red Personalities Are Confident

**Red types make quick decisions and are annoyed by drawn-out deliberations.** Erikson says that they are the first to become bored and frustrated if conversation drags on during a meeting. They prefer to make decisions quickly and get to work.

**Red personalities want to lead the conversation if a decision is being made.** Erikson says they are the first to answer a posed question and typically speak louder than everyone around them. If you disagree with them, they’ll try to convince you to see things their way—sometimes relentlessly.

**Red personality types are honest and blunt, often lacking tact.** Erikson says people with this personality call it like they see it and don’t sugarcoat anything. Some people appreciate and admire this; others are taken aback and intimidated.

> **How to Prevent Your Colleague From Dominating the Meeting**
> 
> If a colleague is dominating every work discussion and derailing meetings, it can kill morale. One effective way to prevent this from happening is to **not interrupt him when he is speaking.**
> 
> It may seem counterintuitive, but **by** **letting your colleague speak for as long as he wants with no interruption, you’ll actually shorten his turn in the spotlight.** If you respond point by point, the colleague will feel that his contributions are valuable discussion fodder rather than a disruption. So let him get everything out and then respond politely in as few words as possible. When you respond, acknowledge only the comments that addressed the core issue and ignore any tangents that he may have brought up.

#### Red Personalities Enjoy Excitement and Risks

**Red types stay busy.** Erikson describes their schedule as being jam-packed—filled with social engagements, professional networking, and physical challenges. A Red personality type is likely to attend a music festival one weekend and climb a mountain the next. Erikson explains that they also get more done than others because if they have five free minutes, they will fill it with a task.

(Shortform note: For some, the desire to stay busy is an inherent personality trait. For others, it is a coping mechanism for anxiety, or a strategy to avoid feelings. One way to distinguish between the two is to evaluate whether this busyness is exhausting you or re-energizing you.)

**Red personalities are comfortable with risks.** Erikson says if you know an adrenaline junkie, she’s most likely a Red personality type. They’re not scared by risky ventures because they believe in their own abilities to handle whatever comes their way.

(Shortform note: According to the Myers-Briggs personality model, “Intuitive Perceivers” (also referred to as NPs) are most likely to enjoy and embrace risks. NPs tend to enjoy career choices that are less secure but have a higher payout possibility, such as entrepreneurship.)

#### Seek a Red-Dominant Person If...

**If you need help solving a problem, especially if it involves conflict, Erikson says to find someone with a Red personality type**. For example, if the residents in your building aren’t adhering to assigned parking spots and you shudder at the idea of confronting them, ask a Red type to help. He’ll be happy to stand up at the HOA meeting and declare why everyone needs to stick to the rule. The caveat here is that **Red personalities need to believe in the cause themselves** ; they don’t care what others think, and therefore they aren’t helping out of compassion for you. But if you can get them on your side, they’ll take care of it.

(Shortform note: If you want to become better at confronting others (rather than outsourcing the task to someone with a Red personality), start by choosing one small complaint to bring up to someone that you love and trust. Choose a complaint that isn’t personal and a person who you know won’t blow up at you. Practice this from time to time and observe how you feel before, during, and after the confrontation.)

**Erikson lists several** famous Red personality types, including Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs, and Barack Obama.

### An Overview of the Yellow Personality Type

**Yellow types have a charismatic personality and a bright outlook.** Erikson says they see life as a smorgasbord of delights and are the first to try something new. Their driving forces in life are joy and laughter. Erikson writes that Hippocrates refers to this type as “sanguine,” which means “optimist.”

#### Yellow Personalities Are Social Butterflies

**Yellow personalities are highly entertaining and tend to be popular.** Have you ever been at a party and noticed a circle of laughing guests around one particular person? Erikson says this person is most likely a Yellow type.**** He adds that they’re avid storytellers, love the spotlight, and ignore no one. This positivity is contagious—when you spend time with a Yellow personality, Erikson says you tend to feel more cheerful yourself.

Red and Yellow personality types are both extroverts, but Erikson makes the distinction that **Yellow personalities are highly focused on crafting relationships and personal connections,** and Red types aren’t. He says people with a Yellow personality can talk to anyone (even strangers) and enjoy the conversation. They don’t care if the conversation leads to anything or is of particular substance—they simply enjoy human connection.

Like Red types, **Yellow personalities like to keep a busy schedule,** Erikson explains. Because they see the beauty in everything, they’re the most curious of the personality types. He says you can suggest almost any activity to a Yellow personality, and she’ll be excited to join you.

> **Are Social Butterflies Always Extroverts?**
> 
> Introverts are often portrayed as shy homebodies who avoid social settings, but according to neuroscientists, this is a huge misconception. Rather, extroverts and introverts have different brain chemistry, one aspect of which is dopamine threshold. Dopamine is the hormone that makes us feel good, and the lower your threshold, the easier it is to become overstimulated and exhausted. Introverts can attend a party and be just as social as the extroverts, and they may even enjoy it just as much—they simply need more recovery time afterward.
> 
> Consider this analogy: Two runners run the same race with similar results. One runner takes a day off and trains again the following day, while the other needs a week to recover. Parties and social gatherings are the same way for extroverts and introverts.

#### Yellow Personalities Feel Positive About the Future

Like Red types, Erikson says Yellow personalities are able to make quick decisions. The difference between the two is that Reds will decide based on logic, while **Yellow personalities follow their gut instinct, or what “feels right.”**

**People with this personality type are optimists, but they’re not in denial about the hardships of life.** If something sad happens to them, Erikson says they’ll cry and feel sad, but they won’t dwell on it. Yellow personalities embrace their feelings in the moment but move on quickly.

Yellow types are highly creative and also resourceful. Erikson explains that they see solutions where others see problems, and their thinking is often out of the box. He says Yellow personalities are the most likely to exclaim, “I have an idea!”

> **Optimism Changes With Age**
> 
> In 2020, the _Journal of Research in Personality_ published the results of a study in which researchers posed a question: _Do people’s life experiences affect their level of optimism?_ In other words, could a person who is normally optimistic become a pessimist after experiencing hardship?
> 
> About 75,000 American, German, and Dutch people (ranging in age from 16 to 101) participated in the study. Researchers found that **optimism fluctuated very little as a response to life circumstances** , but it _did_ change with age. Participants were shown to be the most optimistic in early adulthood and least optimistic in old age, with a plateau in middle age.

#### Yellow Personalities Are Persuasive

**People with Yellow-dominant personalities are skilled persuaders.** Erikson says Yellow types can convince a room full of people to believe in a project through a bubbly and inspirational speech. He adds that they’re masters of language (both verbal and physical) and can convince you to think like them through their charismatic way of speaking. Politicians are often Yellow—including Bill Clinton.

(Shortform note: Regardless of personality, one way to become more persuasive in your speech is to eliminate qualifiers such as “I believe” or “I think.” Rather, state your belief as a fact. “This is the best option,” is more persuasive than, “I think this is the best option.” This works because people tend to follow the most confident person in the room.)

#### Seek a Yellow-Dominant Person If...

**If you need help brainstorming new ideas or finding a creative solution to a tricky problem, Erikson says to find a Yellow personality type.** For example, if you have two deadlines approaching simultaneously at work, your Yellow-dominant colleague will probably have an idea for how you can kill both birds with one stone.

(Shortform note: In the Myers-Briggs model, ENTPs are the most creative problem-solvers. They are skilled at seeing a challenge, dreaming up a conceptual solution, and then strategizing a practical solution.)

**Erikson lists several f** amous Yellow personalities, including Robin Williams, Oprah Winfrey, and Ellen DeGeneres.****
