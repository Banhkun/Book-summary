## Part 2: Applying Your Knowledge | Chapter 7: Adapting to Each Color’s Style

Up to this point, Erikson has explained the ins and outs of every color type. The rest of this guide focuses on how Erikson advises you to _use_ this information. He begins by explaining **why and how you should adapt your own behavior when interacting with other personality types.**

### Why Adapt?

Because communication happens on the listener’s __ terms, **if you want your message to be clearly transmitted—or you want to convince the other person of something—Erikson says you must adapt to _their_ communication style.**

Erikson acknowledges that some people balk at the idea of intentionally adjusting their personality based on who they’re talking to**** because they believe it’s a dishonest and manipulative practice. He points out, however, that we already adapt our behavior as part of social etiquette. For instance, you don’t behave the same way with your boss as you would your spouse. Erikson maintains that **you can be honest about your values, desires, and beliefs while simultaneously adjusting the way you express them.**

(Shortform note: As a general rule, we’re more likely to grant requests from people we know or like. In _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, _Robert Cialdini describes this as the “Liking Principle.” __ This principle explains that we are more easily persuaded by people who we respect, who claim to like _us_ , who are good looking, or who make us laugh. In other words, if we understand and enjoy a person, we are primed to trust them.)

### How to Adapt to Each Color

Now that he’s established _why_ adaptation is a valuable skill, Erikson takes you color by color and explains how to use this skill to persuade**** and work with others.

#### Persuading a Red Personality Type

**Cut to the chase.** If the purpose of your visit is to talk business, a Red-dominant person will be annoyed if you try to be his friend. One of the worst things you can do is ask about his family, hobbies, or personal life—he doesn’t believe you have a right to the information and he also thinks it’s a waste of time. Instead, Erikson recommends you ask for what you want in the fewest words possible.

(Shortform note: This advice contradicts what Dale Carnegie recommends in _How to Win Friends and Influence People. _Carnegie says that expressing an interest in the other person’s life is a tenet of effective salesmanship. He maintains that people love to talk about themselves and this is a quick way to win their favor and set a positive tone.)

**Have an opinion and stand your ground.** Erikson warns that if you approach a Red personality type with a meek “yes-man” attitude, you’re dead in the water. Red personalities respect people who have strong opinions and don’t back down easily. If your boss tells you, “No, I can’t afford to give you a raise right now,” don’t give up. Instead, respond confidently with the factual reasons why you deserve a raise and leave feelings out of it. Erikson reminds you that Red types love a challenge, so your boss is likely to embrace the negotiation process.

(Shortform note: It’s possible to stand your ground and respect the other viewpoint simultaneously. Carnegie explains that if you can understand why the other person thinks the way they do, you hold the key to changing their mind. Start by acknowledging the other person’s opinion and explain, in your own words, why the opinion is relevant. After the recipient receives this validation, explain your position passionately.)

**Focus on the future and take initiative.** Erikson says Red types are always looking to the future, and they respect people who take initiative instead of waiting for directions. If you want to sell a Red-dominant boss on your raise, tell him exactly what you plan to do to help him. Use concrete figures and stay away from flowery language.

(Shortform note: Carnegie says that stating the truth of a situation and providing facts and figures is not compelling enough to persuade most people. He encourages his readers to appeal to the other person via their emotions through showmanship and visual elements. This contradicts Erikson’s advice for how to appeal to a Red personality.)

#### Working With a Red Personality Type

**Help manage the details.** Erikson reiterates that Red-dominant people are big-picture thinkers and don’t care about _how_ the vision is accomplished. Though he won’t like it, you can help this personality type by reminding him that details are, in fact, important. If you have a Blue or Green personality, you might offer to take up the minutiae yourself. If you have a Yellow personality (not keen on details either), try suggesting he delegate those tasks to a teammate who will thrive.

(Shortform note: Red personalities have no problem delegating, but because they aren’t detail-oriented to begin with, it could be helpful to create a list of specific tasks that they can assign to various team members.)

**Encourage them to slow down and calculate risks.** Erikson says that Red personalities rarely stop to calculate risks because they want to get the job done as quickly as possible, and they believe that they must always stay busy. If you’re collaborating with a Red-dominant person, remind him that by slowing down just a bit, he will make fewer mistakes and increase output.

(Shortform note: People often equate being busy with being productive, but there are differences between the two. Think of being busy as working hard and being productive as working smart. Another difference: Busyness is frantic in nature and productivity is focused.)

**Stand up to them if they’re alienating others.** Erikson reminds you that Red types don’t intentionally intimidate others, but their brash style of communicating (in combination with their short fuse) can leave others feeling steamrolled. If you see this happening, Erikson says the best thing to do is stand up to them by pointing out the behavior and communicating that it’s unacceptable.

(Shortform note: If this personality type prefers direct communication, as Erikson says, then it might be more effective to encourage the intimidated colleague to confront the Red-dominant person himself. You can help the colleague prepare for the meeting by role-playing, or offer to come along as a mediator.)

#### Persuading a Yellow Personality Type

**Use flattery and personal connection.** Erikson explains that Yellow personalities are the opposite of Reds in this way—where Red types balk at flattery, Yellows relish in it. Yellow-dominant people also care deeply about human connection, so they enjoy personal conversations. If you’re trying to persuade them, Erikson recommends you spend time chatting them up, find something you have in common, and throw in a genuine compliment for good measure.

(Shortform note: To help forge a personal connection, try researching the person’s interests ahead of time. One of the easiest ways you can do this is to spend a few minutes browsing their social media accounts before the meeting. Also, pay attention to personal items in her office. Are there sports memorabilia knick-knacks, or photos of her family at the beach? Identify something you can use as a conversation starter.)

**Highlight the innovation.** Yellow personalities love being the first to experience something, so Erikson says if you want to sell them something, you should point out the features that are new and exciting. For example, if you want to launch a new program in your office, point out that other offices haven’t yet tried it.

(Shortform note: While their ability to take risks is admirable, people who are chronically attracted to whatever is “new and shiny” can be taken advantage of. If you fall into this category, it’s important to resist your impulses, and take the time to ask yourself: _Is this a real opportunity or simply an interesting distraction?_)

#### Working With a Yellow Personality Type

**Set a cheerful tone.** Yellow personalities are at their best when everyone around them is happy, so if you’re collaborating with them, Erikson recommends you create a cheerful environment. To signal that you’re comfortable and approachable, he says to use friendly body language, such as eye contact, smiling, and leaning forward.

(Shortform note: If your demeanor isn’t naturally cheerful, this body language can come across as disingenuous. A friendly greeting, a show of gratitude, or a compliment can all accomplish the same objective. For example, saying “good morning” to a colleague is a very simple—yet often overlooked—way to start the day on a positive note.)

**Create structure.** If you want to help a Yellow-dominant teammate, Erikson recommends you offer to create some structure by writing up the to-do lists or managing the schedule. They will appreciate someone else taking on this task, and you’ll probably be better at it, too.

(Shortform note: Be prepared for this personality type to deviate from the schedule you created, and resist the urge to respond in frustration. Sometimes, having any schedule at all is enough to keep a person on task, even if she constantly adjusts it.)

**Hold their feet to the fire.** Yellow types are great at coming up with ideas but aren’t as interested in the execution. Erikson says if you’re collaborating with them, it’s important to make sure they’re pulling their weight. Remember, they care deeply about how others feel, so if their procrastination frustrates you, tell them so.

(Shortform note: Contrary to popular belief, procrastinators like to have deadlines. It is the deadline itself that motivates a procrastinator to get to work, and without one they might never begin. If you’re collaborating with someone who routinely procrastinates, break the project into chunks and agree on deadlines for each task. Make it clear that these deadlines are important to you and give a casual reminder before each one.)

#### Persuading a Green Personality Type

**Break the process down.** Green personalities don’t like change, so Erikson says they can be difficult to persuade. He recommends breaking the change down into digestible chunks for them. For example, if you want your office to switch to a new software, eliminate uncertainty by telling the Green-dominant people exactly what would happen and who would handle each step of the process.

(Shortform note: When you are trying to convince someone that a change is necessary, the first question they think is: _How is this going to affect me?_ Most people won’t admit this, because it sounds selfish—but if you begin by telling the person how the change will make their daily routine easier or better, you will have a great advantage.)

**Narrow down the choices.** Erikson says that Green types are happy to follow directions but feel overwhelmed and immobilized when it comes to making decisions. If you’re trying to sell them on a new policy or product, he recommends you come to the table with one or two options for them to say “yes” or “no” to. Do the research and planning ahead of time, and explain how you narrowed down the options; they will appreciate it.

(Shortform note: If you are offering someone a few choices, you should present your favorite option first. In a set of experiments performed at UC Berkeley, participants were asked to quickly choose between two or more options. The results: Most people selected the first option available.)

#### Working With a Green Personality Type

**Give criticisms in private.** If you need to address a Green-dominant person’s behavior (or, more likely, an inaction), Erikson says to speak with her privately. Greens are sensitive, and if they’re criticized in front of others, they feel immense shame and subsequent resentment.

(Shortform note: There are a few exceptions to the widely accepted rule: “Praise in public, criticize in private.” For example, if an employee makes a discriminatory or inappropriate remark, or blatantly violates a policy, it’s important for the rest of your employees to see it addressed immediately.)

**Allow for downtime.** If you’re trying to work collaboratively with a Green personality type, Erikson says one of the worst things you can do is rush her. While it’s important to make sure a Green _is_ moving, she needs occasional periods of time where she can be alone and working at her own tranquil pace.

(Shortform note: For some people, the pressure of a ticking clock can kill productivity. If you want your slower colleague to be efficient, encouraging her to move at _your_ pace can easily backfire. Instead, discuss the time expectations ahead of time and choose a deadline that is realistic for both of you.)

**Take charge.** Green types rarely want to lead, and they aren’t built for it. If you’re working with them, Erikson recommends you lead the conversations and make the major decisions. Green personalities prefer to follow the roadmap rather than write it.

(Shortform note: Even if they don’t want to make the decision, most people want to feel like their opinion matters. Erikson says you can help this personality type by taking the lead, but it’s more considerate to ask them for their thoughts, and _ask_ if they’d like you to take charge.)

#### Persuading a Blue Personality Type

**Stick to the facts.** Like Reds, Blue personalities don’t want to get personal with you. Erikson reiterates that Blues are task-oriented, and if you’re at work, they have no interest in being your friend. He recommends you approach them in a polite but businesslike manner.

(Shortform note: It’s possible to be warm and authentic while still remaining on-task and professional. Most people (regardless of personality type) will accept small bits of personal information as long as it’s not dwelled upon. For example, you can mention one of your hobbies during your greeting: _“_ Good morning! This rain is unbelievable isn’t it? I’m glad I didn’t ride my bike to work today like I normally do.” After this short anecdote, get down to business.)

**Over-prepare.** Erikson stresses that Blue types are extremely detail-oriented and thorough researchers. When you want to persuade them of something, be more prepared than you think you need to be. Erikson recommends you predict what they will ask and have documentation ready. If you don’t know the answer, Erikson warns against guessing—he says it’s a better idea to be honest upfront and find the answer after.

(Shortform note: If someone asks you a question and you don’t know the answer, how should you respond? Admitting that you “don’t know” is honest but doesn’t inspire confidence if you are trying to sell something. Instead, redirect the conversation by detailing what you do know on the subject, and offer to follow up with specifics. For example, if you’re trying to convince your boss to add another person to your team, and she asks, _“_ What return can we expect to see?” you can respond with, “I can tell you that the last time we added a team member, output and profit increased dramatically. I can get the exact figures to you by the end of the day if you’d like.”)

**Keep your pitch realistic.** Erikson says that Blue types are not dreamers, so don’t bother with an inspirational speech or hyperbolic statements. Instead, only promise what you know you can deliver, using exact figures when available. For example, rather than saying “I will grow our sales to the best in the state!” say, “I will increase our sales by 15%.”

(Shortform note: “Under promise and over-deliver” is common advice in business. However, a study at UC San Diego found that while customers remembered who didn’t keep their promises, they quickly forgot about the ones who exceeded their guarantees. The conclusion is that it’s important to follow through with what you promise, but not as important to go above and beyond.)

#### Working With a Blue Personality Type

**Allow them to be meticulous** , even if it takes a long time. When it comes to work, Erikson says Blue types value quality over everything else. They are perfectionists and they’ll be unhappy in their work if you rush them. Although they may take longer than you’d like, Erikson says you’ll save time in the long run because revisions and corrections won’t be needed.

(Shortform note: You may feel less frustrated with the perfectionism if you know what exactly is being perfected. If you are waiting on a colleague to finish something, and she says it’s not ready, try asking, “Can I ask which part you’re still working on, and if I can help in any way?” There’s a good chance she will launch into an explanation about what needs fixing, and you will agree with her.)

**Be precise with expectations.** This is a caveat to the previous instruction. Erikson acknowledges that there will be times when a task needs to be completed more quickly than a Blue-dominant person would like. When you can’t afford to give the Blue an endless deadline, Erikson says to be exact about when you need the task done. Rather than asking them to work more quickly, or pressuring them with questions like, “When do you think you’ll be done?” simply tell them, “I need this on my desk by end of day Friday.” They will appreciate the clarity and meet the expectation.

(Shortform note: It can be difficult to set clear expectations in a collaboration if there isn’t a hierarchy. If you are working with a teammate of equal rank and neither of you has been designated as the “lead,” any rule or time limit set for one person by the other will breed resentment. In cases such as these, hash out the expectations early on, and make sure that both parties agree to the plan.)
