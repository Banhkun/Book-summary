## 7: On Exercise

**The most important thing to understand about exercise is that diet control is far more effective at causing weight loss than exercise.** For most people, it is much more painful to burn 100 extra calories by jogging than it is to merely avoid 100 calories of food.

But what about gaining muscle? Each additional pound of muscle only burns 6 calories per day. And gaining a pound of muscle is far harder than you think.

This is not to say that exercise isn’t beneficial. The medical consensus is that exercise is great for overall health outcomes, quality of life, bone density, energy levels, sleep quality, etc. But merely for the purpose of losing weight, you should focus on meal planning and calorie cutting, rather than burning more calories through exercise.

The book has a chapter on exercise, mainly around body weight fitness (pushups, squats, running in place, and leg lifts). The author suggests tracking your progression on these exercises, as a way of motivating yourself and seeing how you’re getting more fit as you lose weight. Since exercise is a far-reaching topic, we’re choosing not to summarize more here, but you can read the original chapter here.
