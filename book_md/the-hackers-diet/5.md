## 5: Starting to Lose Weight

We've now covered all the critical knowledge and tactics needed to lose weight. Now we formally put it together into a feedback loop system that controls your weight:

  * Estimate the calories you need.
  * Plan your meals to meet your calorie target.
  * Log your weight daily.
  * Observe the trend of your weight. This gives you the truth of your net calorie balance.
  * Adjust your calorie estimate to keep track of your trend.



If you’re losing less weight than you expect, there are only two possibilities. Either you’re burning fewer calories than you expected, or you’re eating more calories than you budgeted, or both. Analyze your situation, and adjust accordingly.

This forms the feedback loop you need to lose weight. By going through multiple iterations of measurement and adjustment, it is simple to reach your goal.

### Getting Ready

If you have little knowledge of calorie content of foods, and tracking weight is new to you, it may be wise to spend a couple of weeks just getting used to the actions — monitoring your daily weight and measuring your calorie spend. Once you’ve become accustomed to your weight fluctuations and the procedures, you’ll be better equipped to execute your plan.

When you’re ready to start, follow these steps:

**1) Measure your current weight and set your weight target.** A general weight goal is to set your target weight based on your height and your frame

  * Each person may have stable weights that are far easier to maintain than a weight 5 pounds lighter or heavier. The author notes that 145 or 165 was easier to maintain than 155.



**2) Figure out your desired deadline for reaching your target weight.** Get the number of days between today and your deadline.

**3) Calculate your calorie deficit.** This is given by the simple formula:

(Target weight loss in pounds) * 3500 / (Days to deadline)

For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds in 2 months (or 60 days), you will need to run a deficit of (10 * 3500 / 60) = 583 calories per day.

As a rule of thumb, 500 per day loses 1 pound per week. Cutting more than 500 calories per day is difficult, and more than 800 calories very difficult to sustain. It’s better to have a more conservative target first then ramp up your deficit as you get more experience, rather than setting an impossibly difficult target upfront and giving up the whole endeavor.

**4) Finally, take a few before pictures of yourself.** Ideally get a full-length picture of your front, profile, and back. Do this in a mirror or ask someone to take them for you. While you may be hesitant to do this, it has a number of benefits:

  * Weight loss is incremental, and you don’t easily perceive differences in a few pounds week to week. But after you lose 10 pounds, the visual difference with your before picture will be obvious. This positive feedback will motivate you to keep going.
  * A before picture will remind you of your past and reinforce that being thin is much better and worth the minor effort to maintain.



### The Initial Plunge

**The first 3 days are the hardest. It gets easier.** Know this, because otherwise you’ll think you need to endure weeks of the same magnitude of pain.

In your normal diet, your body is used to a bounty of plenty. It just burns whatever you eat, and stores the excess. Life is good. When you have a calorie deficit, your body burns all that you eat, and it burns fat to make up the shortfall. But switching from fat storage to fat burning takes time — around 3 days.

In the first few days, your body will panic from the sudden deprivation of calories. Dieting, after all, is just a euphemism for “deliberate starvation.” Your body will shut things down to conserve energy. At this point, **you’ll experience the most severe shortage of nutrition in the entire course of the diet**. You’ll feel cold, weak, irritable, tired, and a constant gnawing hunger. It is this bad, and it’s not good to sugarcoat this — better for you to know what will come and handle it better.

But your body is also smart, and it quickly adapts to what it perceives as the “new normal.” **Your body won’t let you be weak, irritable, and starving for months on end.** It switches from metabolizing food you eat and storing fat, to fat burning. But it takes some time for this to kick in. Once you pass the first 72 hours, the worst is behind you. It’s unlikely you’ll experience anything as bad as the first days. Knowing that an unpleasant experience is limited in time will get you through it.

The pain is an investment for a lifetime of reduced suffering. Endure 3 days of hunger on one side, vs 8 months of recuperation from a heart attack on the other. Furthermore, any pain that you feel now should be motivation for you to keep your weight, so that you’ll never have to go through _that_ again.

If you’re having trouble getting past the first few days, the author suggests an alternative of **partial fasting in the first few days of dieting** , ingesting only about 500 calories a day. He suggests a more extreme calorie deficit hastens the transition time to burning fat, so adaptation might happen in 2 days instead of 3. Further, the pain of being 1200 calories short might not be perceived as much worse than 500 calories a day. If you do this, drink plenty of liquids since this makes you feel more full.

### When and How to Start

**Start your weight loss during a regular period of time when you have a regular schedule** , ideally of at least 2 weeks of “normal life.” Maintaining a weight loss plan benefits from momentum and “getting in the groove.” During a vacation, extensive travel, or holidays, it’s hard to maintain the discipline your plan requires.

Start your diet at the beginning of a work week, typically Monday. Work is a useful distraction from hunger. Otherwise on weekends, if you just sit around hungry, you’re likely to break your calorie limit. If you start on Monday, by the time Saturday comes, you’ll be well adapted and past the 72 hour hump.

**Before you start, sit down and plan out the first five days’ meal plan. Include specific foods at specific times.** Having this certainty will help you deal with hunger by knowing that the hunger time is limited. It’ll also help you avoid the temptation of preparing more food or eating more when you’re hungry.

### The Long Haul

Past the first 3 days, and past a few weeks, you’ll find that the diet becomes less of a bother. The hunger softens from an aching pain you think about constantly, to a minor annoyance that becomes a fact of life. And the positives will start arriving — you’ll notice changes in how you look and feel, and the rewards will motivate you to continue.

Continue tracking your weight daily and computing the trend. Don’t make sudden adjustments to your plan. Reflect every 3 weeks or so. And if you do make a change, don’t expect to see the change reflected immediately in the trend line — it lags behind, and will take at least 1-2 weeks to show up.

### Troubleshooting

#### Day-to-Day Fluctuations in Weight

Don’t use your day to day weight as the number you derive self-worth from. As you know, it is almost entirely water influenced by salt. Focus on the trend line. As long as the trend is going down, ignore your daily weight. This means not being disappointed by sudden gains of weight, while also not getting excited about sudden drops of weight.

#### Plateaus in Weight Loss

You may notice periods when the trend line stalls for a few days. You might be getting through a stable point for your body. Stay with the diet and in a few more days the trend will resume its decline.

#### Drink Liquids

Drink at least 2 quarts of liquid daily. An easy way to do this is to measure it out in a container, and make sure you drink it by the end of the day. This will help you feel less hungry by filling your stomach, and it’ll also flush out metabolites from your new fat burning.

#### Constipation and Stool

Your body is used to moving a certain volume of food through your digestive tract a day. When you reduce the volume of food you eat, you absorb a greater percentage of the food you eat, and there is less bulk to move the stool through.

Eating lots of fiber and vegetables is the best way to deal with this.

#### Side Effects of Weight Loss

By far, the benefits of weight loss outweigh any of the downsides. But there are a few downsides:

  * With less fat, your body heat is insulated less well. You’ll tend to get chilled more easily. So wear more clothes.
  * Your immune system is weakened during the time you have a calorie deficit (your body conserves energy, and less energy is spent on your immune system). Get a flu shot and practice typical cold prevention hygiene.
  * Less fat will make your skin looser and make your veins show more easily. This is also temporary. Your skin is elastic and will adjust over time. 



Overall these are mild, temporary downsides during the course of calorie deficit. When you reach your target and resume maintenance calories, your body will adapt again and life will be good.

#### Lack of Social Recognition of Weight Loss

“Why is no one noticing my weight loss? I wish someone would compliment me.”

Don’t blame people. First off, it’s hard to perceive day to day differences, especially through just your face and your hands, which is typically all that they see of your body.

What _will_ happen is one day someone will say, “hey didn’t you use to be fat?”

In any case, don’t strive for feedback from others — get validation from your weight tracking.

Secondly, many people may actually suspect you’ve lost weight, but out of politeness keep they it to themselves. Imagine if you thought someone lost weight, you asked if they had, and they said, “no” quietly and disappointedly. People want to avoid this awkward situation.

#### Dealing with Hard Times and Hunger

There will be bad days. Your boss yelled at you, your parents don’t like something you’re doing, your car breaks down — all at once. With all these stressors, it’s hard to stay on goal and not cheat on your diet, going back to your favorite foods.

The worst setbacks often happen late at night. Hours after you eat dinner, you’re hungry again. You’re alone, so no one can help you. You may be around food around the house, so a snack is tempting.

In these times, remember why you’re doing this. You may want to live longer; have better health; avoid terrible complications like heart attacks; accomplish more in life and career; get more social acceptance.

Also, think about why you eat. **Are you eating because you want to eat, or are you eating to stop the hunger?** Be very careful about this distinction. More often than you think, we eat as a ritual, to stave off boredom, or from social pressure.

Also, think about how you’ll feel after cheating your meal plan. Guilty? Disappointed? Protect your future self from shame by making the strong decision today.

Finally, if you have a predictable time of day when you’re hungry, consider shifting some calories to that time.

### Success and Transitioning to Stability

Eventually, your weight will hit your goal. Congratulations! But don’t let off immediately. You need to transition from losing weight to maintaining weight stability.

First, even if you weigh under your target, give yourself a little margin of safety.

  * **Make sure your _trend line_ is under your target, not that day’s weight.** You might have just gotten a lucky dehydrated day that won’t last the next day. 
  * Next, aim to be 3 pounds below your original target, if you have no trouble continuing the diet. This will protect you from a small bounce up in the transition process.



When you hit these goals, next, **don’t immediately add your calorie deficit to your current meal plan**. Your body has become more efficient at using limited calories — it’s ramped down your metabolism — and it needs to shift back to burning your food. Transition back over 4 weeks by adding back a quarter of the calorie deficit week by week.

Allow some time for settling. If the trend line is bumping up, then cut back again by a quarter of the calories, then let things stabilize.

Then that’s it. Your diet is finished. Your weight problem is history. The discomfort is over. Next, we’ll cover how to guarantee you’ll never gain back the weight you just lost.
