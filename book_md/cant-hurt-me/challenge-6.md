## Challenge 6: Stock Your Cookie Jar

We often decide to take on challenges while we’re in our comfort zone, but we’re so comfortable, we don’t anticipate obstacles that could arise. To deal with this, we need additional strategies to keep going, even when we face obstacles and want to quit.

Reminding yourself of your previous accomplishments is one way to overcome obstacles. Goggins calls this collection of accomplishments your Cookie Jar.

There’s science behind this strategy. If you get overwhelmed by obstacles, you may forget why you’re doing something and start talking to yourself in a negative way that robs you of energy to keep going. When you feel stressed, your body’s fight or flight system is at work. It’s trying to make a decision about whether to continue with what you’re doing (fight) or abandon it (flight). Focusing on your accomplishments instead of doubtful negative self-talk reminds you of what you’re capable of, giving you the energy to “fight” and keep going.

Goggins developed the cookie jar concept during his experience transitioning from Navy SEAL to ultramarathon runner.

### The Road to Badwater 135

In 2005, Goggins learned of the death of nearly an entire team of special operatives in Afghanistan. He wanted to raise college funds for the children of the deceased soldiers. As a fundraiser, he decided to try ultramarathons, running races that are longer than a marathon.

Goggins wanted to compete in the Badwater 135, a famous 135-mile ultramarathon in California from the floor of Death Valley to the pinnacle of Mount Whitney. But the event director required runners to have already competed in one 100-mile ultra race or more, and was unwilling to make an exception for Goggins. He suggested that Goggins compete in the San Diego One Day, a 24-hour, 100-mile race where each lap around the course is one mile. If he could do it, then he could run in the Badwater 135.

Goggins only had 3 days before the San Diego One Day, so there was little time to prepare. He hadn’t run more than one mile at a time in 6 months. Though he’d kept in good physical shape through strength training, his cardio fitness was nonexistent.

### San Diego One Day

On the day of the race, Goggins started off at a fast pace, faster than he’d need to run to complete the race in 24 hours. But by mile 70, he couldn’t go any further.

Goggins’s wife, who was there supporting him, helped him into a lawn chair to rest. He was dealing with all kinds of bodily complications. Most of his toenails were falling off, and he’d learn later that he had stress fractures in his feet. He hid the bloody urine and diarrhea running down his legs from his wife so she wouldn’t pull him from the race.

Unable to see what terrible shape he was in, his wife believed he still had a chance to finish the race and encouraged him to keep going. But he was walking now, and she told him he needed to pick up the pace if he was going to make it 100 miles in 24 hours.

#### Digging Into the Cookie Jar

Despite desperately wanting to quit, Goggins drew upon yet another strategy to keep going—his Cookie Jar. Growing up, Goggins’s mother always made sure to stock their cookie jar with a variety of cookies. She’d let him have two at a time, and he learned to savor each cookie. It brought a little brightness to both of their lives.

He applied this as a metaphor to help himself get through tough times—he drew from a mental cookie jar of his accomplishments when times were tough. **In this way, he used his past victories to motivate himself to keep going.** Goggins’s cookies included studying to bring himself up to the appropriate reading level, passing the Air Force exam, and losing 106 pounds in three months to be eligible for SEAL training. This strategy is more than just thinking about the memory—it’s remembering how good it felt in the moment.

Thinking about his past victories and recognizing his toughness gave Goggins strength to start running again and finish the race. Though he suffered severe dehydration, he felt elated to be able to finish the hundred miles.

### Take Action: Stock Your Cookie Jar

Just like Goggins, you can come up with your own set of victories to remind yourself of when facing difficulty. Here’s how:

  1. **Use your journal to write down your major life victories.** Examples include exceeding a sales goal, running a half marathon, or convincing the city council to fund homelessness services.
  2. **Write down all of the obstacles you’ve overcome, too.** Examples include managing obsessive compulsive disorder, stopping smoking, or improving your relationship with your parents.
  3. As you work toward your goals, draw on this list to help you when you want to stop short of your goal.
  4. (Optional) Share your cookies and how they help you reach new goals through social media with the hashtags #cookiejar #canthurtme
