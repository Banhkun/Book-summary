## Challenge 1: Face Your Bad Hand

As you grow up, your life circumstances can affect your growth and development. Though it seems counterintuitive, acknowledging the difficult circumstances you’ve faced can be a good first step toward overcoming additional challenges—you can draw strength from your past successes.

### An Abusive Father and School Struggles

For Goggins, acknowledging and overcoming his school struggles and his abusive father opened new doors. Before age 8, Goggins lived with his mother, father, and brother in Buffalo, New York. His father forced the family members to work nights at his lucrative roller skating rink, called Skateland. If anything was out of place, like a missing pair of skates, Goggins’s father beat his son at home with a belt. His mother and brother faced regular abuse as well.

Eventually, his mother sought help from a friend to get herself and her children to safety. They escaped to her hometown of Brazil, Indiana, though his brother returned shortly thereafter to live with their father back in Buffalo. Goggins was 8 years old.

### School Struggles

Due to his work at Skateland, Goggins had fallen behind in school. He, his brother, and mother worked at night, often sleeping on a couch in an office onsite. He was often sleep-deprived during the day.

When they arrived in Brazil, Goggins’s mother enrolled him in the second grade for a second time because he couldn’t yet read at a second-grade level. He had a wonderful teacher who dedicated extra time to helping him learn.

But during the third grade, Goggins’s teacher, Ms. D, wasn’t willing to give him the extra instruction and care he needed to succeed in class. She thought Goggins needed to be placed in a separate school for special needs students, and the school administration supported her.

**It was stressful for Goggins to be thought of as lesser, especially because he was the only black child at the school.** He scaled back his participation in class and developed a stutter. Goggins’s mother fought the decision to send Goggins to another school, and the school agreed to let him stay if he was enrolled in group therapy.

But group therapy included children with true illnesses, unlike Goggins, who needed assistance catching up academically. This further augmented his stress—his stutter worsened, and he started losing patches of hair and developing white splotches on his skin.

Refusing to continue with group therapy, and facing pressure from his teacher to do better, Goggins started cheating. It improved his grades and test scores, reassuring Ms. D but stunting his learning.

### Poverty

Goggins’s mother took a job at a local department store to support her son. They lived in subsidized housing, but still struggled to make ends meet.

When Goggins’s mother attempted to get on welfare, she learned she was considered ineligible because she had a car. She devised a workaround, routing the check through her mother, who lived in town. But the check was for only $123 each month. Between her job, welfare, and stores of coins she had saved over the years, they scraped by, but barely, augmenting Goggins’s stress.

### Toxic Stress

Goggins learned later in life that toxic stress—the term for prolonged stress faced in childhood—likely altered his development.

Stress is helpful for survival in the short term, but in the long-term, it can have severe consequences. High stress levels limit children’s ability to retain information and build language skills, which limits their learning. When kids are exposed to toxic stress, they can develop health problems later in life, such as depression, obesity, and heart disease. They’re also more likely to engage in risky behavior, like smoking. A child raised in an abusive household has a 53 percent likelihood of being arrested before the age of 18, and is 38 percent more likely to commit a crime as an adult.

In his adult life, Goggins grappled with the effects of toxic stress from his childhood.

### Take Action: Face Your Bad Hand

To begin confronting the obstacles you currently face, take stock of the circumstances that have shaped your life, past and present. In the upcoming chapters, you’ll learn how to use these circumstances as motivation.

Here are the steps:

  1. **Start a journal.** Paper or digital is fine—for instance, you could take notes on your laptop or phone.
  2. **List out all of the difficult things you’ve faced or face in life.** Ask yourself the following questions to jog your memory:


  * What difficult circumstances did you face growing up? For example, you might have faced abuse or felt low self-esteem. Or, did you grow up without major challenges and therefore failed to learn to push outside your comfort zone?
  * What kinds of challenges do you face now? For example, maybe a boss is limiting your progress at work, or you’re sabotaging yourself in some way from moving forward.


  1. **(Optional) Share your list.** It could be with a friend or on social media using the hashtags #badhand and #canthurtme.
