## Challenge 9 and 10: Learn From Failure and Seek Greatness

Sometimes, we’re so scared of failing that we stop ourselves from even trying something. To combat this, frame your failure as an opportunity to learn something so it feels less risky. Then, if you fail, you can evaluate the failure and refine your approach to reach your goal.

**Once you’ve met your goal, pushing yourself to go above and beyond rather than settling can help you continuously improve yourself and achieve greatness that distinguishes you from others.**

Goggins’s experience attempting to become an Army Ranger and breaking the Guinness World Record for pull-ups demonstrate these principles.

### More Training Desired

After Goggins’s SEAL training, he got deployed with a platoon to Malaysia where he realized that he held himself to a higher standard than other SEALS. SEALS are considered elite compared to the rest of the Navy and compared to society in general, but Goggins felt like he desired to push himself, train harder, and earn his keep more than even most SEALS wanted to.

**In addition to physical training, Goggins spent his free time studying weaponry and war.** In his first evaluation, he got feedback that he should spend some of that time socializing as a way to learn from the other guys informally and understand the job better. But he was introverted and didn’t want to spend time partying in off hours.

Most people take a break when they finish a deployment, but Goggins decided to look into training in the special forces units of other military branches between deployments. He requested to go through Army Ranger training—he felt he could better himself by gaining additional special operations skills.

### Army Ranger Training

Goggins traveled to Fort Benning, Georgia for Army ranger training. The training consisted of six different phases, including weapons knowledge, navigation, and reconnaissance. For example, one phase consisted of learning skills in the mountains like patrolling and rappelling.

To prove their skills, trainees had to complete four nighttime field training exercises. One night, a winter storm blew in, and all anyone had for warmth was a thin poncho and each other.

Goggins figured that the storm represented a perfect simulation of the conditions that would make soldiers vulnerable to an enemy attack. Instead of huddling with the group, he walked out to hold part of the perimeter, shouting into the night when he reached it.**In doing so, Goggins demonstrated his interest in pursuing opportunities to lead and stand out from the rest.** A few others were inspired and did the same.

### Breaking the Pull-up Record

Goggins wasn’t content to be known just for his Navy career and ultra races. Though he needed to take a break from ultra races due to dizzy spells, he realized that he did a lot of pull-ups as part of his regular training and wondered if he could break the world record for number of pull-ups in 24 hours. The record at the time was 4,020 pull-ups, which was held by Stephen Hyland. While doing pull-ups, he could take breaks and avoid the dizziness brought on by running.

Goggins reached out to the same organization he raised money for through his ultra running to ask if they’d accept fundraising from this event. Then, a friend of his booked him a spot to attempt to break the record on _The Today Show_.

To train for this appearance, he ramped up his pull-up regimen—400 pull-ups each weekday and 1,500 on weekend days.

#### First Attempt: _The Today Show_

When the big day came, Goggins immediately encountered several issues:

  * The television studio was filled with bright lights, and interacting with the hosts and people passing by the studio required him to be more social than he preferred.
  * The bar had more give than he was used to. This forced him to use more power with each pull-up, wearing him out faster than he expected.
  * He wasn’t getting enough calories. Though he was sipping a carbohydrate drink all day, he wasn’t getting any protein. He ended up ordering a cheeseburger, but he still wasn’t able to avoid severe fatigue.



After doing 2,500 pull-ups, he decided to quit. **Though he felt disappointed to have failed in front of a large audience, he realized he had a chance of succeeding if he tweaked his approach and tried again.**

He evaluated what went well and what needed to be improved. For his second attempt, he decided to use a venue that was more private, eat better so his muscles didn’t get fatigued as readily, use gymnastic chalk and tape, and get a sturdier pull-up bar.

#### Second Attempt: CrossFit Gym

Goggins found a CrossFit gym near his mother’s home in Nashville that offered a sturdier bar and the more private environment he wanted. Gym members could help support him and cheer him on during the event, but it would be more private than the television studio.

During his second attempt, he encountered yet more difficulties.

  * Though the bar was sturdier, it came at a cost: Goggins started developing blisters on his hands that he couldn’t soothe with taping or ointments. Though he was wearing gloves, the repetitive movement of the pull-ups cut his palms down to the nerve layer of his skin, making each movement extremely painful.
  * His muscles started spasming and a nurse who was monitoring him said he was suffering from rhabdomyolysis—when a certain group of muscles is so overworked that they start breaking down and the kidneys have trouble filtering out the protein. The nurse warned that it could be deadly, but he decided to proceed with caution.



After about 3,200 pull-ups, the pain was overwhelming and he wasn’t doing pull-ups fast enough to break the record. He decided to quit. However, he knew he wanted to attempt it again, so he took stock of what worked and what needed to change. For example:

  * He liked doing it in the CrossFit gym, but having gym members in the room was still distracting. When he attempted it again, he wanted half the people from before.
  * The sturdier bar helped him get 700 more pull-ups than his first attempt, though it hurt his hands in the process. He decided to ask a mattress company to custom design foam pads for his hands for his next attempt—with approval from Guinness World Records.



#### Third Attempt: CrossFit Gym

During his third attempt, Goggins was still dealing with hand issues and rhabdomyolysis, as well as a new challenge: feeling like he was going to fail again.

Instead of turning his doubt inward on himself and hurting his performance further, he focused his energy toward the current record holder, Stephen Hyland. **He pretended that Hyland was an evil genius that only he could defeat by taking his title, which gave him the energy to push on.** He got past the record of 4,020 pull-ups, completing 4,030.

### Take Action: Learn From Failure and Seek Greatness

#### Learn From Failure

Learn to reflect on your failure with these steps:

1\. Think of a recent failure.

2\. Using a journal–on paper this time, if it isn’t already—use the following questions to help you evaluate the failure:

  * What did you do well as you prepared for and executed the failure?
  * How did you handle the failure?
  * How did the failure affect your relationships with others?
  * How did it affect your life?



Even if you ultimately failed, it’s unlikely you did everything poorly in the lead-up. This is a chance to recognize the things you did right.

3\. Make a list of things you could have done differently. Try to be as honest with yourself as possible.

4\. (Optional) As soon as you can, schedule a time to make another attempt at the thing you failed at. If for some reason you can’t attempt the experience again, just do steps 1-3.

5\. (Optional) Share your experience on social media with the hashtags #empowermentoffailure #canthurtme.

#### Seek Greatness

When you eventually reach your goal, it may be tempting to stop there. But many people operate this way. Instead, to set yourself apart from others, keep seeking new challenges rather than settling.

For example, if you reach your goal of running a half marathon, try another challenge. Maybe you try running longer distances or try trail running instead. Or, maybe you choose a different kind of physical challenge altogether, like swimming.
