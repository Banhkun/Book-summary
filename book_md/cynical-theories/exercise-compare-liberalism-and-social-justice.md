## Exercise: Compare Liberalism and Social Justice

Consider how liberalism and the Social Justice Movement affect inequality.

* * *

Do you think the Social Justice Movement is addressing inequality in modern society, or making it worse? How so?

Do you think the tenets of liberalism—free speech, belief in science, and so on—are still prevalent in society today? Why or why not?

How can society preserve free speech while also moving away from the tenets of the Social Justice Movement? For example, this could be done by enforcing a balanced curriculum in schools with many different ideologies.
