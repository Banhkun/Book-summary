## Exercise: Strengthen Your Prefrontal Cortex

Lembke writes that your prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in thinking honestly and setting long-term goals, and that you can strengthen this part of your brain by thinking about the future. In this exercise, we'll walk you through a guided reflection on your future to strengthen this part of your brain.

Imagine what you want your life to look like 10 years from now. What are your relationships with other people like? What will your family look like? What will your friendships look like? Are there conflicts or issues you would like to leave in the past?

Again, imagine the life you want 10 years from now. Reflect on your hobbies and career. How will they have changed? What achievements do you imagine feeling most proud of?

Reflect on what you would like your character to look like 10 years from now. What habits have you successfully strengthened? What vices have you overcome? What mindsets have you left behind that were holding you back?
