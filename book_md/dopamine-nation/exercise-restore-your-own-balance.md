## Exercise: Restore Your Own Balance

Lembke writes that you must cut back on high-dopamine activities to restore your brain's internal balance. In this exercise, reflect on your own lifestyle and make concrete plans to restore this balance for yourself.

* * *

List your high-dopamine activities. Think broadly: Are there chemicals you ingest daily like caffeine or nicotine? Are there websites or games that you can't stay away from? How about sweets or junk food?

Pick one of your high-dopamine activities you would like to do less often. Remember Lembke's three strategies for limiting your access: spatial, temporal, and associational restrictions. Explain which of these strategies would help the most, and how you plan to execute it.

What are the short-term pain and long-term reward you can expect to receive from abstaining from this activity? For example, cutting out junk food will cause intense cravings for a couple of weeks, but eating healthier will eventually help you feel less bloated and sluggish.
