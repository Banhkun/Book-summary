## Exercise: Place Images in Your Memory Palace

Our brains are naturally good at remembering places. Mentally place images into a memory of a real place in order to remember those images better.

* * *

Think of a place you know very well, such as your childhood home. Picture it in your mind. What are some important locations in it? Consider the bottom of the driveway, front porch, shower, and so on.

Recall the three images you created in the last exercise. Mentally place each of them in a significant location of your memory palace.

From memory, without looking at the answers to the previous questions, write down the route through your memory palace, noting where and when you come across the images you placed in it.
