## 1-Page Summary

In 2005, journalist Joshua Foer (Josh) reported on the US Memory Championships. Many of the competitors he interviewed told him that they weren’t geniuses. They simply used memory techniques, and the techniques were so accessible anyone could learn them—including Josh. Grand Master of Memory Ed Cooke offered to train Josh in the memory arts and Josh, considering it a good journalistic experiment, agreed.

Over the next year, Josh learned the memory arts from Ed but also studied memory more broadly, interviewing famous mnemonists, savants, scientists, and researchers. _Moonwalking with Einstein_ is a compilation of everything he learned and the story of his year training to be a mnemonist, or mental athlete.

### What Is Memory and How Does it Work?

Science doesn’t fully understand how memory works yet, but it does know that **our brains are a network of neurons, and an individual memory is a group of connections between neurons.**

Additionally, **memories aren’t stored in any linear way; they’re stored in a web of associations.** For example, thinking of the word “baker” would probably also make you think about bread, the smell of yeast, your favorite bakery, and so on.

**To remember something consciously, we need a cue.** For example, if you’re trying to remember what your friend’s car looks like, you might have to think more generally about your friend or about cars in order to “search” the web of associations that will eventually lead you to the memory of your friend’s car.

There are several different types of memories:

  * **Internal.** Internal memories include the information you keep inside your heads.
  * **External.** External memories include the information you keep outside your heads, such as what you write down on Post-it notes or take pictures of.
  * **Working.** The working memory is in charge of whatever you’re currently focusing on. It’s a filter between your perception and your long term memory. It can only hold about five to nine different things at once.
  * **Long-term.** The long-term memory stores things you need to remember for longer than a few moments.
  * **Declarative.** Declarative memories are individual conscious memories. There are two types of declarative memories:
    * **Episodic** memories are memories of experiences. They have a place and time attached to them. For example, the time you went surfing in Hawaii is an episodic memory.
    * **Semantic** memories are memories of concepts and facts. For example, the fact that surfing is a water sport in which you stand on a board is a semantic memory.
  * **Nondeclarative.** Nondeclarative memories are unconscious memories such as motor skills and habits. For example, riding a bike.



**Whenever you think or make a memory, you physically change your brain.** You can form new neurons or rearrange the neurons you already have. Additionally, it’s possible to improve your memory. While there are some people with naturally incredible memories, such as savants, anyone can improve their memory using memory techniques.

**The human memory evolved to be good at remembering images and places because these sorts of memories are important for survival.** The brain is also naturally good at remembering things that it finds interesting, such as sex and humor, and things that form patterns, such as songs or rhyming poems.

#### Memory and Other Mental Faculties

Memory is related to many of the other things that go on in our brains, such as identity, expertise, intelligence, and our perception of time.

Because our memories are stored in a web of associations in our brains, **whenever we encounter something new, our interpretation of it is filtered by what we already know.** As a result, our memories of the past are constantly influencing our actions in the present. We behave the way we do because of our memories, and, therefore, our memories shape our identities.

Our memories also affect our expertise and intelligence. Interestingly, scientists have discovered that **expertise isn’t a function of intuition or intelligence—it’s a matter of perceiving things and relating them to the patterns of associations we already have in our heads.** Experts have seen so many versions of the same thing that when they came across a situation, they can instantly remember the most relevant previous experience and apply the correct response without even thinking.

  * For example, chess players can look at a board and come up with the ideal move within five seconds. They don’t have to consciously plan out moves in advance or try to predict what their opponent will do because they’re so familiar with board positions, they know how things will play out.



Finally, memory has a large effect on how we perceive the passing of time. Contrary to the old adage about time flying when you’re having fun, **time appears to pass more quickly when we’re bored and more slowly when we’re doing interesting new things and making new memories.** For example, as you get older, do you feel like time passes more quickly? This is because you’re making fewer memories than you did as a child when you were encountering things for the very first time.

We remember events in relation to other events, so the more memories we can lay down, the denser our network of associations. The denser the web, the more time it feels like we have. Some people make new memories with the express purpose of making their lives feel longer.

#### Forgetting

Scientists used to think that people remembered everything that had ever happened to them, and memories only became inaccessible because the cues were lost over time. However, this is not the case—**memories do fade over time at the cellular level.**

**Memories fade most quickly in the hours and days after forming.** Anything that’s left after a month tends to stay with us long-term. Interestingly, our memories change over time. We tend to remember our oldest memories in third person, as if we were watching them, and our newer memories from our own points of view. Sometimes our memories change so much they no longer even accurately record what happened.

Why don’t we remember anything before we were three or four? This should have been a very memorable time our lives—everything we encountered was new. It could be due to a few reasons: our brains aren’t fully developed until we’re three or four, most of our early learning is unconscious, and we don’t have language or a large existing web of associations. Even when we encounter new things, if we don’t have anything already in our heads to associate them with, they don’t stick.

Amnesia can also be responsible for forgetting. The acts of creating and recalling memories take place in different parts of the brain, so it’s possible to be unable to form new memories but still capable of remembering old ones, or vice versa.

### A History of Memory

In early human history, the only place to store knowledge was in your memory. No external memory aids, such as writing or calendars, existed. Additionally, because writing didn’t exist yet, the only way to transmit and preserve information for future generations was to communicate it orally. As a result, **memory techniques were widely known and memory was an important marker of character and intelligence.** The more you had memorized, the more you knew, and the more ethically you could act.

Writing started to appear in the 5th century BC, but the memory arts were still important. Early texts were written on scrolls in continuous text, with no chapter divisions, paragraphs, or even spaces between words. **These texts were so difficult to read that people used them primarily to remember things they already knew, rather than as a method for offloading their memories externally.** For example, it would be difficult to sight-read the phrase HAPPYBIRTHDAYTOYOUHAPPYBIRTHDAYTOYOU unless you already knew what it said. It would also be impossible to pick out a particular section, such as the beginning of the second phrase, unless you already knew the order of information.

Writing and book-making improved over the centuries. The parchment codex (a bound book) replaced scrolls and punctuation evolved. A notable book on the memory arts was written sometime between 86-82 BC, the _Rhetorica ad Herennium_. Mnemonists still refer to this book today.

**The game-changer for the utility of books as external memory aids was the index.** In the 13th century AD, the first index-like structure appeared, the concordance of the Bible. A concordance is a list of words and phrases with a locator that tells you where in a work they appear. Using a concordance, for the first time, you could find a specific piece of information without already knowing the organization of the work.

Around 1440, the printing press appeared. Now, books were easier to make and reproduce, and they became affordable. Interestingly, **memory techniques experienced a renaissance even though they were less necessary than ever.** Giulio Camillo tried to build a “Theater of Memory,” a building that would house every piece of knowledge in the universe, and Giordano Bruno built a device that would let him turn a word into an image (it worked a bit like a cipher wheel).

From the nineteenth century on, however, memory became less important to the general public. Memory techniques are no longer taught in school, and a good memory is impressive, but more of a party trick than a virtue. **These days, most of us rely on external memories such as calendars and phones to remember things for us.**

#### Memory and Education

In the 5th century BC, the memory arts were part of a classical education. Today, rote memorization is seen as unnecessary and even bad for the mind. What happened?

**Initially, schools based the educational system on the military, which was all about rote memorization.** Educators used to think memorization was good for the brain because regardless of what students were memorizing, they were training their minds.

Over the years, however, **there were many critics of the rote memorization approach and progressional education reform changed the system.** School became more about experiences and focused on teaching skills such as logic and creativity rather than straight facts.

There are critics of this new approach too. 66% of American 17-year-olds don’t know when the civil war took place and can’t even guess within 50 years. Tony Buzan, a well-known mnemonist, has tried to get memory techniques back into the classroom. (He’s been less successful at this than he has at selling self-help books.)

As we learned above, memory is related to intelligence and expertise—the more associations we already have in our brains, the more new information has to stick to. As a result, **it is easier to educate ourselves when we have an initial network of facts to connect new information to.** Some educators believe that rote memorization should still be part of the curriculum.

### Memory Techniques

**The goal of memory techniques is to transform information into a format the brain is naturally good at understanding—meaningful images and places.** To do this, you’ll use the method of loci, which is the foundation for the memory techniques that follow.

**The method of loci involves placing images of whatever you need to remember inside a “memory palace,” which is a memory of a real place you know very well,** such as your childhood home. For example, if your shopping list contains blueberries, crackers, cereal, and beer and you wanted to memorize this shopping list, you might mentally place the blueberries in the mailbox at the end of your driveway, the crackers on the front lawn, the cereal in front of the front door, and the beer on the entranceway mat. **When you need to remember the list, you simply mentally tour your memory palace and look for the objects you left in significant locations.**

Some things you need to remember might not lend themselves well to imagery. There are some more structured techniques for remembering cards, numbers, and words below, but in general, **you can transform abstract things to remember into images using creativity.** You’ll remember images best if you can harness the brain’s natural strengths and interests. Try to make images:

  * **Novel.** If you’ve seen something before, you’re less likely to remember a specific instance of it. 
    * For example, if you need to remember to charge your phone, imagine your phone and charger having a silly conversation.
  * **Lewd or funny.** The brain is naturally interested in both of these things.
    * For example, if you need to remember to go to the bank, imagine a bunch of nude bank robbers.
  * **Multisensory.** The more cues you can create for a memory, the easier it will be to recall it.
    * For example, if you need to remember to pick up horseradish, imagine the smell, taste, and texture of it as well as the visual image.
  * **Personal.** You’ll remember things better if they relate to what’s already in your head because they have a web to fit into. 
    * For example, if you’re interested in military history, use tanks and planes in your images.



In addition to the method of loci, there are five additional memory techniques. You can combine any of them with the method of loci—once you’ve used the technique to transform information into an image or more memorable form, you can store it in your memory palace.

#### Punning

**To use punning, change an abstract word into a concrete word by using rhymes or puns.** You can also employ alliteration or repetition. For example, if you need to remember the title of the book _The Joy of Cooking_ , you might picture a boy who’s good-looking.

Punning can also be used to memorize word-for-word. For example, mental athletes assign images to words like “and” and “the” and then picture a string of images to remember the exact words. One German mnemonist remembers the word “and” by picturing a circle because the German word for round, “rund,” rhymes with “and.”

#### Baker/baker Paradox

The Baker/baker paradox is a phenomenon you can manipulate to help yourself remember names. If you’re shown a picture of a person and told her last name is Baker, you won’t remember “baker” as well as if you’re told she _is_ a baker. This is because “Baker,” as a name, is an abstract concept without much to associate with it. As a profession, however, “baker” is associated with things like flour, the smell of cookies, the heat of an oven, and so on.

**To remember people’s names, create an image that combines what they look like with a visual of something that will cue a memory of their name.** For example, the name Joshua Foer could be remembered by imaging Joshua (he looks like this) joshing you so hard you break into four pieces.

#### “Method Acting”

This is a method of memorizing word-for-word that’s similar to method acting. To use this method, break sections of a text into small chunks and assign them emotions rather than images.

#### Chunking

Your working memory can only hold five to nine pieces of information at once, so if you need to remember something like a 16-digit credit card number, it’s a tall order. **Chunking is a method of breaking and combining individual things into meaningful groups** so that you have fewer things to remember.

For example, if you had to remember the letters ONCEUPONATIME, that’s 13 individual letters, more than your working memory can handle. However, if you group those letters into four words, ONCE UPON A TIME, then you only have to remember four things instead of 13.

#### The Major System

**The major system is a method of converting numbers into sounds, then into words, then into images.** You can use it to memorize any string of numbers, such as your SSN or phone numbers. Here’s how it works:

  1. Memorize the digit-to-letter conversions:
     * 0=S
     * 1=T/D
     * 2=N
     * 3=M
     * 4=R
     * 5=L
     * 6=Sh/Ch
     * 7=K/G
     * 8=F/V
     * 9=P/B
  2. Convert your number into letters. For example, the number 43 would be RM.
  3. Add vowels to the letters to make a word. For example, RM could become “rim.”
  4. Create an image associated with the word. For example, you could picture the edge of a cup for “rim.”
  5. Place the image in your memory palace.



#### The Person-Action-Object (PAO) System

**The person-action-object system is a method for remembering the order of numbers or cards.** This method is used primarily by mental athletes who have to memorize hundreds of digits—if you’re just memorizing everyday numbers such as phone numbers, the major system will likely serve your purposes.

Here’s how the PAO works for numbers:

  1. Come up with 100 sentences that involve a different person acting on a different object. 
  2. Assign each sentence to each two-digit number between 00 and 99.
     * Example #1: 45 is Albert Einstein brushing his hair
     * Example #2: 78 is Michael Jackson moonwalking a stage.
     * Example #3: 89 is Mr. Dressup opening the tickle trunk.
  3. When presented with a number to memorize, break it into six-digit chunks. 
     * For example, 457889894578 becomes 457889 and 894578.
  4. Combine the person from the first two digits with the action from the second two digits with the object from the last digits and create a new image.
     * Example #1: 457889 is Einstein moonwalking on the tickle trunk.
     * Example #2: 894578 is Mr. Dressup brushing a stage.
  5. Place the images in your memory palace.



Here’s how it works for cards:

  1. Create 52 person-action-object sentences.
  2. Attach one to each card. 
  3. When presented with a deck of cards to memorize, break it into groups of three cards.
  4. Combine the person of the first card with the action of the second card and the object of the third. Do the same for each group of three cards.
  5. Place the resulting images in your memory palace.



Competitive mnemonists are always refining this method and some have even gone beyond creating images for two-digit numbers or single cards, instead coming up with images for every _three_ -digit number or two-card combination.

### The 2006 US Memory Championships

**After a year of working with Ed Cooke and learning about memory, Josh competed in the US Memory Championships.** The qualifying events include memorizing:

  * As many names of people featured in headshots as possible in fifteen minutes (up to 198 names) 
  * As many random digits as possible in five minutes (up to 1,000 digits)
  * The order of a deck of cards as fast as possible (at the time, the US record was 1 minute, 56 seconds)
  * As many lines of a poem as possible in 15 minutes (up to 50 lines) 



Josh did very well in speed cards—he used an advanced version of the PAO system that allowed him to beat the US record and advance to the finals.

The finals were three elimination-style events that included memorizing a list of random words, facts about strangers, and the order of two decks of cards. Josh got lucky in the facts-about-strangers event—he didn’t get asked about anything he’d forgotten—and advanced to the final event, which was memorizing the order of two decks of cards. At this point, only he and the defending US champion were left. **Josh’s strength was cards, which were his opponent’s weakness, and Josh won.**

As the US champion, Josh went on to compete in the World Memory Championships, which are much more competitive than the US event, and he finished 13th. After reflecting on the past year, he decided not to continue with the sport and to keep using external memory aids like notes and a Dictaphone. The memory techniques absolutely work—Josh had personally used them to memorize a deck of cards in less than two minutes—but he found external memory aids more helpful. **Ultimately, the most poignant thing Josh learned about memory is that it makes us who we are** —every new thing we encounter is influenced by the web of associations already in our brains.
