## Part 2: The Arts of Memory | Chapter 6: The Basics of Memory Techniques

We learned in Part 1 that the human brain is naturally good at remembering images and places but bad at remembering semantic memories like lists of numbers of words. In Part 2, we’ll learn how to use memory techniques to**transform information into a form that our brain is naturally inclined to remember.**

Additionally, we’ll learn **to transform information into something meaningful that relates to memories we already have.** We remember new things better when we can associate them with what we already remember.

**Anyone can learn the arts of memory.** Creativity helps because it allows you to quickly create images, but you don’t have to be a genius or a savant. You just need to pay attention to life and learn the techniques.

### The Method of Loci and Memory Palaces

The method of loci is a way of organizing memory storage in your brain. Normally, our memories are stored in random, semantic networks, but**if we can be intentional about storage, we can more easily recall information.** The method of loci is the foundation for most memory techniques.

The method involves two stages: **transforming information into an image and then placing the image into a memory of a physical place you know well,** such as your childhood home. This place will be your “memory palace.” For example, if your shopping list consists of eggs, bread, milk, and butter, place the eggs at the foot of your driveway, the bread in front of the door, the milk on the dining room table, and the butter on your bed.

**Transforming a piece of information into an image forces you to pay attention to it** , which results in you remembering it better. Make the image as memorable as possible by giving it some or all of the following characteristics:

  * **Multisensory.** The more senses you can add to an image, the more cues you’ll create.
    * For example, if the first thing on your to-do list is to buy garlic, put the garlic in your mailbox (or at the first thing you encounter when you approach your house). Imagine how it smells and tastes. Not only will a visual remind you of the garlic, but a smell or taste might also cue the memory.
  * **Funny or lewd.** The human brain evolved to find humor and sex interesting.
    * For example, if the second thing on your shopping list is orange juice, put a vat of orange juice in front of your front door and imagine Brad Pitt skinny-dipping in it.
  * **Novel.** When you have a lot of memories of something, such as cereal, your brain files the latest instance into “another memory of cereal.” The latest memory blends in with all the other times you’ve encountered cereal. You can make this memory of cereal distinct by making it very pretty or ugly, supernatural, or anthropomorphizing or animating it.
    * For example, if the third thing on your shopping list is cereal, imagine that your Rice Krispies are all spies communicating via the snap, crackle, and pop of Morse code. You’ve never before encountered cereal spies, so this memory won’t have to compete with any existing ones. Put the Rice Krispie spies to the left or your front door.
  * **Concrete.** Abstract words are difficult to remember. Make them more concrete by subbing in a concrete word that rhymes or involves a pun.
    * For example, if after shopping you need to email your mom to tell her you’re on your way home, switch the word “e-mail” to “she-male.” Imagine a she-male sending an email. And to link the email to your mom, imagine your mom giving the she-male a neck massage while he/she types the email.
  * **Personal.** You remember things better when you can relate them to your existing experiences.
    * For example, if you need to get gas on the way home and you love country music, you’ll remember an image of Shania Twain better than an image of Beethoven.



When neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire (of the cabby brain study)**looked at the brains of master memorizers, she found that they were no different physically than the average person’s brain.**

However, when she and her team looked at the master memorizers’ brains while they were in the process of memorizing, they found that **the mental athletes were using the same part of the brain as the London cabbies, the right posterior hippocampus, which is involved in spatial navigation.** This is because they were mentally touring their memory palaces as they memorized. (Their right posterior hippocampi aren’t enlarged like the cabbies’ because while they use it while remembering, it’s not to the same extent as a cab driver uses this part of the brain.)

#### Memory Palace Architecture

**Memory palaces don’t have to be buildings—they simply need to be something familiar that has a sequential progression.** For example, you could use your walk to work or the signs of the zodiac.

You can put more than one image at each location of your memory palace, but **if you’re going to need to remember many things, you’re going to need multiple memory palaces to hold them all.** Competitive mental athletes can have upwards of a hundred memory palaces. If you’re not intimately familiar with this many places, you’ll have to study. You can look at houses in magazines, museums, and so on. You need to learn these new memory palaces in detail—wall color, arrangement of the furniture, what incidents happened in specific corners, and so on.

### Chunking

Chunking is another foundational memory technique. **Chunking involves combining individual pieces of information into more meaningful groups.**

For example, say you need to remember this string of numbers: 5, 4, 0, 5, 0, 6, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4. That’s 12 things to remember. However, **if you break the numbers into four groups of three, that’s only four things to remember** : 540, 506, 331, 224. (This is why credit card numbers and phone numbers are broken up.)

You could additionally break the 12-digit string into only two chunks in a date format—54/05/06 and 33/12/24. Finally, you could even transform these 12 digits into a single chunk—your grandma’s and mother’s birthdays.

(You’ll find more on turning numbers into meaningful images in Chapter 7.)
