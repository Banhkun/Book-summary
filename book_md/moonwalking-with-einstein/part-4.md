## Part 4: Josh’s Story | Chapter 11: A Year of Learning About Memory

In Parts 1-3, we learned about the science, art, and community of memory. In Part 4, we’ll look at the author’s (Josh’s) personal experience learning the arts of memory. Josh started his journey shortly after attending the 2005 US Memory Championship, where he met his memory coach, Ed Cooke.

(Josh mentions in his acknowledgments that he’s slightly rearranged the order of events to better fit the narrative.)

### Working With Anders Ericsson

Before Josh started training, he spoke to Anders Ericsson, the expert on experts. Ericsson worked at the Human Performance Lab at Florida State University and he was interested in studying Josh’s journey from beginner to expert. Josh went to Florida to have his memory tested. In exchange, Ericsson would help him with his training.

(Shortform note: To learn about Ericsson’s research on how to become an expert, read our summary of his book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise.)

The Human Performance Lab tested Josh’s ability to remember numbers, words, and faces. They also tested him on seemingly random things, such as definitions of obscure words and if he could visualize rotating cubes. He took a Multidimensional Aptitude Battery Information Test, which involved multiple-choice trivia questions such as how a carburetor works. Finally, they tested him on the events that would appear in an international memory competition such as spoken numbers, historical dates, and binary digits.

No one would tell Josh what any of the testing meant, but he was able to self-assess a little. **Josh could remember nine digits—better than average—but he was abysmal at remembering poetry, and he was hit or miss on the trivia.**

### The 2005 World Memory Championship

Josh convinced _Discover_ magazine to send him to the World Memory Championship in Oxford, England. Josh stayed with Ed and his family, who would have preferred if Ed had become a lawyer instead of a mnemonist. Ed took a leave of absence from grad school, and his plans to start the Oxford Mind Academy with Lukas had temporarily fallen through, as Lukas had injured himself in a fire-breathing accident.

**The World Memory Championship takes place over three days, and there are ten events, including memorizing lists of words, numbers, decks of cards, dates, faces, and names.** Some of the events have a time component—how much can competitors memorize in five minutes or an hour?

Everyone dreads the poem-memorizing event, in which you have to memorize—down to the punctuation and capitalization—as many lines of an unpublished poem as possible in fifteen minutes. Then, you have half an hour to write down what you’ve memorized. People had lobbied to get rid of this event, but historically, poetry was viewed as humanizing and creative, and the art of memorization started with poetry. Ted Hughes wrote the poem for the competition for many years, but Buzan took over after Hughes’s death.

The international competitors were much more serious than those at the US championship. The US competitors talked to each other before events, while the Europeans ignored each other or juggled to warm up their minds. The World Championship records were also far more impressive than the US ones. **Americans are like the Jamaican bobsled team of the memory community—friendly and cheerful, but lagging behind in terms of practice and technique.**

### Memory Training

**Josh started his memory training by memorizing Ed’s to-do list using the method of loci.** Then, he memorized some of the to-do list post-it notes stuck on his walls, such as to get his car inspected or to find books on specific subjects. He tried to use his memory in his daily life rather than simply practicing for the specific challenges he’d be facing in the national championship. He memorized phone numbers and his credit card numbers.

Josh tried poetry. He first tried “Jabberwocky,” which is made up almost completely of nonsense words. He didn’t know how to make images out of not only abstract but unreal words such as “brillig” and ended up just memorizing by rote.

**Cards were Josh’s strongest event because he used an advanced PAO system.** At a certain point, however, he hit a plateau and couldn’t get his speed any faster. He consulted Ericsson, who advised him to practice deliberately. Josh did this by timing himself with a metronome and forcing himself to go faster than his usual pace. Whenever he came to a card that gave him trouble, he took the time to analyze why.

Josh logged his progress on a spreadsheet and consulted regularly with Ed. When Josh found himself getting bored by his training and easily distracted by more interesting things going on nearby, Ed suggested he try earmuffs and pinhole glasses to minimize distractions.

### Ed’s Birthday Party

Josh returned to Oxford to work with Ed in person. He timed the trip so he could attend Ed’s twenty-fifth birthday. Ed’s party had some mnemonist-specific elements—it was held in a barn that Ed set up like a memory palace (fabric dividers between sections, a room full of balloons, and so on) so the party would be memorable. He also wanted to mix social circles, so everyone came in a costume that hid their face. Finally, there was a card memorizing contest between Ben Pridmore and Lukas, and after Lukas was deemed too drunk, Ben and Ed.

After the party, Josh got some more tips from Ed. **Josh kept mixing up the seven of spades and diamonds, whose images were both of people riding.** The spades were a jockey on a racehorse, and the diamonds were Lance Armstrong on a bike.**Ed gave him two options: focus on a detail or change the image.** Josh decided to focus on Lance Armstrong’s sunglasses and changed the seven of spades to a midget riding a pony while wearing a sombrero.

**Josh also found that he’d forget his card images, for which the solution was practice.** He had to spend time with each character, considering everything from their taste to their clothes to how they felt about violence. Then, he imagined them doing everyday things to get used to their presence in any situation. He also had some trouble because he’d put family members into his PAO, so Ed recommended he choose other people instead.

### Around a Month Before the Championship

In February 2006, **Josh’s practice scores started to get competitive—he was getting close to the numbers previous champions had achieved and once even managed to do a deck of cards one second faster than the record in the US.** However, Ed warned Josh that he’d likely do at least 20% worse at the actual championship when the pressure was on.

The 2006 championship included a new event that neither Ed nor the competitors had seen before. It was called “Three Strikes and You’re Out of the Tea Party” and involved remembering details about five strangers—an event with real-world applications.

For this event, Josh and Ed came up with a system that involved creating five memory palaces, and assigning one to each of the strangers. Each person’s assigned palace would contain the same piece of information: for example, the image corresponding to the address of each stranger would go in the kitchen of that stranger’s palace.

Three weeks before the championship, Ed told Josh to stop practicing the other events and focus on the tea party. Josh got his friends and family to test him.

A week before the championship, Josh stopped practicing. He mentally cleared his memory palaces so that no leftover images would get in his way during the competition. (Some of the most intense mental athletes won’t even talk to anyone in the three days before a contest, lest someone create a distracting association.)

Ed was supposed to have been at the competition with Josh, but Ed got an opportunity to do research in Australia, so he was no longer able to attend.

### The 2006 US Memory Championship

Josh had been telling everyone the contest was just a whim, or just a journalistic experiment, but he really wanted to win. He worried competitors would come up with new mnemonic techniques, and he was particularly worried about Maurice Stoll. The night before the competition, Josh couldn’t sleep and had strange dreams about his images.

When Josh arrived at the competition, the first people he ran into were Ben, who would be spectating, not competing, and Maurice. Both of them told Josh how important it was to get a good sleep before a competition. Josh was rattled.

#### Competitors

The approximately 35 competitors included:

  * Josh
  * Ram Koll
  * Maurice Stoll
  * Chester Santos
  * Erin Hope Luley
  * Raemon Matthews’ students 



#### Championship Format

In most memory competitions, everyone’s scores in standardized events are added up at the end of the competition and the highest score wins. In the US championships, there are four qualifying events in the morning, and the top six scorers move to the finals in the afternoon. The finals are TV-friendly, elimination events.

#### Morning Events

The morning events are:

**Names and faces.** Competitors try to memorize the first and last names of people in headshots. They have 15 minutes to memorize and then 15 minutes to write out names next to pictures.

  * Josh remembered the names by making up an image that linked the name to the face. For example, he remembered Edward Bedford by imagining him on a bed with Edward Scissorhands, fording a river.
  * Josh came in third with 107 names.
  * Erin won with 124 names, which was a new US record.



**Speed numbers.** Competitors have 5 minutes to memorize as many digits as they can.

  * Josh, like most Americans, used the Major System.
  * Josh came in fifth with 87 digits.
  * Maurice won with 148, setting a new US record. Josh suspects he used a PAO system.



**Speed cards.** Competitors memorize the order of a deck of cards as fast as they can. When finished, they tell the scorekeeper they’re done and then have five minutes to rearrange a new deck into the correct order.

  * Josh used a PAO system to place three cards in each locus. He used his parents’ house as his memory palace. (This was an advanced technique—most Americans were placing only one or two cards in each locus.) Josh almost forgot what image he’d placed in the shower but finally remembered it: the king of diamonds (Bill Clinton), four of hearts (copulating with) and seven of clubs (a basketball).
  * Josh won the event and beat the US record by memorizing the deck in a minute and 40 seconds.



**Poem.** Competitors memorize as many lines of an unpublished poem as possible in 15 minutes.

  * Anyone who placed in the top three of any of the morning events got a bye, so Josh didn’t compete in this event.
  * Erin Luley won and set another US record.



#### Afternoon Events

The afternoon’s events are:

**Random words.** In most memory competitions, the random word event involves competitors memorizing as many words as possible in fifteen minutes. They then have half an hour to write as many as they remember. At the US Memory Championship, however, the event was adjusted to be more TV-friendly. After 15 minutes of memorizing, the six finalists take turns calling out the words. Therefore, the strategy was different—Josh chose to spend more of his time making sure he knew the words, rather than remembering as many as he possibly could.

  * Erin was out on the 27th word.
  * Paul was out on the 36th word.
  * The other four finalists, including Josh, advanced to the next event.



**Facts about strangers.** In this event, five strangers walk on stage and give ten pieces of information about themselves, such as their phone numbers or pets’ names. The competitors are quizzed on the information, and the first two people to make three mistakes are out.

  * Josh purposefully didn’t memorize phone numbers, hoping he wouldn’t get asked about them.
  * Maurice was out first.
  * Chester was out second.
  * Josh and Ram Kolli advanced to the next event.



**Memorizing two decks of cards.** Competitors must do this in five minutes.

  * Josh chose to memorize only one deck of cards because cards were Ram’s weakness and Josh suspected he wouldn’t manage even one deck.
  * Ram forgot the fifth card and was out.
  * Josh won the event and the championship.



#### Minor Celebrity Status

Winning the championship turned Josh into a minor celebrity. He talked to Ellen DeGeneres, and talk shows asked him to come on air and memorize a deck of cards.

### The World Memory Championship

Because Josh had won the national championship, he would act as the US representative at the World Memory Championship. At worlds, he’d be competing against Ed, Ben, and Gunther.

Josh knew he was out of his league. He had hoped to finish in the top ten and become a grand master of memory, but he finished 13th and missed the grandmaster standard in a few events. His top event was names and faces, in which he came third. He expected he did so well because the names were ethnically diverse, and coming from the US, he was used to non-European names.

Clemens Mayer won the championship. Ed won silver in the hour cards and spoken digits events.

#### KL7 Initiation

After the championship, Ed invited Josh to join the KL7. The initiation includes:

  * Memorizing 49 digits
  * Drinking two beers
  * Kissing three women



The first time Josh tried, he forgot the 48th digit. The second time, he got through the initiation and was inducted.

### Returning to Anders Ericsson’s Lab

After the world championship, Josh returned to Ericsson’s lab to be retested. He retook the same tests and some new ones. He’d improved his digit span test to 18 and he could remember more poetry, names, and trivia.

The digit span test is the standard for working memory, but Josh didn’t find that his working memory had doubled. He still didn’t remember things he couldn’t put into a memory palace, and he didn’t remember things he hadn’t been paying attention to in the first place. Only a few days after the world championship, he forgot he’d driven to a restaurant and took the subway home, leaving his car behind.

Ericsson thought Josh was unusual in that he committed to the practice required to improve his memory, but any motivated college student could have achieved the same results.

### Final Reflections

Josh thought he could further improve at the memory arts if he put more time into them, but he ultimately decided to stop competing. A fellow competitor acknowledged that Josh could probably find better ways to spend his time than training intensely for another year.

Josh never got rid of his notebook or Dictaphone, and he only memorizes things if he doesn’t have a phone or pen handy. The memory techniques worked for him, but he found they weren’t very necessary in his day-to-day life in the modern world.

**Josh found that the most valuable thing he learned about memory is that it shapes our characters—we see the world and interact with it based on what and how we remember.** Memory is about finding connections between things, creating new ideas, and being mindful—you can only remember things you were paying attention to in the first place. External memories can keep track of schedules or groceries, but they don’t make creative connections the way people’s memories do. An external memory doesn’t create art or jokes. Our internal memories are at the core of what makes us human.
