## Chapter 3: Key One—Hire Employees for Their Talents, Not for Their Skills or Knowledge

Historically, organizations have hired based on three criteria: **experience, intelligence, and determination.** This is because:

  * An _experienced_ candidate has spent time in the workforce and learned lessons along the way. When compared to someone with no experience, this candidate has likely already dealt with obstacles and figured out how to navigate them.
  * An _intelligent_ candidate has the ability to adapt to different positions. Because they possess the brainpower, they’re able to figure out how the position works and how to most effectively handle the task.
  * A _determined_ candidate has the drive to work effectively. Even if they don’t possess the talents necessary for the position, they possess a passion that can’t be taught. Their determination creates a willingness to learn and adapt.



However, when you look at a pool of employees that were hired using these criteria, **there is often a high range in the quality of their work.** Some employees work efficiently and without issue. Others work slowly and cause problems.

If they all meet the standards of these criteria, what is the reason behind these discrepancies? The answer is differing talents. **If a candidate has experience, intelligence, and determination, but lacks the talents necessary to effectively perform in a specific role, they won’t excel in the position.**

### The Manager’s Purpose

**The purpose of a manager is to help employees translate the talents they already have into performance.** In contrast, trying to teach someone a talent that they simply don’t possess is time-consuming and ineffective. Instead of focusing on the things that an employee lacks, focus on what they bring to the table.

**If you disregard talents when hiring, you risk putting someone into a position that they aren’t equipped to handle, even if they have skills and knowledge that suggest otherwise.** For example, if you hire a customer service representative who lacks the thinking talent of problem-solving, they may struggle when a customer approaches them with an issue that was not described during the onboarding process. Though they have the knowledge to address standard issues, they lack the talents necessary to apply them to a unique situation.

> **The Range of Performance in NASA’s Astronauts**
> 
> In the 60s, Brigadier General Don Flickinger was tasked with assembling a team of astronauts to lead the United States’ foray into space. When looking for candidates, Flickinger assessed a variety of criteria including age, height, experience, intelligence, and athletic ability. He then ran candidates through intense psychological and physical tests. Ultimately, he chose seven men.
> 
> **Despite similarities in experience and intelligence, the performances of these seven astronauts varied drastically.** On the one hand, astronauts such as John Glenn and Gordon Cooper ran successful missions and became public figures. On the other hand, astronauts such as Gus Grissom and Scott Carpenter made critical errors that led to the loss of millions of dollars worth of property.
> 
> **What led to this significant range of performance? Natural talent.** For example, during takeoff, Glenn’s pulse never rose above 80. Grissom’s spiked to 150. This is because Glenn had a talent for keeping calm under pressure where Grissom didn’t. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, that Grissom’s critical error occurred after he had a panic attack and blew his capsule’s hatch too early after splashing down on Earth. This caused NASA’s expensive vessel to sink to the bottom of the ocean, never to be recovered.

### Unclear Language

You now know the difference between skills, knowledge, and talent. **With this in mind, look more closely at the language you use to describe the ideal worker.** To strengthen your ability to communicate expectations and encourage growth, you need to clarify when you’re referring to skills and knowledge that your employees can develop versus talents that they have little control over.

#### Term #1: Competencies

Many companies use the term “competencies” to define behaviors that they expect from their employees. **The problem with the term is that “competencies” can describe skills, knowledge, or talents.**

For example, many companies consider the ability to follow standards as a competency for managers. This is a skill that relies on the manager’s knowledge of the company’s policies and, therefore, can be learned and developed. However, many companies also consider the ability to keep calm under pressure as a competency. This is a talent and, therefore, can’t be learned or developed.

#### Term #2: Habits

The term “habit” refers to anything that is second nature. You’ve been told that you can change any habit with enough willpower and effort. **However, most habits are talents, and, therefore, can’t be changed.**

For example, if you're habitually aggressive, you likely won’t be able to stop the feelings of aggression that emerge whenever you feel attacked or cornered. However, you can develop habits based on skills that allow you to handle your aggression such as counting to ten or stepping away from a situation before speaking.

#### Term #3: Attitude

Many companies press their managers to create an environment where everyone has a positive attitude. **However, a manager has little control over their employee’s attitudes because a person’s primary attitude is based on the way that their brain filters information according to their talents.**

For example, if someone has a talent for empathy, their brain likely filters cynicism or denial out when they listen to other people describe their problems. What’s left is a willingness to listen and embrace the emotions of others. These behaviors and feelings become their attitude.

#### Term #4: Drive

Managers often treat drive as something that can be created through education or willpower. **However, drive specifically relates to striving talents (talents that inform your motivations) and can’t be changed.**

For example, if you have an employee that lacks the striving talent of competitiveness, you’re not going to motivate them using an in-house contest. Their behavior won’t change because their actions aren’t motivated by competition.

### Myths Surrounding Talent

Myths surrounding talent suggest that talent is a difficult thing to find and something that isn’t necessary for all positions. These myths prevent people from seeking talent in their hiring process and lead to the employment of people who don’t fit in certain roles.

#### **Myth #1: “Talent** I**s Rare”**

As a reminder, talents aren’t magic. _Everyone_ has talents.**** As a manager, the challenging thing isn’t finding someone with talent. **It’s matching their talent with the right position.** To do this, you need to pay close attention to the requirements of each role and the talents of your individual employees.

For example, the relating talent of socializing isn’t inherently special. Many people possess it. However, an employee that works in human resources with that talent _is_ special. This is because they’ve been placed in a role that plays into their talent. This advantage makes them more likely to be a “talented” HR employee.

#### Myth #2: “Some Positions Don’t Require Talent”

Many managers or higher-level employees can’t understand why “talented” people would want to work in “low-level” positions such as a housekeeper or janitor. Therefore, they assume that those positions don’t require talent, and that the people in those positions are simply desperate or waiting for a promotion.

However, this perspective is false. While some people have striving talents that push them to try to climb the corporate ladder or achieve high-profile status, others have striving talents that push them to maintain consistency and complete daily tasks. **As a manager, you have to respect the fact that every position requires talent to be done effectively.**

For example, great janitors aren’t defined simply by their ability to clean a room. Anyone could clean a room every once in a while, but janitors return to work every night knowing that the work they did the night before has been destroyed. While this would wear most people down, great janitors have a specific set of talents that allow them to return every day despite the endless cycle.

### How to Find Talent

**How do you find talent to fit the positions that you need filled?** It’s not easy to determine someone’s talents, especially not during the hiring process. There are two reasons for this:

  * Most people can’t identify their _own_ talents. This makes it difficult for you to figure out where their talents lie before you get to know them.
  * Most people are on their best behavior during an interview process. They will say what they think they need to say to get the job they’re applying for, even if they’re brushing over or coloring certain talents. For example, instead of saying they don’t trust people, they may say that they have a talent for “healthy cynicism.”



**While you _can’t_ change the way people present themselves, you _can_ clearly define the talents that describe the ideal worker for the position you’re trying to fill.** Think about the following tips as you’re creating your list of talents:

#### Tip #1: Think About the Structure of Your Company

The talents associated with any given role will change based on the way your company is run. This is because your expectations and the way you interact with the person in that position are both unique to your organization.

For example, two companies are searching for a sales representative. Company A enforces strict procedures but encourages cooperation with fellow reps. On the other hand, Company B gives its employees the freedom to work any way they want but puts them in competition with their fellow reps. The ideal employee for Company A would have talents such as organization, attention to detail, and cooperation. However, the ideal employee for Company B would have talents such as creativity, flexibility, and competition.

#### **Tip #2: Think** A**bout** Y**our** C**urrent** T**eam** M**embers**

Consider what talents you can add to your team to increase performance. Make sure that the people you hire have the appropriate talents to interact with your team effectively.

For example, you’re looking for someone to join your marketing team. You know that your current team has a talent for assertiveness but doesn’t always think before they act. With this information in mind, you conclude that an ideal candidate would be assertive but would also have a talent such as critical thinking or patience to force the team to think through their choices before they make them.

#### Tip #3: Think About the Three Types of Talent

Trying to come up with a list of talents can become overwhelming. When determining the proper talents for a role, start by choosing one talent for each of the three types of talent: striving, thinking, and relating.

For example, if you’re looking for an executive assistant, you may want someone who has the striving talent of service, the thinking talent of organization, and the relating talent of remembering names. Someone with this combination of talents would excel in the role and offer you the assistance you need.

#### Tip #4: Look at Your Best Employees

When coming up with your list of talents, think about the best employee you’ve ever had in that role or a closely related role. Then, consider the talents that they possess that allow them to succeed. Use these talents to inform your search.

For example, you’re looking for a new marketing associate to join your non-profit organization. You know that the best employee you’ve ever had in the position possessed the striving talent of fulfilling a mission, the thinking talent of focus, and the relating talent of empathy. You use this knowledge to inform the way that you guide your decision-making process.

#### **Tip #5: Don’t** L**ook at** Y**our** W**orst** E**mployees**

Many managers try to look at their worst employees to find qualities that they want to avoid when looking through candidates. However, bad employees and good employees often share many of the same qualities. It’s how they use those qualities that make a difference. If you look at your worst employees to find qualities to avoid, you may actually be overlooking things that would benefit your company when paired with the right talents.

For example, a great teacher and a bad teacher may share a talent for confrontation. The difference is that the great teacher also has the relating talent of empathy and knows when to support a student instead of confronting them. On the other hand, the bad teacher lacks a talent for empathy and confronts students at inappropriate times. If you only look at the bad teacher, you may avoid candidates with a talent for confrontation or aggression. However, as the great teacher proves, these proficiencies can be valuable when paired with other talents.

### The Talent Interview

While the hiring and interviewing process can be complicated and multifaceted, **be sure to have a separate interview for talents.** In this interview, don’t discuss money, the company, or expectations. Focus solely on discovering the talents of the candidate. When constructing the interview, think about the following concepts:

#### Concept #1: Ask Open-Ended Questions and Listen

**Allow the candidate to reveal their tendencies by asking them open-ended questions.** Don’t guide their responses. Rather, let them answer using their own filters and talents. If you intervene too often, you won’t get a good sense of their genuine tendencies because they’ll begin to say what they think you want to hear.

For example, you’re interviewing a candidate for a nursing position. You ask them, “What do you think is the most important part of being a nurse?” As they respond, you notice that they never mention the patients. Because you didn’t guide them towards patient care, they answered the question in a way that is true to their tendencies.

Examples of open-ended questions include:

  * How often should a manager give feedback?
  * Is it important to be the best?
  * What is the most important part of this position?
  * What do you value in a workplace?
  * How frequently do you like to hear about your progress?
  * How important is “climbing the ladder?”



#### Concept #2: Focus on Specifics

**Looking to past behavior is a great way to determine tendencies.** To discover this in an interview, ask candidates to talk to you about specific events from their past work experiences. These can include questions about times where they overcame adversity, worked with someone they didn’t like, felt they did good work, and so on.

**When listening to their response, focus on the specifics of what they’re saying.** If they can quickly come up with specific examples, they’ve probably had many experiences like the one you're asking about. This shows a talent. However, if they ramble on without giving any specifics, they probably haven’t had many experiences like the one you're asking about. This shows a lack of talent.

For instance, you ask, “Could you tell me about a time when you helped a coworker with a project you were not a part of?” Initially, they ramble on about the importance of teamwork and collaboration. However, they can’t come up with any specific examples, which shows that they probably don’t have a tendency to help coworkers on projects they’re not involved with. This could imply a lack of talent surrounding collaboration, altruism, and/or empathy.

#### Concept #3: Look for the Signposts of Talent

Other than looking to past experiences,**there are two other signposts of talent that you can use in your talent interviews:**

  * **Fast Learning:** When you first learn a new role, you learn the individual steps necessary to successfully execute your responsibilities. When your talents align with the role, you quickly learn how to excel in the position and the steps become habit. However, if your talents _don’t_ align with the role, the learning process slows and the steps never become habit. Ask the candidate what types of roles and tasks they pick up quickly. This will give you insight into their talents and where they may fit in your organization.
  * **Satisfactions:** Everyone has little things that give them satisfaction or fulfillment. For example, lawyers love winning a debate, accountants love when the math works, and salespeople love when they make a sale. These satisfactions reveal the candidate’s talents and give you insight into their motivations. Ask the candidate what brings them joy in the workplace and what day-to-day activities provide them with satisfaction.



#### Concept #4: Know What You’re Looking For

You can use similar questions for all of your talent interviews. In fact, this may be a good way to maintain consistency in your interview process. **However, the desired answers to these questions will change based upon the requirements of different positions.** With this in mind, specify unique talents for every role. Keep these unique talents in mind when you listen to your candidate’s responses.

For example, think of the following question: “How do you deal with confrontation?” If you’re interviewing a potential lawyer, the response you’re looking for may be, “I embrace confrontation. I try to articulate my side of the argument and get others to see my perspective.” However, you may not want this response if you’re interviewing a potential customer service representative.
