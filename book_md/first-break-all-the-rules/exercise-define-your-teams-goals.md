## Exercise: Define Your Team’s Goals

When defining your team’s goals, you need to ask yourself three questions. These questions help you define your goals based upon the needs of your customers, your company, and your employees.

* * *

What do your customers need? Think about the services you provide and the needs of your average consumer.

What does your company need? Think about your company’s core mission and the strategies you currently use to fulfill that mission.

What do your employees need? Think about the talents of your employees and the ways you can develop those talents.

With these requirements in mind, make a list of goals that fulfill the needs of your customer, your company, and your employees. List 3-5 goals.
