## Chapters 1-2: Measuring the Strength of Your Workplace

**Only 13% of the world’s workforce is actively engaged at work.** This is because employees become unmotivated or resentful when their relationship with immediate management is inefficient or hostile. As a manager, how can you find strong employees and keep them motivated, focused, and productive without creating frustration through constant micro-managing? **Successful** **managers throw out the rules of conventional management and create an individualized approach that focuses on the talents, weaknesses, and personalities of their employees.**

Most organizations know that their ability to find, engage, and maintain strong employees is essential to their success. **However, few know how to gauge how well they’re doing at that task.** Some companies offer concierge services such as flower delivery or dog-walking to their employees to try to keep them happy. Others offer stock options and financial incentives. However, these services benefit good employees and bad employees alike. It may help them find and maintain employees, but it doesn’t incentivize engagement or reward strong performance.

To reward strong performance, you need to determine effectiveness. To do this, many companies use measuring tools such as retention rates, opinion surveys, and turnaround. **However, these numbers are generic and imprecise.** They don’t tell a company how they’re doing with finding and keeping _strong_ employees. They tell the company how they’re doing finding and keeping _all_ employees.

### The Q12 Items

To determine how well you’re finding, engaging, and maintaining strong employees, you need a precise and thorough way to gauge the strength of your organization. **The Q 12 Items are 12 question items to give to your employees that help you determine the strength of your organization. **Managers have the most direct impact on high Q12 scores because they interact with employees on a daily basis and dictate the tone of leadership.

Employees respond to the Q12 on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The items are as follows:

  1. I know what my company expects from me.
  2. I have the tools to effectively do my job. 
  3. I have the opportunity to put my best talents to use every day.
  4. In the past week, I have been recognized for strong work.
  5. My manager, or someone else at work, cares about me as a human being.
  6. Someone at work promotes my development. 
  7. My opinion matters.
  8. My company’s mission makes me feel like my job matters. 
  9. My fellow employees commit to doing good work.
  10. I’ve made a best friend at work.
  11. Someone has talked to me about my development in the last six months.
  12. In the last year, I’ve had learning opportunities at work.



#### The Benefits of the Q12 Items

A high number of “strongly agree” responses typically indicates a high mark in one or more of the following business goals: **productivity, profitability, retention, and customer satisfaction.** The reasons for this are as follows:

  * **Productivity** : Employees who understand expectations and have the tools to succeed are more productive than those who don’t have the necessities they need to perform. Also, employees who are satisfied in the workplace tend to be more productive compared to those who are unsatisfied.
  * **Profitability** : Employees can take different actions to affect profitability. This ranges from turning off their desk fan when they leave to negotiating more aggressively for the company. When employees feel fulfilled and connected in the workplace, they’re more willing to go the extra mile for the team.
  * **Retention** : Employees who are engaged and happy in their position tend to stay with a company longer. However, this depends directly upon their relationship with their immediate supervisor or manager. If an employee has a good relationship with their manager, they will likely stay with the company even if the company doesn’t offer significant employee benefits. On the other hand, if an employee has a poor relationship with their manager, they will likely leave the company regardless of incentives or employee services.
  * **Customer Satisfaction** : When organizations have strong internal relationships and high employee satisfaction, customers tend to be happier. This is because strong relationships between employees lead to higher levels of productivity and high employee satisfaction leads to low turnover. Low turnover ensures that employees are able to be consistent as they develop a routine with their fellow coworkers. This routine allows employees to give customers an efficient and consistent experience. 



##### Example: The Retail Stores

A large retail company used the Q12 items within its stores. After receiving over 28,000 responses from employees across the country, the organization saw an interesting trend between its franchises. Some stores reported back with a high number of “strongly agree” answers. However, others reported back with a significantly lower number of “strongly agree” answers. The discrepancy between their yearly performance is as follows:

| Top 25% of “Strongly Agree” Answers  | Bottom 25% of “Strongly Agree” Answers   
---|---|---  
Sales Budget  | On average, these stores were 4.5% over their sales budget for the year.  | On average, these stores were 0.84% below their sales budget for the year.   
Profit/Loss  | These stores ended their year almost 14% over their profit budget.  | These stores ended their year almost 30% below their profit budget.   
Turnover  | The top stores maintained approximately 12 employees more per store than the bottom stores. This calculates out to about 1,000 employees per year. Because of the costs of scouting, hiring, and training, this difference cost the corporation about $27 million dollars over the course of the year.   
  
The retail company gave every store the same tools, incentives, initiatives, and rules, so what was causing the disparity in numbers? **The answer was management.** The Q12 Items revealed that direct management dictated the experience of the employees. Even though they were given the same materials and benefits, employees at lower-performing stores typically had lower levels of satisfaction and motivation because of their negative relationships with their immediate managers.

#### The Q12 Order

The Q12 items are ordered in a specific way. **The ordering of these items guides employees through a specific thought-process that shows their level of security and satisfaction with the company.** Those levels are as follows:

Level/ Q12 Items  | Significance  | “Strongly Agree”  | “Strongly Disagree”   
---|---|---|---  
Level 1/  Q01-02  | These questions relate to the basic needs of an employee: expectation and proper tools.  | You know what’s expected of you and you have the tools to succeed. Because you can perform the basic function of your job, you can focus on the quality of your work.  | You don’t know what’s expected of you and you don’t have the tools to succeed. Because you can’t perform the basic function of your job, you can’t focus on the quality of your work.   
Level 2/  Q03-06  | These questions relate to the performance of an employee and the perception of how others view their work.  | You’re doing something that you’re good at and are being properly recognized for the effort you put in. You feel as if management cares about you and your development. Because you feel qualified and supported, you can focus on building relationships at work.  | You’re not doing something that you’re good at and aren’t being recognized for the effort you put in. You feel as if management doesn’t care about you or your development. Because you don’t feel qualified or supported, you can’t focus on building relationships at work.   
Level 3/ Q07-10  | These questions relate to the relationships and interactions between the employee, coworkers, and management.  | Your opinion is valued at work and you feel that your job is important. You’re surrounded by people that are committed to doing strong work and you’ve made a close friend in the office. Because you have strong working relationships, you can use that support to help you focus on growth and improvement.  | Your opinion isn’t valued at work and you feel that your job is unimportant. You’re surrounded by people that have no interest in doing strong work and you haven’t made a close friend in the office. Because you lack strong working relationships, you have no support to help you focus on growth and improvement.   
Level 4/  Q11-12  | These questions relate to growth and improvement.  | You’ve been spoken to about ways to improve and feel as though you’ve had opportunities to use that information to grow and improve.  | You’ve never been spoken to about ways to improve and feel as though you haven’t had opportunities to grow or improve.   
  
**In order to build a productive and satisfied workforce, you need to focus on items 1-6 before you attempt to develop 7-12.** They build a foundation of connection and trust that allows you to develop relationships and focus on growth. Aiming to solve the higher-level questions before you establish your base will lead to interesting concepts that you won’t be able to execute. For instance, if you haven’t laid out expectations for your employees, you can’t expect them to focus on the quality of their work because they have no reference for your definition of “quality work.”

To improve your Q12 scores and become a stronger manager, **use your employees’ talents to develop the four keys of management:**

  1. Hire Employees for Their Talents, Not for Their Skills or Knowledge (covered in Chapter 3)
  2. Define Goals, Not Processes (covered in Chapter 4)
  3. Build Up Talents and Navigate Around Weaknesses (covered in Chapter 5)
  4. Guide Employees Towards the Right Fit (covered in Chapter 6)



### What Is Talent?

As discussed, the four keys of management depend on your employees’ talents. Talent is not a magical gift. **Talent is a recurring feeling, thought, or behavior that can be used in an effective way.** For example, if you consistently remember important dates, that’s a talent. Every job lends itself to a unique set of talents and, therefore, requires a person with those talents to fill the role. For example, great lawyers have a talent for debating. Great accountants have a talent for organizing. Great caregivers have a talent for empathy.

**Talents create a filter through which you see the world.** They guide the thought processes that create habits and proficiencies. For instance, if you’re a talented socializer, your brain likely keeps you open and comfortable by filtering out many of the insecurities that are often associated with new relationships.

Traditionally, organizations have held onto the belief that talents can be trained into employees or that talent isn’t a necessary component of success. **Both of these beliefs are inaccurate:**

  * **Talent can’t be taught.** While you can give someone the tools to grow their talents, you can’t teach talents like empathy or confidence. You need to hire people who already possess the necessary talents for the position.
  * **Talent drives performance.** Talent gives insight into an employee’s thought process. For example, if someone is a talented negotiator, it likely means that they’re naturally constantly thinking about counter-offers and price points. If you hire someone who lacks this talent, you can teach them your process, but you can’t change the way that their brain works.



There are three basic categories of talents: **striving, thinking, and relating.**

  * **Striving talents inform your motivations.** They include talents such as ambition, altruism, competitiveness, and mastery. They reveal why you do what you do. For example, if you’re competitive, your desire to improve likely comes from an internal need to best your competitors, and you may excel in a position such as an attorney or salesperson. 
  * **Thinking talents inform your thought and decision-making processes.** They include talents such as discipline, flexibility, focus, and logic. They reveal how you come to conclusions and decisions. For example, if you’re organized, your decision-making process likely reflects your need for everything to be in its place, and you may excel in a position such as an assistant or accountant. 
  * **Relating talents inform your relationships.** They include talents such as socializing, empathy, trust, and confrontation. They reveal how you create relationships and why you make them with the people that you do. For example, if you’re empathetic, your ability to understand the emotions of others will inform the way that you interact with them, and you may excel in a position such as a teacher or a nurse.



#### How Much Can a Person Change?

As discussed, talents can’t be taught. **If you can’t train your employees to have talents they don’t possess, how much of a person can you actually change?**

##### The Brain

**Talents are developed at a young age through neural pathways,** which develop based upon your experiences. For instance, if you handled confrontation constantly as a child, you likely built a strong neural pathway that allows your brain to quickly process aggressive situations. That pathway may translate into a talent for debating or handling difficult conversations.

**Once you reach your teenage years, you no longer possess the ability to develop new connections.** While you can improve upon the connections that already exist to a certain extent, you won’t be able to develop significant talents or abilities if they don’t already exist.

##### Skills vs. Knowledge vs. Talent

While talent is fixed at a young age, **skills and knowledge come through experience and education.** They can be taught at any age and provide employees with the tools and information they need to use their talents.

**Skills are the abilities an employee uses to do their job.** For example, most office employees need to know how to perform basic tasks on a computer. If they don’t have a talent for learning new information or using technology, they may never excel at these skills, but they can be taught to use them at a level of proficiency that allows them to do their work.

**Knowledge is information that informs how you do your job.** There are two types of knowledge: factual knowledge and experiential knowledge.

  * **Factual knowledge is knowledge that you gain through education or research.** It’s typically straightforward information that allows you to perform a task correctly. For example, a defense attorney needs to understand the process of a court proceeding before they defend a client.
  * **Experiential knowledge is knowledge that you gain through experience.** Often less tangible than factual knowledge, experiential knowledge teaches you how to make choices and develop values based upon past experiences. For example, an experienced teacher may not assign large projects at the end of the school year because they’ve watched their students mentally checking out at that time in the past.



**You can teach skills and knowledge after you bring someone on-board.** With this in mind, you should always focus on a candidate’s talents over their skill-sets or education. For example, if you’re hiring an accountant for your organization, you can teach them to use Excel and build reports. However, you can’t teach them the striving talent of accuracy or the thinking talent of organization.
