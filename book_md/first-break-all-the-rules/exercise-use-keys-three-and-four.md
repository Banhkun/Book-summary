## Exercise: Use Keys Three and Four

The last two keys focus on building strength instead of trying to fix weakness and guiding employees to the roles that best suit their talents.

* * *

One of the best ways to help develop the talents of your employees is studying your best. Think about a stellar employee. Now, think about a particular time when you watched this employee handle an obstacle extremely well. Describe the situation and the outcome. What did they do? What talents did they use? What skills and/or knowledge did they use?

Now, describe the ways you could use this situation to train a similarly talented employee. Think about the specific talents these employees possess and the ways that skills and knowledge help with development.

Employees often want to climb the corporate ladder because they believe that it’s the only way to excel. Think about a time where a successful employee wanted to be promoted into a position that didn’t suit their talents. Why did they want the job? Did you ultimately promote them?

With this situation in mind, think about the ways you could have guided the employee towards a better fit or incentivized the role they were currently in. Think about developing achievement levels, adjusting your payscale, tough love, and career path meetings.
