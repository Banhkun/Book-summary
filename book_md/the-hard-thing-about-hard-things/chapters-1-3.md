## Chapters 1-3: Ben’s Business History

Ben Horowitz isn’t impressed with most business books. Most of what they discuss—setting audacious goals, constructing a winning strategy, building a cheerful culture—isn’t the hard part of building a company. The hard part is firing your friends when they no longer fit your company’s goals, it’s staring at impending bankruptcy and throwing your hail mary to save the company.

Most business books try to give a recipe for success, but **“the hard thing about hard things” is that there is no recipe for those hard situations**. (Shortform note: Paraphrasing Leo Tolstoy, “All happy companies are alike; each unhappy company is unhappy in its own way.”) This book is a collection of advice and first-hand experiences to help company operators deal with the hard times.

We’ll start with Ben Horowitz’s background, from his childhood to his wild ride through the dotcom crash. This will form the context for the advice that will constitute the rest of the book.

### Early Life to College

Ben Horowitz grew up in Berkeley, California, the son of Jewish members of the Communist party. Berkeley was a diverse enclave for left-thinking people, hippies, and a mix of social classes.

In high school, Horowitz was the odd combination of a star student and a football player. He crossed social groups with ease, hanging out with bookish students in his classes and the athletes during practice. He saw how differently both groups viewed the world and had selective filters for information; while the athletes raved about a new rap record, the academics fussed over Reagan’s most recent policy announcement. This taught him the value of gathering different perspectives to build a more complete picture of the world.

After graduating from Columbia University in 1988, he became an engineer at Silicon Graphics (SGI). SGI was paving the way for computer graphics for use in entertainment and games.

While excited about SGI, within a year he was recruited to a new startup, Netlabs. Unfortunately, the founders had been replaced by professional management (at the behest of the company’s investors), and the new management was clueless. They didn’t grasp the market or the technology, and the company was aimless. This reinforced to Ben **how important it was to have founders run their companies**.

As typically required by startups, Horowitz worked a lot, which destroyed his home life. Horowitz’s second child had been diagnosed with autism, which required more time at home and stretched him thin. He realized he was putting himself first and sacrificing his family. Ben decided to quit Netlabs and joined the much more established Lotus Development to start a more stable job.

### Netscape

In 1994, while working at Lotus, he learned about Mosaic, one of the first graphical web browsers. Before that point, the Internet was an esoteric technology used by academics and required abstruse commands to operate. In contrast, Mosaic was a graphical web browser that made the Internet accessible to everyday people. It gave Horowitz a glimpse of the future, and he was converted—**he was wasting time working on anything else**.

A few months later, Jim Clark (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and the 22-year-old wunderkind Marc Andreessen (leader of the team that developed Mosaic) founded Netscape to capitalize on the innovation. Horowitz seized the chance to interview for a job at the new company.

A brief history lesson: While today, we know the Internet to be the global innovation it is, in 1994 it was still in its infancy, nowhere near mainstream. Instead, software giants like Oracle and Microsoft were racing to build their own proprietary technologies to become the Information Superhighway of choice. The Internet was just one competitor in this battle.

The vision of Netscape was to make the web browser safer, easier to use, and more functional. In doing so, they would popularize the open Internet, freeing it from the shackles of a closed, proprietary corporate future.

Ben went through the interview process, and his final interview was with Marc Andreessen. The discussion was an intense exploration of Ben’s views on software and the future of the Internet. In turn, Andreessen revealed his impressively deep knowledge of computing history and his inspiring insights into technology. Horowitz thought Andreessen lived up to his wunderkind reputation and was convinced Netscape would shape the future.

Ben got the job to lead the Enterprise Web Server product line. The division sold two products: a web server selling for $1,200 and a secure web server (featuring Netscape’s new technology SSL) selling for $5,000. This was still a small part of the business—at the time, Netscape made most of its money by selling its browser to commercial users.

In August 1995, just 16 months since their founding, Netscape went public in their IPO. They priced their stock at $28 per share; at the close of their first trading day, the stock shot up to $58, giving Netscape a value of $3 billion. (Shortform note: While Netscape was unprofitable at the time—then a rarity in IPOs—investors were enthusiastic about how its revenues had doubled every quarter that year.) The IPO was a shock to the business world—the Internet was now a verifiable industry worth taking seriously.

#### Fierce Competition

The good feelings didn’t last. The software behemoth Microsoft announced that it had developed its own browser, Internet Explorer, and that it’d be bundling it with Windows 95. Since **Microsoft had a near-monopoly on operating systems** , this meant the world’s computer users would by default use the free Internet Explorer. And since Netscape made most of its money selling its browsers, they were in deep trouble.

Knowing selling browsers was no longer tenable, they decided to focus on selling web server software instead. This was Ben Horowitz’s business line. Microsoft was selling a high-powered, expensive server suite called BackOffice. If Microsoft was going to undercut them with Internet Explorer, Netscape could undercut them too. In response, Netscape decided to launch a low-cost, open alternative called SuiteSpot, which cost just a fraction of the price.

In one of the book’s most memorable anecdotes, Ben describes how they planned to unveil the new product as a surprise in March 1996, until Marc revealed the strategy to a trade publication. Dismayed, Ben sent an email to Marc:

> I guess we’re not going to wait until the 5th to launch the strategy.

Marc sent a reply within minutes, CC’ing Netscape’s CEO and chairman:

> Apparently you do not understand how serious the situation is. We are getting killed killed killed out there. Our current product is radically worse than the competition. We’ve had nothing to say for months. As a result, we’ve lost over $3B in market capitalization. We are now in danger of losing the entire company and it’s all server product management’s fault.
> 
> Next time do the fucking interview yourself.
> 
> Fuck you,
> 
> Marc

Ben thought he was going to be fired. But he wasn’t, and SuiteSpot became a $400 million revenue business. As for Marc, they’re still partners today at their venture capital firm. Ben notes warmly about how valuable it is to have partners who can freely point out errors in each other’s thinking.

#### The End of Netscape

Despite their efforts, Netscape couldn’t compete against Microsoft, which used its vast resources to build free products and undercut Netscape’s revenue sources. (Microsoft would later face antitrust issues for these practices.)

In the end, Netscape was acquired by America Online in 1999 in a stock-swap transaction. Netscape was valued at $10 billion at the time.

As the team migrated to AOL, they became disillusioned with the merger. AOL was a media company, not a technology company, and their cultures and interests clashed. Ben, Marc, and a few other co-conspirators thought about what to do next.

At AOL, Horowitz worked in the e-commerce division, partnering with online merchants. They repeatedly ran into a problem: Each time they tried to bring a partner online, AOL would send them so much traffic that the partner’s website would crash. The partners simply weren’t prepared to handle the server load of millions of people.

This sparked an idea: Could they build a company to handle the headaches of web server operations, such as security, reliability, and scaling to meet more users? They leapt at the idea, an early version of “cloud computing” and software as a service, and **founded Loudcloud in September 1999 with Horowitz as CEO**.

### Loudcloud

1999 was near the peak of the dotcom bubble. Feelings were exuberant, and the world was full of possibilities.

The money came easily. Just two months after founding, Loudcloud raised $21 million ($15 million from Benchmark and $6 million from Marc) at a pre-money valuation of $45 million. Two months later, they raised $45 million in debt from Morgan Stanley.

The money fueled growth.**Horowitz was encouraged by their investors to run their companies as though “capital were free.”** Within 6 months of founding, they hired almost 200 employees; in about the same time, they booked $10 million in contracts and nearly tripled that the next quarter. They also spent freely, including $5 million on a fancy new office to contain their headcount. Everything looked like it was working.

#### The Dotcom Crash

Then, in March 2000, the crash began. After 10 days, the NASDAQ had fallen by 10% from its peak; within a year, it would fall 72%. Companies went bankrupt and billions of market value evaporated instantly. Tech investors became skittish to fund companies.

Loudcloud was in trouble. Within a year, they had spent nearly all of their $66 million in funding on growth. Luckily, in June 2000, they were able to raise a Series C of $120 million at a $700 million pre-money valuation.

But even this $120 million wasn’t enough. The company was in operational trouble. They had forecasted booked sales of $100 million for Q3 of 2000. Instead, they finished with only $37 million in contracts (after all, their customers suffered in the dotcom crash too). And these numbers represented merely _booked_ sales, the total value of the contract over 2 years—their customers paid them on a monthly basis, so they faced steep cash flow problems.

With revenue far lower than expected and 477 employees, within a few months by late 2000, **Horowitz needed to raise money _yet again_. But this time, no one was biting.** It looked like they might actually go bankrupt, which would mean losing all their investors’ money and laying off all the employees they worked so hard to recruit.

**One unlikely option emerged: go public.** Surprisingly, while private investors had withdrawn their investments, the public markets were still somewhat receptive to companies. (Shortform note: While the market had fallen 25% by September 2000, it would not bottom until two years later, in September 2002.)

With no investors offering to invest, Loudcloud had no other option. In September 2000, Loudcloud announced it was going public. Its S-1 filing with the SEC looked terrible, showing $1.94 million in revenue in the past 6 months, with forecasts of $75 million for the coming year. They were set to run out of money in 3 weeks if they didn’t IPO. The press pilloried them for being emblematic of the deeply unprofitable dotcom company.

Loudcloud started their IPO roadshow trying to price their shares at $10 each, which would value the company at under $700 million, below their Series C valuation. During the three weeks on the roadshow, comparable public companies lost half their value. They had to reprice at $6 a share, an even steeper loss from their private valuation.

Loudcloud raised $162.5 million in the IPO, but no one celebrated. They had survived, but at a steep loss in valuation, and even more trouble was to come.

#### The Troubles Continue

As the economy continued its nosedive, Loudcloud’s business continued to worsen. Customers were harder to sign, and their existing customers started canceling. For their first earnings call, Loudcloud had to lower its revenue guidance from $75 million to $55 million. Doing so just after going public was a big red flag, and their stock dropped from $6 a share to $2.

In 2001, September 11th happened. On September 26, their largest competitor Exodus went bankrupt. It had been valued at $50 billion a year earlier and had raised $800 million at the beginning of 2001. Repeat: It had burnt $800 million in cash in just 9 months.

These were all grave warning signs for Loudcloud. Horowitz contemplated the fate of the company. **If Loudcloud went bankrupt, what could they possibly do? His answer: He’d buy the software that managed their servers, Opsware, and build a company around that.** Compared to the capital-intensive server cloud business, a capital-efficient software would be relatively easier to turn around.

He asked another question: Could they work on this business without going bankrupt? They could. He directed a small team of ten to make Opsware a standalone software that could run on any server platform. While he thought this might be the hail mary to save Loudcloud, he didn’t portray this to the rest of the company, lest they lose motivation on their core server business.

But the server business continued to struggle. In early 2002, their largest customer, which paid them $1 million per month and represented 20% of their revenue, went bankrupt. Loudcloud was still deeply unprofitable, and **they were caught in a death spiral** : With less money on their balance sheet, their customers had less confidence in Loudcloud’s stability, which hurt sales, which depleted their balance sheet even faster. Even if they laid off most of their headcount, their infrastructure costs were so high they couldn’t break out of the spiral. Loudcloud looked doomed.

It was time for Horowitz to make his plan public. They needed to exit the cloud business, thus reducing their infrastructure expenses, and turn into a software company. This meant finding buyers for the cloud business. After entertaining two top bidders, IBM and EDS, Loudcloud struck a deal with EDS:

  * EDS would buy the cloud business for $63.5 million in cash and assume its liabilities and expenses.
  * The company Loudcloud would retain the software Opsware and rebrand as Opsware as well.
  * EDS would license Opsware for $20 million per year.



The deal closed, and it felt like a burden had lifted. They could now rewrite their future.

### Opsware

While Horowitz saw the sale to EDS as a victory, Wall Street didn’t see it that way. Their stock fell to a low of $0.35 per share, representing a valuation of $30 million. This was half the $60 million in cash they had in the bank—a sign that investors thought Loudcloud was likely to go bankrupt.

Opsware was left with about 80 employees (150 had moved to EDS with the sale and another 140 were laid off). Horowitz even had to lay off loyal senior executives who had been appropriate for the server business but knew nothing about the software business. It was depressing but necessary—they were in survival mode.

**Their task now was to create a product worth buying.** Their software Opsware currently ran only on Loudcloud; they needed to generalize the software so any company could use it on any server platform.

As typical, **Horowitz and the team ran into existentially threatening problems** :

  * Their largest company EDS, which accounted for 90% of revenue, was unhappy with recurring technical issues and the slow rate of progress. They wanted to cancel and get their money back. Given 60 days to fix the issues, Opsware tried to find a way to appease their contact at EDS. They learned the contact really wanted a particular inventory software (Tangram) but was being coerced to switch to a cheaper option. Opsware decided to acquire Tangram and bundle it with Opsware for free. The EDS contact was elated, and they kept the contract.
  * Marc Andreessen, who had been working full-time as board chairman, turned his attention to founding a new social network company, Ning. Horowitz now had full, lonely responsibility for Opsware.
  * A new competitor, Bladelogic, was winning deals that Opsware should have been winning. Ben rallied his staff, asking them to commit to working hard from morning to night for 6 months, or else Opsware was going to die.



They continued soldiering on, working hard days to untangle themselves from a bleak future. They launched a revamped software in 9 months and, with a methodically managed sales team, started winning deals again.

Eventually, they reached a $150 million revenue run rate; from their low of $0.35 per share, their stock lifted to around $7 per share, granting a market value of $800 million.

#### Opsware Sells Itself

**Despite this momentum, the business was tough every quarter.** Server technology shifted rapidly—virtualization was now getting popular, which would make what Opsware built more valuable but required retooling of their software suite.

At the same time, Opsware started getting acquisition offers from other companies. First EMC approached hinting at an acquisition; when this leaked to the press, their stock price hit $9.50 per share. This triggered even more companies to approach Opsware. In total, eleven companies approached within a month expressing interest.

On one hand, Horowitz wasn’t thrilled about selling the company, given all the labor they’d committed to clawing their way out of failure. On the other hand, looking at the future, the opportunity was large, but it’d require more years of hard work to stay competitive. The team was tired—when Horowitz surveyed his direct reports, all but one wanted to sell.

The bids came in between $10 to $11 per share, a good deal above their current market price, but Horowitz felt this wasn’t enough. After deliberating with the board and his executives, he had a firm number in mind—$14 per share, or roughly $1.6 billion for the company. If no one offered this, they’d go back to work.

Horowitz went back to the bidders and said the price was a firm $14. No one accepted. A quiet month passed until BMC Software countered with $13.25. Horowitz said $14 was firm. Two days later, BMC accepted.

Opsware immediately went back to the other bidders and announced they were selling for $14. If any other company wanted Opsware, it was their last chance to bid. Hewlett-Packard countered with $13.50, a test to see if Opsware was bluffing. **Horowitz held firm—$14 was the going price** —and HP countered with $14.25. This was the winning bid, and they closed the deal.

**The grueling journey lasting eight years had ended.** Starting with Loudcloud at the peak of the dotcom bubble and riding the torturous crash downward, to refocusing on Opsware and clawing their way up to a sale, Horowitz and his team accomplished a magnificent feat.

What should he do now? He’d gone through a company’s entire life cycle, from founding to going public to selling, and he felt it was time to retire from operating a business. But he’d learned so much, and not using this knowledge seemed like a waste.

Then he had an idea—start a venture capital firm, to help other entrepreneurs through the same struggles. We’ll cover this more at the end of the book, in Chapter 9. In the interim, we’ll cover Ben’s key management advice.
