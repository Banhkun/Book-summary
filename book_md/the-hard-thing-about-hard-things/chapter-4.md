## Chapter 4: How to Handle the Bad Times

Most startup books talk about business strategy in the good times—how to form a competitive advantage, how to set big hairy audacious goals. Horowitz is more interested in sharing advice on how to deal with the bad times.

### The Struggle

(Shortform note: This section incorporates part of Chapter 7 on being a good CEO.)

Most people start their companies with boundless enthusiasm. The sky is open, the possibilities are endless, and success is inevitable.

Then reality hits. Your plans have not lived up to their promise. You don’t have the traction you hoped for. Things seem to be unraveling. Your key first hires start leaving. Your customers start churning. It seems to point to inevitable failure.

**This is the Struggle.** The Struggle is when the impending failure of your company swallows every thought and sensation in your waking life. The Struggle is when you question why your idiot self ever started a company. The Struggle is sleepless lonely nights when you feel you’ve failed everyone who was dumb enough to believe in you.

Every entrepreneur has gone through the Struggle, from Steve Jobs to Elon Musk. Greatness is born from the Struggle.

The Struggle is a make or break moment. If you are weak and you succumb to the Struggle, you will fail. If you are strong and you can get through the Struggle, you have a fighting chance.

**Here’s how to cope with the Struggle and find a way out of it.**

#### Realize Failing Is Normal

Being a CEO is unnatural. Humans didn’t evolve in a way that makes running a thousand-person company a natural thing to do. For instance, humans evolved behaviors to get other people to like them; as CEO, you will have to make decisions that will make people dislike you (at least temporarily).

This also means people aren’t born CEOs out of the womb. It is a learned skill. Even worse, **it’s a skill that you can only learn by actually doing it**. So if you’re a first-time CEO, you have no idea what you’re doing, and you have no idea how well you should be doing.

The good news is, most CEOs have failed repeatedly, and many are currently failing. Horowitz says that **if CEOs were graded on a test, the mean score would be 22 out of 100**. Many CEOs indeed don’t know what they’re doing; even among those who do, things simply go wrong because building a business is complex, the market is competitive, and the future is unpredictable. Every company goes through existentially threatening moments.

If you don’t know the mean score is 22, then you feel bad because you think you’re the only one underperforming. But now that you know better, you can focus on improving your score.

#### Don’t Quit

Despite being in the struggle, you must never give up. The only certain way you’ll fail is if you give up. **When you see no good moves, you have to keep looking for a move.**

  * When Loudcloud was running out of money in the dotcom bubble, even Ben’s most trusted coach told him to prepare for bankruptcy. Horowitz looked for any solution he could, and he took Loudcloud to an IPO in 2001, after the bubble had already burst, 6 weeks away from running out of cash.



Ben doesn’t like thinking about the statistics of the situation—that there might be a one in a hundred chance of things working and a 99% chance of failure. **The odds don’t matter to him—there is an answer to your problems out there, and your job is to find it.**

Great CEOs push through the pain.

#### Don’t Wallow in Regret and Self-Hate

In the Struggle, you will blame yourself. Every mistake will be your fault. You will turn over past decisions in your mind, and regrets will seep in.

At the same time, you might pity yourself. You were inexperienced—how could you have possibly known the decisions were bad? How could you have predicted the economy would take a sharp downturn? It’s unfair to play against a stacked deck.

**This is all wasted energy.** You can’t change the past, so regret is pointless. And no one cares why you failed or how difficult it was—they just know that you failed.

**Focus on what you can do from today forward.** Rather than focusing on what you did wrong in the past, focus on what you need to do right from now on.

#### Don’t Be in Denial

On the other extreme, when bad news happens, don’t delude yourself into thinking the situation is fine. This makes you feel better but hides the problematic truth.

  * If people quit, don’t think, “that’s fine, we didn’t want them anyway.” You put in the work to hire “rockstar” people—how could they all have turned out bad? Either your company is bad, or your hiring process is bad.
  * If you lose a sale, don’t believe a sales rep when she says, “our competitor gave away their product.” Call the buyer and see if this really holds true. Most likely, your product is not competitive.
  * If you miss your targets, don’t think “it was just a weak quarter” and come up with excuses like temporary dips in marketing. 



This is basic denial, and it will cause you to ignore problems you should fix right away.

People tend to like good news more than bad news. They act on the good news, and they reject bad news. (Shortform note: This might be tied to the psychological bias of loss aversion, where losses feel more painful than gains are rewarding. Accepting bad news would mean a loss in the status of the company, so it’s easier to pretend the loss isn’t real. Read more about loss aversion in our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

The key is to balance the right level of emotional involvement: **Take the problems seriously, but be emotionally detached from them**. This will let you work on the problems without getting so obsessed that you micromanage or become emotionally paralyzed.

#### Write on Paper

If you’re struggling with a problem or a decision, write it down on paper. Articulate what you know and what you plan to do with the best logic you have.

Writing lets you separate the problem from your psychology and view it from a fresh objective lens. It can also be clarifying—a problem that’s an impenetrable knot in your head might simplify once you put it all out on paper.

#### Talk to Other People

There are plenty of people who have been through similar difficult situations. Often these people can’t give you great _advice_ about your situation, since they know so much less about your company than you do, but they can offer psychological help.

#### Talk to Your Team About the Company’s Problems

You think that you’re so brave, you’re shouldering all the world’s problems and that your team wouldn’t be able to handle the bad news. You think that you need to be Mr. Sunshine, beaming positivity to your team to keep their spirits high.

This is arrogant. In reality, **no one will take the problems harder than you**. You founded this company, and you will sink with the ship. In contrast, your employees can easily find a job elsewhere; your investors have other investments.

Also, your team isn’t dumb. They know that things aren’t great all the time, and bad news spreads faster than you can control. **If you become known for hiding bad news, your team will stop trusting anything you say.** If you are honest with your team, they will trust and respect you, knowing that you respect them.

You hired all these smart people for a reason. It’s a waste to not have them thinking about your company’s most critical problems.

  * When Opsware was losing business to competitors, Horowitz called an all-hands meeting and told them the company was going to die if they didn’t improve their product. The team took it well and opted into the grind to revitalize their product.



Talking about problems openly **sets an important cultural tone: It’s OK to surface problems**. In some companies, bad news is buried, messengers are killed, and managers bark, “don’t bring me a problem without bringing me a solution.” This seems counterproductive. Wouldn’t you rather hear about problems early? Doesn’t it make sense for someone to report a problem even if they don’t know how to fix it. You can set the example by sharing bad news.

#### Lots of Lead Bullets, Not a Silver Bullet

When you have an existential problem, like a competitor that totally outclasses your product, it’s tempting to think about a simple silver bullet solution, often in the form of a pivot: “let’s go down market” or “let’s target a different buyer” or “let’s acquire this business to solve our problems.”

Sometimes, **what you need is not a single silver bullet, but a lot of lead bullets**. You may simply need to do the grunt work of improving your product in the dozens of ways that it is currently failing.

  * When Netscape’s web server was being outclassed by Microsoft’s free product, Horowitz was tempted to look at partnerships and acquisitions to pad their offering. His colleague made it clear—their product sucked, and they needed to put in the work to fix it.



### How to Lay People Off

When the company fails to meet its plans, you will need to lay people off to survive. We’ll talk about the general principles, and then talk through three situations: a general layoff, firing an executive, and demoting a friend.

Here are general principles for every negative staffing change:

  * **Act quickly:** Once you know you have to take the action, execute it as soon as you’ve finished preparation. Waiting longer makes the situation worse. Also, the bad news may leak.
  * **Define the correct root cause:** Be honest about why the layoff or demotion is happening. It’s most often a problem with the company’s performance or hiring procedures, not with the person herself.
  * **Have a clear exit plan for the people affected:** You should have details on severance and benefits planned before the meeting. 
  * **Have a clear transition plan for the team remaining:** They will want to know how this changes their reporting structure and their day-to-day work.
  * **Rehearse your meeting:** You don’t want to misspeak.
  * **In your meeting, be clear on the reasons:** Communicate the root cause clearly.
  * **In your meeting, be firm and unwavering:** State the decision is non-negotiable. Use words like “I’ve decided” rather than “I think.”
  * **Afterward, message to the rest of the company:** This speech is for the people who are remaining. Be respectful to the people affected. They’ve built friendships with the rest of the team and made real contributions. The team that’s staying cares how you treat people who leave.



Now let’s apply this general advice to the three situations.

#### How to Layoff Multiple People

**Root cause:** When you need to lay people off, it’s because the company failed—failed to meet its targets, failed to execute its strategy, or had the wrong strategy in the first place. Don’t use other feel-good excuses, like “we’re getting rid of the bottom performers.” Admit the company failed; this builds trust with the rest of the team.

**Managers should lay off their own people.** Don’t be a coward and pass the task onto HR or an outsourced agency. The people being laid off want to hear the bad news from your face or from their manager’s. The people remaining want to know you have the courage to own your decisions.

#### How to Fire an Executive

Executives tend to be easier to fire, because they’ve fired plenty of people in the past. But given their higher position, the root causes and preparation can be more nuanced.

**Root cause:** Most often, it’s not the executive’s fault she’s being fired. It’s the company’s fault for having a bad hiring or onboarding process. Here are a panel of reasons:

  * **You didn’t know what you wanted.** If you weren’t sure what exactly the company needed in the next 1-2 years, you wouldn’t have filtered for the right qualities.
  * **You looked for lack of weakness rather than for strength.** This is most common in hiring by committee, where people reject people they have problems with, leading to a vanilla candidate who is not hated by anyone but is also not particularly strong at their core function. You need to hire someone who is world-class at what they need to do, regardless of tolerable faults.
  * **You hired an executive by archetype.** You probably have an image in mind of what an ideal, say, sales manager looks and sounds like (tall, suave, smooth-talking). This likely has a poor correlation with what job your company needs done. A VP of engineering at Google might be a terrible fit for your company.
  * **You hired for the wrong stage of the company.** Executives are specialists at certain stages in company growth. Don’t hire someone who will be appropriate in 3-5 years—she’ll be useless in the next 18 months, and the team will reject her.
  * **You hired for the wrong expertise in growth.** When you’re scaling fast, you need someone who has personally scaled from small to large. You don’t want someone who merely worked in a large company or inherited a large department.
  * **You didn’t integrate the executive properly.** Executives are like organ transplants and can be accepted or rejected by the host (your team). You need to smooth the way for employees to welcome her. Make the team expectations clear on how she should be treated.



In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to run a hiring process to avoid these mistakes.

**Inform the board.** Ben advises broaching this with individual phone calls, then finalizing the decision at a board meeting. It can be especially sensitive if you have high executive turnover or if the executive was recommended by a board member. Steps to take:

  * Communicate your root cause and how you plan to fix it. 
  * Have them approve the separation package.
  * Don’t bad-mouth the executive. Doing so makes you look childish.



**Let the executive determine the outside messaging.** The executive cares about protecting her reputation. Ben advises that you let the executive decide how to communicate the news to the team and the world.

**Exit plan:** The executive’s direct reports will want to know what the plans are to replace the executive and who they will report to in the interim. Horowitz recommends the CEO take on the executive’s role since this provides smooth continuity and helps inform your hiring plans.

#### How to Demote a Loyal Early Employee

When your company grows, people who have been in senior positions from the beginning may no longer be appropriate. It’s rare for a great manager of the 5-person team to also be great at leading the 50- or 500-person team. You may have to demote someone from her position, promote a colleague above her, or hire someone from outside for a role she was expecting to be promoted to.

**Root cause:** Explain that the person is under-equipped to do the job and why. You also have fault in not being experienced enough to coach her into the role.

**Exit plan:** If you want the person to stay, come up with a plan that lets her preserve her dignity and motivation. Working under her new boss might not be the best solution. Consider moving her to another team where she can learn new skills. Meanwhile, consider giving her a raise, just to reemphasize how valued she is.

### Execute with Failure in Mind

In feudal Japan, the samurai code of honor _bushido_ prescribed warriors to “keep death in mind at all times.” The purpose was to prepare constantly for death, to live life honorably and to plan for a good death with honor intact. Keeping death in mind would protect the value of each living moment.

Horowitz advises the same thing. Keep your company’s death in mind. This will make you focus when building your company. If you don’t want to go through the pain of firing an executive, then you’d better hire a great one from the start. If you don’t want to go through the pain of laying off half your team, then you’d better get the strategy right and hire appropriately.
