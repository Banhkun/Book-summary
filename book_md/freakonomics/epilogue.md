## Epilogue: Articles and Supplemental Material

(Shortform note: This section is composed of a series of articles from the _New York Times Magazine,_ including a “Freakonomics” column that ran in the magazine from 2005-2006, as well as select entries from the “Freakonomics” blog that were added to the revised and expanded 2006 edition to the book. **These should be viewed as** **supplemental readings only**. They aren’t necessary for understanding the larger themes of the main _Freaknomics_ text, and many of them simply restate or summarize the case studies featured in the original book.

From these articles, you should gain a deeper understanding of _why_ the author’s focus on the stories that they do, how they define their approach to economics, what they think are the main drivers of behavior (incentives), and how data analysis can provide powerful insights into how the world actually works.)

### “The Probability that a Real-Estate Agent is Cheating You (and Other Riddles of Modern Life): Inside the Curious Mind of the Heralded Young Economist Steven Levitt” (2003)

This article discusses Levitt’s focus on applying an economic lens and economic tools to explain events and behaviors that are traditionally outside the realm of economics.

His approach has been to **take the “dismal” out of the “dismal science” of economics by blending psychology, neurology, criminology, and other fields** into the discipline, engaging a wider audience and using economic theories and methods of analysis to provide insight to pressing real-world problems. Fundamentally, Levitt defines his approach to economics as empiricism (knowledge through observation) over theory.

### “Up in Smoke: Whatever Happened to Crack Cocaine?” (2005)

This article re-explores some of the themes discussed in Chapter 3 of the main _Freakonomics_ text. As you’ll recall, crack is still quite prevalent, with overdoses actually _higher_ than they were during the height of the crack epidemic of the 1980s. **The crack trade has just gotten** **significantly less violent.**

With reduced demand for the product (younger people were turned off to it, having seen its ravaging effects among their elders), there has been a drop in price, as one would expect from laws of supply and demand.

The resulting decline in profit margins reduced the incentive for violence—it’s not worth the high costs and risks associated with killing a rival (or risking getting killed yourself) to gain marginal ground in a less and less profitable market.

### “Does the Truth Lie Within? One Professor’s Lifetime of Self-Experimentation” (2005)

This article puts the _Freakonomics_ lens on the self-experimentation of Seth Roberts, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Self-experimentation is (as the name suggests) when an individual performs experiments on themselves. Aside from the personal risk associated with doing this, the practice is usually scorned by scientists, since:

  * It removes objectivity
  * It’s impossible to set up a control group or a double-blind experiment (since the subject and the researcher are the same person)
  * It’s difficult to replicate



Nevertheless, Roberts wanted to experiment with how to lose weight. He realized that **the human body has an internal “thermostat” or an ideal weight set point to which individuals naturally regressed.** This had a sound evolutionary basis. In the Stone Age, when access to food was hardly guaranteed and small tribal groups went through periods of great abundance followed by unforgiving scarcity, the body had to learn to adjust hunger levels to fit the relative availability of food at a given time.

Thus, our body sends intense hunger signals when there is lots of tasty, familiar food around (as there is in most wealthy, industrialized societies of the 21st century) and sends the opposite signal when food is unavailable or unappealing. In a wealthy society like the US, our bodies are sending us the “wrong” signals. Big Macs beget more Big Macs.

**The key, then, is to “game the system” by tricking our bodies into telling us we’re not hungry.**

Through self-experimentation, Roberts achieved this effect by consuming a few tablespoons of oil per day, giving him some extra flavorless calories that tricked his body into being less hungry. The result? He lost 40 pounds which he has never regained.

Self-experimentation suffers from inherent flaws**** that requires its results to be viewed with skepticism. Still, we shouldn’t completely ignore what it tells us. Sometimes self-experimentation is the fastest, or only, way to get an interesting result to an interesting question.

### “Curbing Your Dog: Can Technology Keep New York City Scooped?” (2005)

Given the low penalties and infrequent enforcement, why do so many dog owners pick up after their dogs? Well, think back to Chapter 1. **It’s not because of economic incentives—it’s _social_ incentives. **While a $50 fine may not constitute a severe financial penalty, being seen as a selfish and irresponsible dog owner is a powerful source of shame that does compel people to obey the law in this case.

### “Why Vote?” (2005)

**Economists talk often about the** **“irrationality of voting.”** Since any singe vote is highly unlikely to affect the outcome, the cost of voting to an individual (in terms of lost time, foregone wages, and travel costs) isn’t one worth paying. Outside of some self-satisfaction for performing your civic duty, you don’t “get” anything for showing up to the polls. **So why bother voting?**

(Shortform note: **if everybody followed this logic, then _nobody_ would vote, **which would be a bad outcome for democratic societies.This is related to the idea of the “tragedy of the commons,” where rational, self-interested behavior by an individual becomes destructive when exercised collectively.)

**The implementation of a vote-by-mail system voting in Switzerland presented** **a natural experiment** that enabled political scientists to study whether voter participation would increase once people could avoid paying the costs of voting in person. The natural experiment was especially useful, since vote-by-mail was not implemented uniformly across the country, but rather, on a district-by-district basis, enabling researchers to treat districts where it had been implemented as a variable group and districts where it had _not_ yet been implemented as a control group.

**The results? Turnout actually _declined_!**

It turns out that **the social incentive to vote (i.e., not being seen as a slacker citizen by your community) is actually quite high**. By being seen showing up in person at the polls, you can avoid the social penalty. With the anonymity of vote-by-mail, however, more people took the liberty to stay home, since the cost of nonvoting had been reduced. If you weren’t seen voting, you could just say you had voted by mail. This should give pause to those who point to Internet voting as a means to _boost_ turnout—the Swiss experience would suggest the opposite effect.

### “The Economy of Desire: Can Fear of AIDS Change Sexual Preference?” (2005)

Outside of prostitution, we don’t typically think of sex as having a price. Economists would beg to differ.

**In economics, prices encompass much more than the dollar amount on the menu**. They consist of opportunity costs (the costs of the foregone alternatives as a result of a decision: think giving up your job to go to college), as well as social and moral costs.

The epidemic of HIV/AIDS among gay men in the 1980’s, could be said to have drastically (and lethally) raised the cost of male-male sexual contact. **Would people respond** **to this “cost increase” by demanding less?**

According to a study from the University of Chicago, they did. In a 1992 sexual behavior survey of more than 3,500 people, those who had a relative with HIV/AIDS were far less likely to have had sex with men—this was true for both men AND women.

  * _None_ of these men reported having had sex with a man within the previous five years, nor did any of them cite homosexual preferences.
  * Perhaps more startlingly, self-reporting of homosexuality among _women_ in this category was twice as high as those who did not report having a relative with HIV/AIDS.



The absence of homosexuality among these men and the overrepresentation of it among these women would seem to suggest that this subset was frightened off the idea of sex with men in general, by knowing someone suffering from HIV/AIDS.

### “Filling in the Tax Gap: Why Americans should be clamoring for the IRS to do more audits, not fewer” (2006)

Why do Americans pay their taxes?

**Because _most_ Americans have a powerful incentive to comply**, for fear of a potential (and painful) audit by the IRS. This is especially true for wage earners who file a W-2 form (in other words, 90 percent of American taxpayers). For these filers, their employer has _already_ reported their income to the IRS and taxes have _already_ been withheld from their paychecks. Cheating on your taxes in this situation is very dangerous, since you run a high risk of being caught.

Unsurprisingly, tax compliance is very high among W2 filers (only about 1 percent of income from this group goes unreported, according to IRS data).

Contrarily, those who are self-employed underreport far more than wage and tip-earners. Here, **the incentives work in the opposite direction**. If you’re a business owner or independent contractor, _you’re_ the only one who knows your income. The only way the IRS could discover a discrepancy in your filing would be for them to audit you. Given the overtaxed (pardon the pun) resources of the IRS, this is unlikely. Thus, **the relatively** **low risk of discovery creates a stronger incentive for self-employed individuals to cheat.**
