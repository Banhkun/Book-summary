## Chapter 1: The Power of Incentives

### Economics is the Study of Incentives

There are **three main kinds** of incentives:

#### Economic Incentives

This is the type we’re most familiar with. Economic incentives provide tangible rewards to people for engaging in productive behavior and penalties on people for destructive behavior. Getting a raise at work for exceeding expectations, a speeding ticket, or even being sentenced to prison (which deprives one of one’s freedom and livelihood), are all economic incentives.

#### Social Incentives

Social incentives are rooted in our natural desire to be looked upon favorably by others. On the flip side, we fear being shamed and looked upon _dis_ favorably by our peers. To harness social incentives, many jurisdictions in the US have started publishing the names and photos of people arrested for prostitution-related offences—likely a far stronger deterrent than a $500 fine!

#### Moral Incentives

Most of us want to do what we consider to be “right,” and avoid doing things that we consider to be “wrong.” Thus, there is a powerful _moral_ incentive against committing crimes or engaging in any behavior that causes harm to others. Uniquely, **moral incentives are self-enforced** —only we as individuals can hold ourselves accountable on moral grounds.

### Incentive Design is Critical

Because incentives are effective, economists are fond of devising incentive-based solutions to real-world problems. Unfortunately, **people acting in bad faith will always try to “game” or abuse the incentive to gain an advantage**. **Poorly designed incentive systems can backfire completely** and produce unintended, destructive behavior.

Therefore,**incentives need to be well-designed.** Properly designed incentives promote the intended behavior without allowing people to profit from unintended behaviors. We’ll cover three key examples of how well-meaning incentives caused unintended consequences.

#### Example: Parents Late to Daycare Pickup

A day-care center requires parents to pick up their kids by 4PM. But inevitably some parents are late. This is costly—the kids are anxious, and the teachers have to stay late to watch the kids. How do you fix this with incentives?

Here’s a simple fix: fine a parent each time they’re late. Theoretically, **this increases the punishment to a parent for being late, which should decrease late arrivals.**

A pair of economists put this to the test a ta group of day-care centers in Israel. The rule: any parent over ten minutes late would pay $3 per child for each late arrival.

The result was counterintuitive—**the number of late pickups _doubled_**. This is odd, since adding an extra fine should decrease pickups! What happened?

It turns out that **adding a fine changed the nature of the relationship**. A social/moral incentive was _converted_ into an economic incentive. Previously with no fine, parents were held to social standards to be on time (“if you’re a good parent and a thoughtful person, you’ll be on time”).

But when the day-care center added dollars to the mix, it changed the implicit agreement, making the calculation financial, rather than social/moral. It seemed as though the day-care center were saying, “it’s fine for you to be late, as long as you pay $3 each time.” Parents could weigh the value of their time and decide $3 was well worth being late.

This illustrates the tricky, counter-intuitive nature of incentives—**well-meaning incentives can have unintended consequences**.

(You might suspect that $3 isn’t enough, and that a higher fee like $50 would be more effective. This is likely right, but it might also increase resentment and cause parents to switch to another day-care.)

#### Example: _Teachers_ Cheating on Standardized Tests?

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the US federal government and several states began enacting laws mandating “high-stakes” testing. This was an incentive system that:

  1. **Rewarded** schools whose students performed well with additional funding and raises for teachers
  2. **Punished** schools with low student test scores by cutting funding and firing teachers and administrators.



The idea was to incentivize schools to raise their academic standards. If teachers had a personal stake in the performances of their students, then they would work harder to promote strong test results—right?

Well, teachers _did_ raise their students’ test scores—but not in the way that policymakers intended.**High-stakes testing created a massive incentive for teachers to cheat on behalf of their students** by granting unwarranted extra time on tests, giving away answers, or even changing incorrect answers. And given the incentive, this behavior makes sense. If they could earn a $25,000 raise by boosting their class’ test scores (and avoid getting fired if they didn’t), there was every economic incentive to give their students a “leg up.” Besides, who would suspect teachers?

**Critics of the policy turned to** **statistical analysis** to prove it. By studying a database of seven years’ worth of test answers from students in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system, researchers were able to construct an algorithm that identified certain suspicious answer patterns within a given classroom:

  1. Low-performing students getting lots of hard questions right.
  2. For any given student, getting the easy questions wrong and the hard questions right.
  3. Large classrooms that earned suspiciously high scores in one year, while getting lower scores in the past and future.



It’s unlikely that these answer patterns would come about through honest effort or sheer coincidence. Instead, they were best explained by teacher tampering. When they crunched the numbers, researchers discovered that **there was** **evidence of cheating in over 200 classrooms per year, representing more than 5 percent of all classrooms in the CPS!**

After discovering the cheating, administrators retested select classrooms with heavier oversight. As expected, classrooms run by cheating teachers showed a huge score decrease when cheating was prevented. Many of these teachers were fired.

#### Example: Collusion Among Sumo Wrestlers

Sumo wrestling, the national sport of Japan, carries a deep emotional and spiritual gravity among wrestlers and spectators. Yet we see that **rampant cheating and collusion are the unintended consequences of a flawed incentive system.** Sumo wrestlers are, after all, human beings just like the rest of us.

Each sumo wrestler is ranked according to their win-loss record in tournaments. Those with the highest rankings earn a handsome living and enjoy great prestige. Those with the lowest rankings earn hardly anything and are forced to serve their superiors. So, clearly, the rankings carry tremendous weight (pardon the sumo wrestling pun).

Wrestlers face 15 opponents during the course of a tournament. If they finish with a winning record****(8-7 or higher),**** they will rise in the rankings. If they finish with a losing record, (7-8 or lower), they are relegated to a lower rank. **The 8th win makes all the difference**.

A wrestler going into a final match with a 7-7 record has every possible incentive to win, of course. But **a wrestler with an 8-6 record has little to compete for** , since he will have already secured advancement but is also likely to be out of contention for the overall tournament championship. For such a wrestler, one additional victory has almost no value.

**This alignment of incentives and disincentives makes a powerful recipe for collusion.** Instead of fighting to win, the 8-6 wrestler might let the 7-7 wrestler have the victory, since it matters so much more to the latter.

Like the CPS case above, when we study the data from over 30,000 matches fought by nearly 300 wrestlers, and then narrow it down to matches fought between 7-7 and 8-6 opponents, **we can actually see the numbers telling a story**. The data reveals some key findings about these matchups:

  1. 7-7 wrestlers _vastly_ outperform their predicted win percentages when facing 8-6 opponents (winning close to 80 percent of the time when they would be expected to win about 50 percent of the time).
  2. When these same wrestlers meet again when neither is on the edge of an 8th win, the 7-7 wrestlers who won the previous match _underperform_ their predicted win percentages (winning only 40 percent of the time, when they would be expected to win about 50 percent of the time).
  3. When these same opponents meet for a _third_ time, the results match the expected win percentages of each wrestler much more accurately.



So an upset win, followed by a worse-than-expected performance, and concluding with a reversion to the mean. Like the unusual answer patterns in the CPS high-stakes test data, **these unlikely win-loss records strongly suggest a quid pro quo arrangement** —“I’ll take a dive for you if you take a dive for me the next time.”

The specific economic incentive of that 8th win drove rigging of sumo wrestling matches.
