## Introduction

Are we right to accept the opinions and recommendations of experts? Are there perhaps deeper mechanisms at work that might explain why human beings behave the way they do and why events unfold as they do? In fact, **much of the conventional wisdom we have come to accept is false.**

### The Missing Crime Wave of the 1990s

As the decade of the 1990s dawned, the US airwaves were awash with experts claiming that a new crime wave (far more terrifying than the just-passed crime wave of the 1980s) was on the horizon, to be driven by a fresh cohort of violent, amoral young “superpredators,” who would soon be entering the prime years of their criminal careers.

Except that the crime wave just...never happened. In fact, a historic _drop_ in crime would be a hallmark of the period beginning in the 1990s and lasting through to the present day. In a later chapter, we’ll discuss how data and analysis were used to unpack this misconception.

### What Are Incentives?

At their most basic, **incentives are stimuli that encourage “good” behavior and discourage “bad” behavior.**(Think of how you might give a dog a treat for sitting when she’s told to). As we’ll see throughout _Freakonomics_ , incentives are a key driver of human behavior.

Incentives create an entire mental framework in which human beings think and act. Understanding them enables us to better understand the choices people make. Choices that seem perplexing on the surface often look perfectly rational in light of hidden incentives.

### The Folly of Experts

We tend to put our trust in experts—be they doctors, politicians, or even real estate agents and car salespeople. We heed their advice because we accept that they will use their superior knowledge to help _us._

Unfortunately, this is often not the case. **Experts are motivated by incentives as much as anyone.** Doctors might order expensive and medically unnecessary procedures to boost their bottom line. Real estate agents might manipulate you into accepting a weak offer on your house because it’s not worth their time and money to negotiate for a better deal on your behalf.

Understand the incentives of experts, and you’ll understand how they can act against your best interest.

### How Do We Find The Truth?

**We apply the analytical, quantitative methods of economics.** Economics has a powerful toolkit that can be used to solve problems far beyond predicting stock market trends or forecasting GDP.

We see this in the pervasive influence of false correlations. **Experts are adept at dubiously linking correlations to causes—** it’s one of the most common means by which they spread misleading conventional wisdom. For example, stock market pundits point to questionable causes of movements that might largely be random.**Data-driven methods like** **regression analysis** , **however, can expose this weak logic and point us closer to the truth.**

### Does Money Really Buy Elections?

Consider the idea that “money buys elections.” Political scientists (and, perhaps more importantly, self-interested political fundraising consultants) tell us that the candidate who raises the most money wins the election the vast majority of the time. And on the surface, that’s true!

But does the cash _really cause_ the candidate to win? Or is this merely a correlation - are those candidates who are likely to win anyway (because they’re powerful incumbents or because they possess strong appeal) just more likely to receive contributions from donors who want to be on the winning side?

As it turns out, data analysis can shed some light on this. By analyzing elections in which the same two candidates ran against each other in consecutive races, **we can create a natural experiment** , controlling for political appeal of the individual candidates, the partisan lean of the district, and other potential **confounding variables,** to focus solely on the effects of money.

The data shows that **fundraising makes very little difference toward election outcomes**. Winning candidates can raise half as much money and lose only 1 percent of their support, while losers can double their spending and only gain that same 1 percent of additional votes. Good candidates simply raise more money and bad candidates don’t.
