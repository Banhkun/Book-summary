## Exercise: Confront Conventional Wisdom

Be skeptical of conventional wisdom - what everyone believes might be wrong.

* * *

What’s a piece of conventional wisdom that you used to believe in? How did you come to realize that it was incorrect?

Building on that experience, what conventional wisdom do you still put stock in today? If you’re beginning to think that it’s wrong, how can you investigate it to get closer to the truth?

What is an example of a widely-accepted belief that you think is wrong? Why do you think this belief is incorrect?
