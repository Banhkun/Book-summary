## Exercise: Overcome the Information Gap

In information asymmetry, whoever has more information has more power.

Can you think of a major public issue or event where information asymmetry is a factor? Explain how an information gap is at play.

Have you ever been in a situation where someone had more information than you and it caused you to feel at a disadvantage? Briefly describe what happened.

Moving forward, how can you enhance your information to put yourself in a stronger position in your personal and professional lives?
