## Chapter 2: Information Asymmetry

### Unequal Access to Information

As the world has become **more specialized and complex** , people have come to rely more and more on experts to guide them through major life decisions. This is largely driven by fear of making a wrong decision that might result in financial ruin or even physical harm.

As we’ve discussed above, however, experts are hardly neutral arbiters of truth who are selflessly devoted to guiding you through the trials and tribulations of a staggeringly complex world. Rather, **they are often** **self-interested, equally fallible humans** who seek to use their superior information to gain an advantage on you. This unequal distribution of information between parties to a transaction is known as **information asymmetry**.

Think of the mechanic who tells you that you need to replace parts of your engine that you’ve never heard of to be able to pass your vehicle inspection. Or the doctor who orders that MRI that you’re not quite sure you needed. Or the car salesperson who insists that you need all of those pricey add-on safety features. All of these experts know perfectly well that you know nothing about their business. Often, **your information deficit is their gain** , especially if they have strong incentives to profit.

(Shortform example: the 2008 Financial Crisis was another story of information asymmetry. Financiers created products like derivatives and collateralized debt obligations, whose larger implications many investors simply did not understand. When the housing market collapsed, those investors who bought these products were wiped out, while the sellers, who possessed a major information advantage, made a tidy profit.

Note: This is not to say that all experts with an information advantage consciously deceive unknowing victims. There are many fair and well-meaning experts. But a tricky thing about incentives is that they can bias someone subconsciously.)

#### Example: How the Ku Klux Klan Lost its Information Advantage

The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is the most infamous domestic terrorist group in United States history. Through violence and intimidation against African-Americans, they were fearsome enforcers of the traditional racial hierarchy in the southern US.

You might remember that the Klan supported violent acts like lynchings to spread their message and intimidate African-Americans. But statistics show lynchings had fallen drastically by the 1920s, when Klan membership was at its peak. This suggests that something _besides_ simple violence was at the root of the organization’s influence and power.

**Their secret weapon was information.** The Klan relied on its status as a**secret organization** , giving it a powerful mystique that enabled it to exert an influence far beyond its actual numerical strength. With its operations, rituals, and membership shrouded in mystery, the Klan appeared to be all-seeing, all-knowing, and ever-present. This information asymmetry between the Klan and what the rest of the country _really_ knew about it was a major source of organizational strength.

When journalists Stetson Kennedy and John Brown infiltrated the Klan in the 1940s, they discovered that the Klan’s greatest strength could also be its greatest weakness. In radio shows, they publicized the Klan’s passwords, closely-guarded rituals, hierarchical structure, and titles. **They robbed the Klan of its secrecy, erasing its advantage of information asymmetry.**

Suddenly, the Klan was no longer an omnipresent force and fearful symbol of white supremacy, but rather, a group of poorly educated and unemployed men who engaged in absurd ritual chanting and bestowed upon themselves laughably grandiose titles like “Grand Dragon” and “Klokard.” No longer intimidated, the American public now had enough information to mobilize en masse against them.

The result? **Applications for** **membership and attendance declined** as it became an object of mockery, not fear. The veil of secrecy (and thus, power) had been irreparably broken.

#### Example: Your Real Estate Agent vs. You

When you’re selling your house, it’s natural to assume that your real estate agent will work hard to secure the best deal for you. After all, why wouldn’t she? The incentive seems aligned: the more she sells your house for, the higher her commission will be, right?

Unfortunately, **your incentives aren’t as aligned as you think.**

Let’s say you sell your house for $500,000. With the customary 6 percent of the sale price going to the agent, she should be pocketing $30,000 from the deal. But that’s before we consider a few other factors that cut significantly into her final take:

  1. The _buying_ agent’s fee.
  2. Her own _agency’s_ fee.
  3. The selling costs (which are borne by the agent).



In fact, her real takeaway from the deal is more like 1.5 percent, or $7,500.**** And if you think you can ask for more and want to sell for $520,000? Sure, **_you_ pocket an extra $18,800, but your agent would only take home an additional $300. **And given that she would have to put in all the extra work, place all the extra ads, and turn away new clients, this hardly seems like a worthwhile reward.

Now here’s where the information asymmetry comes into the picture. Given her vastly superior knowledge of the real estate market, she knows how to exploit your relative ignorance. She’ll work her hardest to convince you that the lowball $500,000 is the best you’re going to receive and that you’d better take it before they withdraw or lower it. Of course, she _knows_ that’s not likely to be true, but **she’s more interested in having you making a _quick_ deal than in holding out for a _better_ one.**

This contrasts with how real estate agents behave when selling their _own_ homes. When we study the public data of home sales in the Chicago area, we see that real estate agents:

  * Leave their houses on the market for 10 days longer than they advise their clients to.
  * Sell their houses for 3 percent _higher_ than their clients’ homes go for.



(Shortform note: this is a good example of what’s known in economics and in managerial studies as the **principal-agent problem**. This arises when a party hired to carry out a task has poorly-designed incentives that lead them to engage in behavior that harms the agent. Think of shareholders of a company hiring a CEO and tying that CEO’s compensation to the company’s stock price. This can create an incentive for the CEO to engage in risky ventures, rush untested products to market, or even falsify earnings figures in order to elevate the stock.)

### The Internet: A New Hope?

With so much of the world’s information now available at _anyone’s_ fingertips thanks to the Internet, it has become much more difficult for specialists to use their knowledge to their unique advantage.**The Internet has** **eroded the leverage once wielded by old sources of expertise** and empowered ordinary people to make better-informed decisions on their own.

If we want to explore how the Internet has helped to bring once-powerful information monopolists to heel, a great example is the term life insurance industry. Term life insurance is a relatively commodified product, with most policies offering the same coverage as those offered by competitors. **With little differentiation, customers tend to make their decisions based on price alone.**

Before the Internet, it was time-consuming, confusing, and expensive for customers to do price-comparison shopping on term life insurance policies. They did not have adequate access to information to be able to compare products and did not understand the differences between policies. Naturally, this put customers at a considerable disadvantage relative to the insurance carriers. With such an information gap, **insurers were free to overcharge customers for routine policies and the customers had little recourse**.

Until the Internet. In 1996, **Quotesmith.com published the prices of term life insurance policies sold by dozens of companies, along with simple breakdowns of the coverage offered by each.** Now, a process that had been laborious and costly became easy and cheap. _Anyone_ could simply click on a website and compare insurance quotes side-by-side.

The result? **Insurance carriers had no choice but to lower prices to compete** —customers paid _$1 billion_ less for term life insurance in the years afterwards.
