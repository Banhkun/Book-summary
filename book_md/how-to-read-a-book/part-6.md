## Part 6: Comparative Reading

The first three levels of reading (and the specific advice in Part 5) all focus on reading a singular text. Now, we’ll talk about applying those analytical skills across a multitude of texts. Adler and Van Doren call this “syntopical reading.” “Syntopical” is a neologism Adler’s Encyclopedia Britannica team invented; for simplicity, we’ll call this type of reading “comparative” reading.

Comparative reading aims to compare books and authors to one another, to model dialogues between authors that may not be in any one of the books. The ultimate aim of comparative reading is to understand all the conflicting viewpoints relating to a subject. It’s not to devise your own synthetic answer, as this would merely be an entry into the literature, rather than an understanding of what already exists. (Shortform note: In _How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ , author Thomas C. Foster describes “intertextuality,” which is the common references and themes that exist across fiction books. Reading literature with an intertextual lens is similar to reading expository books comparatively.)

### The Process of Comparative Reading

Here are the major steps of comparative reading according to the authors. (Shortform note: Adler and Van Doren list these as a set of five steps, each containing many sub-steps. For clarity, we’ve expanded the list so that each step is one distinct action.)

1\. Create a total bibliography of works that may be relevant to your subject.

  * Many of the important works may not be obvious, since they may not have the keyword in their titles. (Shortform note: In established fields, look for a primer or brief history of your subject. This will give you an overview of the topic and help you identify additional sources.)



2\. Inspect all of the books on your bibliography to decide which are relevant to your subject and to better define the subject.

  * As you research, you may find that your subject is more difficult to define than you imagined. For example, if your subject is World War II, you’ll have more material than you could possibly read. As you begin reading, the authors recommend narrowing down your subject—for example, to women’s roles on the American home front or a specific event like the Warsaw Uprising. 
  * (Shortform note: The ultimate scope of your topic depends on your project. If you love history and want to know everything there is to know about World War II, you might keep the subject broad and make it a lifelong reading project. On the other hand, if your goal is to write a paper for a class, you may want to keep narrowing until you have just enough information to fill a set number of pages.)
  * You may have to iterate between reading works and defining your subject.



3\. Go through each book on your list and mark specific chapters or passages you intend to use.

  * Keep in mind that only a portion of any given book may be relevant to your purposes. You needn’t read the entire book if only one or two sections are relevant to the subject you’re exploring. You may use a syntopicon that organizes passages across works by subject, like _Great Books of the Western World_. (Shortform note: The “Syntopicon'' is a directory of “Great Ideas'' that includes every reference to those ideas across 431 “Great Books.” It took Adler and his team over 400,000 hours of reading and more than a decade to create.)



4\. Develop a set of common terms and rephrase each author’s argument in that language.

  * Authors in different fields may use entirely different terms that mean the same thing, and the same terms in different fields may mean entirely different things.
  * You must establish the controls and bring order to the chaos. Adler and Van Doren recommend doing this by deciding on a set of terminology for your project and translating various authors’ arguments into those common terms. 
  * (Shortform note: For scientific or technical topics, you may need to literally translate the author’s conclusions into a set of common units. For example, if two authors are discussing changes in sea level due to climate change, one might use absolute sea level as a measurement while the other uses sea level change relative to land movement. To get them on the same terms, you’d need to convert these to a common measure.)



5\. Develop a set of questions that each author provides answers to.

  * This may not be explicit—you may have to infer the author’s answer to a question she never directly considered. 
  * (Shortform note: Take your inferred answers with a grain of salt. Even if you’re well-versed in the work of a given author, it’s impossible to know for sure how that author would feel about a subject they never addressed. This is especially true for subjects they had no concept of in their time—for example, we should be especially cautious inferring what Aristotle would think of social media.)



6\. Get a sense of the complexity of the issues.

  * See how each author answers the questions. If their answers are vastly different, it probably means that your question represents a particularly contentious issue in their field. 
  * (Shortform note: Another clue that you’ve stumbled on a contentious issue is if a lot of literature is published on that topic in a short amount of time (because authors are constantly rebutting each other). More informally, you may even look to social media or interviews with the authors to see whether they’re focused on rebutting another author’s ideas.)



7\. Order the questions and issues to throw maximum light on the subject.

  * Show how the questions are answered differently and say why. Generally, the authors advise ordering more general questions before less general questions.
  * Avoid trying to assert the truth or falsity of any view—this fails the goal of the syntopic reading to be objective. According to the authors, full objectivity is difficult to maintain, and bias can show in subtle ways like the summarization of arguments and the ordering of answers. The antidote to this is constant reference to the actual text of the authors. 
  * (Shortform note: Keep in mind that bias can persist even when you’re actively trying to be objective. Psychologists have shown this through the Implicit Association Test, which tests implicit social biases. Participants know they’re being tested on bias (and therefore may be deliberately trying to appear unbiased), but those biases are so deeply rooted that they appear anyway.)



The authors suggest omitting imaginative works from comparative reading, because the propositions are obscured by plot and are rarely explicitly attributed to the author (a character’s speech could be satirical). (Shortform note: Including fiction in a comparative project is complicated indeed, but may still be valuable. For example, reading only historical accounts of 18th century English and Irish politics without reading Jonathan Swift’s _Gulliver’s Travels_ (or of ancient Greece without reading the works of Homer or Sophocles) would be a major omission, despite the influence of fiction.)

> **Comparative Reading vs. Literature Review**
> 
> In academic settings, literature reviews are a common undertaking. Literature reviews are similar to comparative reading projects in that the goal is to gain a wide understanding of what other thinkers have to say about a certain subject. Researchers conducting literature reviews often complete extra steps that Adler and Van Doren don’t mention in their discussion of comparative reading; however, these steps might be useful for comparative reading projects. For example:
> 
>   * Define your inclusion criteria. Literature reviews have strict inclusion criteria to help determine which sources to use. For example, many literature reviews only pull sources from academic journals, not popular press books or even textbooks. If you need to narrow down your comparative reading bibliography, you might set similar parameters on the types of sources you want to use.
> 
>   * Create a table to keep track of different authors’ viewpoints. This will help you keep all your information in one place as you work through your bibliography. You can even color code authors who are in favor of a certain issue or against it.
> 
>   * Analyze the quality of your source. For scientific topics, researchers can do this mathematically by analyzing effect size and statistical significance. For qualitative topics, you might do this by researching the author. What is their experience in this subject? For translated texts, you might also research the translator and the history of translation for that specific text. Are there any passages that different translators have approached differently?
