## Shortform Introduction

_How to Read a Book_ is the classic guide to reading effectively. It teaches how to understand the crux of a book within 15 minutes, how to analyze a book intelligently, and how to synthesize ideas from multiple books. Reading is an active activity, not a passive one—so if you read a lot of books, it makes sense to learn _how to read better_ and increase the value of your reading.

### About the Authors

**Mortimer J. Adler** was a philosopher, Columbia professor, Chairman of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and prolific author of more than 50 books (imagine how many he must have _read!_). Adler wrote on a range of subjects including Aristotelian philosophy, liberal arts education, capitalism, religion, and morality. As Chairman, he oversaw the publishing of Encyclopedia Britannica's _Great Books of the Western World_ series and went on to found the Great Books Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting literacy and critical thinking.

**Charles Van Doren** was a writer, editor, educator, and eventual vice president of Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. He is the author of six books and the editor of five (many of which were co-edited by Adler). Van Doren came from a literary family—his mother was a novelist and both his father and uncle were Pulitzer Prize-winning authors—and was a polymath, holding advanced degrees in both astrophysics and English.

In the late 1950s, Van Doren was a contestant on “Twenty-One,” a popular quiz show. He ultimately won over $129,000 (which equates to over a million dollars today). However, rumors of fraud prompted a Congressional investigation, and Van Doren ultimately admitted that the network gave him the questions and answers in advance. The 1994 movie “Quiz Show” is based on his involvement in the scandal.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Simon & Schuster

_How to Read a Book_ was originally published in 1940 with the subtitle, “The Art of Getting a Liberal Education.” Mortimer J. Adler was the sole author of the first edition. This guide, however, covers the revised 1972 edition, which features a significant content expansion (the book is divided into four parts, only one of which was present in the first edition) and a new subtitle: “The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading.” The first edition of _How to Read a Book_ was Adler’s ninth book; the 1972 edition was Van Doren’s second book. Both authors wrote extensively on the importance of books and reading (including Van Doren’s _The Joy of Reading_); however, _How to Read a Book_ remains the most popular book in both authors’ bibliographies.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

In the preface to this edition of _How to Read a Book_ , Adler described the changes he observed in American society that prompted him to revisit the book 32 years after its original publication. First, the percentage of young people earning college degrees rose significantly during that time period (in part due to the passage of the GI Bill, which financed college education for veterans returning from World War II). Additionally, in 1970, the federal government reiterated the importance of reading when the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare announced a national “Right to Read” effort designed to improve reading education for children under age 10. Adler took this educational boom as a sign that reading well was more important than ever and decided to revamp his 1940 classic.

#### Intellectual Context

_How to Read a Book_ was one of the first books to explicitly teach the art of reading for comprehension rather than speed. Its modern successors include Thomas C. Foster’s _How to Read Literature Like a Professor_ , Steve Leveen’s _The Little Guide to Your Well-Read Life, _and Harold Bloom’s _How to Read and Why_ , all of which focus primarily on works of fiction (unlike _How to Read a Book_ , which focuses on techniques for reading nonfiction books).

#### The Book’s Impact

_How to Read a Book_ became an immediate bestseller when it was first published in 1940. The 1972 revised edition has been consistently successful and was most recently republished in 2014.

In 1997, Adler wrote a companion volume to _How to Read a Book_ entitled _How to Speak How to Listen_ , in which he adapts his methodology for close reading to the art of spoken conversation.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

The 1940 edition of _How to Read a Book_ was critically well-received; upon the book’s release, one reviewer called it, “a serious and valuable invitation to an enrichment of personal life.”

Reviews of the 1972 revised and updated edition, on the other hand, are much more mixed. A 1972 New York Times review particularly exemplifies this tension—the reviewer said he couldn’t decide “whether to praise it or damn it.” He concedes that _How to Read a Book_ fills an important gap in popular education (by teaching the reader how to get the most from a book) but also argues that the book is overly highbrow and ignores the quality of modern fiction. In the end, the reviewer recommends the book to those who are just beginning to read critically; however, he advises those who are already well-versed in the art of reading to “drop this book down the incinerator, throw it on the compost heap, get rid of it; then fumigate the premises and start reading as you please.”

Modern reviews of the 1972 edition are equally mixed—many praise the book for its unique approach to analytical reading but argue that it’s now thoroughly out of date and “boring.”

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Nearly every idea in _How to Read a Book_ is thoroughly fleshed out. Adler and Van Doren explain _what_ their techniques are, _why_ they’re important, and _how_ to use them. Thus, the authors meet their goal of helping the reader wring more understanding out of the books they read.

To a modern reader, it may seem as though the authors give undue attention to some points that aren’t critical to the main argument; this is likely because society has changed significantly in the decades since the book was published. For example, the authors analyze the strengths and weaknesses of speed-reading in depth because speed-reading was part of the intellectual zeitgeist of the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, speed-reading has fallen in popularity, so the argument has lost some cultural relevance.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_How to Read a Book_ is organized into four parts. Part One covers the mechanics of “elementary reading” and tips for “inspectional reading” (which is a form of in-depth skimming). Part Two covers “analytical reading,” which is the authors’ method of wringing as much understanding as possible out of a single book. Part Three offers specific advice for reading books of different genres (like philosophy, poetry, and science). Finally, Part Four covers “comparative reading,” which is the art of reading a wide variety of books on a single subject in order to fully understand that subject. The book ends with a recommended reading list.

This four-part structure is somewhat confusing because the four parts don’t directly map onto the four “levels of reading” that the authors reference throughout the book (with elementary reading and inspectional reading being compressed into one part), nor do they map onto the “four basic questions” that the authors claim a reader should ask about every book.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide to _How to Read a Book_ contains six parts. Part 1 covers the basics of what Adler and Van Doren believe constitutes “good reading.” Parts 2 to 4 describe the principles of elementary, inspectional, and analytical reading, in that order. Part 5 contains specific advice for reading different genres analytically, such as fiction, science, and philosophy. Finally, Part 6 describes comparative reading, which Adler and Van Doren argue is the highest form of reading. Throughout the guide, we’ll examine the authors’ advice through a 21st-century lens to see how well it applies to modern readers.
