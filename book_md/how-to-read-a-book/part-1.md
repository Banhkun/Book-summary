## Part 1: The Premise of How to Read

If you read a lot of books a year, then it makes sense to spend a few hours learning how to __ double the value from your reading. That’s the point of _How to Read a Book_.

According to the authors, after you learn phonics as a child and go through high school English, no one really _teaches_ you how to read _intelligently_. College courses rarely touch on this, and the workforce even less so. As a result, plenty of adults read at an elementary level—not in the sense of having a limited vocabulary, but in absorbing the value of a book efficiently. (Shortform note: This holds just as true today as it did in 1972. One study found that 43 million American adults have “low literacy skills.”)

### What Good Reading Is

While some consider reading to be passive in nature, Adler and Van Doren argue that **reading for the purpose of comprehension is an active pursuit.** This is a bit like the difference between merely _hearing_ someone’s words and _actively listening_ with the goal of comprehending what the words mean. If you read passively (without effort), you might register the surface level of what is said, but you won’t truly understand what the author is trying to say. (Shortform note: Studies show that reading for comprehension requires significant cognitive effort, but that this type of reading isn’t the most demanding—reading with the goal of revising the text requires even _more_ mental effort.)

The authors believe there are two types of active reading (note that this does not include reading for pure entertainment, which is a relatively passive pursuit in terms of cognitive effort):

  1. **Reading to collect facts.** The authors argue that if you understand the book completely without exerting any extra effort, then you have only gained _information_ from the book—you haven’t improved your _understanding_. You’ve simply added to your existing collection of facts on the subject. 
  2. **Reading for comprehension.** When you read for comprehension, the authors believe that you won’t glean all the meaning from the book on the very first try. Instead of just adding to your collection of facts on a subject, the book will challenge you to find new ways to think about those facts or relate them to one another. You’ll begin to think about not just what is the case, but _why_ it is the case. **This type of reading expands your understanding and increases your reading skills.**



However, we don’t live in a world that’s conducive to understanding.

  * The authors argue that most people are not taught how to read beyond elementary school. That is, **courses no longer teach how to learn more effectively by reading.** This book aims to bridge this gap. (Shortform note: This is no longer the case, at least in theory. As of 2021, 41 of the 50 United States had adopted the Common Core Standards, which require instruction in both analytical and comparative reading for students in the last two years of high school. However, in practice, it’s likely that some schools are better than others at implementing these core standards, and many high school graduates may still lack critical reading skills.)
  * Adler and Van Doren believe that today’s media is designed to require little deep comprehension. The data and viewpoints that we see in the media are designed to make the consumer agree with a preselected opinion. (Shortform note: Numerical data (such as percentages) might seem more objective, but that often isn’t the case. In _How to Lie With Statistics_ , author Darrell Huff describes the many ways people manipulate numbers to support whatever conclusion they want to make, like using bad sampling practices.)



The authors feel that **the best books challenge your reading ability and force you to grow as a reader**. They also believe that to be well-read is not to have read a large number of books, but to **have a high-quality understanding of _good_ books**. (Shortform note: There are many ways to define being “well-read.” The authors insist you can be well-read without being widely read, but they don’t attach limits to this idea. Can a reader have an intimate understanding of two great books and be considered well-read? Alternatively, would they use the term “well-read” to describe someone well-versed in the classics of just one genre, country, or subject?)

> **In 19th Century America, All Reading Was “Reading for Comprehension”**
> 
> As we noted earlier, the authors believe that “reading for comprehension” is a unique type of reading, distinct from reading for information. In _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ , author Neil Postman argues that classifying “reading for comprehension” as just one category of reading is a modern idea because, in the past, there were no alternatives: _All reading was for the purpose of comprehension_ because print was the most accessible medium for sharing ideas. In other words, reading was such a critical part of early American society that deeply understanding what you read was crucial.
> 
> How did “reading for comprehension” evolve into its own, separate task? Postman argues that two inventions changed the nature of reading in 19th century America, the first being the telegraph. The invention of the telegraph made it possible to communicate short bursts of information across great distances. Over time, the country evolved from a slow, print-centered intellectual culture to one that valued speed and quantity of information over relevance. Reading _The Federalist Papers_ and thoughtfully debating the contents with your family was out—glossing over eye-catching headlines of news from around the world was in.
> 
> The development of modern photography also contributed to this new hunger for information to be delivered in quick, easy-to-digest formats. Instead of slogging through a long book about life in another culture, you could glance at a photograph and immediately get a sense of another world, without all the mental effort of reading. Now, two centuries later, we spend our free time scrolling image-based social media platforms. For better or for worse, “reading for comprehension” has become an entirely separate activity that is no longer a requirement to participate in daily life.

### 4 Key Questions to Answer While You’re Reading

The authors assert that if you read for understanding, you will be able to answer four key questions about the book:

  * What is the overall message or theme of the book?
    * This should be a quick synopsis, not a detailed summary.
  * How does the author's argument unfold?
    * What are the main principles and supporting evidence?
  * Is the author's argument valid?
    * Provide evidence to support your opinions.
  * What are the implications?
    * If you agree with the author’s argument, how will you act on it? 



Ideally, the authors recommend you make a habit of asking these questions **as you read**. Doing this feels clunky at first, but you need to train each skill separately before doing it all subconsciously.

> **A Fifth Question: The Limits of a Good Idea**
> 
> As you read, you may also want to ask a crucial question _not_ posed by the authors: “What are the limits of the author’s good ideas? What would happen if _everyone_ followed this advice _all the time_?” It’s rare that an idea is applicable in all situations.
> 
> For example, in _Smarter Faster Better_ , author Charles Duhigg advocates for probabilistic thinking, a decision-making strategy that requires thinking up all the possible outcomes of a given choice and then calculating the likelihood of each of those outcomes. Duhigg argues that thinking probabilistically will increase the accuracy of your predictions and lead to more productive choices. However, if everyone thought probabilistically all the time, we’d lose the ability to be spontaneous or to respond instinctively to any situation. If we thought probabilistically about whether to slam on the brakes when a dog runs into the road, the extra thinking time could have terrible consequences. Therefore, Duhigg’s good idea clearly has a limit.
> 
> “Too much of a good thing” is a particular concern in self-help books. For example, in _The Game_ , author Neil Strauss presents tips on flirting with women from several self-proclaimed master pickup artists. However, many of these tips—like “negging” (insulting a woman with a backhanded compliment)—could easily escalate into abusive behavior. Thus, if you’re reading a book in the self-help or how-to genre, “what are the limits of this idea?” may be an especially important question to ask.

#### Techniques to Understand a Book

We’ll cover far more suggestions on how to read well later in this guide, but here are a few strategies Adler and Van Doren recommend, most of which relate to how you should mark up a book while reading:

  * Underline, highlight, or draw a symbol to mark major points.
  * Sketch out the author’s argument using numbers in the margins (for example, Point 1, Subpoint 2, Evidence 1, and so on). 
  * Refer to other pages in the margin.
  * Write questions in the margins next to confusing or unclear points.
  * After finishing the book, outline the content of the book.



(Shortform note: Adler believes so strongly in the importance of marking up books that he published a pamphlet called “How to Mark a Book'' in 1941, one year after publishing the first edition of _How to Read a Book_. In it, he offers a tip for taking notes on books if you’d rather not write directly on the pages: Write your notes on paper that is slightly smaller than the book pages (so the edges don’t stick out of the book), then store them in the book itself.)

### The Four Levels of Reading

Adler and Van Doren divide the act of reading into four levels, each increasing in difficulty and complexity. Here they are at a high level (we’ll discuss them in detail later in this guide):

  * Elementary
    * This is pure mechanical reading of text—translating written symbols into meaningful words.
    * Most of what you learned in school was elementary reading techniques.
  * Inspectional
    * This is a careful skimming of the book to understand its main points and its structure. 
    * Inspectional reading involves reading the table of contents, index, and key paragraphs of major chapters.
  * Analytical
    * This is the most thorough way to read and understand a single book. 
    * When reading analytically, once you understand what an author is saying, your job is to form an opinion on the validity of the work. 
  * “Syntopical” or Comparative
    * This aims to compare books and authors to one another in order to fully understand a single question or idea. (Shortform note: This is what Shortform’s expanded book guides do. We add commentary on each unique idea within a book that situates that idea within the wider universe of ideas.)



> **Other Ways to Divide Reading Levels**
> 
> The authors’ way of dividing reading skill into a leveled system isn’t the only way. For example, educators commonly use a three-level system to grade reading comprehension. In this system, Level 1 consists of what the authors would call “elementary” and “inspectional” reading. It’s the process of reading and understanding the literal words on the page. Level 2 is the beginning of what the authors would call “analytical” reading—readers begin to interpret the meaning of the text and answer “why?” questions about what they’ve read. The third and final level in this system, Level 3, also falls under analytical reading. At this level, readers form judgments about what they’ve read, decide whether they agree or disagree with the author, and evaluate the work’s impact on their own lives.
> 
> Similarly, there is another three-part leveling system that teachers sometimes use. In that system, Level 1 is still about the literal words on the page. Level 2, however, brings in what Adler and Van Doren would call “syntopical” reading, in which students begin making connections between what they’re reading, other books, and even their own life experiences. In Level 3, students refocus on the text at hand and begin looking for rhetorical devices (such as repetition and juxtaposition).

### On What Books to Read

According to the authors, the vast majority of books will not strain your ability to read analytically. They deliver information that fits your current framework, or they are meant to be read for entertainment.

Then, there is a smaller class of books that can give you more than entertainment or information—they can actually help you live a better life. These are the books that you can read analytically, be deeply impacted by, but not necessarily feel compelled to reread once you finish them. (Shortform note: Beware—not every book that purports to teach you how to live well actually does. Many self-improvement books become popular because they are easy to read and sound like good ideas, not because they can actually help you live a different or better life.)

There is a final, highest class of books, perhaps fewer than a hundred, that you can return to over and over again and get something new out of them each time. The authors believe **you should seek out these books, for they will teach you the most.**

To identify these books, the authors suggest you consider the desert island question—which 10 books would you take with you if you could never read any book ever again? These are unique to us all, and you should start with the classics that interest you the most.

> **Consider Great Books Outside the Western Male Canon**
> 
> As you read this guide, keep in mind that when Adler and Van Doren discuss “great books,” they’re referring exclusively to books in the Western canon. In an appendix, the authors acknowledge this and explain that they’ve chosen to stay within their own areas of expertise (this makes particular sense for Adler, who spearheaded the _Great Books of the Western World_ program and is, therefore, a respected gatekeeper of the Western canon). Therefore, their recommended reading list does not feature any writers from other parts of the world. The 137-author list also features just two women: Jane Austen and George Eliot.
> 
> The classics of the Western canon are timeless for a reason. However, for modern readers, reading solely within the Western canon means missing out on the chance to read authors with vastly different perspectives. To expand your literary horizons, consider reading classic works of world literature like Gabriel García Márquez’s _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ or Chinua Achebe’s _Things Fall Apart_. Additionally, you might wish to explore classic works written by women like Zora Neale Hurston’s _Their Eyes Were Watching God_ or Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein._
