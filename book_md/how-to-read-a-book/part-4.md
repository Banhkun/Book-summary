## Part 4: Analytical Reading

So far in this guide, we’ve covered elementary and inspectional reading. Now, we’ll cover analytical reading, which is much more in-depth than the previous levels. According to the authors, **the aim of analytical reading is to, without imposing any time restraints, gain the best understanding of the book possible.** Not only should you aim to understand what is being said, but you should also develop a personal opinion about its validity. (Shortform note: In addition to forming a judgment about the book’s validity, you might think about what parts of the book were most impactful and will stay with you over time.)

Adler and Van Doren argue this isn’t necessary for every book, and it would be a waste of time for lower-quality books. If your goal with a book is simply information or entertainment, then you don’t need to do as thorough of a job analyzing it.

The authors argue that analytical reading consists of four components:

  * Understand the author—her intentions, problems, and goals.
  * Understand the author’s logical arguments.
  * Use external resources, but only after you struggle through it yourself first.
  * After you understand a book, criticize a book from your own viewpoint, finding areas with which you agree and disagree.



We’ll explore each of these facets in more detail below.

(Shortform note: Analytical reading is an important skill with applications beyond the realm of literature: Customer service employees who are skilled in analytical reading are better able to read and respond to all of a customer’s questions or complaints, even the implicit ones. For example, if a customer says, “My printer isn’t working, can you fix it?”, a skilled analytical reader knows the customer is not only asking _if_ the company can fix her printer, but also _how much it will cost._)

### Understand the Author

Adler and Van Doren believe the first step of analytical reading is to understand the author’s goals in writing the book. This requires finding out what problems the author is trying to solve and what questions the book tries to answer. (Shortform note: This task is a bit more complicated for fiction works, as different readers can come away with different understandings of the author’s intent. We’ll learn some more concrete strategies for understanding fictional works in Part 5.)

According to the authors, different categories of books have different typical questions they try to answer. A theoretical book may question whether something is true while a practical book may ask, “What should we do about it?” (Shortform note: Some books may aim to answer both theoretical _and_ practical questions. For example, Ijeoma Oluo’s _So You Want to Talk About Race_ answers both, “Does systemic racism exist?” and “What should we do about it?”)

### Find What the Book Says

In the step above, you figured out what questions the author is trying to answer. Now, Adler and Van Doren argue you need to comprehend what the book is actually saying, and what arguments the author makes in relation to her questions. Well-written books make it easier for the reader to comprehend their arguments using signposts, such as keywords and important sentences. Let’s discuss each in detail.

#### Keywords

To find what the book says, Adler and Van Doren advise looking for keywords. Keywords are meaningful words or phrases that are used often and convey a wealth of information. As a reader, you need to understand the keywords of the author and what is meant by them. This is especially important because the same word can mean different things to different authors. (Shortform note: Be sure to look for keywords _early_ in the revision process, otherwise you may misunderstand the author’s arguments in the rest of the book. For example, in _A Brief History of Time_ , author and physicist Stephen Hawking uses the word “theory” in a very specific, scientific way, not in the colloquial sense as a simple synonym for the word “idea.” To really understand the rest of the book, it’s crucial to understand how Hawking defines that keyword.)

How do you find keywords? Adler and Van Doren provide two clues to identifying the most important terms in a book. First, a word is probably important if the author deliberately uses it differently than other writers do (particularly if the author makes a point to explain why those other writers’ definitions are incorrect or incomplete). Second, if you struggle to understand how an author is using a particular word, that’s a sign that the word is important: Authors frequently use keywords in unique ways to express their most important (and, often, most complex) ideas.

> **More Tips on How to Find Keywords**
> 
> The process of finding keywords in a text can differ based on the type of text and the way you approach it. For example, shorter works like articles often feature keywords in predefined places—such as the first sentence of the article, the last sentence of the first paragraph, and in any repeated phrase throughout the piece.
> 
> Additionally, if you already know something about what you’re reading, that can help you identify the keywords. For example, if you’re reading Darwin’s _The Origin of Species_ , you probably know that Darwin’s ideas were part of the theory of evolution, so you’ll know to keep an eye out for “evolution” as a keyword. You can also look for synonyms and related words or phrases, like “heredity” or “survival of the fittest.”

#### Most Important Sentences

After identifying keywords, Adler and Van Doren recommend finding the author’s leading propositions in her most important sentences. Important sentences express parts of the author’s argument. Here are some tips on how to find them:

  * Special sentences may be formatted stylistically or set apart (for example, with italics or underlining). 
  * The important words are often contained in the important sentences. Therefore, if you spot a keyword, pay special attention to the sentence it’s located in. 
  * Pay attention to words that confuse you, rather than words that grab your interest. (Shortform note: Remember, the goal of analytical reading is to increase your understanding. It’s perfectly fine to pause at a particularly interesting or entertaining sentence—but if your goal is to better understand the author’s ideas, your time is better spent wrestling with sentences you don’t immediately understand.)



> **Finding Key Sentences in the Digital Age**
> 
> In the modern era, there are other, high-tech ways of identifying important sentences that Adler and Van Doren couldn’t imagine in 1972. For example, computer programmers in the field of natural language processing have developed algorithms capable of reading digital text and automatically identifying key terms and sentences. The program is partly based on the frequency of a given word in a text, but it has to distinguish between common-but-not-useful words (like “and” or “the”) and the actual keywords of the text. Once the program identifies the keywords based on frequency, it scans every single sentence and highlights those sentences with higher proportions of keywords—which is essentially a computerized version of the process that Adler and Van Doren recommend.

##### Identifying Propositions

Adler and Van Doren also advise unpacking complicated sentences to find all the propositions the author is making. For example, in _The Body Keeps the Score_ , author and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk writes, “No matter how much insight and understanding we develop, the rational brain is basically impotent to talk the emotional brain out of its own reality.” We can break this sentence down into at least five propositions:

  1. Scientists have developed at least some understanding of this subject.
  2. There are two parts of the brain: the “rational brain” and the “emotional brain.”
  3. These two parts of the brain can be in conflict with one another, despite being part of the same physical organ.
  4. The rational brain may try to override the emotional brain.
  5. The rational brain cannot overpower or “turn off” the emotional brain when it is activated. 



(Shortform note: Not all sentences that appear complex will actually be critical parts of an author’s argument. In some cases, authors may use overly complex language to mask a weak point in their argument. As you read, you’ll need to distinguish between necessary complexity and fluff.)

According to the authors,**once you identify a proposition, you should rephrase it in the way most comfortable to you.** This is the best way to verify that you understand it. If you can’t restate the author’s idea in your own words, you may have just memorized the words you’ve read rather than truly understood the idea. This can lead to misunderstandings if you encounter the same argument, phrased differently, in another book—you may think you’re reading a brand new idea when you’re really reading another wording of an idea you’ve already read.

(Shortform note: To make sure your new understanding really sinks in, try writing down this restatement by hand rather than just thinking it through in your head or typing it on a keyboard. The physical act of writing things down on paper requires more brain connections than typing (as your brain is processing a more intense sensory experience as well as coordinating fine motor movements), and those extra connections aid your memory and understanding.)

This is especially helpful for comparative reading—different authors say the same thing in different words, and this will help you see how they agree and disagree. (Shortform note: One example of this is the way different authors discuss the racist idea that people of a certain race are genetically superior to people of another race. In _Biased_ , author Jennifer Eberhardt labels this idea “scientific racism”; in _How to Be an Antiracist_ , author Ibram X. Kendi calls the same idea “biological racism.” If you only think to search for one of these terms, you’d miss out on hearing the other author’s thoughts on this idea.)

#### Sequences of Sentences Form an Argument

According to Adler and Van Doren, until an author supports her principles with reasons, they are merely opinions. You must distinguish between genuine knowledge and mere opinion. (Shortform note: This isn’t always an easy task, especially in the era of “fake news,” in which both opinions and outright falsehoods are sometimes presented as fact. If you’re unsure whether an author is sharing genuine knowledge or merely her own opinion masked as objective fact, consider consulting independent fact-checking organizations, like FactCheck.org or Snopes.)

### How to Use External Resources

As much as possible, the authors believe **you should struggle with the book independently on a first pass**. This will help you see the book’s main arguments, rather than getting mired in minutiae like looking up words you don’t know. Therefore, your job is to first understand the book as well as you can without outside assistance. Once you’ve gotten as far as you can on your own, you can consult external resources to help you.

When you use an external resource, understand 1) what you hope to get from consulting it, and 2) the limitations of the resource. Here is how Adler and Van Doren recommend using external resources, and, where relevant, these sources’ limitations:

Dictionary

  * You can use a dictionary to look up words you don’t understand; however, remember that the author may use keywords in atypical ways, which is why you must understand terms from the context of the book.
  * Use a dictionary only for the most important words that are critical for understanding. 
  * (Shortform note: It can be difficult to determine whether a word is important enough to look up in the dictionary. One study suggests looking up words only if they’re used multiple times in the text (not just once) and/or if you’re unable to infer their meaning from context.) 



Encyclopedias

  * These contain facts and not arguments on subjective questions (“What makes man happy?”), other than what people have said about the subject. 
  * Use it to resolve disagreements about facts. 
  * (Shortform note: You may also find encyclopedias (and their online equivalents, like Wikipedia) useful for giving context around an issue or event. For example, if you’re reading Anne Frank’s _The Diary of a Young Girl_ , you may want to look up the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands for historical context.)



Summaries/abstracts

  * Use these to recover your knowledge about the book _after_ you’ve read it. Do not use these as a substitute for reading the book yourself; the authors believe you’ll develop a bad habit of using these as a crutch, and you’ll get lost understanding a book without a summary. Ideally, you’ve written your own summaries, and you can refer to them when you return to a book.
    * According to the authors, there is an exception to this rule: You should use summaries for comparative reading to know if a work will be relevant to your project.
  * Note that many summaries have incorrect interpretations or incomplete treatments.
  * (Shortform note: The value of a summary depends on your goal as a reader. If you want to understand a particular text in depth, you should read the whole book (multiple times, if necessary). However, if you’re deciding what to read next or simply looking to extract the major ideas from a variety of texts, summaries might be useful.)



Commentaries/reviews

  * Like summaries, Adler and Van Doren believe it’s best to avoid these until after your read-through. Otherwise, you’ll start the book biased and focus on things that support the commentary, rather than working to understand what the author is saying. 
  * (Shortform note: This is a form of confirmation bias, in which you unconsciously seek out evidence that confirms your existing beliefs and ignore evidence that contradicts those beliefs (or in this case, the beliefs of the commentator). To counteract this effect, try intentionally looking for information that _disproves_ your existing beliefs. _The Black Swan _author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls this technique “negative empiricism.”) 



> **When External Resources Are Internal**
> 
> In general, Adler and Van Doren recommend ignoring external resources until you’ve read the book all the way through and done your best to understand. However, some books make this task impossible because external resources are embedded into the text. For example, many modern editions of Shakespeare’s plays contain extensive notes, translations, and commentary either in footnotes or on the facing page of the text. This placement makes it almost for the reader to ignore this external information. The same phenomenon occurs in annotated versions of classic novels, which are increasingly popular.
> 
> Adler and Van Doren may not have anticipated the rise of annotated editions, as they make no mention of them in _How to Read a Book_. So how can a modern reader follow their advice?
> 
>   * If possible, find an unannotated edition of the book. This may be an older edition.
> 
>   * If only annotated editions are available, use a piece of scrap paper to cover the notes while you read. This will help reduce the visual distraction, but it may still take some willpower not to peek!

### How to Criticize a Book

So far in the reading process, if you’ve been following Adler and Van Doren’s advice, you’ve been absorbing what the author has to say without criticism or judgment. However, once you fully understand a book, you have a new responsibility as a reader: to argue with it.

According to Adler and Van Doren, when criticizing, your job is to **determine which of her questions the author has answered and which she has not, and to decide if the author knew she had failed to answer them**. (Shortform note: As you begin this process, you may also want to think about the subject as a whole and ask yourself: Are there any important ideas the author _didn’t_ mention? Did she leave anything out? If so, how would that missing information change your impression of her argument?)

#### Complete Your Understanding First

Much like having a conversation with an author, Adler and Van Doren contend that you need to give the author the chance to express herself fully before passing judgment. **If you interrupted the author at each sentence to say she’s wrong, you’re not having a conversation that can lead to learning.** Therefore, you must finish the other tasks above (outlining the book, defining main terms, understanding the main arguments) before criticizing. Otherwise, your criticism will be meaningless because you won’t be criticizing the author’s actual argument.

(Shortform note: You’ll need to use your own best judgment to decide if you fully understand the author’s arguments. However, if you’re new to the book’s subject, you should be especially cautious about deciding you understand because the less you know about a subject, the more likely you are to overestimate your understanding. This is the essence of the Dunning-Kruger effect.)

The knowledge to understand the author may be present in other works by the author. (Shortform note: Adler and Van Doren cite the example of ancient authors like Aristotle and Plato, but this may also be true of modern authors of multiple books. For example, to fully understand Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s _Antifragile_ , you need to understand the ideas in his earlier work, _The Black Swan._)

#### How to Criticize Well

In Adler and Van Doren’s view, criticizing a book means to comment, “I agree,” “I disagree,” or “I suspend judgment.”

When you’re criticizing an author, Adler and Van Doren caution against being overly contentious or combative. Remember that disagreement is an opportunity to learn something new. Here are some tips for keeping an open mind:

  * Do not play devil’s advocate by default. Don’t resent the author for being right or teaching you something new. (Shortform note: You may be especially tempted to resent the author when they challenge one of your political or religious beliefs. Studies have shown that these beliefs are the most resistant to change because they’re intimately tied up with how we see ourselves.) 
  * Only agree with the author if you’ve fully evaluated their work; don’t just assume the author is right because they’re smart. (Shortform note: This may be even harder (and thus even more important) for authors you respect and admire, as you might naturally evaluate those authors’ arguments less rigorously than authors with whom you disagree.)
  * Separate your emotional reaction to the book from your rational one.
  * As you read, earnestly try to take the author’s point of view.



> **Resolving Difficult Conversations With the Author**
> 
> Separating your emotional reaction to a book from your intellectual reaction and taking the author’s point of view isn’t always easy, especially if the author’s argument threatens an aspect of your life or your identity. In that situation, it may help to think of yourself as entering into a _difficult_ conversation with the author.
> 
> In _Difficult Conversations_ , authors Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen offer advice for navigating these types of conversations:
> 
>   * Remember that our individual experiences shape how we see the world. That means that whatever the author is saying probably isn’t meant as an attack on your principles or your identity; it’s a reflection of their own life experiences. Keeping this in mind can help you not take the author’s ideas personally.
> 
>   * Acknowledge and express the feelings that come up as you read—otherwise, they’ll fester and keep you from evaluating the book with a clear head.
> 
>   * Try out the “And Stance,” in which you acknowledge that several things can be true at once. For example, you might say, “This author has some good ideas, _and_ some of her views are deeply intolerant” or “I’m a good person, _and_ I’m guilty of the behavior this author is criticizing.” This allows you to see the bigger picture, not just the most difficult part.
>

According to Adler and Van Doren, when you agree or disagree, you must justify and provide evidence for your conclusion. Without doing so, you’re merely expressing opinions—you’re not providing a substantive rebuttal to the author’s argument. (Shortform note: When you criticize an author’s argument, make sure you’re responding to the argument itself, not the author as a person. Not doing so is the “ad hominem” fallacy, or attempting to invalidate someone’s argument by attacking their character. This is a fallacy because even people we dislike are fully capable of saying true things.)

Likewise, you should distinguish between the author’s knowledge (arguments backed by evidence) and the author’s opinions (not backed by evidence). Be aware of your own assumptions and remember that your opponent is allowed to assume too, even if her assumptions don’t match yours. If the author asks you to take something for granted, you should do so. (Shortform note: Doing this allows you to evaluate the author’s argument to see if the conclusion follows from the premises; however, it’s possible to craft a logical argument based on faulty assumptions. In this case, you might conclude, “Based on the author’s assumptions, her conclusion is true—however, her assumptions don’t reflect reality.”)

#### Categories of Disagreement

If you disagree with the author, your criticism must fit into a set of categories:

  * **Information**. You can critique the author on this basis if…
    * The author lacks important information (this can happen when an author ignores the relevant work of predecessors). 
    * The author’s information is wrong, outdated, or unsupported by outside evidence. 
      * The misinformation should be relevant to the argument—if an author gets an unrelated detail wrong, that shouldn’t derail your opinion of her overall argument. 
  * **Logic.** You can critique the author based on logic if her argument contains a logical fallacy. Adler and Van Doren assert that this category is uncommon among great books, which are “great” in part because their logic holds up so well. 
  * **Completeness.** You can critique the author’s completeness if you feel she hasn’t fully addressed every important component of her argument or fully analyzed the issue at hand. 



According to Adler and Van Doren, if you can’t criticize the author’s information, logic, or completeness, then you must agree with the author’s conclusions.

> **Additional Categories of Disagreement**
> 
> While Adler and Van Doren believe these four categories encompass _all_ valid sources of disagreement with an author, there may be others: for example, moral disagreement. It’s possible to disagree on moral grounds with an author who is fully and accurately informed and makes a complete, logical argument. For example, an author who advocates for eugenics may have a logically sound argument, but a reader who believes that all human life is equally valuable can still disagree with the author’s conclusions.
> 
> Additionally, Adler and Van Doren’s categories assume that if part of the author’s argument is false, the author must be uninformed or misinformed. This takes the author in good faith and ignores the possibility that the author has more nefarious reasons for asserting something that is not true (for example, to increase personal profit). While this may not be a concern in the great books, it’s something modern readers may encounter in an increasingly partisan world. Adler and Van Doren’s four categories leave no room to disagree with an author who is willfully misleading the reader.
