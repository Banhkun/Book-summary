## Exercise: Practice Analytical Reading

According to the authors, most of us don’t learn analytical reading in school, so this may be a brand new skill. Let’s practice it now.

* * *

Think of the last nonfiction book you read. In one or two sentences, describe what the book was about.

What was the author’s main argument? How did she support it?

Did you agree with the author’s conclusion? Why or why not? (Remember, to criticize an author well, you need to provide evidence for your views.)

What will you take away from the experience of reading the book? Were you inspired to make any changes in your life or your views? Why or why not?
