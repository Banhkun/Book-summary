## Exercise: Explore Your Experiences Working on Projects

Explore your experiences working on projects, and reflect on how you might improve such experiences in the future.

* * *

Think of a time when you worked closely with someone you didn’t know very well. How do you think this affected your ability to work effectively with them? If you got to know this person better, did your effectiveness improve? How so?

Think of a time when a project you were working on fell behind schedule. Why do you think it fell behind schedule? Was it due to overly optimistic deadlines, poor communication, or something else? What could have been done to keep the project on track?

Think of a boss or manager of a project you worked on who didn’t handle a major challenge well. What made them unable to deal with the challenge effectively? What could they have done differently to better adapt to a difficult situation?
