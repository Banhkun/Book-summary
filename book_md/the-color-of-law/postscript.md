## Postscript: Frequently Asked Questions

In the ten years Rothstein researched _de jure_ racial residential segregation, he unsurprisingly encountered a number of questions about his findings. In the book’s final chapter, he addresses some of these questions.

#### Question #1: The public officials who pursued segregation were men of their time; isn’t it unfair to judge their behavior by present-day mores?

This question ignores the many voices, belonging to both whites and African Americans, **decrying segregation when it was most entrenched.** For example, in 1914, after Woodrow Wilson began segregating federal offices, Christian leaders condemned the move. Later, officials in FDR’s administration like Harold Ickes and Frances Perkins desegregated their departments’ cafeterias, and Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of the president, was the first white person to join the Washington, D.C., chapter of the NAACP. During WWII, while the Boilermakers union excluded African Americans,**the United Auto Workers accepted them.**

The fact that there were dissenting voices at the time belies the claim that segregation was just “the way of the world” during the early and mid-twentieth century. And so, when we judge public officials who promoted segregation now, **we’re not doing so according to “present-day” attitudes but rather principles that existed _while_ segregation was being pursued**. However, in the end, the general attitudes of the public in the early-to-mid twentieth century is immaterial:**Segregation violated African Americans’ constitutional rights.**

#### Question #2: What can I do if I discover the deed to my home has a restrictive covenant and I want it removed?

The short answer is that**it depends on your state:** Some states make it difficult and/or expensive to strike clauses from deeds.

That said, the best option might not be to strike the clause from the deed but to amend the deed to recognize both**the educational value and moral repugnancy of the clause.** For example, you might include language that acknowledges the clause is unenforceable but, nevertheless, disavows it as a remnant of a shameful period in American history.

#### Question #3: When my family immigrated to America, I wasn’t even born, and segregation was already in force. Why should I sacrifice to repair the damage it did?

You should do so for the same reason you celebrate Independence Day—that is, as American citizens, we accept the benefits of sacrifices we did not make (for example, in the Revolutionary War) and the responsibility to correct wrongs we did not commit.

#### Question #4: I’m an African American, and I’m perfectly happy living among other African Americans. Why are you trying to force African Americans to live in integrated communities?

The idea isn’t to _force_ integration but rather to _incentivize_ it. And the way one does this is by not only providing financial support **but also making predominantly white communities more welcoming to African American residents.**

A major reason African American families decline to move to white areas is increased discrimination: Police in these areas are prone to stop African Americans more frequently than whites, and **schools are more likely to punish Black children than white ones for minor infractions**. School and police reform is essential to the larger project of nationwide integration.

However, to achieve a truly integrated society, African Americans must also take some risks. That is, some Black families will have to be pioneers, integrating white neighborhoods with the support of public policy.

#### Question #5: If, as studies show, diversity yields positive outcomes, why present the need to integrate as a “responsibility” or “obligation.” Isn’t it really an opportunity?

Integration does indeed confer benefits on African Americans and whites alike,**but it would be a mistake to conceive of it as a “win-win” without cost.**

For example, residents of predominantly white, middle-class areas should be prepared for a rise in petty crime as low-income African American families are funded to move in. These residents should also be prepared for the possibility that their property will decline in value (due to the enduring legacy of redlining, blockbusting, and white flight).

Financial sacrifices will also be necessary. Taxes will likely go up to fund more generous housing vouchers and developer incentives. Schools will need to hire more special-education teachers to bring new arrivals from under-resourced schools up to speed.

Simply put, **historical racial residential segregation is too complex and significant an injustice** to be remedied without a **greater sacrifice on the part of the privileged.**

#### Question #6: Why did nominally “liberal” officials like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman perpetuate segregation?

It’s true that these politicians, who enacted some of the most progressive policies in US history, also entrenched racial residential segregation. The reason was twofold: Political expediency and, at the very least, a tolerance for bigotry.

For example, in the mid-twentieth century, **southerners committed to white supremacy were still a major faction in the Democratic party.** To appease this faction, Roosevelt and Truman had to include racial exclusions in their policies.

Roosevelt and Truman also tolerated racism among their staff. For instance, Roosevelt twice ran for president with John Nance Garner, a segregationist from Texas, as his vice president.

Some of this bigotry was a product of the homogeneousness of the mid-century political elite. At the time,**leaders were almost exclusively male, white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.** These “WASPs” often had little concern for members of other races and ethnicities.

#### Question #7: Isn’t the degradation of African American neighborhoods a product of African American choices? In other words, don’t African Americans have to take more responsibility both for their struggles and their success?

The idea that African Americans don’t strive for success—or simply _choose_ antisocial or criminal behaviors like drug dealing rather than legal employment—isn’t born out by the facts.**It also elides the obstacles arrayed against African Americans due to discrimination**.

_First_ , despite some pejorative stereotypes, African Americans succeed academically. In 2014, 21% of African American men and 24% of African American women between the ages of 25–29 were college graduates, and 90% had finished high school.

_Second_ , many ambitious Black men are permanently disadvantaged both economically and socially by having criminal records—records that, in many cases, they didn’t deserve in the first place. For example, although young Black men are **statistically less likely to use or sell drugs than their white counterparts, they’re _more_ likely to be arrested, sentenced, and jailed for those activities** (Shortform note: For more information on the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans, read Shortform’s summary of _The New Jim Crow_). In Ferguson, Missouri, police stopped Black motorists far more frequently than white ones, **yet found illegal drugs on white drivers more often than Black ones.**

Despite the American notion that anyone can rejoin our community after having “paid their debt to society,” released prisoners typically exist as a permanent underclass. For example, many formerly incarcerated people are not only**discriminated against in the private labor market, but they’re also deprived of the right to vote, live in public housing, and access food stamps**. Because African Americans make up a disproportionate number of the formerly incarcerated, they feel these effects disproportionately as well.

_Third_ , the difficulties of African American children and teens are often due to health factors beyond their control. For example, due to the second-order repercussions of segregation—overcrowding, dilapidated housing stock, poor maintenance, and nonexistent services—many Black children have suffered irreparable brain damage from lead poisoning. **Studies have found lead levels can predict risky behaviors among teenagers and violent or criminal behavior among young adults.**

#### Question #8: Can’t the blame for African Americans’ confinement to ghettos be laid at single mothers’ feet? Shouldn’t we concentrate on teaching Black single mothers to raise their children better?

Historically, it was**working- and middle-class two-parent Black families that were discriminated against** due to _de jure_ segregation. But even now, the greater incidence of single motherhood among African American women can be attributed to the relative lack of marriageable partners. The mechanism for this lack is twofold:

  * _First_ , an aspect of racial bigotry is that while Black men marry non-Black women at a rate of 24%, Black women marry non-Black men at a rate of only 9%. That is to say, because heterosexual African American women are largely limited to African American partners due to prejudice, **the pool of possible partners is smaller**.
  * _Second_ , due to disproportionate incarceration and unemployment rates among African American men, the pool that _is_ available to African American women is often infeasible. **Marriage is both a romantic and an economic institution** —one study found that 78% of never-married women desired a partner with a steady job above all else—and, due to legacies of segregation like criminality and joblessness, there’s little incentive for African American women to marry.



Whereas single white mothers often have the advantage of their historical privilege, which places them in a position to afford child care and other kinds of assistance, Black women don’t have the same options. **It would be cruel to slow-walk integration because of African American women’s parenting skills,** when society offers them no support.

#### Question #9: Why only focus on African Americans? Aren’t members of other races and ethnicities confined to segregated neighborhoods as well?

They are, but _The Color of Law_ is concerned with exposing the _de jure_ racial residential segregation of African Americans. The latter-day segregation of Hispanic, Asian, and other communities, for the most part, **isn’t the product of an explicit governmental policy but rather narrow economic opportunity and meager social support.** That is, the neighborhoods that tend to become identified with one or another underrepresented race or ethnicity have inexpensive housing that can accommodate recent unskilled immigrants.

That said, **Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Puerto Ricans _have_ endured _de jure_ segregation (for example, in Texas), and Jews, the Irish, and others were targets of restrictive covenants**. However, these injustices were never as widespread, total, or long-lasting as the discrimination against African Americans. For example, Mexicans were often considered “caucasian” for the purposes of restrictive covenants.

#### Question #10: Isn’t compulsory desegregation a type of “social engineering”? Aren’t there all kinds of risks associated with government-mandated changes like these?

This question fails to acknowledge that the **US’s _de jure_ segregation of African Americans in the twentieth century was _also_ a form of social engineering**—one that met (and meets) with precious few objections. While there may be risks to policies that further integration, the righting of a profound and unconstitutional wrong takes precedence.

#### Question #11: What about gentrification? Isn’t the influx of relatively affluent whites in predominantly African American neighborhoods leaving low-income families with nowhere else to go?

Indeed, gentrification can cause great hardship for the low-income families displaced. The solution is to**reform zoning ordinances in both urban and suburban areas to ensure an adequate amount of low-income housing.** That way, as areas gentrify and property values rise, low-income families can remain to enjoy the economic and social benefits of integration or find an affordable place to live in another area.

#### Question #12: Is the redress of racial residential segregation a form of reparations?

Although Rothstein prefers the term “remedies” to reparations—simply because, to his ear, “reparations” connotes a one-time cash transfer rather than a suite of national policies—he has no objection to his proposals being called reparations.**As long as the objective is the undoing of racial residential segregation and making African Americans whole,** he isn’t concerned with the terminology.

#### Question #13: Won’t the Supreme Court overrule any attempt to compel—or even incentivize—integration?

Whatever its ideological makeup, the Supreme Court often tracks the general consensus. If it’s accepted among a large portion of the populace that _de jure_ segregation is a fact that needs to be remedied—**and this acceptance is indicated by the election of officials who support remedies** —then the Supreme Court would, potentially, let broad legislative action stand.

Section 2 of the 13th Amendment empowers Congress to abolish the “badges and incidents of slavery.” Few ramifications of slavery have been as harmful as racial residential segregation.
