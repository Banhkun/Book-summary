## Chapter 3: How the Federal Government Worsened Residential Segregation

The shortcoming of economic zoning—at least as far as segregationists were concerned—was that it was race-blind: Although many African American families were too poor to own single-family homes, not all were, and so **if a Black family could afford to buy a single-family home, they could live in an economically zoned area**.

Two policy objectives pursued by the federal government in the middle of the 20th century furthered the cause of segregation. Through agencies like the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the government (1) encouraged and financed the movement of white families out of urban centers and into suburban tracts and (2) withheld that support from African Americans, thereby consigning them to those urban centers.

### The Rise of the Suburbs

The origins of the government’s discriminatory interventions in the private housing market can be found in the early twentieth century. Elected officials, wary of the communist takeover in Russia, theorized that the **wider ownership of property would act as a bulwark against communism** (because the more people who owned property, the more people who would be committed to the capitalist system that _allowed_ for private property).

The type of property officials favored was homes. In 1917, the Department of Labor inaugurated the “Own-Your-Own-Home” campaign, which, through mass marketing, **pressured renters to purchase homes as a “patriotic duty.”**

This initiative was supplemented by the Better Homes in American organization. Nominally private, but headed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and guided by the Department of Labor, this organization praised **homeownership as a mechanism for avoiding racial tension**. That is, **white families could avoid conflict with Black families by moving from integrated urban neighborhoods to single-family homes in suburbs.**

A seminal moment in the federal government’s promotion of homeownership was the President’s Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. Convened by Hoover in the middle of the depression, the conference**featured numerous racial dog whistles**. For example, one member of the committee on financing homeownership recommended deed restrictions to prohibit “incompatible ownership occupancy”—**a euphemism for African American buyers.** Other committee members were architects of segregated neighborhoods in Atlanta and St. Louis.

### How the New Deal Excluded Black Americans

However, Hoover’s efforts to promote homeownership were ultimately no match for the Depression, and when Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office, homeownership remained out of reach for most working- and middle-class families; even families who already owned their homes were having trouble making their mortgage payments.

Roosevelt responded to these challenges by creating two agencies, the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). As a rule, **both agencies systematically discriminated against Black Americans**.

#### The Home Owners Loan Corporation

Designed to keep current homeowners in their homes, the HOLC bought mortgages in danger of default and reissued them to the holder with more generous terms. For example, in the ’30s, most mortgages required 50% down payments, and borrowers could only pay off interest, not principle, until the mortgage came due after 5–7 years. The HOLC, however, offered borrowers 15-year terms and amortized payment plans (amortized payments include part of the principle as well as interest).**This meant owners could gain equity in their homes even as they paid off their loans**.

Although the HOLC’s mission was altruistic, **it still expected its beneficiaries to make the payments to which they were obligated.** So, to assess the risk of particular borrowers, the agency hired local real estate agents to appraise properties and neighborhoods. These real estate agents, bound by a segregationist code of ethics that assumed African American residents equaled lower property values and so higher risk of default, produced color-coded maps of metropolitan areas for the government to use as a guide for evaluating homes. **The agents used red for neighborhoods with any African American residents—no matter how well off—and green for all-white neighborhoods,** a practice that would come to be known as “redlining.” Residents in green neighborhoods had an easier time securing loans and thus were able to cement the monoracial—that is, white—makeup of those neighborhoods.

One representative example of redlining took place in St. Louis. In 1940, an appraiser colored Ladue, a suburb of the city, green, because no foreigners or African Americans lived there. Lincoln Terrace, a suburb with comparable housing stock and equally middle-class residents, was colored red—**because it was predominantly African American.**

#### The Federal Housing Administration

Although the HOLC did occasionally assist homeowners in redlined tracts, the redlined maps set a standard in the government—**that certain neighborhoods were undesirable or problematic simply because they contained African Americans.**

This standard was especially destructive when it came to the Federal Housing Administration (or “FHA”), whose mission was to increase homeownership by insuring new bank mortgages and facilitating more favorable terms (20% down; 20-year, amortized payment periods).

Like the HOLC, the FHA performed appraisals on the properties whose mortgages a bank wanted to insure. In 1935, the FHA issued its first manual to its appraisers; the manual explicitly referred to **integration as leading to “instability” and a “reduction in values.”** It also said that properties in neighborhoods that **excluded “inharmonious” racial and ethnic groups** **should receive high ratings** , thus increasing the likelihood homes in that neighborhood would be insured. The manual favored suburbs over urban areas, and it singled out integrated schools as a sign of lending risk. Subsequent editions of the manual, right up until 1952—i.e., throughout and after World War II—maintained similar guidelines.

The effects of this racialized policy were significant. For one, it prevented Black families from moving to the suburbs, where many white families were relocating. For example, in 1941, a real estate agent in New Jersey tried to sell twelve homes in a development called Fanwood to African American families. All the families had good credit, and local banks were willing to finance their purchase if the FHA would insure the mortgages. But the FHA declined, **writing that no loans would be given to “colored developments.”** Today, Fanwood’s African American population is about 5% while the county in which it’s located is 25% Black.

### Levittown and the Segregation of Subdivisions

In accounts of racial residential segregation, the discrimination against individual homeowners—by agencies like the HOLC and FHA—gets most of the attention. But another, arguably more pernicious, strategy of segregation was**federal agencies’ subsidization of white-only developments**.

The process went like this: A developer would submit plans for a subdivision to the FHA. Included in these plans would be descriptions of the construction materials, zoning restrictions, and other specifications; but, most importantly,**they would include commitments not to sell to African Americans**. Once the FHA approved the plans, developers could secure financing from private banks with relative ease, because these banks knew that the mortgages they would eventually issue would be insured.

Levittown, the massive subdivision built for WWII veterans on Long Island, New York, provides a clear example of this policy (though similar examples can be found elsewhere, including in Oak Forest in Houston, Texas, and Prairie Village, in Kansas City). Although African American workers helped _build_ Levittown, they were ineligible to own homes there. One African American veteran, **whose family’s business trucked building materials into Levittown** , tried to purchase a home there and was refused. He ended up having to take out an uninsured mortgage in a predominantly Black area nearby.

(The FHA was so instrumental in the building of Levitt’s subdivisions that in 1960, a New Jersey court deemed his project in that state **public housing** —and so constitutionally obligated to accept buyers of any race.)

Simply put, much of the racial residential segregation in the US today is **the result of a collaboration between public and private entities** in the middle of the 20th century. A 1973 report from the US Commission on Civil Rights concluded as much, finding that “government and private industry came together to create a system of residential segregation.”
