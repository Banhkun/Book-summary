## Chapter 5: How the IRS and Regulatory Agencies Furthered Segregation

Government’s contribution to racial residential segregation didn’t end with federal and local housing programs or the FHA. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as an array of regulator agencies, also exacerbated segregation **by neglecting their constitutional obligations not to promote prejudice or discrimination.**

### The Role of the IRS in Racial Residential Segregation

The IRS contributed to racial residential segregation by failing to follow its own rules against promoting discrimination. One important area in which it did this was in the determination of tax-exempt status for US entities. IRS rules obligate the agency to **withhold tax exemptions** from organizations that countermand official public policy or promote prejudice and discrimination. Yet, throughout the middle of the 20th century, the**IRS regularly conferred tax-exempt status on entities that contributed to racial residential segregation.**

For instance, tax-exempt religious entities like **churches and synagogues regularly promoted segregationist policies**. In the 1940s, priests in North Philadelphia, Buffalo, New York, and Los Angeles spearheaded efforts to keep African Americans from moving into their predominantly white parishes. In LA, the pastor of the Wilshire Presbyterian Church**even personally sued a Black war veteran to keep him from moving into the neighborhood.** Yet his church’s tax-exemption was never in danger.

Religious organizations weren’t the only tax-exempt parties pushing segregation—colleges and universities were guilty of the practice as well. For example, on the South Side of Chicago, the University of Chicago subsidized local property owners so that they could keep the area segregated. From 1933 to 1947, **the University covered $100,000 in legal fees for the defense of restrictive covenants and the eviction of recently arrived African Americans.**

### How Regulators Enabled Segregation

**As with the IRS, a number of regulatory agencies also contributed to segregation** , especially in the banking sector. Throughout the middle of the previous century, government regulators frequently allowed the firms over which they had oversight to discriminate against African Americans and further racial residential segregation.

One example of this tacit support of segregation concerns private banks. An array of entities and agencies—the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and others—regulate and support private financial institutions. These public entities _could_ have withheld support or otherwise reprimanded institutions that were discriminating against African American consumers. **But they didn’t**.

For example, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which chartered and insured savings and loan associations from the inception of the New Deal, **did not oppose financial institutions denying mortgages to African Americans**(that is, until 1961, when the US Commission on Civil Rights elicited a promise from the agency to stop its discriminatory behavior). Other important agencies like the Treasury Department and FDIC also took a hands-off approach, arguing that banks were making _economic_ rather than racial decisions, and so they were powerless to intervene.

The upshot was _de jure_ racial segregation at one remove:**Public entities constitutionally bound to promote civil rights among private institutions systematically failed to do so.**

#### Racial Residential Segregation and the 2008 Financial Crisis

US regulators’ enablement of racial residential segregation didn’t end with the civil rights battles of the 50s and 60s. In fact, by failing to police the predatory and discriminatory lending practices of mortgage providers in the early 2000s—practices that would eventually lead to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession—**regulatory agencies tacitly consigned many Black borrowers to default and entrenchment in ghettos**.

The story begins with so-called “subprime” mortgages—loans designed for low-income borrowers that featured exploitative features like misleadingly low initial interest rates, high late-payment penalties, and unethical financial incentives for brokers. Although subprime mortgages were designed for borrowers who met certain financial criteria**, they ended up being sold to African Americans at much higher rates** than white purchasers.

For example, among borrowers who refinanced in 2000, low-income African Americans were twice as likely to have subprime loans as white Americans, and higher-income African Americans were three times as likely to have subprime mortgages as whites. By 2006, whether they qualified for more conventional loans or not, **African American mortgagors in general were three times as likely to have subprime mortgages.**

The agency responsible for regulating predatory lending was the Federal Reserve. Although a 2005 survey **conducted by the Federal Reserve itself confirmed that predatory lenders were targeting African Americans** , the agency did nothing to stop the practice. It was only in 2010, after the economy had collapsed and oversight of mortgage lenders had transferred to a different agency, that the Federal Reserve’s neglect came to light.

In the aftermath of the crisis, which resulted in a tsunami of mortgage defaults and foreclosures, some severely affected cities sued banks that had sold subprime mortgages. In one such suit, brought by the city of Memphis against Wells Fargo, affidavits from bank officials showed that**subprime mortgages were colloquially referred to as “ghetto loans.”**

The effect of the financial crisis on Black families has been significant. Those who lost a house have had to move in with friends or relatives, creating greater crowding in already-overcrowded neighborhoods. Having a default and foreclosure on a credit report makes purchasing a new home even more difficult. **And banks are selling foreclosed properties at inflated prices and with punitive terms** , echoing the exploitation of not only subprime loans but also the “contract buying” of houses in the 1950s.

In short, the upshot of the crisis has been (1) the greater concentration of African Americans in low-income neighborhoods and (2) a reduction in means to escape those neighborhoods.
