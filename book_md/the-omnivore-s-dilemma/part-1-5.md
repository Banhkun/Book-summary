## Part 1-5: Consumers of Corn

We are what we eat, which for Americans is mostly processed corn.

This can actually be quantified. A scientist can tell which type of plant — corn, wheat, soy — created a given carbon atom in a human bone, and can therefore determine the composition of a person’s diet by their remains. Carbon atoms created by corn are different, and their presence indicates how much corn was in a person’s diet.

Americans eat more wheat than corn outright — 114 pounds wheat flour a year, versus 11 pounds of corn flour. But Americans, compared to Mexicans, have diets much higher in corn, because of all the processed corn we eat in various forms. (Mexicans eat grass-fed as opposed to corn-fed beef, and use cane sugar instead of corn syrup as a sweetener.)

### Fattened by Corn

Our consumption of so much corn in unhealthy forms, especially high-fructose corn syrup, has helped create an epidemic of obesity in the U.S.

There are striking parallels between our obesity problem and **the epidemic of alcoholism in 19th century America. The latter was also driven by excess corn, which was turned into cheap corn whiskey.**

In the early 19 century American farmers, especially in the fertile Appalachians, were producing too much corn. Transporting it over the mountains to sell more widely was difficult and expensive. Like today, the way to use up the surplus of cheap corn was to process it. They distilled it into alcohol, and corn in this value-added form was easier to transport.

Americans began drinking more than they had before or have since. This created the public health epidemic of its day. The typical American drank more than a half-pint of corn whiskey a day (five gallons of spirits a year, compared to less than one today). **The coffee break began as a late-morning whiskey break**.

The overconsumption resulted in public drunkenness, violence, family breakups, and alcohol-related diseases. Several of the nation’s founders, including George Washington, decried America’s transformation into “The Alcoholic Republic.”

**The Alcoholic Republic has been replaced today to The Fat Republic.** We’re eating excessively today, as we drank then, for some of the same reasons.

Obesity has become our greatest public health problem:

  * **Three in five Americans are overweight** ; one in five is obese. **Children have a one in three chance of developing diabetes.**
  * As a result, today’s children may be the first generation of Americans whose life expectancy is shorter than that of their parents.
  * Obesity also is spreading globally, with “overnutrition” surpassing malnutrition.



**Since 1977, an American’s average daily consumption of calories has jumped 10 percent.** The additional calories came from the farm.

**Rising obesity rates started in the 1970s with the advent of the cheap-food farm policy** and the elimination of programs to stem overproduction. Since the Nixon administration, farmers have produced 500 additional calories per person per day — up from 3,300, which was already much more than we need.

Today’s parallels with the Alcoholic Republic are:

  * A health problem starts with a mountain of cheap corn.
  * To get rid of it, corn is processed into a more profitable, higher-calorie product.



### A Supersized Epidemic

Corn sweetener or high-fructose corn syrup is to the obesity epidemic what corn whiskey was to the Alcoholic Republic.

**High-fructose corn syrup is in many processed foods** (including ketchup, breads, hot dogs, and hams)**, but we consume the most in soft drinks**. It first became an ingredient replacing sugar in Coca-Cola in 1980, followed by Pepsi.

**High-fructose corn syrup is cheaper than sugar** , but rather than cutting consumer prices, soft drink companies began upsizing the bottle and increasing the price.

**The concept of supersizing** , applied to fast food as well, **dramatically increased sales**. It was invented by David Wallerstein, who served on the board of McDonald’s. In the fifties and sixties while working in the theater industry, he had discovered that movie-goers would eat more popcorn and drink more soda in larger containers. Later he convinced McDonald’s to supersize its fries and burgers to sell more.

**The problem with supersizing is that people don’t stop eating supersized portions when they feel full,** researchers found. They eat up to 30 percent more than they would otherwise.

This behavior made sense in the hunter-gatherer era. **Our ancestors feasted whenever they could, to build fat reserves to last through future food shortages.** Obesity researchers call this the thrifty gene.**** It’s useful when food is scarce or unpredictable, but harmful when food is always available.

Because we have a biologically driven preference for energy-dense foods, the added sugar in our food today make matters worse (anything with sugar or fat in it tastes better). In effect, **food scientists are pushing our evolutionary buttons to get us to buy and consume more.**

Sugars and starches turn to glucose. Consuming too much can wear out the body’s system for managing glucose — and then we get Type II diabetes.

Contributing to the problem:**since the 1970s the price per calorie of sugar or fat has plunged, making energy-dense foods cheap as well as neurobiologically appealing**. For instance, a dollar can buy 1,200 calories of potato chips or 875 of soda, versus only 250 calories of carrots. **The government subsidizes high-fructose corn syrup but not carrots.**

The obesity epidemic will only get worse, regardless of warnings from the surgeon general, as long as the president signs farm bills to keep the corn coming — supplying Americans with a surfeit of cheap, unhealthy calories.

### An Industrial Food Chain Meal

The industrial food chain meal consumed for this book began with corn grown on an Iowa farm. At the opposite end of the food chain,**** it was prepared by McDonald’s and eaten in a car by the author, his wife, and son.

The meal consisted of:

  * Cobb salad
  * Classic cheeseburger, large Coke and large fries (32 oz, only 30 cents more than the “small” size of 16 ounces)
  * Chicken McNuggets, a double-thick vanilla shake, large fries, dessert of freeze-dried pellets of ice cream



The cost was $14 total for three people, and it was ready in four minutes. I**t was derived from an estimated six pounds of corn** , totaled 4,510 calories, and was eaten in under 10 minutes.

#### Corn was The Chief Ingredient

For instance,**13 of 38 ingredients in a chicken nugget are derived from corn, starting with the corn-fed chicken**. It also contains completely synthetic ingredients from petroleum or chemicals (a preservative used is derived from butane).

The author had the meal analyzed for corn content via mass spectrometer, which verified corn’s central place in fast food:

  * Sodas: 100 percent corn
  * Milk shake: 78
  * Salad dressing: 65
  * Chicken nuggets: 56
  * Cheeseburger: 52
  * French fries: 23



#### Fast Food Life

Convenience was a central feature of the fast-food meal, and is a key selling point of all fast food (19 percent of American meals are eaten in a car). The chicken nugget is convenient, waste-free, needs no plate or utensils, can be eaten with one hand, and is automobile-friendly (salads are still a challenge).

**Fast-food started out as an occasional treat, but today one in three children eat fast food every day**.

It has a unique flavor and fragrance unlike that of burgers, chicken nuggets, or fries made at home. **Fast foods have been processed to such an extent that they seem like products of our culture rather than of nature.**

**Fast food is becoming a comfort food** with its burst of carbs and fat, which relieves stress and releases feel-good brain chemicals.

In a sense, we’re turning into specialized eaters of corn, to the detriment of our health, environment, and farming heritage.
