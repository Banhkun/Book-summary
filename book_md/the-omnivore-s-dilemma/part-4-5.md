## Part 4-5: The Perfect Meal

**Pollan’s hunter-gatherer food chain meal was the “perfect” meal** because it fully answered the question of where the food came from. It met the following criteria:

  * Everything was hunted, gathered, or grown by him.
  * The meal included something from each edible kingdom: animal, plant, fungi
  * Everything was in season and fresh.
  * No money was spent to purchase food.



The ingredients for the meal, which required considerable preparation, were:

  * Fava bean toast (beans from garden, garlic, sourdough bread from “wild” yeast and organic flour)
  * Paté from pig liver
  * Sauteed morels over egg fettuccine
  * Wild pork: braised leg, and grilled loin
  * Bread with wild yeast (spores collected from outside air)
  * Salad from his garden
  * Cherries for a dessert (foraged from a neighborhood tree)



Preparing and consuming the meal became a way of giving thanks to nature, of saying grace. The author told guests the story of each item, which could be done because **the food chain was transparent and short.** Also, the meal connected its eaters to Northern California’s nature and culture.

Nothing had a barcode or price tag, although Pollan knew firsthand the true cost. **Its creation didn’t diminish nature** because nature could replace each item****(in contrast to the debts we incur when eating industrially, without thinking).

When you compare the foraged meal with the McDonald’s meal:

  * The foraged meal was based on knowledge, the industrial meal on ignorance.
  * The foraged meal mirrored the diversity of nature, the other was based on corn, a single species.
  * The foraged meal wasn’t easy to acquire, but the price was acknowledged and paid; the industrial meal was seemingly cheap and convenient, but incurred costs to the planet, public health, and the future.
  * The foraged meal and the industrial meal represent different ways of using nature’s resources.



**In the past, eating took place in the context of family and culture, where everyone knew what was involved.** Because of the way our food is produced and consumed today, we have mostly lost this context.

Although it is impossible to depend on a hunter-gatherer food chain for our meals today, we can become more active participants in our food production: **We should ask what we’re eating, where it came from, how it got to our table, and what its true cost is.**
