## Introduction: What Should We Eat?

What should we have for dinner?

_The Omnivore’s Dilemma_ by Michael Pollan explores how modern-day humans answer the age-old question, “What should we eat,” by tracing four types of food chains (or food production systems), from a food’s origin to its final destination, the dinner table.

Although this is a seemingly simple question, answering it turns out to be complicated. The book examines why it’s complicated and who benefits, often to the public’s detriment.

### Humans Evolved as Omnivores

**Humans evolved as omnivores**. This is reflected in the design of our teeth (we can eat both plants and meat), our brain capacity for observation and memory, and adaptations such as hunting and cooking.

Being an omnivore is an advantage that has enabled humans to survive in many different environments. But it presents a challenge. **Because we can eat almost anything, we must continually make choices.**

In the early days of human evolution, eating the wrong thing might kill you or make you sick, so the decision was crucial and fraught with anxiety. Besides deciding what was safe, humans also needed to determine which foods provided the most energy.

In contrast, animals that are “specialized eaters” don’t have to think about what to eat because they only eat one thing, For example, a koala eats only eucalyptus leaves. A monarch butterfly eats only milkweed.

We developed some evolutionary tools to help us decide what to eat. They include:

  * **Recognition and memory** , to sort out poisons and the most nutritious foods
  * **Taste buds:** We’re predisposed toward sweetness, which signals carbohydrate energy.
  * **Sense of disgust** : This keeps us from eating from bad things, such as rotten meat.
  * **Culture and tradition** : We don’t have to each learn for ourselves what’s good and bad to eat. For instance, we know from collective experience and culture to not eat the mushroom called death cap. We’ve created taboos, rituals, traditions, and recipes as guides. 



### The Modern Omnivore’s Dilemma

Thirty years ago University of Pennsylvania researcher Paul Rozin came up with the term “Omnivore’s Dilemma” to describe our decision-making process around food.

In spite of the tools we’ve developed to help us decide what to eat, we still have a dilemma today. While we don’t worry as much about accidentally eating something poisonous, we still confront uncertainties about what to eat. Eating the wrong things can still be bad for us, and it’s hard to tell what we’re eating due to the way our industrial food system produces, processes, and labels food.

There are further complications that make it hard for us to make food decisions.

#### Lack of Food Culture

**The U.S. lacks a unique, enduring food culture** that would help guide us in what to choose, in part because we’re an immigrant nation.

Other countries like France and Italy decide dinner questions on the basis of tradition and pleasure; they eat “unhealthy” foods, yet the French are generally healthier than Americans (this is referred to as the French paradox) because of their culture of eating small meals, and eating slowly to savor them.

Our U.S. paradox is that **we’re unhealthy people obsessed with the idea of eating better**.

#### Industrialization of Food

Due to our lack of a stabilizing food culture, we’ve been less able to navigate **a big change that occurred in at the end of World War II: the U.S. industrialization of food production.**

**Figuring out what to eat has come to require expert help** (investigative journalism, nutritionists), because the origins of our food are difficult to trace via today’s industrial food chain. Food used to come from local markets and farms, but now it’s mass produced on huge farms and transported long distances; much of it is transformed through processing.

#### Mixed Messages about Health

**We get ever-changing messages from government, diet books, and media coverage of the latest research, which gives us whiplash.**

For example, in 1977 during the Carter administration, a Senate committee issued dietary goals urging reduced consumption of red meat, and people complied. Then Dr. Robert Atkins argued that you could in fact eat meat and even lose weight at the same time, if you cut bread and pasta. A New York Times Magazine cover story asked, “What if fat doesn’t make you fat?”

A shift began toward low-carbohydrate diets, and bread started falling out of favor. Some people developed “carbophobia.” (Shortform Note: Research since this was published in 2006 continues to show the major health problems caused by consuming large amounts of carbohydrates, as well as the benefits of reducing your carb and sugar intake.)

**Marketing messages create further confusion**. For instance, we confuse sugar-packed “nutrition” bars and so-called food supplements with food, and confuse sugar-loaded cereal that makes health claims with medicine (it’s supposedly heart-healthy).

Furthermore, our food habits and practices are characterized by:

  * Extraordinary abundance, but confusing options: We must choose organic or not, local organic or imported, trans fats or not, farmed salmon or wild, vegetarian or vegan. Food labels are hard to decipher: They claim food is heart-healthy, cage-free, grass-fed, range-fed, has natural flavors, etc. They list a string of incomprehensible ingredients.
  * Prevalence of fast food: **We eat a fifth of our meals in a car;** **we feed a third of children with fast food daily.**
  * Vulnerability to food scientists creating new processed foods and to marketers selling them – our confusion is their opportunity. **The food industry exacerbates our food anxieties** ,**and then gives us new products to buy.**



**The food industry has reinvented the traditional food chain** — from synthetic fertilizers replacing natural growth, to reshaping food through processing. This has implications for human health and the health of nature.

### What This Book is About

This book is about the three main food chains available to us today — industrial, true organic, and hunter-gatherer — plus a hybrid food chain (industrial organic). **A food chain is a system for passing on calories synthesized from the sun by plants.**

We used to rely on a traditional food chain: It started with animals and crops raised locally on small farms and sold locally. We prepared it ourselves and very little processing was involved.

Nowadays, the industrialization of the traditional food chain, to the point that food is now mass produced with the aid of chemicals and reshaped through processing, has changed how we eat.

  * The **industrial food chain** depends on energy from fossil fuels rather than relying totally on the sun. This has greatly increased the amount of food energy available to us, but has created many new problems, including pollution and health issues.
  * The industrial food chain is built on monocultures — huge farms growing or producing just one thing for maximum efficiency but to the detriment of the environment. 
  * **Corn is the dominant species of the industrial food chain**.



The book’s first section follows a centerpiece of industrialization, corn, from its origin through its transformation into a fast-food meal.

The second and third sections trace two **organic-based food chains** resulting in two meals:

  * An industrial organic meal from a Whole Foods supermarket, mass produced and distributed using some industrial farming methods.
  * A true organic meal – grown without using synthetic fertilizer or pesticides, and marketed locally from a grass-based farm in Virginia.



The last section follows a **hunter-gatherer food chain** in northern California. The author first had to confront the ethics of killing animals for food. But with this food chain he was able to eat with full knowledge of everything involved in creating and preparing the meal, which consisted of items foods he had grown, gathered, or hunted.

There were **several themes common to all the meals** , regardless of their food chain:

  * **There is a basic tension between the logic of industry and the logic of nature** — for instance, growing food in monocultures versus polycultures, and confining and feeding animals unnaturally versus allowing them to live and eat according to their instincts.
  * Many of today’s health and nutrition problems trace back to what happens on the farm, which is driven by government policies.
  * We have always done foolish things in our quest for food (destroying species and their habitats) but the poor choices we’ve made stemming from our reliance on fossil fuels are unprecedented (close confinement of animals, feeding them food they weren’t meant to eat, creating unhealthy foods). **We are taking huge risks with our health and environment**.
  * **The way we eat reflects how we connect and interact with nature** ; agriculture has done more to reshape nature than anything else; we are closely intertwined with other species, some of which (like corn and cows) evolved to gratify our desires.
  * Industrial eating obscures our connections and relationships with the natural world.
    * For example, shaping chicken into a bite-sized nugget involves intensive processing plus the addition of numerous corn-based ingredients. It doesn’t look or taste much like natural chicken after this processing.
  * If we knew how industrial agriculture works — and could see how animals are raised and slaughtered — we would change what we eat.
  * Eating is political and also existential. **How and what we eat is linked to how we use the world – and what happens to it.**
  * Eating with full awareness of how our food is connected to nature brings satisfaction. By contrast, eating industrially (in ignorance) brings only temporary pleasure and many problems.
