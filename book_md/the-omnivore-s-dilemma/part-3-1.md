## Part 3-1: Traditional Organic Farming

In contrast to the huge organic producers that supply Whole Foods, Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia is a small farm operating on organic principles of sustainability, diversity, and simplicity (no synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or antibiotics; and local marketing).

Owned and operated by Joel Salatin, **Polyface Farm provides an alternative to the industrial food chain, by farming according to the logic of nature rather than by industrial principles.** According to the author, this is what a true organic farm looks like.

The farm raises chickens, beef, pigs, turkeys, and rabbits, as well as tomatoes, sweet corn and berries, on 100 acres of pasture, abutted by another 450 acres of forest.

**The foundation of the farm’s food chain is grass of various types** , in the way corn is the foundation of the industrial food chain starting on an Iowa farm. Animals and crops are rotated through the various pastures and benefit in a symbiotic way.

Pastures are grazed twice by beef cattle, followed by hens that eat bugs in the manure and spread the manure around (acting as a cleanup crew). Chickens also add their own fertilizer (nitrogen). Finally the pastures are cut for hay.

By the end of a season, the grass has produced 25,000 pounds of beef, 50,000 pounds of pork, 12,000 broilers, 800 turkeys, 500 rabbits, and 30,000 dozen eggs.

The pasture is not degraded in the process; it is improved, becoming lusher, more diverse, and more fertile, with more earthworms. The process shows that farming in accordance with nature is not a zero sum proposition in which humans benefit but nature is diminished.

### Organic Principles in Practice

#### The Centrality of Grass

Animals eat grass and we eat the animals. The Old Testament describes the connection this way: “All flesh is grass.” But **the industrial food chain overlooks or eliminates grass** as a component.

The human connection with grass began with our ancestors. They encouraged the growth of grass to attract and fatten animals. They set fire to it periodically to prevent trees and shrubs from taking over, and to improve the soil. This helped the grass, which then helped the animals and the humans.

Annual grasses (corn, wheat, rice) developed, which humans could eat, and we eventually put all our energy into growing and harvesting them. Our appreciation for the polyculture of grass waned.

At Polyface Farm, grass of many types — bluegrass, timothy, fescue, clover — underlies the farm’s success.It’s supported by soil teeming with fungi, bacteria, insects, earthworms, and voles. (Healthy soil digests decomposed matter.)

**The grass must be managed effectively, which requires local knowledge** and action, as opposed to the one-size-fits-all approach of industrial farming using machines and chemicals for greatest efficiency.

Salatin practices “**management intensive grazing** ,” which involves rotating animals through different pastures at various intervals. This requires using portable fencing and moving animals every day, as well as understanding how grass grows and responds to grazing.

  * Grass has a spurt of growth after animals have grazed the first time, or taken a first bite, and after the grass has rebuilt its reserves and root mass.
  * Then growth slows down again and the grass gets ready to seed.
  * The farmer has to avoid regrazing (allowing a second bite) before grass has a chance to recover from the first round.



**To manage pastures effectively, it’s necessary to keep track of the grazing and stages of growth and recovery** of each section, which varies according to the amount of rainfall and season. A farmer knows the average amount of forage a cow will eat in a day (a cow day) and calculates how many cow days each pasture will provide. Grazing the optimal number of cows at the optimal moments yields tremendous amounts of grass while also improving the quality of the land.

Polyface Farm achieves as much as 400 cow days per acre (compared to the county average of 70), in effect expanding the farm without adding new acreage.

Among the benefits of good management:

  * **Moving animals keeps them healthy** by not allowing too much manure to build up underfoot, which harbors parasites.
  * Grazing cattle get minerals they need from grass, and also nutrients to ward off disease, so **they don’t need supplements and drugs**.
  * **Grazing cattle also start a process of replenishing the soil** , and increasing the diversity of the plants in a pasture (rotated cattle don’t eliminate favorite grasses by overgrazing them; and no single species gets a chance to dominate).
  * **Pastures also remove carbon from the air**.



If the 16 million acres now being used to grow corn to feed animals became well-managed pasture, that would remove 14 billion pounds of carbon from the atmosphere a year. This is comparable to removing four million cars from the road.

**Poor pasture management causes problems.**

  * Grasses shortened by overgrazing have weak root systems for drawing water and minerals, so the grass deteriorates and can dry up.
  * Also, grasses favored by livestock – clovers, bluegrass timothy — weaken and disappear. On the other hand, undergrazing also leads to lower quality grass when some varieties crowd out others.
    * Wild populations of grazing animals moved regularly to new territory, or were forced to move like buffalo were due to predators.



Grass’s contrast with corn couldn’t be sharper.

  * Unlike corn, growing grass doesn’t lend itself to the industrial system benefits of consistency, mechanization, and economies of scale.
  * Grass isn’t particularly portable, storable in large quantities, or traded as a commodity. 
  * Unlike corn, it doesn’t shore up the larger economy — for instance, the chemical and oil industries, or pharmaceuticals.
  * Grass quality is variable, and grass can’t be broken down and processed into value-added foods.
  * **The skill and local knowledge required to manage grass are hard to standardize.**
  * Growing grass follows the cycles of nature rather than the logic of industry.



#### Managing Animals

In a similarly intricate way, Polyface Farm manages its animals. The various **animals and the grass are interdependent, benefiting each other and the land while producing food**.

Chicken pens housing broilers are moved around the farm regularly — 10 feet per day — so they can eat grass and fertilize it with their manure; the birds avoid pathogens, and get nutrients from the varied grasses plus bugs, but are moved before their pecking and manure can destroy it.

There’s also an eggmobile (portable chicken coop) housing laying hens and their eggs, which is moved into areas that cattle have recently vacated. The chickens clean up the insects, larvae and parasites from the cow manure, breaking the cycle of infestation and disease.

**The hens get protein from eating the grubs and insects, and lay tastier, higher quality eggs.** The cows don’t have to be treated with chemicals to kill parasites.

Another example of interdependence is the way the farm handles rabbits for sale as meat to restaurants. The rabbits live in cages suspended over wood chips, in which their manure and urine collects; chickens scratch in it, which helps turn it into compost.

The farm grazes turkeys in a grape orchard, where they eat bugs, cut the grass, and fertilize the vines.

Manure that collects in cattle sheds, where cows spend winter, is layered with straw and corn, which ferments; then pigs are allowed to root in the manure for the corn, and this aerates it, creating a rich compost in a few weeks. This can later be spread on pastures, which will enhance the grasses, which feed the cows, chickens, and turkeys.

#### Nature’s Efficiencies

**In such an interconnected system, you can’t change one thing without changing the others.**

For example, if the farm added more chickens, their nitrogen-based manure would be too much for the pastures to handle and it would kill the grass. Also, the farmer would need to add more cattle to produce the manure and insects to feed the chickens, or their eggs wouldn’t be as good.

The farm is more like an organism than a machine; it works only on a smaller scale.

**Natural systems are efficient in a different way from industrial systems** ; for instance, in nature, **there’s no waste problem**. One animal’s waste becomes another’s food source; turning cow manure into eggs is efficient, as is using the same pasture repeatedly to produce different things: cows, pigs, broilers, eggs, turkeys.

In an industrial system, simplified by creating a monoculture, the only way efficiency is measured is by yield.

But natural systems’ efficiencies grow from interdependence. You need multiple species complementing each other, to eliminate the need for fertilizer, pesticides, drugs, etc. The animals accomplish this by behaving naturally, doing what they are designed to do.

**Pastoral farming is labor intensive compared to the more mechanized and standardized industrial farming system.**

#### Slaughter

Polyface Farm processes and packages its own chickens. **The government allows farmers to process a few thousand birds on farms** , but most other food animals must be processed in a state- or federally-inspected facility.

Polyface Farm does its processing in an open-air assembly line of steel sinks and water tanks, which customers can watch if they want to. Birds are placed upside down into metal funnels or cones, with their heads sticking out the bottom of the cone. Their necks are quickly cut and they are bled out.

The federal regulations for processing facilities are rigid and specific — for instance, walls must be painted white, with screen doors and windows. Processors are required to provide an exclusive bathroom for the USDA inspector.

**Regulations are one-size-fits all and are difficult to apply to small organizations**. For instance, because Salatin’s process is open-air, conducted in an open-sided building, it lacks white-painted walls.

However, **there are no federal standards for food-borne pathogens** (if there were, inspectors would have to test and order recalls of meat.) Yet government research has shown that the main cause of food-borne illness in the U.S. is centralized production and processing, plus long-distance transportation of meat. Irradiation rather than decentralization is the solution.

Slaughtering animals can be dehumanizing to the people doing it and inhumane to animals if it becomes routine. Polyface Farm **processes chickens only a few days a month, so it doesn’t become routine**. Salatin says this keeps workers focused on what they’re doing, so they can be as careful and humane as possible.

Salatin believes transparency is a better guarantor of a clean and humane process than regulations or irradiation.
