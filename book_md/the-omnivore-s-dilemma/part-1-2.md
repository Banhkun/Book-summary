## Part 1-2: The Industrial Farm

#### The Evolution of Farming

**Today most of our food comes from corn-based industrial farms.** But in the early 1900s, most farms started out as diverse operations, with corn, fruits/vegetables, oats, hay, chickens, and pigs. One in four Americans lived on a farm.

Beginning in the fifties and sixties the availability and cheap price of corn made it more profitable to fatten livestock on feedlots, and chickens in giant factories. So chickens and cattle moved from farms to industrial areas, creating space for farmers to plant more corn, which made it even cheaper.

By the 1980s, diversified farms had basically disappeared in Iowa and a single crop or monoculture — corn — dominated.

**Growing just corn required much less labor than diversified farming** , thanks to fertilizer, pesticides, mechanization, and other practices. Monoculture farms got bigger but required fewer people to operate.

Here’s how farming works today. George Naylor is a typical farmer, raising corn and soybeans in Greene County, Iowa. Naylor rotates the two crops. (Soybeans have become the second crop supporting the industrial food system; like corn, they’re fed to livestock and are a component of a majority of processed foods.)

Naylor plants a hybrid corn variety developed by Monsanto, which yields 180 bushels per acre; in 1920 the average was about 120 bushels per acre. The higher yields stem from the fact that the hybrid corn can be planted close together. It has a stronger root system, stands up straight, and is amenable to mechanized harvesting.

Naylor and other midwestern farmers are going nearly broke because the price they get for corn doesn’t cover their costs — and it keeps declining as they get more productive (we’ll explain more about why later). Naylor’s farm, which has been in his family for generations, no longer financially supports the four people who live on it; his wife works off the farm and he depends on a federal subsidy.

The plight of midwestern farmers is a direct result of years of farm policies designed to encourage overproduction to benefit the huge agribusinesses that buy corn, process and sell it, or feed animals on factory farms to produce and process meat.

### Farm Policy Promotes Excess Corn

**The price of a bushel of corn is about a dollar less than the cost of growing it**. So if the supply is so abundant that the market won’t pay the cost of producing it, why do farmers keep growing more of it?

There are multiple factors involved, but **the biggest driver of production is long-standing government farm policies.**

American farm policy originally was designed to limit production and support prices to help farmers. Crop surpluses during good years would drive down prices and bankrupt farmers. So **New Deal farm programs established a target price for corn.** When the market price dropped below the target price, a farmer could get a government loan, with his crop as collateral, and store his grain until prices increased again. At that point, he sold his corn and paid back the loan, or he kept the loan and gave the corn to the government. This kept corn prices from collapsing as yields continued to increase.

Beginning in the fifties a campaign to undercut New Deal programs began, in an effort to let market forces push prices down. It was driven by food processors and exporters, laissez-faire economists, and businessmen upset that farmers aligned themselves with the labor movement.

But the real dismantling was accomplished in the 1970s by Earl Butz, an agricultural economist and Richard Nixon’s secretary of agriculture, who remade farm policy on the basis of cheap corn, to satisfy big business as well as to stem inflation of food prices.

  * The government pushed farmers to ramp up their production (to “get big or get out”), to consolidate into bigger farms, and think of themselves as agribusinessmen rather than farmers.
  * Butz eliminated price supports, replacing them with a new system of direct payments to farmers for any shortfall in the price of corn. This encouraged farmers to produce more and sell their corn regardless of the price, since the government would make up the difference.



However, subsequent farm bills have continued to lower the target price, and government payments haven’t made up the difference. **Since the 1970s farm income has steadily declined along with corn prices** , forcing farmers deeper into debt and bankruptcy. Yet farmers produce more corn every year.

  * A farm needs a certain amount of cash flow every year to support itself, and if the price of corn falls the only way to stay even is to produce more corn. Farms aren’t designed to switch easily to other crops.
  * Even as prices decline, the government is telling farmers to keep growing corn and soybeans, and calculates subsidy prices based on a farmer’s yield. But the more production increases, the more prices fall.
  * By encouraging more and more production, the government is subsidizing the buyers of cheap corn like Cargill and Coca-Cola, who make money transforming it and selling it.



**The free market doesn’t work in agriculture** the way it does in other economic sectors. Typically in manufacturing, when prices fall a factory lays off workers and makes fewer widgets while waiting for the market to stabilize. Or it starts making something else if one market dries up. However when corn prices fall, farmers don’t stop producing corn, and even increase production. This benefits most of the industrial food chain, except for farmers.

### The Role of Fossil Fuel

In addition to U.S. government farm policy, **the development of synthetic fertilizer played a pivotal role in enabling the production of corn on an industrial scale.**

Before World War II, German chemist Fritz Haber had invented a synthetic process of nitrogen fixing (making nitrogen from the air usable by plants), which led to the development of chemical fertilizer that adds nitrogen to the soil. (In nature, legumes utilize bacteria to add nitrogen to the soil.)

After the war, this advance was put into action in a big way by the U.S. government, which helped launch the chemical fertilizer industry. Manufacturing plants that had made munitions needed something else to do, so they **switched from making explosives to making chemical fertilizer**. Both processes used ammonium nitrate (a source of nitrogen, which plants need) — of which the government had a huge surplus.

**Synthetic fertilizer use allowed farmers to plant corn every year,** without allowing the soil to rest or rebuilding it with legumes. Farms could become monocultures, paving the way for mechanization and economies of scale. Use of hybrid corn skyrocketed because it could consume more fertilizer than any other crop.

Farming could now be managed on industrial principles, turning inputs (chemical fertilizer) into outputs (corn). Corn, in turn, thrives in the industrial system, getting more than half of all the synthetic nitrogen that’s produced.

#### The Environmental Cost

While it may make economic sense, **industrial farming is costly to the environment**.

It has led to reliance on fossil fuel rather than the sun for rebuilding soil. Producing synthetic fertilizer takes huge amounts of electricity plus hydrogen supplied by oil, coal, and natural gas. (This energy is not renewable.)

Considering the fossil fuels needed to make fertilizer and pesticides, and harvest, dry, and transport corn, **producing a bushel of industrial corn requires a quarter to a third of a gallon of oil**(around 50 gallons per acre of corn).

Also, **farmers growing hybrid corn tend to use too much fertilizer**. This is leading to pollution. When it gets into the water supply during spring runoff it can be harmful to children because it affects the blood’s ability to carry oxygen to the brain. **The city of Des Moines issues “blue baby alerts” at times when parents should not give their children tap water due to pollution.**

Synthetic nitrogen damages forests and the oceans too. It has killed marine life in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a dead zone the size of New Jersey and still growing. And it adds to global warming.

**We have disturbed the global nitrogen balance.** More than half the world’s supply of usable nitrogen is now man-made. The consequences are only beginning to become apparent.
