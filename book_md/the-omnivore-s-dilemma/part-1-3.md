## Part 1-3: Corn Storage and Feedlots

Most of the corn harvested is used as a commodity and turned into processed foods. Only a small fraction of it is eaten as actual corn. Here’s what happens to the corn after it’s harvested.

### The Grain Elevator

The first stop after harvest for an industrial corn crop is **the grain elevator, invented for collecting and storing mass quantities of corn prior to loading it onto railroad cars for distribution.** These clustered, concrete towers are the tallest structures in farm country. They’re filled with corn by conveyor belt and drained by a spout into railroad cars.

**Most corn is sold as a commodity**. It is a different variety — known as No. 2 field corn — from what the corn that we humans eat. It is traded and sold all over the world.

**Farmers once sold their corn in burlap sacks bearing their names**. They had to be concerned about quality, because buyers knew where their corn came from. With the invention of the grain elevator for storage and railroad cars for transport, corn was no longer packaged in burlap sacks with a farmer’s name. Corn from all sources was mixed, breaking the link between producer and consumer.

In 1865 the Chicago Board of Trade come up with a grading system, and source no longer mattered as long as the corn met standards. **Quantity or yield, rather than quality, became the goal.**

From the grain elevators, the stream of corn produced by George Naylor and other farmers funnels to a small number of large agribusinesses, who reap profits by controlling its path. They’re the true beneficiaries of the farm subsidies that produce cheap corn.

Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, for instance, buy an estimated one-third of the corn produced in the U.S. They make pesticides and fertilizer; operate the mills, export it, feed and slaughter animals, and make ethanol and high-fructose corn syrup. In addition they help write government policy on corn.

### The Feedlot

#### Factory Farms

**With the abundance of cheap corn, animals were moved from farm pastures to feedlots** called CAFOs, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, where they could be fattened more quickly and efficiently.

One of the largest, Poky Feeders in Garden City, Kansas, shows how factory farms work. It features acres of pens containing 37,000 steers, eight miles of feed troughs, streams, and lagoons of waste, a processing plant, and a feed mill. The mill mixes feed for the cattle consisting of corn, liquified fat, protein, drugs, alfalfa, and silage.

This feed mix helps cattle, which are ruminants designed to eat grass, to eat corn without getting too sick. It isn’t good for them but it offers the cheapest calories, and there’s a huge supply.

Besides fattening animals efficiently, CAFOs have other economic advantages including:

  * Consolidating animals in feedlots leaves more acreage for planting corn.
  * T**he CAFO system has made meat cheap and abundant.** Americans used to eat it just a few times a week, but now some eat meat multiple times a day.
  * Also, **corn-fed beef is marbled, which Americans like**. (The USDA’s grading system is designed to reward marbling, and thus reward the feeding of corn to cows.)



Farms were once a closed ecological loop: You fed cattle waste products of crops, and fed manure from cattle back to the crops. Animal feedlots create two problems by breaking this loop: a need for chemical fertilizer, and a pollution problem. **CAFOs produce air and water pollution, toxic waste, and deadly pathogens.**

#### From Grass to a Corn Diet

Beef cattle destined for feedlots are typically born on independent ranches in the West because of the large amount of land (10 acres) required to raise a calf. (By contrast, the pork and chicken industries have consolidated the animal’s entire life under one roof.)

Blair Ranch in Vale, South Dakota, a cow-calf operation on 5,500 acres of grass, is typical of how the system works. Ranches like this are the first stage in beef production.

**Steers spend their first six months in pastures, eating grass as ruminants are designed to do**. Besides benefitting the cattle, grazing benefits the land by preventing the growth of trees and shrubs that block sunlight; the cattle spread grass seed and fertilize it with manure.

There’s some evidence that grazing makes ranges healthier, as long as cattle are moved frequently. The feedlot does greater environmental harm than grazing.

As ruminants, cattle convert grass to high quality protein through their rumen, a digestive organ that acts as a fermentation tank. They can make use of low-quality grasses.

But cows raised on grass take longer than those raised on corn to reach slaughter weight (4-5 years, compared to 14-16 months in corn-fed cows) — so it’s more efficient to feed them corn after a few months on grass at the start of their lives. Getting a steer from 80 to 1,100 pounds in 14 months takes huge quantities of corn, protein, and fat supplements, as well as drugs (particularly antibiotics).

After weaning at the ranch, calves are confined to a pen for a few months, where they learn to eat from a trough, and get accustomed to eating corn before being sent to a feedlot.

**Since cows aren’t designed to digest corn, feeding them only corn leads to all sorts of problems**.

  * Feeding cattle a corn diet leads to bloat (a stomach gas buildup that can be fatal), acidosis that can be fatal, liver disease, and more problems. Up to 30 percent of feedlot cows have abscessed livers.
  * Today beef cows are being bred/selected for their ability to eat large quantities of corn without getting too sick.
  * **Feedlots rely on antibiotics to keep cattle healthy enough to slaughter for food**. In fact, most of the antibiotics sold in the U.S. end up in cattle feed, which is contributing to the development of superbugs.



The majority of cattle born on western ranches are funneled to four big meatpacking companies (Tyson/IBP, Cargill/Excel, Swith & Co., and National), which slaughter and market four of five beef cattle raised in the U.S.

#### Problems for Humans from Animal Feedlots

Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations lead to a bevy of problems for humans.

In the past, cows were fed a grisly meal - rendered cow parts and bonemeal. Due to the spread of mad cow disease, **the FDA banned feeding cows rendered cow parts in 1997** ,but it could still be a problem. Rendered cattle meat and bonemeal are still being fed to chickens and pigs. It’s OK by the FDA to feed cows feather meal and chicken litter (bedding, feces, and discarded feed), as well as chicken, fish, and pig meal.

This means that when the cattle are fed chicken and pig meal, from animals that ate rendered cattle parts, **infectious prions (the source of mad cow disease) could find their way back into cattle.**

Besides the potential for mad cow disease, the industrial production of meat creates other health problems for humans. **Corn-fed meat is less healthy for us** : it contains more saturated fat and less healthy Omega-3 fatty acids than grass-fed meat.

Research suggests that many of the health problems associated with eating beef are really problems with corn-fed beef (modern-day hunter-gatherers who eat wild meat don’t have our rates of heart disease). In the same way that ruminants are poorly adapted to eating corn, humans may be poorly adapted to eating the ruminants that eat the corn.

Then there’s the problem of toxic waste. Feedlot waste can’t be used as fertilizer, because its nitrogen and phosphorus content is too high, and it contains heavy metals and traces of hormones. So it gets into water supplies downstream, where fish and amphibians develop abnormal sex characteristics. Nitrogen in the Mississippi Is creating a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.

Also, bacteria, especially _E. coli_ , from the manure in a feedlot can also get into meat during processing, which can be fatal to humans. Strains of _E. coli_ are developing that can resist human stomach acid. Switching a cow’s diet to grass or hay a few days before slaughter reduces the E. coli in the cow’s gut by 80 percent, but this is considered impractical by the cattle industry. So the preferred solution for killing dangerous bacteria is to irradiate meat. (Shortform note: But this has its own issues - some bacteria are becoming resistant to this process. Also, it may diminish nutrients and taste.)

Another problem of industrial meat production is its **consumption of oil** , from raising corn, processing it, transporting it and feeding to animals. A steer eating 25 pounds of corn a day and reaching 1,200 pounds will have consumed the equivalent of nearly 35 gallons of oil or about a barrel in its lifetime.
