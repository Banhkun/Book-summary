## Exercise: Use Effective Thinking to Solve a Problem

Applying the principles of effective thinking will help you better understand a problem and guide your next steps in solving it. Think of a problem in your life that you’re trying to solve right now, big or small (but be specific). We’ll walk through the steps of thinking effectively about this problem to better solve it.

* * *

First, establish your foundational knowledge. What do you already know about this problem? What is its context? What are the factors contributing to it? What effect does it have on you or the world? Note any gaps you find in your knowledge.

Next, think about how you might learn through trial and error. How might you experiment with a possible solution? How might you purposefully create a mistake? (Is there an extreme situation you might apply your problem to?)

Then, ask questions: What facts might you be taking for granted? Is there a “what if” scenario you can think of?

Now, using your foundational knowledge and what you have learned from the previous question, what is the next step for this problem? How will solving this problem affect you or the world? And finally, what change will you enact to work toward solving the problem?
