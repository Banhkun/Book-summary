## Chapter 10: S—Scribing

Scribing or **writing in a journal allows you to record insights, ideas, successes, lessons, and opportunities for future development**.

Benefits include clarifying your thoughts, reinforcing what you’re learning, and setting a direction for the future. But **you get even more benefit from reviewing your journal at regular intervals.** For example:

  * You gain an appreciation for what you’ve accomplished in a month or a year.
  * You feel gratitude for your accomplishments.
  * By looking back, you can identify lessons learned and commit to the steps you’ll take to implement those lessons.



### Starting Your Journal

Here are three steps to get started:

**1) Choose a format** : You can use a digital or traditional paper format. It’s a matter of personal preference.

**2) Get a journal** : If you’re going the traditional route, you can use any lined notebook, although some people prefer hardbound volumes that are more durable. There are digital formats and apps you can use on an electronic device, as well as sample pages you can download and print out for traditional use. You can also download the Miracle Morning Journal template here.

**3) Decide what to write** : You can write about anything—for instance, your goals, family, plans, or commitments. Elrod sometimes takes a structured approach of listing what he’s grateful for, his accomplishments, and areas for improvement plus the steps he’ll take to improve. Other times, he just writes a synopsis of his day.

#### Maintaining Your Journal

Many people who keep journals do their writing at night before going to bed, but it’s easy to skip writing when you’re tired. Some people buy pricey bound volumes to write in, hoping that the money expended will motivate them to use the book. They end up with a collection of blank books in which they’ve only written a few words.

However, making journal writing part of a Miracle Morning routine is more successful because the routine provides a consistent time and a structure for writing.

There can be a downside to reviewing your journal, especially if you’re a perfectionist or high achiever: focusing too much on how far you have to go (your potential gap). This can lead to minimizing your accomplishments and beating yourself up for not making enough progress. To avoid this, make a point of being grateful for what you’ve done, then tell yourself you’re doing the best you can in the moment and will continue to do better.

**Writing in your journal should remind you that you do many more things right than you do wrong**. Always record what you accomplished, what you’re grateful for, what you’re committed to doing better. This should keep things in perspective as well as motivate you.
