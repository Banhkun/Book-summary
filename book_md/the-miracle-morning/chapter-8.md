## Chapter 8: E—Exercise

Besides being good for your health, exercising for a few minutes each morning **boosts your energy and mood and increases your mental clarity and focus.**

Your Miracle Morning routine should include aerobic exercise such as jumping jacks, pushups, and situps. Alternatively, you could follow along with a yoga video. You can do additional exercise with a longer duration, such as running or working out at the gym, at other times during the day, but you still should incorporate a short period of exercise into your morning routine to increase your energy and focus for the day.

Elrod prefers yoga. It dovetails well with other aspects of the Miracle Morning method.

It’s a multipurpose activity: it can incorporate stretching, strength training, and cardio. It can be combined with focused breathing and serve as a form of meditation.

Yoga can take various forms. There are different practices to address the physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual aspects of life. Choosing the practice you need can help bring your life into balance.

While everyone knows it’s important to exercise consistently to maintain good health and increase your energy, it’s easy to make excuses for not exercising—for instance, feeling tired or not having time. However, the Miracle Morning routine provides a structure (a designated time when you’re not tired) that eliminates these excuses so you can make exercise a habit.
