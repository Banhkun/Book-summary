## Chapter 5: S—Silence

To reduce your stress and begin each day with calm, clarity, and focus, do the opposite of what most people do—start with a period of silence.

For most people, early mornings are either: 1) hectic—you have a million things on your mind, or 2) slow—you feel lethargic, lazy, and have trouble getting started. Neither is a productive way to start your day. In contrast, starting with purposeful silence will allow you to focus on what’s most important in your life.

**There are at least five ways to practice silence: meditation, prayer, reflection, deep breathing, gratitude**. You can start your Miracle Morning with just one of them or combine them. Many people choose meditation.

#### Meditation

Basically, **meditation is the practice of quieting and focusing your mind**.

There are countless books and videos you can consult for step-by-step instructions. Meditation requires little time, yet offers numerous health benefits for just minutes a day—for instance, improving metabolism, blood pressure, and brain function; reducing stress and pain; and improving sleep and concentration. Many celebrities and high achievers—for instance, Oprah, Jerry Seinfeld, and Sting—attest to the benefits.

In general, there are two types of meditation: individual and guided. Individual meditation is done on your own, while the guided version is done by following audio instructions to focus your mind. If you need help getting started, here’s a simple process:

**1) Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit** : a couch, chair, pillow, or the floor.

**2) Sit upright with your legs crossed** ; close your eyes or look down at the floor.

**3) Quiet your mind** by letting go of intrusive thoughts, worries, and anything preoccupying you. Focus on “just being” rather than on thinking or doing.

**4) Focus on breathing** : take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Breathe from your belly rather than your chest. Inhale and exhale for a count of three. When thoughts cross your mind, acknowledge them and let them go. Keep focusing on your breathing.

**5) Be present in the moment**. If you have trouble quieting your thoughts, focus on a word or phrase, repeating it to yourself as you inhale and exhale. (For example, “I breathe in peace… I breathe out love.”)

Think of your daily meditation as a mini-retreat from your problems. Although your problems won’t go away, you’ll be able to handle them more calmly and effectively.

At first, sitting in silence may be difficult, but you can master it with practice. Start with about five minutes. It won’t be long before you begin to experience the benefits. (Shortform note: For a deeper exploration, read the Shortform summary of Mindfulness in Plain English here.)
