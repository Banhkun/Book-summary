## 1-Page Summary

In _The Miracle Morning_ , best-selling author and speaker Hal Elrod argues that **everyone is capable of achieving their dreams in every area of life** , including relationships, finances, career, health, spirituality, and happiness.

**The answer is committing yourself to personal development by getting up early and following a simple, daily routine of silence, affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and writing** , which can empower anyone to transform any area of life in a surprisingly short time.

Elrod developed this “Miracle Morning” routine in the process of overcoming two major setbacks in his life:

  * A devastating car accident that left him with brain damage and eleven broken bones at age 20.
  * The financial collapse of his business plus a deep depression in the recession of 2008.



These experiences taught him that he needed to take responsibility for creating the life he wanted. **He realized that if he wanted a life of extraordinary success, he had to develop himself into the kind of person capable of achieving success**.

So he committed to spending time each day improving himself through silence (typically meditation or prayer), affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and scribing (writing in a journal). His “Life S.A.V.E.R.S.” routine energized and motivated him. This book explains how you can use the Miracle Morning process to transform yourself and your life.

### Overcoming Mediocrity

The first challenge to living the life you really want is overcoming a tendency toward mediocrity.

**Most people passively accept the cards that life deals them**. Even people who achieve success in one area, such as a career, often accept less than they want or are capable of achieving in other areas, such as relationships or health. Most people—95%—live mediocre lives, without realizing they have the ability to be who they want to be, do what they want to do, and have whatever they want.

If you take one hundred people at the start of their working life and follow them for forty years, you’ll find, according to the Social Security Administration, that:

  * One will be wealthy.
  * Four will be financially secure.
  * Five will continue working because they have to.
  * Thirty-six will be dead.
  * Fifty-four will be broke and dependent on friends, family, and the government.



**The challenge is ensuring that you are among the successful minority rather than the struggling majority**.

The most common reasons people settle for uninspired lives are:

#### 1) Rearview Mirror Thinking

Most of us view current choices through the filter of our past experiences—the rearview mirror syndrome. **We measure new opportunities against our past experiences and capabilities** —for instance, thinking: “I’ve never done anything like that before; I’ve never succeeded at that.” Thus, we limit our future development based on the limitations of our past. Even though we want to change, we’re stuck on the way things have always been.

You can overcome past limitations by repeating affirmations that inspire confidence that anything is possible and that you can make it happen. Focus on what you want, reprogram your beliefs about what’s possible, and move in the direction of your goals until they become reality.

#### 2) Viewing Small Actions in Isolation

We wrongly think our choices affect only the moment—for instance, that it’s no big deal to eat something unhealthy or to skip exercising today because we’ll get a “do-over” tomorrow.

However, your individual actions, as well as thoughts, have long-term consequences. **Every thought, decision, and action determines who you’re becoming** and, ultimately, the life you create. By keeping your commitments, you develop the discipline to achieve the results you want.

#### 3) A Mediocre ‘Circle of Influence’

**We emulate the people we spend the most time with—our circle of influence.**

If you’re surrounded by negative, complaining, lazy, people, you’ll be like them. Likewise, if you spend time with positive, successful people, their attitudes will rub off and you’ll become more like them. This is true of every aspect of life, including happiness, health, and even income. Spend less time with people who pull you down (this can include family) and associate instead with those who believe in and encourage you.

### A ‘Level 10’ Life

There’s no reason to settle for less than extraordinary success in any area of your life—happiness, health, money, freedom, love, or success. Of course, no one consciously chooses to accept less in a given area. For instance, on a fulfillment scale of 1-10, we don’t decide we’re okay with a level 5 relationship, in which we’re unhappy half the time. Yet most people still end up accepting mediocrity in most areas.

However, you can achieve top-level success in every area of life by:

1) Devoting time each day to work on becoming the person you need to be to attract and achieve the success you want.

2) Changing the way you start your day. A morning routine focused on personal development leads to productive days, which create a successful life.

### Your Miracle Morning

**You can literally change your life by changing how and why you wake up**.

If you’re like most people, you delay waking up for as long as possible. You hit the snooze button and, ultimately, only drag yourself out of bed because there’s somewhere you must be. However, **what you’re doing when you hit the snooze button is resisting your life** , your day, and creating the life you want.

The secret to waking up feeling energized and excited is to make each morning feel like Christmas morning felt as a kid. The Miracle Morning routine creates this experience by giving you purpose and excitement around developing into the person capable of creating the life of your dreams.

Starting your day with personal development creates energy and focus that carry over into the rest of your day. Also, when you do your routine immediately upon getting up, you face fewer temptations to skip it than you would later in the day—for instance, feeling tired or too pressed for time.

If you have trouble getting up, try these wake-up tips: Place your alarm clock across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. After you turn it off, brush your teeth, drink a glass of water to rehydrate, and dress in your workout clothes. Then move to another room for your morning routine so you aren’t tempted to go back to bed.

The Miracle Morning consists of these practices (the Life S.A.V.E.R.S.)

  * **Silence** : Starting your day with silence calms and centers you. There are five ways to practice silence: meditation, prayer, reflection, deep breathing, and gratitude. You can practice just one or combine them. Many people choose meditation, following these steps: close your eyes or look down at the floor, quiet your mind by letting go of intrusive thoughts, focus on breathing, be present in the moment.
  * **Affirmation** : Affirmations are positive, constructive statements that you repeat to yourself as a tool for reprogramming negative thinking to help you change or accomplish something. An effective affirmation is read aloud and states what you want and why, how you’ll change, and what steps you’ll take. 
  * **Visualization** : Through visualization, you increase your chances of success by imagining yourself achieving the results you want. Use your senses to see, hear, feel, touch, smell, and taste every aspect of your dream. Then, envision yourself achieving your goals. Also visualize the person you need to be to achieve them.
  * **Exercise** : Aerobic exercise, such as jumping jacks, pushups, and situps get your blood moving and raise your energy level. Alternatively, you could follow along with a yoga video. 
  * **Reading** : Reading self-help or inspirational literature gives you the ideas, strategies, and knowledge you need to achieve your goals. Learning from people who have already done what you aspire to do saves you from reinventing the wheel. Reading ten pages a day adds up to 3,650 pages a year or about eighteen self-improvement books.
  * **Scribing** : Writing in a journal allows you to record insights, ideas, successes, lessons, and opportunities for development. Try listing what you’re grateful for, your accomplishments, and areas for improvement plus the steps you’ll take to improve. Or just write a synopsis of your day.



The Miracle Morning can be customized to fit everyone’s work schedule and lifestyle—for instance, you can spend ten minutes on each practice for a total of an hour or spend as little as a minute on each for a six-minute routine. You can spend less time on some practices and more on others and vary the sequence. Whether you’re a “morning person” or not, you’ll learn to wake up earlier, excited to start your day. **Your Miracle Morning experience will become the key to unlocking your potential**.
