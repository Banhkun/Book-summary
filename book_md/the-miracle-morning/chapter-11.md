## Chapter 11: Implementing Your Miracle Morning

**You can customize the Life S.A.V.E.R.S. practices to fit your work schedule and lifestyle**. Many people devote thirty to sixty minutes, but you can do a shorter routine on weekdays and a longer one on weekends. You may need to vary the time, for instance if you’re traveling.

Here’s an example of how to complete a Miracle Morning in an hour:

  * Silence: Five minutes
  * Affirmation: Five minutes
  * Visualization: Five minutes
  * Exercise: Twenty minutes
  * Reading: Twenty minutes
  * Scribing: Five minutes



However, you can complete the steps in as little as six minutes by spending a minute on each activity. For instance:

  * Minute 1: Sit in purposeful silence and breathe deeply.
  * Minute 2: Read your affirmations out loud.
  * Minute 3: Visualize accomplishing your goals for the day and how it will feel.
  * Minute 4: Write down something you're grateful for, something your proud of, and your goal for the day.
  * Minute 5: Read a page or two from a self-help book, looking for an idea you can use immediately.
  * Minute 6: Move your body for sixty seconds by running in place, or doing jumping jacks, pushups or situps.



You can also change the sequence of the practices—for instance, some people like to start with exercise to get their blood flowing and help them wake up, while others prefer to exercise at the end and then shower.

If there’s a Life S.A.V.E.R.S. practice that’s challenging for you, you might want to start with that one first. Getting the hardest thing out of the way first generates momentum and confidence that will make the rest of the routine and your day more productive.

Your start time is customizable as well, for instance if you work an evening or night shift. Just plan to wake up thirty to sixty minutes earlier than you normally would.

### When and What to Eat

Digesting food takes energy—the more you eat, the less you feel like doing. Forgoing breakfast until after your Miracle Morning routine ensures that you’ll be alert and focused—your blood will be going to your brain instead of your digestive system.

But if you need to eat first thing in the morning, start with something light and easily digestible.

#### Eating for Energy and Health

Many people choose what to eat based on taste, convenience, or dietary restrictions they may have. We get emotional enjoyment from the way foods taste—for example, fried chicken, fast food, ice cream, or soda. However, for more energy and better health, it’s better to choose foods based on those criteria. Food that’s healthy and gives you energy can still taste great—for instance, fresh fruits and vegetables.

Elrod created a Miracle Morning fruit smoothie to provide a healthy, energy-boosting breakfast. It includes protein, antioxidants, Omega 3 essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Here’s the recipe:

  * 1 cup water, orange iuice, or almond/soy milk
  * 1 banana (can be frozen)
  * 1 handful of spinach (can be frozen)



Optional additions:

  * 1 leaf Swiss Chard or Kale
  * 1 handful of berries (can be frozen) or a mango



Whatever you choose to eat, make sure it’s good for you as well as great-tasting.

### Keeping Your Routine Fresh

Once you become comfortable with the six personal development practices, look for ways to vary them to keep things fresh.

For instance, you might change your exercise routine every few months. You can search for different meditations online or download different meditation apps. You can change your vision board and continue to update your affirmations. Adjust the practices to what’s going on in your life—for instance, if you’ll be giving a speech, use your Miracle Morning time to focus your thoughts and rehearse.

**It’s your responsibility to keep your routine fun and valuable for you**.
