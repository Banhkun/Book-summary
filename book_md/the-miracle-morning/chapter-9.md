## Chapter 9: R—Reading

**Reading gives you the ideas, strategies, techniques, and knowledge you need to achieve your goals and dreams.** Learning from and emulating people who have already done what you aspire to do saves you the time and struggle of reinventing the wheel.

With an infinite number of books available on every topic, there’s no limit to the knowledge and life-changing ideas you can gain through daily reading. It would be foolish to pass all this up by not reading.

Just a few examples of books by financially successful people are: _Think and Grow Rich_ by Napoleon Hill, _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ by T. Harv Eker, and _Total Money Makeover_ by Dave Ramsey. Other books can help you transform relationships, increase self-confidence, improve communication skills, or exercise effectively.

Many Miracle Morning practitioners spend their morning reading time with the Bible, Torah, or another religious text.

Whatever you choose, **commit to reading at least ten pages a day. While reading ten pages requires only ten to fifteen minutes a day, it adds up to 3,650 pages a year or about eighteen self-improvement books.** Think of how much more knowledgeable you will be after reading eighteen books.

### Reading Tips

**1) Articulate why you’re reading a particular book** , including what you want to gain. Then, keep that in mind as you read.

**2) Take notes and highlight useful passages** to reinforce what you’re learning and so you can easily review the most important information later.

**3) Re-read good self-improvement books**. You can’t retain and apply everything of value after a single reading. You need repetition to embed the ideas in your subconscious.

**It can be more useful to re-read a book that you know can help you than to start a new book before mastering the ideas of the first one**. Elrod maintains a special shelf for books he wants to re-read. Try it with this book—commit to re-reading it to reinforce the Miracle Morning concepts and practices.

(Shortform note: We created Shortform in large part for this purpose—to bring you a book’s most important points for easy reference in the future.)
