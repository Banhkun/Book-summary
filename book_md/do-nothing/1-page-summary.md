## 1-Page Summary

In today’s fast-paced world, our lives increasingly revolve around productivity, efficiency, and work. It’s now normal for many people to answer emails during dinner and pack their days with as many tasks as possible. Yet in _Do Nothing_ (2021),__ Celeste Headlee argues that by trying to do too much, people are working less efficiently because the human brain isn’t designed to multitask and work without rest. In addition, the culture of overworking has led to worse health outcomes and more social isolation.

So if all this work isn’t serving us, how can we end an addiction to productivity? And if not work, what _should_ we be doing? Headlee’s solution isn’t exactly to “do nothing” as the title suggests but rather to**embrace true leisure—doing things just for the fun of it and not to achieve a specific goal**.

Headlee is a radio journalist of over 20 years and the author of the best seller _We Need to Talk_ (2018), as well as _Speaking of Race_ (2021), and _You’re Cute When You’re Mad _(2022)_._ Her TED Talk titled “10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation” went viral in 2015, launching her career as a public speaker on topics ranging from communication to music. Headlee decided to write _Do Nothing_ after struggling with work burnout, despite gaining financial stability and self-employment. By sharing her experience and research on this topic, she hopes to help others like herself end an unhealthy addiction to productivity.

In this guide, we’ll explain how economic changes during the Industrial Revolution sparked a major shift in work culture that persisted into the modern age, discuss how the cultural emphasis on productivity impacts people today, and lastly, cover Headlee’s tips for changing the way you work and making space in your life for leisure and human connection. We’ll also supplement Headlee’s ideas with more context on global labor trends and tips from other wellness and productivity experts.

### The Historical Origins of Overworking

Headlee writes that the culture of overworking can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution—a period of rapid technological advancement in Europe and the US beginning in the 1700s. During the Industrial Revolution, inventions such as the steam engine drastically changed the way people lived and worked due to the proliferation of factories, which quickly became a common place of employment. During this period, many people migrated to cities for work.

Headlee identifies two specific factors that encouraged people to prioritize work during this industrial era: **1) the economic pressure to work more due to the rise of wage labor and 2) the cultural pressure to work hard** , which stemmed from Protestantism and the American dream**** narrative.**** Together, Headlee argues, these economic and cultural factors spurred people to work more hours than humans had ever done historically. In this section, we’ll break down each of these factors and how they played a part in the work culture we inherited today.

> **Do Headlee’s Arguments Apply Globally?**
> 
> Throughout the book, Headlee implies that overworking is a _global_ cultural problem. However, much of her research is based on American and European history as well as her experience as an American, so it’s important to **distinguish which of her arguments apply globally and which of them apply more specifically to the US or Western cultures**.
> 
> In terms of the impact of the Industrial Revolution, these economic changes were a global phenomenon. The Industrial Revolution began in England during the 1700s and spread as the technologies reached the US and other regions over the next 300 years. This period is known broadly as a period of industrialization when countries shifted away from agriculture and toward manufacturing as the basis for their economy. For example, China and India both experienced an increase in industrialization beginning in the mid 20th century. Therefore, while the shifts that Headlee describes happened at different times in various parts of the world, the larger trends apply globally.
> 
> And what about the idea that people around the world are overworking themselves in the modern age?**International research suggests that people in many regions of the world aresuffering from worse health outcomes because of overwork. **One study by the World Health Organization found that people have the highest risk of health problems from overwork in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, while people in Europe had the lowest risk.
> 
> On the other hand, **some of Headlee’s explanations for the driving factors of overworking—such as theAmerican dream narrative—are specific to the US**. In other places, work cultures might be influenced by other country-specific factors such as legal limits on weekly work hours.

#### Economic Pressure: Wage Labor During the Industrial Revolution

Headlee explains that before the Industrial Revolution, more people had access to land that they could live off of, and many people worked in trades such as carpentry. However, during the Industrial Revolution, those options dwindled as a small upper class consolidated land ownership. This reduced other people’s access to land, and factories cheaply mass-produced products, making it increasingly difficult for artisans to sell handmade products.

Headlee posits that as more people were forced to move from rural areas to cities to find work, **the economic autonomy of the working class declined sharply, and people had to work longer hours to meet their basic needs**. For example, instead of working on chores that were done as needed, like taking care of livestock and gardens, people had to trade their time for money and had little control over their working conditions, wages, and schedules. Workers had to meet the demands of their employers, often in unpleasant factory environments, or risk losing their jobs and livelihoods.

> **What Caused Land Loss and the Rural Exodus?**
> 
> Two main factors contributed to these conditions and the decline in worker autonomy during the Industrial Revolution: the Enclosure Movement in Europe and the rise of industrial farming. During the Enclosure Movement, state governments in Europe converted land that was traditionally used communally (commons) into private property and sold it to the aristocracy to manage and profit from commercial production. This drastically reduced the amount of land that rural communities could steward, leading to increased migration to cities.
> 
> In addition, vast tracts of farmland in Europe were consolidated as innovations in commercial-scale agriculture decreased people’s ability to make a living from small-scale subsistence farming. Similar to the way manufacturing technology made it more difficult to make a living as an artisan, farmers no longer had the resources and land to compete with industrial farms. For example, the seed drill automated the process of planting crops, making it much more cost-effective for commercial farms that could buy large tracts of land and invest in expensive, more efficient equipment.

Headlee writes that during this time, people started working 10 to 14 hours per day on monotonous tasks. By contrast, medieval peasants worked a maximum of eight hours per day and took about a third of the year off. This example and other historical reference points reinforce the idea that industrialization significantly increased the number of work hours required to survive.

(Shortform note: Data suggest that working hours started to decrease around 1870 when people worked about 60 to 70 hours per week for 50 weeks per year. Today, people in wealthier countries work about half as much, although there are large disparities by country in terms of working hours. For example, the US averages 34 hours per week while Colombia and Turkey both average 48 hours per week. Economic data suggest that greater wealth and higher wages in a country both decrease the number of hours people work. )

##### Power Struggle Between Laborers and the Economic Elite

In contrast to the loss of autonomy for working-class laborers, the wealthy business-owning class benefited from cheap labor and the massive profits from selling retail products like clothing and household goods. As a result, **they leveraged their power to exploit laborers by forcing people to work long hours for as little pay as possible**.

(Shortform note: Many people disagree about the net impact of wage labor and the power dynamic between employers and laborers. In _The Communist Manifesto_ , Karl Marx argues that this dynamic is part of what makes the capitalist economic system unjust: Business and the accumulation of wealth rely on the upper class taking advantage of laborers and treating them like commodities. On the other hand, others argue that capitalist-driven entrepreneurialism led to more affordable products that increased people’s overall quality of life, including that of laborers.)

Headlee says that around the turn of the 20th century, labor unions started forming to curb employers’ power and implement policies like the eight-hour workday. Despite the fact that police and the military often responded to strikes with violence, people in the US, Europe, and other regions fought for improvements to working conditions and limited work hours.

Headlee explains that when faced with these limitations (around the turn of the 20th century), the wealthy class then shifted their attention to new strategies to encourage people to work more. Some of these were internal, company-level strategies like dangling promotions to encourage workers to compete with one another by working harder. The wealthy class implemented other methods to change how people thought about work in general, as we’ll see in the next section.

> **The Great Depression Made Work More Scarce and Valuable**
> 
> In _Your Money or Your Life_, Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez highlight another historic turning point in work culture that Headlee doesn’t discuss: the Great Depression. During this severe economic recession in the US, beginning in 1929, the lack of work opportunities and people’s dire financial needs encouraged the working class to value work more highly and shifted the power dynamic in favor of employers.
> 
> Robin and Dominguez assert that because of continued high unemployment throughout the 1930s, **people started to value work more than they valued leisure** , thus reversing the trend of the labor movement to reduce working hours. Workers still _needed_ to work long hours to make enough money to survive, except now they had fewer opportunities to do so, so the scarcity of employment made it more valuable.
> 
> Since most people still had to work for an employer to make a living and the higher demand for jobs pushed wages down, workers arguably had even less autonomy and bargaining leverage in the workplace than before. These competitive labor market conditions likely reduced the need for employers to actively persuade people to work more.

#### Cultural Pressure: Work as a Virtue and the American Dream

Headlee says that the **American elite exerted cultural pressure on people to work more** by promoting the Protestant idea that hard work is virtuous as well as the narrative of the American dream**—** the idea that you can rise through the ranks and get rich if you work hard enough. Although the Protestant church had been teaching that hard work is a virtue in the eyes of God (while idleness is a sin) since the 1500s, a 1904 book by the German sociologist Max Weber inspired capitalists to revive the idea in American culture to get people to willingly work longer hours.

In the book— _The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism_ —Weber **argued that linking morality to work was what fueled the booming capitalist economy in Europe in the industrial era**. Thus, upper-class Americans decided to use this tenet for their own financial gain as well. For example, Headlee suggests that in 1901, a prominent Episcopal leader received millions of dollars in donations from the financier J.P. Morgan to preach that wealth demonstrates that a person has good character (thereby encouraging people to work harder so upper-class employers could make more money).

> **The Debate on Weber’s Theory of the Protestant Ethic**
> 
> Although there’s a consensus that Weber’s book was highly influential, some critics disagree with his idea that the Protestant ethic drove capitalism in Europe and the US. For example, some scholars contend that Weber misinterpreted the Protestant doctrine, which encouraged _spiritual_ works (like prayer, for example) and not just any work.
> 
> They also point out that some Protestant leaders, such as John Calvin, preached against elements of capitalism like accumulating wealth. Others argue that since capitalism first flourished in commercial hubs in Italy, which were primarily Catholic, it was capitalism that influenced Protestantism, and not the other way around.
> 
> In terms of the tangible effects of Weber’s book, it’s difficult to find examples of how capitalists used the theory to their advantage since many sources focus on the legacy of the book within academia rather than an analysis of its real-world consequences. Likewise, while there are sources that corroborate J.P. Morgan’s financial contributions to the Episcopal Bishop William Lawrence in the earlier example, it’s difficult to prove whether Morgan made the donation for nefarious purposes, as Headlee suggests.

According to Headlee, employers also made people feel ashamed for taking time off or being idle and convinced laborers to work more by espousing stories of the “self-made man” and the idea of the American dream, in which people could become rich and improve their quality of life through hard work alone. Employers used propaganda such as posters and slogans to link hard work with morality, patriotism, and economic success—a technique that first became popular during World War I.

One example of this is a series of posters called the Mather Work Incentive Posters, which said things like, “Floaters Always Float Down Stream. The worker who drifts from one job to another, is always headed down-and-out. To get up and on, requires real effort, real work. The good places are all up stream”.

(Shortform note: Some historians write that this kind of media, targeted at encouraging hourly laborers to work harder, segued into a new fad in motivational work posters aimed more at _managers_. This trend coincides with a shift from an industrial-age emphasis on manufacturing to an information-age emphasis on creative work and information technology. Employers may have shifted to focusing on managers because it became important to have leaders coordinating efforts and facilitating large projects rather than having each worker do an individual task as efficiently as possible. Despite this distinction, the underlying goal of the materials still seems to be to encourage ideal traits and behaviors in employees, including hard work.)

Headlee writes that in addition to using posters and slogans to encourage work, business owners had to figure out how to _sell_ all the new products that workers were helping to make, so the marketing industry put additional pressure on people to make more money and keep up with consumer trends by buying new products. (Shortform note: In _User Friendly_ , Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant write that the feminist movement of the 1920s led to a natural increase in product demand, as more women wanted new household products like vacuum cleaners that would reduce the time they had to spend doing domestic labor. However, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, marketers had to exert more pressure on people to buy non-essential products.)

### The Productivity-Obsessed Culture of Today

Fast-forwarding to the modern age, Headlee says that **the cultural obsession with work ethic that started during the Industrial Era persists today, causing many people to choose to overwork themselves**. Many people still view hard work as a sign of good character, and when asked how they’re doing, “busy” is often the response that signals how important and valuable they are as a person (even if it’s stated in a complaining tone). As a result, many people willfully work far more than is necessary to survive.

> **Unpaid Labor and Compulsory Work**
> 
> Research supports the idea that some people are not only working more hours than they need to cover their expenses but also working more unpaid overtime. A 2021 study of workers in 17 countries found that 10% of workers put in more than 20 hours per week in unpaid labor.
> 
> Some experts assert that poor management practices are to blame and suggest that unpaid labor may not be entirely “voluntary” if temporary or new employees feel pressured to put in unpaid hours to prove themselves or keep their position. Others point out that shortages of employees due to layoffs or resignations can lead to extra pressure on the remaining employees. These factors suggest that an institutional approach to changing the current work culture might be appropriate in addition to changing individual mindsets (as Headlee focuses on).

However, Headlee shares a caveat to her assertion that people are choosing to overwork: This trend doesn’t apply to the many people who don’t have the luxury of _choosing_ to work less. This includes people who are involuntarily unemployed or underemployed (meaning they don’t get enough work hours to meet their needs) as well as those who are struggling to get by while working full-time.

Headlee writes that the modern pressure to constantly be productive largely stems from **changing perceptions of how valuable one’s time is and the pressure to achieve a more glamorous lifestyle**. She also points out the higher expectations on women to both have a successful career _and_ take care of their families.

> **Headlee’s Argument Applies to a Specific Subset of Workers**
> 
> Although Headlee generalizes about a global culture that’s preoccupied with productivity, there are complex factors at play that determine why some people choose to overwork, why some people can’t find work, and why some people have jobs that don’t have flexibility around scheduling and weekly work hours. Because of this complexity, it’s worth emphasizing that **her analysis (in this section and the rest of the guide) applies primarily to the subset of relatively well-off people who can choose to work less**.
> 
> In one example of the nuance around work culture, some experts specify that the concept of busyness as a status symbol and a “badge of honor” is common among higher-paid workers in particular. On the other hand, for people of lower socioeconomic status, the economic pressures during the Industrial Era that Headlee mentions are still a driving force of overworking. In addition, even among higher-paid workers, the ability to work fewer hours varies by industry.
> 
> Lastly, there are many identity-based factors that may influence whether people fall into Headlee’s category of those who don’t overwork because they’re unemployed or underemployed. These include gender, physical ability, race, and more.

#### Time Feels Scarce and Too Valuable to Squander

Although people aren’t working longer hours on average compared to the Industrial Revolution era, they still feel exhausted and overworked. Headlee says this is partly because as someone’s hourly wage or salary goes up, their time becomes more valuable. And because time is more valuable, it also feels more scarce. Thus, **people feel anxiety at the prospect of wasting time by not doing something productive**.

> **The Psychology of Scarcity**
> 
> Headlee doesn’t quite explain why time feels scarce as its monetary value goes up, but studies demonstrate that the reverse is true: When something is scarce, and therefore more difficult to acquire, people attribute a higher value to it. Therefore, Headlee might be implying that this association works both ways for people psychologically—if something has a high monetary value, people assume it must be because it’s in short supply.
> 
> Research also supports the idea that regardless of how many hours you’re working, the _feeling_ of time scarcity is enough to derail your mental well-being and schedule. In _Scarcity_ , Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir explain that feeling stressed about not having enough time decreases your mental bandwidth, which makes you more likely to make bad decisions about time management. For example, you might procrastinate on cleaning your house, even though you know it will take longer if you put it off. This causes a negative spiral as you accumulate more things to do and feel increasingly stressed about the scarcity of time.

As a result, the urge to be productive spills over into people’s non-professional lives, so even when people aren’t at work, they feel like they should be still pursuing self-improvement or self-advancement. This means that activities that should be relaxing, like meditating, often become tiresome and stressful because people overanalyze the activity with an app, or post it on social media to impress others. In other words, activities turn into work when they’re goal-oriented instead of being done just for the sake of enjoying life in that moment.

(Shortform note: One counterargument to this idea is that being productive can also be a way to cope with negative feelings and stress rather than a _cause_ of them. Psychologists say that because productivity releases endorphins (hormones that make you feel good), it can be a good way to boost your mood and confidence. However, experts also warn that you can stay busy to an unhealthy extent, which will exacerbate the negative feelings you were trying to avoid in the first place. This suggests that it’s important to strike a balance between being productive to cope with stress and giving yourself a break from productivity to process the sources of that stress.)

#### Chasing Economic Advancement and Social Status

Headlee argues that another reason behind the modern obsession with work is the **pressure to achieve a more luxurious lifestyle by working hard and making more money**. As we mentioned in the first section, the narrative of the worker who gets rich by never taking a day off dates back over a hundred years. The problem with this, Headlee says, is that social media causes people to chase ever more glamorous lives as they compare themselves not only to the people around them but to the billionaires and millionaires that take up a disproportionate amount of media space.

(Shortform note: Psychologists affirm Headlee’s argument that social media exacerbates the negative aspects of social comparison—instead of feeling inspired to improve something about yourself when looking at social media, you’re more likely to suffer a drop in self-esteem because you only ever see the highly curated, best parts of other people’s lives. Some tips to avoid the negative effects of social comparison are to compare your current self to your past self to reflect on your progress, focus on gratitude for what you have, identify strengths that you have in common with others, and limit your social media time.)

Headlee also points to capitalism and the psychology behind consumerism as driving forces behind the compulsion to work more to buy things. To keep the economy growing, people have to keep spending money, so **the marketing industry continues to put enormous amounts of resources into making people feel like they need to buy products to be happy**.

Headlee notes that psychologically, people _do_ get a boost of happiness when they get something new. Unfortunately, when the novelty wears off, they need _another_ new thing to feel that joy again, so what someone has never feels like enough. The same vicious cycle occurs with people’s salaries as a result of what psychologists call the “hedonic treadmill”—the phenomenon in which humans go back to a baseline level of happiness after something good (or bad) happens.

(Shortform note: Although the cultural pressure to buy new things has been part of the global culture since the Industrial Era, data suggest that consumerism in the US is higher than ever. Some experts point to several driving factors behind increased spending: the ease of digital shopping and the ability to impulsively buy things anywhere, at any time, as well as the constant exposure to digital advertising. Psychologists recommend resisting the trappings of consumerism and the hedonic treadmill by keeping a gratitude journal and doing altruistic and meaningful activities like volunteering.)

#### Women Experience Additional Pressures

Headlee also argues that women are disproportionately burdened by the modern work culture because **they’re expected to do more unpaid domestic labor (such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare), often while working outside of the home for less pay** on average. Headlee writes that women with children tend to be paid less than women without children, while the opposite is true for men. This means that many women have more economic pressure and more family duties to juggle on top of the cultural expectations to be ultra-productive at work and outside of work.

(Shortform note: Research shows that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this unequal distribution of labor in many households. One global study found that women did three times as much additional childcare compared to men in 2020. This widened the existing income gap since many women had to work less or stop working to care for their children.)

### The Negative Consequences of Working Too Much

Now that we’ve described the nature of the modern work culture, we’ll explain how working too much becomes counterproductive in many ways. Headlee argues that the work-obsessed culture has led to lower efficiency, worse mental and physical health, and an unhealthy addiction to technology.

#### Lower Efficiency

One of the main ways people try to fit more into the day is by multitasking—for example, responding to emails and text messages as they come in while also working on writing a report and scrolling through social media. Yet Headlee says that instead of getting more done at once, people take _more_ time to do each task than it would take if they focused on one thing at a time. This is because despite our best efforts, the human brain isn’t capable of multitasking. Instead, we take extra time constantly _switching_ between different tasks.

(Shortform note: In _The One Thing_ , Gary Keller explains that task-switching itself can become addictive because you get a little jolt of dopamine—a feel-good brain chemical—each time you shift your attention toward a new task. In addition to the decreased efficiency in work contexts that Headlee points out, Keller notes that multitasking in social situations can erode your personal relationships, and multitasking while driving can be extremely dangerous. His key advice to counteract the downsides of multitasking is to focus on doing the one thing that matters most at a given moment. For example, if you’re hanging out with friends, focus on enjoying quality time with them rather than glancing at phone notifications.)

In addition to trying to multitask, people often work long hours, thinking they’ll get more accomplished or impress their boss by showing how hard they work. However, Headlee says that although many companies measure productivity by work hours, research shows that people work more efficiently when they work fewer hours and take frequent breaks. This is because people can only do about an hour of focused work at a time on average.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that the number of productive work hours you can put in also depends on the type of work you do. One article asserts that if you’re doing more repetitive work, your productivity maxes out at 40 hours per week, but if you’re doing creative work, it tops out at 20 hours per week. This suggests that even with breaks, there are limits to the amount of work you can do before there are diminishing returns on your effort. To account for the counterintuitive relationship between work hours and productivity, some experts suggest measuring employee productivity based on things like objectives achieved in a given time period.)

And, Headlee adds, we tend to make a task length stretch to the amount of time available to do it. Therefore, working long hours can lead to inefficiencies like taking a whole workday to complete a task that could have been done in a few hours (with breaks in between) if given a strict stopping point. (Shortform note: Research also suggests that setting challenging time parameters for your work improves efficiency because it causes physiological arousal (such as an increased heart rate) that motivates a boost in effort. However, _too_ much stress around the time constraint can backfire and cause a decline in productivity.)

#### Worse Mental and Physical Health

Although many people state that they enjoy work or they feel better when they’re being productive, Headlee counters that this is partly due to the cultural conditioning that shames people into working hard, when the reality is that overworking has a negative impact on people’s mental and physical health. (Shortform note: Some experts posit that being passionate about your work and enjoying your work make you more susceptible to burnout (mental and physical exhaustion). This is because you’re more likely to think that you can and should be working all the time—you rationalize that it doesn’t really _feel_ like work and that the output is meaningful to you. Many studies suggest that regardless of your motivations to work hard, you can overdo it.)

Headlee cites research that says that **half of all visits to the doctor in the US are linked to stress-related health problems** , and Headlee attributes this trend to the rise in work and productivity-related stress. Research indicates that feeling stressed about not having enough time can lead to insomnia, anxiety, lower levels of happiness, and obesity. In contrast, companies that reduce work hours tend to maintain productivity while improving the emotional and physical health of their employees.

(Shortform note: Rather than focusing on working _less_ due to the link between work stress and poor health, some researchers point to ways we can improve jobs to make them less conducive to stress-related illness. For example, experts assert that jobs support employees' well-being when workers have agency over their decisions, can develop and use new skills, and work in a supportive and respectful environment. Therefore, managing both the quality and quantity of work might be an effective approach to improving your health.)

#### Unhealthy Technology Usage

Another downside of prioritizing productivity above all else is that it tends to make technologies that _enable_ productivity—like smartphones—an integral part of people’s day-to-day lives. Headlee argues that this, in turn, has a slew of negative consequences.

One major impact of the frequent use of technology is that it **allows work to seep into people’s personal lives when they’re off the clock**. Smartphones and laptops enable people to stay connected 24/7, and as a result, there’s more pressure to respond to work emails and phone calls even when someone is meant to be enjoying time off. This means that there’s less separation between on-the-job time and off-time, and many people feel like they can never fully relax.

(Shortform note: A counterargument to these points is that technology also provides benefits such as the flexibility to work from home and adapt your work schedule to your other needs. For example, by working from home, you could spend less time commuting to work and more time with your family. To preserve these benefits and keep technology from interrupting your personal life, some experts recommend techniques to establish boundaries between work time and off-time even if you work from home. For example, try doing a daily routine when you start and stop work to delineate the transition and having a specific physical area that you use for work (and if possible, closing the door to your office after hours).)

Another impact of the constant use of technology is that it **interferes with sleep patterns** because the blue light emitted from screens tricks your brain into thinking that it’s daytime (and therefore time to be alert). This hinders the release of the hormone melatonin, which helps you sleep.

In addition, Headlee says that digital **device notifications stimulate a physiological fight-or-flight response** , which releases stress hormones. Simply having your smartphone near you, and therefore having the _possibility_ of receiving a notification, can distract you from being present.

Lastly, Headlee writes that the **frequent use of social media is (ironically) causing social isolation**. Instead of having deeper relationships with a smaller circle of friends, people are replacing those relationships with an overwhelming number of superficial, digital connections. Headlee says that a person’s social media network tends to include too many people to genuinely empathize and keep in contact with. In addition, the digital interactions are less intimate than in-person and vocal interactions, so the countless digital exchanges that people have daily are less emotionally gratifying.

> **Attention Economy in the Age of Information**
> 
> In _How to Do Nothing_ , Jenny Odell links these negative effects of technology to the rise of the attention economy, or the monetization of people’s attention through apps, social media, ad-supported websites, and so on. Unlike the process of industrialization, which Headlee argues led to a change in the type and amount of work people were doing, we’re now in a period of de-industrialization in which economies are shifting away from manufacturing and toward a knowledge- and service-based economy.
> 
> As a result, companies profit not only from people’s labor and purchases of physical items but also from holding people’s attention as long as possible. Spending excessive amounts of time on technology then exacerbates the problems that Headlee describes: sleep disruption, physiological stress responses to notifications, increased digital communication, and more social isolation.
> 
> Some of Odell’s practical tips for resisting the attention economy include spending time in nature, learning about the local history of where you live, and taking the time to get to know your neighbors. She also warns that doing a temporary detox or getaway from technology might help reduce your stress in the short term, but it doesn’t eliminate the mindset of viewing time and attention in terms of monetary value. Therefore, it’s also important to increase your awareness of how companies manipulate your attention and resist the urge to monetize your free time.

### How to Live a Healthier Life

Given the negative consequences of a productivity-obsessed culture—the inefficiency and the tolls it takes on people’s minds and bodies—Headlee concludes that working more than we need to support ourselves simply isn’t good for us. She explains that she experienced many years of struggling financially as a single mother, and even when her career started to provide financial stability and the flexibility of self-employment, it wasn’t enough to relieve her stress around work and time. She realized that it wasn’t her boss or her smartphone that fundamentally caused her problem but the cultural norms and expectations that encouraged her to willfully overwork herself.

(Shortform note: Headlee’s personal experience aligns with data showing that people who are self-employed tend to work more on average than people who aren’t. In addition to the cultural pressure Headlee refers to, this may also be because their earnings are more directly tied to the time they put into their work as opposed to someone who has a fixed salary or hourly rate.)

Based on her own experience making positive changes to the way she lives and works, **Headlee advises on how to live a healthier life—with ample leisure and social connection—by being more intentional about how you spend your time** (she refers to these tidbits of advice as “life-backs,” as a play on the phrase “life hacks”).

(Shortform note: Although Headlee focuses on leisure and social connection as avenues for healthful living—especially for people who are overworking—many wellness experts differ in their view of what people need to achieve a healthy life. For example, in _Ikigai_ , Héctor García and Francesc Miralles draw inspiration from the Okinawan people of Japan to define a set of guidelines for a long and happy life. They recommend practicing mindfulness techniques to decrease stress, doing mental exercises to revitalize the mind, doing physical exercises such as yoga and tai chi, and improving your diet by eating less food and more varied food.)

#### Change Your Mindset

The first way to improve your mindset around productivity and time is to **increase your awareness of how you spend your time.** Headlee says that by keeping a log of how you spend your day, you’re likely to discover that you have more time than you thought you had to get everything done. Realizing that you _do_ have enough time to get all the essentials done will greatly reduce your stress levels and anxiety around time. It might also help you pinpoint aspects of your schedule you’d like to change—for example, if you notice that you spend far more time on social media or writing emails than you thought you did.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins recommends different approaches to changing your perspective on time to reduce anxiety. One technique is to change the time frame you’re thinking about when you’re feeling stressed. For example, when you’re overwhelmed by the tasks at hand in the present, shift your thoughts to the future (when you’ll have everything done). Or when you’re worried about the future, focus on what you can do proactively in the present. Robbins supplements strategies to change your mindset around time with time management strategies, such as prioritizing _important_ tasks over urgent ones.)

The next mindset shift Headlee describes is **focusing on larger goals rather than the steps you take to achieve the goals**. She explains that we often get too caught up in a goal's metrics or stepping stones, to the point that we forget about the ultimate reason for doing something.

For example, perhaps you want to feel healthier, so you start a strict yoga class regimen. However, if missing a session makes you feel stressed, or you force yourself to go even when you don’t feel physically up for it, the activity can become counterproductive to your initial goal. Instead, it might be better for your health to keep the class schedule flexible and take days off when your body needs rest. Headlee says that while metrics _can_ be helpful, remember that there are many ways of reaching a goal, so focus on what’s important to you in the long term.

(Shortform note: In the business industry, the phenomenon that Headlee describes is also referred to as “surrogation”—when you conflate a metric with your overall strategy. In this context, the company might have an overarching goal to improve customer satisfaction, which it decides to measure using customer surveys. However, if the metric itself becomes a high-stakes target for employees, it may lead to unethical behavior of falsifying data or could lead to employees pestering the customers to respond to surveys, which _decreases_ customers’ satisfaction with the company. Some experts recommend avoiding this by using multiple metrics for each larger strategy and decreasing the link between incentives (such as bonuses) and metrics.)

#### Change Your Scheduling and Work Habits

Headlee's next tips are for changing your scheduling and work habits. Her first piece of advice is to do more focused work so that you can **work fewer hours while getting the same amount done.** If you have flexibility in your schedule, she recommends working for about 50 minutes at a time, followed by a short break to recharge.

(Shortform note: Headlee’s advice to work in 50-minute sessions with short breaks in between is similar to the Pomodoro technique of working in blocks of 25-minute focused work sessions followed by a 5 minute break, and then taking a longer 15 to 30 minute break after four of those cycles. In addition to working in shorter, more focused bursts, research suggests that you can work more efficiently by setting short deadlines for specific tasks. In _Scarcity_ , Mullainathan and Sendhil explain that this is because we naturally work more effectively as a deadline looms. Thus, the combination of short deadlines and shorter working sessions could significantly reduce the amount of time you spend on a project or task.)

Headlee also **recommends not working any more than your job requires** , since the accompanying stress and exhaustion from being overworked isn’t worth the career-related benefits you may or may not get from it.

(Shortform note: Headlee’s advice to stop working optional hours is sometimes referred to as “quiet quitting”—a practice that many younger workers have adopted of reclaiming their time by not doing anything non-essential for work. Proponents of quiet quitting argue that it’s crucial for people to develop their sense of identity and self-worth outside of work. Some argue that the Covid-19 pandemic reinforced this principle as work became less social and less enjoyable for remote workers. A 2022 study suggests that about 50% of workers are quiet quitting, although others argue that this number isn’t much different from the last couple of decades.)

Another work-related tip is to **work in groups when you can**. Headlee says that although many people feel that working independently is more efficient, research suggests that diverse groups are more efficient at problem-solving and making optimal decisions compared to individuals. Thus, collaborating with others can save you time and produce better results.

(Shortform note: Headlee doesn’t specify what _kind_ of diversity to strive for in your work groups, but some experts assert that cognitive diversity in particular facilitates efficient problem-solving. For example, it’s better to have a mix of people who prefer to synthesize the ideas of others and people who like to generate new ideas, rather than people who approach tasks in the same way.)

Lastly, **create your dream schedule and include ample leisure time**. Headlee says your dream schedule doesn’t have to be strictly followed, but writing it down will give you something to strive for. Remember to include leisure activities—anything that’s purely for enjoyment like going for a walk, reading outside, doing a craft, or playing music.

(Shortform note: If you’re not sure where to start with your leisurely dream schedule, in _The Happiness Project_ , Gretchen Rubin offers advice for how to discover new opportunities for leisure. First, try keeping a log, where you record things that pique your interest—locations on a map to visit or new activities you’d like to try, for example. Second, peruse random magazines or listen to a new podcast to expose yourself to new topics that might inspire a hobby or pastime.)

Having these periods of **rest is essential because it improves mental health and activates a state of mind known as the default mode network (DMN)**. The DMN activates when your brain isn’t working on a task, and in this state, we naturally process emotions and decisions, reflect on memories, think about how others feel, and daydream about the future. Headlee says that the DMN sparks creativity and growth since our brain is free to consider things from new angles.

(Shortform note: Similar to Headlee’s argument here, Chris Bailey’s _Hyperfocus_ espouses the benefits of what he refers to as “intentional mind wandering.” He clarifies that in order to maximize these benefits—like creative ideas or plans about the future that this mental state inspires—it’s best to jot down any insights that occur to you so you can access them later. Otherwise, you may not remember the brilliant ideas you conjured while in the DMN.)

#### Change How You Interact With Others

Headlee’s next set of advice for achieving a healthier life centers around your interactions with others. First, **avoid making unhealthy comparisons about your productivity**. Headlee asserts that your perception of how busy other people are is likely inaccurate anyway since many people try to outdo one another when it comes to busyness. In addition, she says that comparing yourself to someone online can be unhealthy because they might have a lifestyle that’s unobtainable—like celebrities, for example—and the comparison is more likely to make you feel bad than it is to inspire you.

(Shortform note: One way to let go of damaging social comparison is to engage in creative activities. According to Brené Brown’s _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , doing activities like painting, drawing, creating new recipes, and writing fosters a sense of individuality and helps remind you of your unique skills (since no one will express things in quite the same way that you do).)

Another way to improve your well-being and avoid some of the pitfalls of overworking is to **schedule social time and make an effort to interact in person with others**. Headlee asserts that while many people use technology to avoid conversations and small talk with acquaintances and strangers, these small social interactions—like chatting with your mail carrier—improve your health and make you feel more relaxed. As we mentioned earlier, deeper relationships are also important, so set aside time to regularly catch up with friends and stay connected with loved ones.

(Shortform note: In _Digital Minimalism_ , Cal Newport echoes Headlee’s assertion that in-person social time is crucial to well-being. However, given that technologies are integral to our lives, he argues that we can improve the impact of technology on our relationships by changing how we use devices to communicate. He recommends using text-based communication exclusively for planning and coordinating non-digital conversations and sharing simple logistic information. For example, instead of catching up with a friend via a messaging app, you would instead exchange messages to plan an in-person meetup.)

Headlee’s last recommendation is to **do a small act of kindness every day** to counteract the lack of social connection and mental-well being that overworking causes. This could include cooking a meal for someone, or something small like giving a sincere compliment. Acting kindly and generously toward others not only helps the recipient but also makes the person doing the act feel happier and less stressed. Headlee explains that humans are social creatures (we thrive in communities, not in isolation), so we evolved to receive psychological benefits from altruism, which increases social cohesion. Plus, these benefits have a ripple effect because the recipient is more likely to do something nice for someone else, too.

(Shortform note: Similar to the way altruism increases the chances of a community’s survival and provides mental health benefits, self-compassion improves an individual’s likelihood of survival due to its health benefits: One research study shows that acts of self-kindness lower your heart rate and reduce other bodily stress responses such as sweating, and this physical state of relaxation enables your body to heal faster.)
