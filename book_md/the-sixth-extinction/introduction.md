## Introduction

Around two hundred thousand years ago, in eastern Africa, a new species emerged. While not especially strong, fast, or prolific, the newcomer— _Homo sapiens_ —proved to be uniquely inventive.

In _The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History_ , journalist Elizabeth Kolbert argues that our species today is rapidly changing the shape of the earth and the composition of the atmosphere, in the process unleashing a mass extinction of most living things, quite possibly including ourselves. **Scientists have identified five previous mass extinction events (plus smaller disasters) over 500 million years and many believe a sixth extinction, set in motion by modern humans, is underway**.

Humans began impacting the world from the start. As their population grew, modern humans spread from East Africa into new regions, undeterred by climate or geographic barriers like rivers and mountains. Humans adapted to the conditions and food supply wherever they landed—for instance, along coasts, they ate shellfish, while inland, they hunted mammals.

When they arrived in Europe, they found Neanderthals, archaic humans similar to themselves, and interbred with them before wiping them out. As modern humans spread, they encountered gigantic animals—huge bears, elephant-sized turtles, fifteen-foot-tall sloths—which they also were able to wipe out by killing them faster than they could reproduce. Humans even found ways to cross the seas, reaching islands inhabited by fantastic creatures, such as giant skinks and birds that laid foot-long eggs, many of which they annihilated. (Shortform note: Learn more about how modern humans became the world’s dominant species in our summary of _Sapiens_.)

They—we—rapidly multiplied and started demolishing forests to grow food and spreading animals, plants, and organisms to new continents, thus changing the face of the earth. With the discovery of fossil fuels underground, we began our greatest transformation—of the makeup of the atmosphere and the oceans. Some plants and animals have survived by migrating. But many, possibly millions, are stranded where they are unable, or lack time, to adapt. **Extinction rates are skyrocketing. No other species has so drastically changed life on earth**.

The Big Five mass extinction events of the distant past each suddenly decimated the earth’s diversity of life, the most “recent” being an asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs and other life 66 million years ago.

(Shortform note: The “Big Five” mass extinctions were:

1) **The End Ordovician period** , 444 million years ago, 86% of species lost. The cause was a sudden cooling of the climate (carbon dioxide levels and temperatures dropped and things froze—glaciation) plus a huge drop in sea levels and an ocean chemistry change.

2) **Late Devonian** , 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost.

3) **End Permian** , 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost. This extinction seems to have been triggered by a sudden warming of the climate.

4) **End Triassic** , 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost.

5) **End Cretaceous** , 66 million years ago, 76% of all species lost when an asteroid traveling at 45,000 miles an hour crashed into the Yucatan Peninsula.)

By a twist of fate, just as we’re learning more about how these five mass extinctions occurred, we’re also beginning to grasp that our species is causing a Sixth Extinction.

This Pulitzer Prize-winning book traces our path to the Sixth Extinction by telling the stories of many unique species—some long gone and some going extinct as you read these words. Although the author reports from research outposts in the Amazon, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Andes, where scientists are trying to understand and slow the devastation, she notes that species die-offs are happening everywhere, probably including in your backyard. We live in an “extraordinary moment” that’s both riveting and terrifying.
