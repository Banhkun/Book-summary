## Chapter 7: Impacts—The End of Coral Reefs

**Corals have endured for many geologic epochs, but researchers believe they won’t survive the Anthropocene.** Instead, they’re on a course to be the first major ecological system to go extinct. The driving forces are acidification and climate change.

Some scientists project they’ll last out the century; others don’t give them even that long.

One paper in _Nature_ predicted that visitors to the Great Barrier Reef in 2050 will find it rapidly disintegrating.

Coral reefs stretch around the middle of the globe. The largest is the Great Barrier Reef, which extends, with breaks, for more than fifteen hundred miles; in some places, it’s five hundred feet thick. The next largest is off the coast of Belize. There also are sizeable reefs in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea, plus smaller reefs in the Caribbean.

Reefs are enchanting in their beauty—Darwin described them as “amongst the wonderful objects of the world.” Biologically, they are even more distinctive. Yet they are under dire threat.

### How Reef-Building Corals Work

Coral reefs are strong enough to destroy ships, yet they’re built by generations of tiny marine invertebrates called polyps that work together as communities, each secreting calcium carbonate to form a hard exoskeleton. Corals get nutrients from a microscopic plant (_zooxanthellae_) that lives in their tissues.

Among calcifiers, corals are master builders. Billions of individuals belonging to one hundred different species join forces to build a reef, which is a living, constantly growing structure.

Reefs are comparable to rainforests in the immense variety of life they support. **Millions of marine species spend part of their lives on reefs, depending on them for protection or food.** Additional species prey on those using reefs for protection or food. Researchers have cracked open small chunks of coral and found hundreds of species—one volleyball-sized piece contained fourteen hundred worms of one hundred and three species.

Coral are highly sensitive to ocean acidification. They need a certain “saturation state” or concentration of carbonate ions in seawater in order to create their exoskeletons. Acidification lowers carbonate ion concentrations.

Because reefs are always being eroded by waves and eaten by fish, they have to keep growing.

Research in Biosphere 2, a closed glass structure containing different habitats in Arizona, showed that coral grow fastest at a saturation state of five, and grow more slowly at four and three. They stop calcifying at level two. Currently, the saturation state virtually everywhere is four or less. Based on current trends, there won’t be any ocean areas above level 3.5 by 2026 and none above three by 2100.

Once a year, corals engage in mass spawning, in which the polyps release eggs and sperm together in bundles that break open after release. Ideally, eggs and sperm connect and produce larvae. However, acidification and lower saturation states reduce fertilization. They also hinder larval development and establishment to begin new colonies.

Other research has confirmed that diversity plummets as acidification increases and causes the saturation state to drop. According to one study, **coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef has decreased by 50% over the past thirty years.** Researchers project that at current emission rates, all reefs will stop growing and begin dissolving in the next fifty years.

### Climate Change and Other Threats

Acidification’s “evil twin,” climate change, also is a significant threat to reef-building corals because it increases water temperatures. When the water temperature rises too high, _zooxanthellae_ , the microscopic plant that lives in coral and provides it with carbs through photosynthesis, starts producing harmful concentrations of oxygen radicals. The coral then eject the _zooxanthellae._ Because these organisms also give reefs their color, the reefs turn white, which is referred to as coral bleaching; they stop growing and die. Significant bleaching occurred in 1998, 2005, and 2010 and is expected to increase as temperatures continue to rise.

Research reported in _Science_ in 2008 found that, **of eight hundred reef-building coral species studied, a third are at risk of extinction, primarily due to increasing water temperatures.** The researchers wrote that “the proportion of coral species listed as threatened exceeds that of most terrestrial animal groups apart from amphibians.” Thanks to global warming, reef-building corals are one of the planet’s most endangered groups.

Corals also face other threats, some of which are more immediate, including:

  * Overfishing, which stimulates the growth of algae that compete with corals. (Overfishing includes dynamite fishing, which damages coral).
  * Agricultural runoff, which promotes algae growth.
  * Deforestation, which leads to erosion and muddies water.



Stresses make coral vulnerable to diseases, such as white-band disease, a bacterial infection that has devastated two species of Caribbean coral, both of which are listed as critically endangered.

(Shortform note: The author doesn’t explicitly discuss the larger implications of the loss of coral reefs, but we see two themes through the book. First, coral reefs can be like the canary in the coal mine, warning us of eventual dangers to ourselves. Secondly, they’re a key part of the ocean ecosystem where they exist, and their loss could have consequences throughout the food chain.)
