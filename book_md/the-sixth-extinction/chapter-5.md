## Chapter 5: A New Science of Extinction

Today’s science of extinction developed from a series of paradigm shifts.

Sociologist Thomas Kuhn came up with the paradigm shift idea in 1962 to explain how **a fundamental change in the basic concepts of scientific discipline leads to a totally new way of thinking**. Kuhn showed through studies that when people receive “disruptive” information, which goes against their beliefs, they first try to fit it into their current thinking or framework. They disregard aspects that don’t fit for as long as possible.

When the inconsistencies between the new information and their old way of thinking become too great to ignore, they reach a crisis point. They have what psychologists call a “My God!” reaction and begin to assimilate the new reality.

Both individuals and entire fields of study experience this process. In science, new data that doesn’t fit accepted assumptions and principles is dismissed or rationalized. As the contradictory information grows, the explanations become crazier until people finally acknowledge the new reality. The old framework collapses and the paradigm shifts, opening the way for new insights.

The science of extinction evolved in this way. There wasn’t any concept of extinction until the latter part of the eighteenth century. When strange bones were found, naturalists tried to match them to something familiar—for instance, arguing that mammoths were a type of elephant. Then Cuvier changed the paradigm by showing through fossils that life had a progression and suggesting that species disappeared due to a catastrophic event.

However, so many extinct creatures were discovered in different time periods that the single-catastrophe framework weakened. Counter-arguments for slow extinction—the uniformitarian explanation—lasted for a century, until the discovery of the iridium layer, showing that a catastrophe did occur. And science faced a crisis undermining the uniformitarian view.

Today, the paradigm for extinction combines elements of both Cuvier’s and Darwin’s beliefs: **Life on earth consists of long periods of almost imperceptible change punctuated by calamity.** Or, as one researcher described it, “long periods of boredom interrupted occasionally by panic.”

But science hasn’t been able to come up with a “unified” theory for mass extinctions. The asteroid strike theory doesn’t explain the other big mass extinctions. It turns out that the Big Five extinctions had various causes, and climate change was a major player in at least two.

### The First Extinction: End Ordovician

**Scientists believe the first extinction occurred at the End Ordovician period 444 million years ago** and eliminated 86% of marine species (there were no land animals). It was precipitated by some sort of spontaneous climate change, in this case, a cooling rather than an asteroid strike.

The Ordovician followed the Cambrian period, during which new life forms grew exponentially—for example, marine animal types tripled and the first plants started to appear on land. However, catastrophic change at the end of the Ordovician occurred as a result of: 1) sudden cooling of the climate (carbon dioxide levels and temperatures dropped and things froze—glaciation) and 2) a huge drop in sea levels plus an ocean chemistry change resulting from the drop in CO2.

Graptolites, a class of marine organisms, were nearly wiped out. However, a few survived; they repopulated the oceans in the next period—the Silurian—but they differed in shape from the graptolites that went extinct. The survivors can be seen in the form of fossils in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, at an outcropping of rock called Dob’s Linn.

### The Third Extinction: End Permian

The End Permian extinction of 251 million years ago—the most devastating of the Big Five, eliminating 96% of species—seems to have been triggered by a sudden warming of the climate.

For unknown reasons, an enormous amount of carbon was released into the air. Temperatures shot up as much as 18 degrees; the seas heated up and became acidified. Oxygen levels in the water plummeted, probably suffocating nearly all life.

Possibly, bacteria that produce hydrogen sulfide suddenly multiplied in the oceans, killing marine life, and the oceans in turn released toxic gases into the air, which killed nearly everything else. Geologically, it was brief, lasting only one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand years, but it nearly eliminated multicellular life.

### The Anthropocene Epoch

Every mass extinction event has its own unique causes. Suddenly, living organisms face drastically changed conditions, for which they’re not prepared. Eons later, signs left in rock reveal their demise and offer clues to the conditions that caused it.

**One hundred million years from now, all our achievements—structures, monuments, works of art, cities—will be compressed to a paper-thin layer of sediment.** The mass extinction event we are precipitating will leave its own evidence in rock—of nuclear fallout, river diversion, monoculture farming, ocean acidification, and our dispersal of species around the globe.

**As a result of these man-made changes, scientists believe we’ve entered a new epoch—the Anthropocene or human-dominated geological epoch** —named by Dutch chemist Paul Crutzen, who shared a Nobel Prize for research into ozone depletion.

Crutzen identified the following geologic-scale changes brought about so far by people:

  * Transformation of up to half of the planet’s land surface.
  * Diversion of most of the world’s major rivers.
  * The manufacture of more nitrogen than is fixed naturally. (Shortform note: “Fixing” is the process of converting nitrogen in the air into compounds in the soil that are usable by plants.)
  * Removal of more than a third of fish and other marine life from the oceans’ coastal waters.
  * Use of more than half of the world’s accessible freshwater runoff.



#### Changing the Atmosphere

Most importantly, **we’ve changed the composition of the atmosphere by adding vast amounts of carbon dioxide** —over two hundred years, the level of carbon dioxide in the air has risen by 40%. As a result, Crutzen contends, the earth’s climate is likely to behave much differently for many millennia to come.

By burning fossil fuels, we’ve added 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. By cutting down forests, we’ve contributed another 180 billion tons; each year we add

9 billion tons more.

**The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—over four hundred parts per million—is higher than it’s been in more than a million years.** At our current emissions rate, it will exceed five hundred parts per million by 2050, boosting the average global temperature by 3½ to 7 degrees Fahrenheit. This will melt what remains of the glaciers and the Arctic ice cap and flood islands and coastal cities, such as New York and Washington, D.C.

**There’s also an equally destructive flipside to carbon emissions: ocean acidification**.
