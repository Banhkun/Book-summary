## Chapter 9: Impacts—Fragmentation of Habitat

As humans have reshaped the earth’s landmass, we’ve constrained the ability of other species to survive the life-altering effects of global warming.

Currently, the earth contains about fifty million square miles of land not covered by ice. We’ve transformed more than half—27 million square miles—into cities, highways and shopping centers, cropland and pasture, logging and mining operations, and manufacturing plants. That leaves 23 million square miles, which are mostly (three-fifths) forest; the other two-fifths are high mountains, tundra, and desert.

Another way of looking at how we use the planet is by dividing the landmass into “anthromes,” or human-altered zones, such as urban, irrigated cropland, and populated forest. Researchers have identified eighteen anthromes covering 39 million square miles. That leaves 11 million square miles of wildland, including parts of the Amazon, Siberia, northern Canada, and the deserts.

However, there’s virtually no area left that’s truly untouched—roads, logging, and mining have sliced up and cut off every wild area to some extent. There are two results: **1) species lose the ability to move or flee, and 2) their ability to reproduce declines and extinction becomes more likely.**

Brazil’s Reserve 1202, a twenty-five-acre block of untouched Amazon rainforest surrounded by cut-over forest and brush, illustrates the survival challenges we’ve created for other species.

It’s part of a string of forest “islands” known as the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project or BDFFP, an experiment enabled by cooperation between ranchers and conservationists. In the 1970s, the Brazilian government gave ranchers a stipend as an incentive to create new ranchland by clearing rainforest. At the same time, they had to leave at least half the forest on their property intact. Scientists now known as “fragmentologists” have been managing and studying these untouched fragments for thirty years. What they’re learning is how species respond to isolated, shrinking habitats.

Birds are an example. Reserve 1202 has at least thirteen hundred bird species. At first, birds from the surrounding deforested areas took shelter in the fragment, increasing the number of species. But gradually, the number of bird species declined. Some species, for instance, wouldn’t cross roads or cleared areas to get to the reserve. Ultimately, in all of the fragments, birds and other species experienced steady declines. Overall biodiversity dropped.

Similarly, ocean islands typically have less biodiversity. To start with, some species probably don’t have enough room—for instance, a large cat that needs an average of forty square miles can’t thrive when confined to a twenty-square-mile area. But the problem isn’t just the amount of habitat. Species don’t level off—they keep declining.

Smaller populations are more prone to local extinction because they have a harder time recovering from chance disasters. For instance, the last breeding pair of a certain bird species might see its nest destroyed by a storm one year and raided by predators the next. The following year, the chicks might die of disease or turn out to be all males. So, the species eventually dies out. Depending on how accessible the habitat fragment is, new members of the species may or may not be able to recolonize it. Local extinctions can eventually become regional and then global.

Forest fragment researchers in the Amazon islands have found:

  * While there are six species of primates in the area of the BDFFP, there are only two in the fragments.
  * Peccaries (pig-like animals) disappeared from the fragments along with frog species that bred in their wallows.
  * Birds that forage in mixed flocks mostly disappeared from the smaller fragments and declined in the larger ones.
  * Near the edges of the fragments, species sensitive to changes in light and warmer temperatures declined, but butterflies that like sunlight increased.



As noted in regard to forest reserves in the Andes, species that need to move to adjust to continually warming temperatures will run out of room to move in habitat fragments. Man-made barriers—cities, highways, deforested areas—will impede movement as well, further challenging many species’ ability to survive even as man-made changes compel them to move.
