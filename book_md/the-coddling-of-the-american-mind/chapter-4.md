## Chapter 4: “Violent” Speech, Violent Response

In the first three chapters, we focused on the Three Great Untruths. To recap, they are:

  * Avoid discomfort and adversity at all costs.
  * Always trust your emotions over logic and reason.
  * The world is defined by a black-and-white struggle between good and evil.



In this chapter, we’ll look closer at one of the main _effects_ of these ideas—how they have convinced many students that violence and intimidation are acceptable, even necessary, responses to speech that they dislike.

Specifically, we’ll focus on:

  * The idea that certain forms of speech are equivalent to violence, and that physical violence is therefore a justified response to them
  * How left-wing college protesters have internalized this logic and used it to harass and intimidate those they perceive as their opponents on campus 



### Speech as Violence

In a 2017 _New York Times_ essay, Northeastern University professor Lisa Feldman Barrett made the argument that **certain forms of speech ought to be considered a form of violence.**

The logic of this argument is that inflammatory speech can cause emotional distress. Emotional distress, in turn, can have harmful effects on one’s physical health. Therefore, since some forms of speech can lead to physical harm, such speech ought to be considered the moral equivalent of physical violence.

But this is a deceptively simple formulation. **By this logic, almost _anything_ could be considered an act of violence, since anything is likely to be emotionally stressful to at least _someone_.** Anything that causes stress would therefore be considered “violent.” A parent telling their kids to clean their room or to do their homework (either of which might trigger stress) would be violent if one carried the premise of Barrett’s argument to its logical conclusion.

Of course, emotional stress, even if it leads to some level of physical harm, is not the same as violence—and neither is the speech that might _cause_ emotional distress.

#### “Violent” Speech, Physically Violent Response

This attitude toward speech is extremely dangerous. As we explored in Chapter 2, concepts like “white supremacy” or “trauma” have lost much of their once-objective definition, becoming largely subjective in modern left-wing discourse.

These concepts have been watered down to encompass forms of speech and behavior that never used to fall under them. This makes the evaluation of what is “hateful” or “oppressive” entirely up to the listener. Regardless of what was said, if it caused _anyone_ emotional harm, then it can be considered hate speech.

**This then becomes an open invitation for a listener to respond to nearly _any_ speech with which she disagrees with _actual_ violence**. After all, if one is being “violently” attacked (or believes that others are), then one has a right—indeed, a moral obligation—to respond in kind. Preemptively violent responses to speech (or even intended speech) become not acts of aggression, but rather, acts of self or community defense. If you _oppose_ this physical violence, you are justifying and enabling “hate speech”—and making _yourself_ a deserving target of physical violence.

**Not only is this mode of thinking incompatible with the free expression of ideas, it is also psychologically damaging to those who subscribe to it.** If you choose to interpret speech that does not 100 percent conform to your own beliefs as a personal and violent attack upon yourself, you will be severely limited in the variety of viewpoints to which you can reasonably be exposed. You will be intellectually impoverished and find your world becoming narrower, angrier, and duller.

### Campus Riots

These ideas have been given real and often frightening expression on college campuses in recent years, resulting in rioting, mayhem, violence, and intimidation at universities from the University of California at Berkeley to Middlebury College in Vermont.

In February 2017, left-wing protesters at Berkeley assaulted people gathered to hear a talk by right-wing personality Milo Yiannopoulos (a self-described “troll” who admits to making inflammatory statements in order to provoke outraged responses from the left).

**The protesters, many of them masked and claiming to be affiliated with the militant anti-fascist group Antifa, intimidated attendees and caused extensive damage to university property.** Ultimately, Berkeley gave in to the protesters and canceled Yiannopoulos’s speaking event.

The next month, a similar outbreak of violence occurred at Middlebury College in Vermont. There, controversial right-wing author Charles Murray was scheduled to speak. Murray, in his 1994 book _The Bell Curve_ , argued that social and economic inequality is the result of innate genetic differences that render blacks, Latinos, women and the poor intellectually inferior to white men. **Students at Middlebury responded by rioting, destroying property, and even physically threatening Murray and members of the faculty.**

Chillingly, **these violent riots were justified in the name of _stopping_ violence**, because the rioters believed that speech by these (admittedly controversial and deliberately provocative) right-wing speakers _itself_ constituted an act of preemptive violence that denied students from historically marginalized groups “the right to exist.”

This kind of thinking is the essence of destructive common-enemy identity politics. It is inherently poisonous to free debate. **If you believe your opponents in a debate are attempting to do violence to you or negate your very existence, then violence _is_ the only possible response.**
