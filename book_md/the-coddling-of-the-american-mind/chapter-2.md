## Chapter 2: Bad Idea #2—Always Trust Your Emotions

In the last chapter, we examined the destructive idea that you should avoid adversity and exposure to conflicting ideas at all costs.

In this chapter, we’ll explore **the second of the three Great Untruths: Always trust your emotions.** Specifically, we’ll look at:

  * How emotional reasoning distorts our picture of reality
  * How feedback loops of negative thinking can cause us to form unrealistically gloomy views of ourselves and the world around us, and how campus discourses around oppression and microaggressions encourage this type of harmful thinking
  * How emotional reasoning leads students to aggressively shut down or cancel speaking events on campus—limiting the diversity of viewpoints available to all members of the university community



### The Rider and the Elephant

**Our picture of reality is actually deeply shaped by our emotions.** Our perceptions derive much more from how our minds _interpret_ what we see, rather than from an objective and rational assessment of reality. A metaphor for thinking about the human mind is of a human rider sitting atop an elephant.

The rider, representing reason, can do her best to attempt to direct the elephant. But the elephant, representing emotion, is far more powerful and has its own will; it will only comply with the rider’s commands _if_ those commands are not in conflict with its desires.

The elephant (emotion) governs our unconscious, automatic thought processes. Too often, however, this sort of emotional reasoning causes us to misperceive the world around us. For young people, emotional reasoning can cause them to feel intentional slights where there are none and strengthen the desire to shelter themselves from emotionally triggering experiences—even speech that they merely disagree with.

(Shortform note: Want to learn more about the interaction between emotion and reason? Read our summary of The Happiness Hypothesis.)

### Negative Feedback Loops

**Emotional reasoning often leads to negative cognitive feedback loops.** Individuals who suffer from anxiety and depression often start from a place of low self-esteem. Because they have such low self-esteem, they selectively seek out “proof” to confirm these negative beliefs.

One way they do this is through catastrophizing, turning minor setbacks into disasters.

Another symptom is generalization: taking one setback and re-casting it as a comment on one’s _entire_ experience in life. A third symptom is mind-reading, assuming (nearly always falsely) that others have a negative opinion of them, without any proof.

These “proofs,” in turn, further reinforce the original negative beliefs. People suffering from depression cherry-pick negative experiences and discount positive interactions in order to fuel their negative self-image, in which they are deeply emotionally invested.

#### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Emotional reasoning is totally at odds with what modern psychology says about healthy thinking. **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) challenges patients to consciously question their ingrained patterns of negative thinking.** Practitioners encourage patients to label these thoughts as they happen and identify more positive (and realistic) ways of interpreting the events in their lives.

This disrupts the pattern of negative thinking. Thus, instead of thinking, “I’m stupid and worthless and doomed to a life of failure” after performing poorly on a test, a patient undergoing cognitive therapy might reorient their thinking toward something more along the lines of “It was just one test; it doesn’t define my life.” Over time, the patient’s automatic thought patterns become more positive. CBT can be remarkably effective at breaking the negative mental model.

(Shortform note: If you’re interested in learning more about CBT, read our summary of Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond.)

#### The Threat to Critical Thinking

Alarmingly, these patterns of negative thought are strikingly similar to the ways in which overprotected university students interpret speech or ideas with which they disagree.

In a college American literature class, for example, students might be asked to read Mark Twain’s _The Adventures of_ _Huckleberry Finn,_ a novel that famously features characters using anti-black racial slurs that were common in everyday parlance at the time it was written, in the 19th century.

Twain was not attempting to promote white supremacy by having his characters use these words—he was merely accurately representing the speech of the real people he encountered in his travels along the Mississippi River during the antebellum era. The novel and the characters in it represent a window into how Americans of the time thought about race. Thus, it is a legitimate work for students to explore in a college setting.

But a student who objects to the racial slurs in the book might demonstrate negative thinking by overgeneralizing and labeling, assuming that Twain and the professor who assigned the book are racists. The student might go even further and feel that the entire _university_ is biased against her and that the assignment of the book renders her learning environment unsafe and

hostile.

Not only is this disruptive in a classroom setting, but **it also inhibits the development of critical thinking—the skill that enables people to absorb new information and revise incorrect beliefs.**

If you believe that the mere _presence_ of ideas with which you disagree constitutes an existential threat to you, you will never be able to grapple with those ideas and grow intellectually.

### Microaggression and Misperception

Another dangerous manifestation of emotional reasoning can be seen in the phenomenon of so-called “microaggressions.”

**Microaggressions are minor slights that members of minority groups are often exposed to in the course of daily life.** A microaggression might occur when a white person instinctively crosses the street when they see a black person coming their way, or when a person of color is automatically assumed to be a member of the waitstaff at an office cocktail party.

These experiences can be deeply emotionally painful for those on the receiving end of them, particularly as they build up over time. This is why it’s important to be respectful and mindful of one’s potential cultural blind spots, particularly when in diverse company—as one often is on a college campus.

But **an excessive focus on these incidents can cause the recipient to perceive an _intentional_ slight where there was none**. This sort of mind-reading is a classic symptom of negative-feedback loop thinking, wherein one assumes the very worst about people.

Undoubtedly, some microaggressions are intentionally hostile But often, another interpretation is available:

  * When a white person says, “I think jobs should go to the most qualified person,” they are usually not saying “Systemic racism is a hoax that enables black people to receive unfair advantages in the job market.”
  * When a white person says, “The US is great because it’s a melting pot,” they rarely mean to say, “Members of minority groups should abandon their culture and assimilate into ours.”



Believing that microaggressions indicate deep-seated and _personal_ hostility encourages listeners to constantly take offense to the world around them.

#### Intent vs. Impact

Certainly, a diverse college campus presents no shortage of opportunities for offense-taking, if you choose to have such a defensive mindset. Inevitably, you are going to encounter people who come from different ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds than your own. **If you come to interpret every innocent misunderstanding as a deliberate expression of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, or other form of prejudice, you will soon find yourself in a battered emotional state.**

What may be most harmful about the inordinate focus on microaggressions (and the heavy-handed efforts by student groups and even some university administrators to curtail them) is their tendency to conflate impact with intent. The term itself encourages this attitude—an act of “aggression,” by definition, cannot be accidental. Ultimately, a deep belief in the pervasiveness and power of microaggressions only encourages you to feel more marginalized and disempowered, as you’re forever at the mercy of omnipresent forces of oppression.

### De-Platforming

The last product of faulty emotional reasoning among young people that we’ll discuss in this chapter is the phenomenon of de-platforming.

**De-platforming occurs when controversial guest lecturers, speakers, or debaters who are invited to a university campus to discuss issues are unable to speak due to protests by student activist groups.** These groups often stage attention-grabbing protests, boycotts, walkouts, or disruptive displays of heckling in order to intimidate the speaker or pressure the university to rescind the invitation.

Unfortunately, many of these student-led actions against speech have proven successful. This use of the “heckler’s veto” deprives others of the opportunity to hear the speaker, resulting in intellectual impoverishment for everyone. These de-platforming or disinvitation attempts stem from the same patterns of faulty thinking and emotional reasoning we’ve discussed so far—a belief that one’s safety is threatened by exposure to opinions with which one disagrees and an unhealthy focus on the oppressive power of microaggressions.

In the years since 2009 (and especially since the 2016 election), **these efforts have become more common on the political left, usually targeting conservative speakers.** While some of the speakers targeted by these protests have been right-wing provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos (whose _goal_ is to provoke shock and outrage), many have been mainstream conservative commentators and policymakers.

In fact, many of the targeted speakers at universities are themselves left-leaning, including Clinton administration Secretary of State Madeline Albright and Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder.

**It is a cognitive distortion to believe that merely _hearing_ ideas you disagree with causes you psychological harm. **It is also deeply harmful to the process of learning and intellectual development. Learning is about forcing you to think. It is often _meant_ to be uncomfortable, as it forces you to engage critically, be open to new information, and challenge long-held beliefs.
