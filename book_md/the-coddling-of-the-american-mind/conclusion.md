## Conclusion: Cause for Hope

Despite the problems we’ve explored in this summary, there are good reasons to believe that the situation is improving.

We’ve talked about how social media companies like Facebook play a negative role in young people’s emotional and social development by increasing their feelings of isolation. Although it’s still early, it appears that these companies are beginning to understand the harmful side effects of their platforms. As a result, they are changing their algorithms and exploring ways to make their products fun and engaging, while minimizing their negative mental health impacts.

Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country are passing laws that give parents greater freedom to allow their children to play outside alone or walk unaccompanied to school—giving them legal protection against wrongful charges of abuse or neglect. On campus, scholars and university administrators are showing signs of a much-needed pushback against safetyism and cancel culture.

**Ultimately, higher education must be about the fostering of wisdom._True_** wisdom lies in exploring new ideas, confronting entrenched orthodoxies, and having the intellectual courage to reject wrongheaded ideas and accept new knowledge. This commitment to wisdom and truth is real social justice—and it’s what will yield the greatest good, both for students and the society to which they belong.
