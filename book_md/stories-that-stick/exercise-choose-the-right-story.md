## Exercise: Choose the Right Story

Hall explains that one of the challenges of storytelling is choosing the right story at the right time for the right purpose. As you're deciding what story to tell, consider who your story is for and how you want the story to change them.

* * *

What is a problem you're facing that you'd like to use storytelling to solve?

Who will be your audience for this story? What do you want to communicate to this audience?

Given your audience and your purpose, what do you think the most appropriate type of story would be (The Value Story, The Customer Story, The Founder Story, or The Purpose Story)? Why?
