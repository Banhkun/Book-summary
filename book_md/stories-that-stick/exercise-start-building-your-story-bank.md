## Exercise: Start Building Your Story Bank

According to Hall, the first step in becoming an effective storyteller is building your story bank. She suggests your own stories as a great place to start.

* * *

Write down three nouns that have significance in your life. It may be a person, a place, or an object (for example, your first love, the lake near your house, or your childhood stuffed animal).

Choose one of the nouns you wrote down, and briefly describe a story associated with that noun. Craft the story using the framework of a before, a change, and an after.
