## Exercise: Pilot the Selection Phase

Sketch out Steps 1 - 3 of the Behavior Design Process for a habit that’s meaningful to you.

* * *

**Step 1. Pinpoint your exact aspiration or outcome.**

Generally speaking, what would you like to achieve? Is it an aspiration (an abstract idea) or an outcome (a concrete result)?

Is this aspiration or outcome really targeting the underlying problem? Will implementing good habits in this domain have a direct effect on the problem? If not, come up with a new aspiration that better describes what you want to achieve.

**Step 2. Brainstorm possible behavioral solutions.**

Now you’ll create a diverse lineup of behaviors (“Swarm of Bs”) that might help you to achieve your aspiration and outcome.

If it’ll help you to focus, you could set a timer for two or three minutes. Include:

  * One-off behaviors (deleting a social media app from your phone; buying a set of high-quality kitchen knives for food prep)
  * Fresh habits to cultivate
  * Unhelpful habits to drop



**Step 3. Identify the Golden Behaviors.**

In this step, Focus Map to find your ideal behavioral targets for change. Write your Swarm of Bs on index cards, Post-it notes, or small pieces of paper. Sketch the axes below on a large piece of paper. (Shortform note: You could also do this digitally, using a tool such as Google Jamboard that allows you to move around digital Post-its.)

Step 1: Impact. Arrange your behaviors along the vertical axis by looking at each and asking the question: _Will this behavior help me to achieve my aspiration or outcome?_

Step 2: Feasibility. Consider each behavior individually, asking the question: _Can I realistically get myself to do this behavior?_ Move each behavior to the left or right on the horizontal axis according to the answer.

Which behaviors have ended up in the top right corner? Do they feel inviting and achievable?
