## Chapter 2: Behavior Design Phase 1—Selection

In this chapter, we’ll start applying the Fogg Behavior Model, which we discussed in Chapter 1, to the following practical question: How do we build positive new habits into our lives? The complete Behavior Design process consists of seven steps divided into three broad phases: Selection, Design, and Practice.

### Steps in Behavior Design

The seven steps in Behavior Design are as follows:

> _Selection_
> 
> **1\. Pinpoint your exact aspiration or outcome**
> 
> **2\. Brainstorm possible behavioral solutions**
> 
> **3\. Identify the Golden Behaviors**
> 
> _Design_
> 
>   1. Find the tiny version
> 
>   2. Choose your prompt
> 
> 

> 
> _Practice_
> 
>   1. Celebrate
> 
>   2. Repeat, refine, and upgrade
> 
> 


In this chapter, we’ll discuss Phase 1 (Selection), consisting of Steps 1 to 3. We’ll talk about Phases 2 and 3 in later chapters.

### 1\. Pinpoint Your Exact Aspiration or Outcome

What exactly are you aiming to achieve?

Often our aspirations are vaguer than we realize. **The clearer the aspiration, the more targeted your behavior design can be.**

Sometimes we misfire when creating aspirations. It helps to consider carefully where we really want to end up. For example, if your aspiration is to cut back on caffeine, what exactly are you aiming for? To feel less anxious? To sleep better? To manage blood pressure? Would it be more efficient to approach these targets in other ways?

You can use both aspirations and outcomes as a starting point. However, aspirations are better to start with because they’re usually less rigid—and therefore less daunting—than outcomes.

### 2\. Brainstorm Possible Behavioral Solutions

Once your aspiration or outcome is clear, come up with as many behaviors as you can that might help you to get there. The goal here is volume, not practicality.

Don’t go into detail or get stuck on elaborating any of your ideas. As soon as you’ve generated an idea, tell yourself, “OK, and what else?” Aim to create a **“Swarm of Behaviors” (“Swarm of Bs”)**.

Use the **Magic Wanding** approach. If you had magical powers and infinite resources, what would you do? Move to a tropical island? Get a job that pays double? Hire a live-in housekeeper? Let your optimism do the talking, and be creative. The Swarm of Bs should be as diverse as you can make it. There should always be some answers that surprise you alongside the obvious, logical ones.

It may help to generate ideas under three categories: **one-off behaviors** (for example, deleting a social media app from your phone or buying a set of high-quality kitchen knives for food prep); **fresh habits to cultivate** ; and **unhelpful habits to drop**.

After you have your Swarm of Bs, **check that the Bs are well-defined**. Take any that are fuzzy or poorly defined (for example, “snack on fruit once a day”) and see if you can make them clearer and crisper: “Eat an apple every day after lunch.”

If you’re not sure how to define your behavior clearly, ask yourself three questions.

  1. Is it a one-off behavior, or will you repeat it?
  2. What exactly will you be doing? (Remember the advice from the previous chapter on the difference between behaviors, outcomes, and aspirations. Ask yourself if it’s possible to do the behavior you’ve written down right now or at a particular point in the future.)
  3. When will the behavior happen? 



The “when” question is optional. If there’s no obvious answer, hold off on defining this for now and address it when you work with the prompt (Chapter 3).

### 3\. Identify the Golden Behaviors

Once you have your Swarm of Bs, you’re ready for **Focus Mapping**.

Here’s how to do Focus Mapping:

**1.** Write all of your brainstormed behaviors on index cards.

**2.** On a large flat surface, set up an axis as follows:

![tinyhabits-focusmapping.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/tinyhabits-focusmapping.png)

**3.** Arrange cards. **Stage 1:** **Impact**. For now, only consider the vertical axis. Take each card individually and ask yourself: _Will this be an efficient way to achieve my aspiration?_

  * If you think it will, put it toward the top of the Impact axis.
  * If you don’t think it will, put it toward the bottom.



At the end of Stage 1, all of your index cards should be lined up along the vertical axis, with the most effective at the top and the least effective at the bottom.

**4.** Arrange cards. **Stage 2:** **Feasibility.** Now only consider the horizontal axis. For each card, ask yourself: _Is this realistic?_ Because Tiny Habits is about feeling good and minimizing motivation struggles, a good substitute question is: _Do I really want to do this?_

Imagine yourself doing the behavior. Does it feel good? Do you feel any resistance? It’s important to listen to even slight feelings of resistance.

**5.** Look at the top right-hand quadrant. There should be at least two to three behaviors there that feel familiar, easy, and “right.” **These are your Golden Behaviors.**

If there are no behaviors in the top right-hand corner, go back and generate another Swarm of Bs. If there are any one-off behaviors on the list, prioritize these. They often solve the problem faster.

#### How _Not_ to Choose Target Behaviors

Here are some common behavior matching methods that _don’t_ work:

  * **Random guessing.** Don’t look out the window at a random cyclist, buy all the gear, slog through one commute to work, and realize it’s not for you. Be as methodical as you can in this process. Set yourself up for success through design—don’t depend on luck.
  * **Inspiration from the internet.** The internet is a context-free minefield of unrealistic inspiration. Steer clear unless a behavior you see really seems to suit you and fit into your life.
  * **What worked for someone else.** If your mother tells you she’s gone cold turkey on coffee by substituting herbal tea, this doesn’t necessarily mean the same approach will work for you.



Tiny Behaviors are tailored. Yours should feel like they’re **made just for you**.
