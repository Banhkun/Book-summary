## Chapter 4.1: Behavior Design Process Phase 3—Practice (Celebration)

The Behavior Design process consists of seven steps. We’ve covered Steps 1 to 5 in Chapters 2 and 3. Now let’s look at the remaining steps, which comprise Phase 3 of the process: Practice. As there’s a lot of detail here, we’ve split Phase 3 into two chapters. In Chapter 4a we’ll look at Step 6 (Celebration), and in Chapter 4b we’ll look at how to repeat, refine, and upgrade the habit.

We first encountered Step 6 (Celebration) in the “recipe” in the Introduction:

We first encountered Step 6 (Celebration) in the “recipe” in the Introduction:

  1. After… [Anchor]
  2. I will… [Tiny Behavior]
  3. To celebrate, I will … [Celebration]



We now have a good understanding of the first two ingredients, the Anchor and the Tiny Behavior. But what exactly does a Celebration look like?

### Step 6. Celebration

As we saw in the Introduction, we change best when we feel good. But feeling good can be more complicated than you might think. How do we make ourselves feel good about a new habit? In the most challenging cases, how can we cut through the years of negative emotional baggage and “self-trash-talk” that have accumulated around this behavior? The answer is Step 6 in the Behavior Design process: celebration.

**Celebration is absolutely fundamental in Tiny Habits**. Fogg writes in this chapter that if a reader takes away one thing from the book, it should be the value of celebrating our tiny successes.

Despite this, many Habiteers (even professional coaches) are inclined to skip it. Some don’t take it seriously because it doesn’t seem important. Others feel self-conscious or silly about celebrating.

Because of this,**celebrating is the very first skill you should tackle when starting out with Tiny Habits**. Once people implement this step, it changes their whole outlook. Many actually start wanting to do their new habits just so they can celebrate afterwards.

Celebration is the core of Fogg Behavior Maxim #2: _Help people feel successful._ Note that this isn’t “Help people _be_ successful.” Actual success, externally measured, isn’t important. It’s the ability to _feel_ successful that we’re aiming for—which for many of us can be even more challenging than achieving external success.

Celebration is important because through celebration we cultivate the important skill of making ourselves feel good. This is important not only when working with new habits, but also in building emotional resilience in the face of challenging life circumstances.

Above all, **celebration is a way to practice being kind to yourself**. Many of us could use some extra skills in this area. Celebration helps us defy society’s unrealistic expectations about behavior change and switch to a gentler, more sustainable way of being.

In fact, **if you have children or if you spend time caring for someone else’s children, try to cultivate their celebration of small successes wherever you can**. Children are naturals at celebration, so this shouldn’t be hard. Building in celebration now will help later on, when social norms start to dampen this natural exuberance. Habiteers consistently say that they wish they’d learned this particular skill earlier, as practicing it has changed their lives in radical ways.

Celebration is only necessary when establishing a habit. After the habit has grown strong roots, you don’t need to keep celebrating—though you certainly can if you want to!

#### Shine

“Shine” is the feeling you’re aiming to access through celebration. Fogg invented this term after realizing that English didn’t have a good word to capture the feeling he was talking about: “authentic pride” came closest, but wasn’t succinct or accurate enough.

**Shine is a feeling of mingled joy and success**. You get this feeling when an authority figure you admire praises you, or maybe when you’re relaxing in the sun on a beach or cuddling with your child or pet. We’ll give you a list of suggested celebrations later on. Try out a few of those to see if they invoke a feeling of Shine for you.

#### Celebration in Tiny Habits: Origin Story

Fogg’s tooth-flossing Tiny Habit was introduced in Chapter 3 as a new habit that was the seed for the Tiny Habits method. It was also the habit that taught Fogg the importance of celebration. The remainder of the flossing story is as follows:

It was a very stressful time in his life. His nephew had just passed away, his business was failing, and everything felt like it was on the verge of falling apart. He thought, “If everything else is collapsing around me, at least I can accomplish one thing—I can floss one tooth.”

He flossed one tooth, then smiled at himself in the mirror and silently said, _Victory!_ Immediately after that, he felt an emotional shift. The emotion made him want to floss again so he could feel good again amidst all the difficulty.

This celebration became a stable positive point in his day when everything else was unstable and difficult. He introduced celebration when cultivating other habits and noticed that it helped him automate the habit faster. He also noticed that he could access the same feeling via different types of celebrations (a thumbs-up, a visualization, an encouraging phrase said to himself silently).

After making these observations, Fogg combed the scientific literature on celebration (which was surprisingly sparse) and observed the public celebrations of athletes, looking for common threads.

Though there aren’t many scientific papers published specifically on celebration, there’s a huge body of work on the brain’s reward system and how it works.

#### The Mechanics of Celebration

**Conscious celebration allows you to harness powerful brain networks to your new habit.**

The brain network we’re “hacking” through Tiny Habits is the reward system. This system has evolved over millions of years to keep us alive, healthy, and safe.

Whenever you feel good, your brain notes and reinforces the actions you performed to get there. This means that experiencing pleasure helps you to encode new behaviors. When you experience pleasure (or, more specifically, an outcome that yields a “reward prediction error,” in that the outcome was better than you expected), your brain releases a shot of dopamine. This dopamine helps to lock in the habit.

#### What Are Rewards?

Like “goal,” the word “reward” is conceptually fuzzy, and its technical meaning is frequently lost in translation between academic research and self-help books. Because of this lack of precision, **the word “reward” isn’t used much in Tiny Habits**.

For many people, “If I go to the gym now, I’ll watch a movie tonight” is a reward. But in the technical sense (and the sense that matters to us here), this isn’t the case.

It helps to **distinguish between “incentives” and “rewards.”** The difference is **_timing._ **Incentives are ways to encourage a particular behavior. The benefit can appear well into the future. Examples of incentives are:

  * “If I keep the kitchen counter tidy all week, I’ll buy that new blender I’ve been eyeing in the store.”
  * “If you sell 100 products this month, you’ll get a 20% sales bonus.”



Incentives can certainly motivate you to do something, but they don’t have a direct effect on your brain.

**Rewards are tied to the behavior in real time** : You take a bite of chocolate and a delicious taste fills your mouth, or you finish a presentation and the audience begins to clap.

Rewards **need to occur either _while the behavior is happening_ or _very shortly afterwards_** (ideally within milliseconds). This is because dopamine is metabolized quickly in the brain.

Celebrations, like Tiny Habits, should be tailored for best results.

#### Characteristics of a Great Celebration

**A great celebration is immediate.** As we saw above, timing is key.

**It’s also authentic**. The celebration feels natural to you—perhaps it’s already something you do when you’re feeling triumphant. It should easily tap into a genuine feeling of Shine.

#### Types of Celebration

Most celebrations fit into a few categories:**physical movements, words, songs, sound effects, and visualizations**. Some celebrations combine a few categories.

For example, one Habiteer, Mike, invented the following celebration for the Tiny Habit of rolling out his yoga mat every day: He paced back and forth next to the yoga mat, singing _Eye of the Tiger_ at the top of his voice and holding his arms triumphantly above his head in imaginary boxing gloves. (When a bemused postman passed by his window one day, Mike realized that this particular celebration worked better with the curtains drawn.)

> Here are some suggestions for celebrations in each category. They come from examples throughout the book, as well as from an Appendix that offers 100 suggested celebrations.
> 
> **Physical movements: Strike a pose or make a movement that makes you feel joyful and triumphant.**
> 
>   * Do a happy dance (the floss dance, a few belly dance moves, a stylish spin).
> 
>   * Drum out a jaunty beat on a nearby surface.
> 
>   * Smile.
> 
>   * Clench your biceps and kiss them.
> 
>   * Thump your fist against your heart.
> 
>   * Give yourself a fist bump, blowing up both fists.
> 
>   * Jazz hands.
> 
>   * Do an elaborate bow.
> 
>   * Wave and blow kisses like a celebrity.
> 
> 

> 
> **Words: Say a positive affirmation, either aloud or in your head.**
> 
>   * “Nailed it!”
> 
>   * “Great job!”
> 
>   * “Yes!”
> 
>   * “I’m great at forming new habits.”
> 
> 

> 
> **Songs: Sing, hum, or whistle a snatch of a song that makes you happy.**
> 
>   * _Celebration_ — Madonna
> 
>   * _Eye of the Tiger_ — Survivor
> 
>   * _You Sexy Thing (I Believe in Miracles)_ — Hot Chocolate
> 
> 

> 
> **Sound effects: Play these on your phone or imagine them.**
> 
>   * A crowd going crazy
> 
>   * A round of applause
> 
>   * A fanfare
> 
> 

> 
> **Visualizations: Be creative.**
> 
>   * Imagine getting a hug from someone who cares about you
> 
>   * Imagine your best friend smiling at you
> 
>   * Imagine you have a tail and wag it happily like a dog
> 
>   * Imagine you’re surrounded by a pure white aura
> 
>   * Imagine fireworks exploding
> 
> 


Of course, context is important. You don’t want to have an _Eye of the Tiger_ celebration for the habit of contributing an intelligent point in a work meeting. A repertoire of possible celebrations that you know will reliably generate Shine works best.

#### Finding Your Best Celebration

Celebrations have personalities: Some are more introverted (a quiet head nod) while others are very extroverted (a silly pose or dance).**You may be more drawn to subtle expressions or you may prefer very dramatic ones.** Choose whatever gives you easiest access to Shine.

Everyone—even the most modest or gruff among us—has a celebration. If you’re struggling to find yours, imagine the following three scenarios. What do you do after each?

  * You get an email telling you that you’ve been hired for your dream job.
  * You’re in the office. You crumple up a piece of paper you’re finished with and lob it towards the recycle bin from across the room. Swish!
  * You’re watching a championship and your favorite team is playing. The scores are tied. Your team scores right on the buzzer and wins the trophy.



#### The “Power Celebration”

Develop at least one celebration with extra oomph. You can use this to **feel intense Shine when you need to get a habit under your belt quickly**. Fogg’s Power Celebration is imagining his strict, beloved fourth-grade teacher putting her hand on his shoulder and saying “Good job!”

Children are often better at celebrating and feeling intense emotions than adults. Think of some times you felt an intense sense of accomplishment as a kid. Does invoking these memories make you feel strong Shine?

Be sparing with how often you use your Power Celebration, as the intensity can wear off with frequent use.

#### What to Do if You’re Still Struggling

If you’re still struggling to celebrate authentically after trying all of this, here are some suggestions.

It may be because deep down you don’t feel you deserve to celebrate. Tiny Habits are tiny, after all—why would you celebrate something so trivial? But remember that:

  * **Taking a genuine step towards changing your life is _not_ trivial.** How many times did you want to make a change and didn’t? Now you’re actually doing it. That’s a big deal.
  * **You’re practicing the skill of celebration.** As beginners at any skill, it usually feels awkward until we get the hang of it. As you practice more, the awkwardness will fall away.



**Think of the big picture.** Why is this habit important to you? What big impact could it have on your life? For example, Habiteer Jill was trying and failing to cultivate the habit of wiping her kitchen countertop. To address this, she thought carefully about the potential effects of the habit. It was for the benefit of her husband, who was the family cook and hated starting out with a dirty countertop. Jill noticed that on the days she remembered to wipe the counter, the evening was much more peaceful for the whole family, including her daughter Emma. Jill began to reframe wiping the counter as something she did to foster a harmonious family environment for her daughter and husband. Maintaining this perspective, she was able to clinch the habit.

**Increase the granularity of your celebrations.** Within each habit, there’s space for not one but three celebrations:

  1. **When you remember to do your habit.** Remembering is a habit too: a mental one.
  2. **While doing the habit.** This makes the habit more enjoyable. You could visualize the big-picture effects. For example, while wiping the counter, Jill imagines her husband giving her a kiss and a compliment and the relaxed family dinner they’ll have that night.
  3. **After completing the habit.** (This is the celebration you’re already familiar with.)



#### Celebrating After the Habit Is Already Established

After a habit is firmly rooted into your routine, you don’t need to celebrate anymore, but feel free to keep going if you like. Here are some reasons you might choose to continue celebrating after your habit is locked in:

  * **If you’ve fallen out of a habit** and want to resuscitate it. This might happen if something has disrupted your regular routine, like a vacation.
  * If you’re **escalating your habit beyond the tiny version**. Let’s say your Tiny Habit is two pushups. When you start to push things and do more pushups, make sure you celebrate with extra intensity. This neutralizes the pain of pushing yourself.
  * Because **celebration makes you feel good**. Getting into the habit of celebrating success, whether or not it’s tied to a Tiny Habits recipe, will change how you respond to events in your life.



#### The Celebration Blitz

The Celebration Blitz is an ideal technique if you want to feel better quickly. It’s also a great way to practice your celebration skills.

To do a Celebration Blitz:

  * Go to the messiest place in your house or office.
  * Set a timer for three minutes.
  * Start tidying up. For every single thing you put away, celebrate. Use a variety of celebrations—anything that makes you feel successful. Clench your fists, cheer, do a victory dance, say “Wow, that looks great!”
  * When the timer goes off, stop tidying. How do you feel?



Everyone who tries this finds that they feel happier, lighter, and more successful than they did three minutes ago.

Linda, Fogg’s sister, used Celebration Blitzes to help her get through a difficult situation. Her husband had advanced Alzheimer’s disease, the family was in deep financial trouble, and she felt overwhelmed most of the time. When she felt things were too much, she let herself cry as much as she needed to—but then she got up and did a Celebration Blitz for three minutes (or five minutes if she was feeling particularly down). This helped her move past her grief and stay positive and emotionally stable for her family.

Celebration builds a bridge from Tiny Habits to larger ones. In the next chapter we’ll look in more detail at how to build this bridge.
