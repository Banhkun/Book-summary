## Exercise: Map a Behavior on the Action Line

Learn to work with Motivation, Ability, and the Action Line.

* * *

On a piece of paper, draw a vertical axis for Motivation and a horizontal axis for Ability. Now draw in the Action line curve.

Think of one new habit you’d like to create and one unhelpful habit you’d like to break. Plot both behaviors. Where does each sit in relation to the Action Line? Are they close to the Action Line (easier to change) or far away?

Take the new habit you’d like to create. List some ways you could manipulate ability to lift this above the Action Line.
