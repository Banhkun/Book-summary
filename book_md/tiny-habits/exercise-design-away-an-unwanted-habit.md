## Exercise: Design Away an Unwanted Habit

Select, analyze, and design away one of your Downhill Habits.

* * *

Downhill Habits don’t require much effort to maintain, but it takes some effort to stop them. Identify one to three Downhill Habits in your current routine.

Think of one of your worst habit tangles. What’s the broadest possible description for this tangle? (for example, eating unhealthy food, too much screen time, grumpy with family members.)

Set a timer for two minutes. Think of the problem you wrote above and all of the specific behaviors that make it up. Write down as many of these specific behaviors as you can. (For example, snapping at your teenage son when he leaves clothes on the floor, giving your partner the cold shoulder when she doesn’t take out the garbage.)

Consider everything you wrote above. Of all of these behaviors, which would be the _easiest_ to change?

How might you change the Ability and Prompt components of this behavior to make it harder?
