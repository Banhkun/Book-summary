## Exercise: Are You a Ringleader or Ninja?

Think about your behavior change leadership style.

* * *

Ringleaders lead change overtly, often as group leaders or teachers, while Ninjas take a more stealthy approach. Which one of these approaches do you gravitate to more naturally?

Now imagine you’re in the position that is _less natural_ for you. (If you wrote Ringleader above, imagine you’re a Ninja. If you wrote Ninja, imagine you’re a Ringleader.) Of the seven steps of group change, which in particular might be challenging for you in this role? How might you address these challenges?

(Reminder: The seven steps are 1) Pinpoint the aspiration or outcome, 2) Brainstorm possible behavioral solutions, 3) Identify the Golden Behaviors, 4) Find the tiny version, 5) Choose the prompt, 6) Celebrate, and 7) Repeat, refine, and upgrade.)
