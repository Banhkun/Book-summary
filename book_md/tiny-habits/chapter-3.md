## Chapter 3: Behavior Design Phase 2—Design

The complete Behavior Design process consists of seven steps. We looked at Steps 1 to 3 in Chapter 2. Now we’ll learn about Steps 4 and 5, which comprise the Design phase of the new habit.

### 4\. Find the Tiny Version

How do we make behaviors so easy that they shoot up above the Action Line?

We have two options for making behaviors easier: practicing more and working with the Ability Chain.

#### Practice

With each repetition a behavior gets easier, pushing it further to the right on the Ability axis. However, repetition isn’t the answer for all behaviors.

#### The Ability Chain

You can visualize the Ability component in B = MAP as **a chain with five links** :**time, money, physical effort, mental effort** , and **compatibility with existing routines**. As with all chains, the Ability Chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

To target Ability effectively, we use two questions: a _discovery question_ and a _breakthrough question._ The discovery question diagnoses the weak link. The breakthrough question tells us how to strengthen it.

##### Diagnosing the Weak Ability Chain Link

**The _discovery question_ is: What is making this behavior difficult?**

“Difficult” doesn’t have to mean very difficult—it refers to any amount of difficulty that is stopping you from doing the behavior.

Often our _perception_ of the difficulty is more important than the actual difficulty of an activity.

We can break down the discovery question into five parts, one for each chain link:

  * Do I have enough **time** to do this?
  * Do I have enough **money** to do this?
  * Does this require a lot of **physical effort**?
  * Does this require a lot of **mental effort**?
  * Can I incorporate this easily into my **daily routine**?



Let’s say you want to start eating blueberries as a daily snack.

  * **Time.** Eating blueberries doesn’t take a lot of time.
  * **Money.** Fresh blueberries can be quite expensive.
  * **Physical effort.** Eating blueberries doesn’t require much physical effort.
  * **Mental effort.** Eating blueberries doesn’t require mental effort.
  * **Daily routine.** It’s easy to incorporate eating blueberries into most daily routines.



The weak link for this habit seems to be money. Because fresh blueberries are expensive, perhaps you don’t buy enough when you go to the store to be able to eat them every day.

Because money is the weakest link, this should be the target of your solution. Buying blueberries frozen or in bulk might be the trick to establishing this habit in your life.

##### Strengthening the Weak Ability Chain Link

Once we’ve diagnosed the problem, we need to generate solutions.

**The _breakthrough question_ is: How can I make this easier?** We can use the PAC acronym for this: Solutions can be**P** erson-based, **A** ction-based, or **C** ontext-based.

**Person**. Change something about yourself to make the activity easier. This means “skilling up”: increasing your skills to make the activity easier in the future. You can skill up through:

  * Watching YouTube videos (there’s a video for pretty much everything)
  * Reading a book
  * Taking a class
  * Asking someone to teach or show you how to improve



Skilling up is most natural during a motivation surge. Take advantage of motivation surges to skill up—this investment will make a difference later, when your motivation is low.

**Action**. Change the action itself to make it easier (more on this in a moment).

**Context**. Change something about your environment to make the activity easier. You can work with context through:

  * Investing in a helpful tool (such as better dental floss, a salad spinner, or good walking shoes) 
  * Rearranging your environment (store something where you can reach it, reorganize the fridge)



**Manipulating the action itself is a key strategy in Tiny Habits.** If you shrink the behavior enough, you can do it no matter how low your motivation sinks. There are two ways to approach making behaviors tiny:

**1.** **Starter step.** This is the very first “baby step” towards the behavior you want to cultivate. It can create a surprising amount of momentum. For example:

  * Desired behavior: Walk for 30 minutes daily. Starter step: Put on your walking shoes.
  * Desired behavior: Tidy up after meals. Starter step: Stack the plates.
  * Desired behavior: Cook yourself breakfast. Starter step: Turn on the stove burner.



**2\. Scaling back.** This is a pared-down version of the behavior you want. For example:

  * Desired behavior: Walk for 30 minutes daily. Scaled-back version: Walk to the front gate.
  * Desired behavior: Tidy up after meals. Scaled-back version: Put dishes in the sink.
  * Desired behavior: Cook yourself a healthy breakfast. Scaled-back version: Make instant microwave porridge.



In all cases, **it’s important to** **keep the target behavior tiny**. Don’t get excited and make the baseline behavior more ambitious—especially not early on. If you cooked yourself a gourmet breakfast yesterday, it’s perfectly fine to just turn on the burner today. The most important thing is to keep the tiny habit alive.

### Your New Habit Is Like a Plant

**When you start a Tiny Habit, you’re planting a seedling**. If you don’t water this seedling a little bit every day, it will die. Daily watering, even with only a few drops of water, keeps the plant alive.

With consistent daily watering, the seedling starts to grow roots, making it more stable. It also starts to naturally grow bigger and taller. After an extended period of daily watering, the plant will be strong enough to withstand storms and will be flowering in all kinds of unexpected ways.

Consistent Tiny Habits can carry you through unexpected life “storms” such as illness and psychological adversity. These habits often ripple out and have unexpected positive effects on other areas of your life.

#### Consistency Is Key

Completing the behavior consistently is like watering your plant faithfully. It only needs a few drops of water every day, but without that baseline, the plant will wither and die.

Tiny Habits should feel easy, and **growing them should feel like fun, not like a chore**. It doesn’t matter how elaborate your habit becomes over time—the low baseline is always the same tiny version, and doing more is always optional.

> **Example: Flossing One Tooth**
> 
> For years, Fogg had problems developing a daily flossing habit. Immediately after dentist visits he felt very motivated, but this motivation quickly disappeared within a few days. As a behavior scientist specializing in habits, this was quite embarrassing!
> 
> He examined the flossing habit using the above five questions, and—surprisingly—found that physical effort was the weak link. Fogg’s teeth are particularly close together, so it’s hard work to get the floss in and out, and the floss often breaks and gets lodged between his teeth. So he targeted the physical effort dimension by testing out 15 different types of floss, finding the best fit for his teeth, and scaling back to a habit of just flossing one tooth.
> 
> After two weeks, he was flossing all of his teeth twice daily. He eventually became something of a floss connoisseur, signing up for a personalized tour of a floss factory while on a trip to Dublin. On days of particularly low motivation, he still flosses just one tooth.
> 
> After you’ve manipulated the Ability dimension to find a promising Starter Step or Scaled-Back Version, you’re ready to design your prompt.

### 5\. Choose Your Prompt

As with motivation and ability, prompts can be based on **P** (Person), **A** (Action), or **C** (Context).

**In Person prompts, you remind yourself to do the action.** The most reliable subset of these is using primary physical needs as your reminder. For example, you feel hungry, so you eat.

Here’s an example. Fogg wanted to do pushups throughout his day. He decided to use peeing as the prompt, and now has an established habit of doing at least two pushups immediately after he pees.

But person prompts can be unreliable, especially if they rely on your memory.

**In Context prompts, something in your environment reminds you to do the action.** Post-its, notes on your hand, phone notifications, reminders from others, and putting something where you can see it are all examples of context prompts.

Context prompts can become overwhelming, and it’s easy to become habituated and start to ignore them. We can manage context prompts in our environment by silencing our phones, hanging up DO NOT DISTURB signs, and directing people to certain communication channels (for example, not using text messaging for work purposes).

Context prompts can be effective, but design is important. If a context prompt isn’t working, design another prompt and try again.

**In Action prompts, an existing action in your routine prompts a new action.** For example, brushing your teeth prompts you to floss, setting your coffee on the desk prompts you to look at your To Do list, hanging up your coat when you get home prompts you to play with the dog.

This is like computer code: if you get the sequence right, there’s a predictable outcome.

Action prompts are the “secret sauce” of Tiny Habits and **are also known as Anchors.** We first encountered Anchors in the Introduction, in the ABC Tiny Habit recipe mnemonic: **A** nchor,**B** ehavior, **C** elebration.

The key to an effective prompt is _after_. **The desired behavior should be executable _immediately after_ the prompt. **A well-designed prompt has a clearly defined ending, and this ending serves as a cue for the desired behavior.

#### Advice on Implementing Anchors

Morning routines are better because they’re more stable. Later in the day, our routines are more likely to fall apart. Analyze your desired new habit and tailor the Anchor accordingly. Where does the habit fit best into your routine?

There are a few different ways to pair new habits with Anchors. These are, from most to least effective:

**Pair by location.** Can you find an Anchor that you already do in the same place? (Pair a new habit in the garden with something you already do regularly in the garden.)

**Pair by frequency.** How often do you want to do the new habit? (Pair a new once-a-week habit with something you already do once a week.)

**Pair by objective.** Can you find an Anchor that shares a common goal with your new habit? Note that this is very personal. If your morning coffee is a signal to jump into your work day, you could pair it with looking over your To Do list. But if it’s about quiet, reflective time, you could pair it with taking three deep breaths.

Sarika, whom we met earlier, paired watering her houseplant with taking a drink of water herself. This way, when she nourished the plant with water she also nourished herself.

Bad Anchors don’t match any of the above. “After I take a shower, I will sort the laundry” doesn’t match location, frequency, or objective. This new habit has a low chance of success.

**Anchors need to be clear.** If an Anchor isn’t working, perhaps it’s not clear enough. To solve this,**look for the “Trailing Edge”** : the exact moment when the action ends.

For example, “after I get home from work” is a fuzzy Anchor. Does getting home from work end when you walk in the door? When you put down your bag? When you change out of your work clothes? Find the Trailing Edge and anchor the new habit to that.

It helps to look for a final action that gives you a sensory cue, for example:

  * The sound of the water turning off as a cue to wipe the kitchen bench.
  * The sound of a car door closing as a cue to write a task on a Post-it.



If it helps, look for a strong Anchor first and then decide which behavior to pair with it. Are there any regular actions in your daily routine with clear-cut edges? What new habit could you introduce there?

**If an Anchor doesn’t work, keep experimenting**. Change the recipe to see what works best. By experimenting, you’re improving your skills in pairing habits with Anchors in the context of your own preferences and routine.

You’ll know when something feels right.

#### Using Prompts in Business

Fogg believes that successful businesses of the future will rely less on context prompts and more on action prompts. For example, a medical insurance company might ask its customers about their daily routines and use this information to tailor its reminders to clients.

> **Example: Amy and the Car Door**
> 
> Habiteer Amy owns her own business and she’s struggling to accomplish business-related tasks. Each morning, she drives her daughter Rachel to school. After she says goodbye to Rachel (more specifically, when Rachel closes the car door), Amy drives immediately to a free nearby parking space and does her Tiny Behavior: writing her most pressing task for the day on a Post-it note. She then drives home and puts the Post-it on the wall near her desk. On most days she goes on to do the task, and this generates momentum for completing other pending tasks. On some days, she doesn’t do the task—but as long as she’s written it on the Post-it, the habit is secure.
> 
> This prompt of Rachel closing the car door is effective because:
> 
>   * It’s linked to a sensory cue (sound of car door closing)
> 

>   * It’s the first task in Amy’s work day
> 

>   * It fits seamlessly into her existing daily routine.

### Special Types of Tiny Habits

There are a few types of habits that are built on special prompts. “Meanwhile Habits” are small habits that you can use to fill otherwise useless or dead time. “Pearl Habits” are habits that take prompts that would otherwise trigger negative emotions or unhelpful behaviors and turn them into prompts for positive emotions and helpful behaviors.

#### Meanwhile Habits

You can introduce “Meanwhile Habits” while waiting for something else to happen. For example, you could do a Meanwhile Habit when:

  * Standing in line
  * Waiting for the shower water to heat
  * Waiting at a red light
  * Vacuuming the house



In Meanwhile Habits, unlike other types of habits, the prompt is the _beginning_ of a particular situation rather than the end. The purpose of Meanwhile Habits is to fill otherwise empty fragments of time, so these habits will stay tiny rather than growing bigger.

#### Pearl Habits

Like pearls, Pearl Habits start with an irritation and grow into something beautiful. When creating a Pearl Habit, **you convert a periodic annoyance in your environment into the prompt for a positive new habit**.

Here’s one example of a Pearl Habit. Fogg had an air conditioner in his bedroom with a noisy thermostat that clicked whenever the A/C turned on and off. This woke him up, which was annoying. Instead of installing a new thermostat, he experimented with using the click as an Anchor reminding him to relax the muscles in his face and neck. Now he’s happy when he hears the click, because it’s helping him to sleep rather than waking him up.

Here’s another, more impressive example _._ Amy (of the closing car door prompt) was going through an acrimonious divorce in which her husband regularly insulted and verbally assaulted her. She**turned her husband’s behavior into a prompt to do something nice for herself**.

This changed how she reacted to the insults. She began to accept them with more equanimity, and even welcome them: His bad behavior became an opportunity to watch her favorite movie or book a massage.

Over time, her ex-husband saw that his insults weren’t affecting her anymore, and he gradually stopped behaving badly. The kids, who in the past had had to watch the abuse, also benefited. The relationship between Amy and her ex-husband improved so much that after a few years they worked together to throw their daughter’s graduation party.
