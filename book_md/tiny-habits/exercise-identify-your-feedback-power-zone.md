List a few domains that are important to you.

List a few domains in which you feel insecure about your performance.

Identify some domains where there’s overlap. What’s the most meaningful positive thing someone could say to you about a behavior in this domain?

Think of someone you love or are trying to help. Can you list some of their Feedback Power Zones? What kinds of feedback might you give for behaviors related to these Power Zones?
