## Chapter 1: The Fogg Behavior Model

**The Fogg Behavior Model is a simple way of breaking down the components of a particular behavior**. This helps us to understand the causes of the behavior, which in turn lets us pinpoint any problem elements and address them directly.

In this chapter, we’ll look at each component of the Fogg Behavior Model in turn, and we’ll learn about the Action Line, a way of visualizing how the Fogg Behavior Model applies to any given behavior. We’ll also discuss why motivation isn’t the best starting point for building lasting new habits and introduce some alternative, more reliable jumping-off points.

#### Fogg Behavior Model: B = M A P

**Behavior (B): The specific action we’re considering**.

This formula applies to any human behavior, from dropping dirty clothes on the floor to climbing Mount Everest. This means that the model applies regardless of culture or environment, and regardless of the ease or difficulty of the behavior.

**Motivation (M): Your desire to execute the behavior**.

Motivation fluctuates wildly from day to day and from behavior to behavior. Here, we’re talking about the motivation you have at the exact time you’ll execute a given instance of the behavior.

**Ability (A): Your capacity to execute the behavior**.

This includes two main dimensions: your own skills related to this behavior, and the difficulty of the behavior itself.

**Prompt (P): The cue that reminds you to execute the behavior**.

While motivation and ability can vary, prompts are binary. You either notice them or you don’t.

**For a behavior to occur, M, A, and P must _all_ be present simultaneously**. If one is missing, the behavior won’t happen.

The model builds in individual differences. M, A, and P for a given behavior vary widely between individuals, and will even be different for the same individual in different contexts and at different times. Experimenting with all of these variables will teach you the best way to configure your new habits.

Note that this model does _not_ model the general characteristics of a behavior. Instead,**it applies to one instance of the behavior at a given point in time**.

For example, let’s say you want to introduce the behavior of going to the gym. Your motivation to do this will vary from moment to moment. Your ability will also vary: Sometimes it’s easier to go to the gym (perhaps when you have less going on at work) and sometimes it’s more difficult. And at any point in time, you may or may not have a prompt reminding you to go to the gym.

The model doesn’t help us much with the _general idea_ of going to the gym, because there’s so much variation in M, A, and P. But if we think instead about going to the gym _right now_ , the motivation and prompt components are more fixed. Now we can apply the model with more accuracy.

Tiny Habits uses the Fogg Behavior Model as its basis.

### The Action Line

**By looking at the “Action Line,” we can work out whether or not a behavior will be performed.**

Let’s plot Motivation and Ability as the axes on a graph. The Action Line is a curve marking the threshold at which an action will be performed.

![tinyhabits-actionline.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/tinyhabits-actionline.png)

In this graph, the star on the right is a behavior that’s very easy to do and for which you have a moderate level of motivation. It sits far above the action line, so when you’re exposed to the prompt you’ll have no problems doing this behavior. The star on the left is a behavior that’s much more difficult. Though you have almost as much motivation as for the blue star behavior, the high level of difficulty means that even with a well-designed prompt you won’t get above the Action Line and manage to do the behavior.

Ability and Motivation are complementary. **If you have more ability (or if the action is easier), you need less motivation to get over the Action Line.** If you have less ability, you’ll need more**** motivation to get over the Action Line. This is why if you’re extremely motivated to do something but the activity is very difficult (such as lifting a car to save someone pinned underneath), you still have a chance of getting over the Action Line.

If a behavior is currently below the Action Line, how can you lift it above the curve? You can target any of M (Motivation), A (Action), or P (Prompt).

**If motivation isn’t going to change, target A or P.**

For example, housework in a shared household is a common point of contention. Here’s one problem that arose in Fogg’s household. His partner wanted him to wipe down the shower every time he used it, but the habit just wasn’t sticking.

Fogg analyzed M, A, and P. There was motivation (a shared desire for a clean shower) and a clear prompt (turning off the water), but the behavior wasn’t happening. Why? He realized that he simply didn’t understand what “wipe down” meant in this context. With what? How?

So he asked his partner to show him how to do it. After his partner had demonstrated exactly what to do, Fogg’s ability increased, pushing the behavior over the Action Line.

**The Fogg Behavior Model is about design, not about character judgment.** Notice that there’s no “self-discipline” or “moral fortitude” axis.

> **Example: Katie’s social media habit**
> 
> We can see the Action Line at work in the situation of Katie, a successful executive. Katie had one troublesome habit that consistently fell above the Action Line: scrolling through social media on her phone after her alarm went off at 4:30 am, not leaving her enough time to go to the gym.
> 
> To conquer this social media habit, Katie examined M, A, and P in turn.
> 
>   * Her**** motivation was to stay in touch with family and friends. Knowing that this motivation would be hard to change, she moved on to Ability.
> 
>   * Scrolling through social media in bed is incredibly easy, so there were opportunities here to make it harder. Katie experimented with several options, eventually finding that keeping her phone in the kitchen overnight made the behavior hard enough that she wasn’t tempted.
> 
>   * As the prompt for this behavior was the phone itself, putting the phone in the kitchen also removed the prompt. Katie bought an alarm clock for her bedroom, which woke her up without the temptation of social media.
> 
> 

> 
> After this adjustment, Katie successfully banished the bad habit and started going to the gym immediately after she woke up.
> 
> Katie’s experience exemplifies many of the specific Behavior Design techniques that we’ll learn about in more detail in later chapters.

### Breaking Down the Fogg Behavior Model

Recall that the structure of the Fogg Behavior Model is B = MAP. Let’s consider Behavior, Motivation, Ability, and Prompt in turn.

#### What Is a Behavior?

Most people confuse behaviors, aspirations, and outcomes.

An **aspiration** is a desire for something abstract (become a lawyer; get rich). An **outcome** is similar to an aspiration, but more concrete (pass the bar exam; earn 30% more in commissions. A **behavior** is much more specific: it’s something you can do at a given time (open a law textbook; make a sales call).

We don’t use the word “goal” in Behavior Design because it isn’t clearly defined—it could apply to any of the above.

Think of your aspiration as the top of a cliff face you’re climbing. Your behaviors are like the jutting pieces of rock you hold onto to pull yourself higher. There’s no prescribed way to climb the rock—you choose the path—but the behaviors that support you should be solid and dependable.

You can **disambiguate between behaviors and aspirations or outcomes** with one question: _Can I do it at a given time (for example, right now)?_

Fogg encountered this common confusion between behaviors and aspirations in his consulting work at a bank. The bank had introduced a new initiative to encourage people to put aside a $500 emergency fund. He asked the staff, “What behavior do you want people to do?” They answered, “Save $500.” He replied, “OK, all of you save $500 right now.” This made them realize that they needed to be more specific in their suggestions—to target the “how” and not the “why.”

**The “how” is the step that most people overlook**. The strength of Behavior Design is that it makes “how” the focus. Think of Marie Kondo’s smash hit books on tidying up. These books don’t focus on _why_ you should be tidying up. They take you through the concrete steps of how to do it. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.)

### M: Motivation

Motivation is your desire to execute a specific action (such as “go for a jog”) or category of actions (such as “do exercise”).

You can think about motivation as **a force that draws you toward certain actions and pushes you away from others**. A desire for love, for example, pulls you toward a relationship. An aversion to physical exertion pushes you away from strenuous exercise.

We can sort different motivations according to the PAC (Person, Action, Context) dimensions.

  * Person: What does the person want to do?
  * Action: What external benefit or reward is available? Are there any punishments for doing or not doing the behavior?
  * Context: Is the environment (physical and social) helping or hindering?



Motivation can be powerful in helping us with difficult or one-time actions (more on this later), but we shouldn’t rely on it for long-term behavior change. Here’s why.

#### Motivation Is Complicated

Motivation is unreliable. Motivation is like that one friend you have who’s the life of the party. She’s terrific to have a few drinks with, but would you rely on her to pick you up from the airport?

**Motivation comes in waves**. It ebbs and flows on large and small timescales. Something that feels like no big deal when you’re surfing the motivation wave can become insurmountable when you’re wallowing in the trough. Motivation can vary:

  * Daily—Willpower is known to be highest in the morning.
  * Seasonally—Weight Watchers has consistent peaks and troughs in their signups throughout the year (peaks in January and after Labor Day; troughs in November and December in the lead-up to food-saturated holidays).
  * Depending on the circumstances—If you eat lunch at 1 pm, you’ll be more tempted by a pizza at 12:30 than at 1:30.



Some motivations _are_ more consistent, but these are much less common. Examples of these might be wanting to spend more time with your pet or wanting your child to succeed.

**Competing motivations can pull us in opposite directions**. You may want to reduce the sugar in your diet, but you may also _really_ want that chocolate chip cookie.

**Motivation can be opaque**. Often we don’t have a clear understanding of our own motivations. This means that subconscious motivations can rise up out of nowhere and sabotage our efforts.

#### Working With Motivation

To work intelligently with motivation, we need to do the following.

##### Avoid Abstractions

Often we try to motivate ourselves with abstract aspirations: “eat healthier,” “save more money,” “reduce stress.” But these are not specific behaviors. Dreams and aspirations are not bad things. We need them as human beings. But to turn them into habits, we need the extra “ _How?_ ” step.

**Aiming to motivate specific behaviors is the key.** We can substitute the above aspirations with “eat an apple after lunch every day,” “set up an automatic direct debit of $50 per month to a savings account,” and “meditate for ten minutes every day.”

##### Understand That Motivation Is _Not_ the Key to Long-Term Change

Motivation is only one of three “ways in” to a new habit (the others are Ability and Prompt), and it’s usually the most difficult. Think about the following three ways to enter a building. Ability is like opening the door and walking in. Prompt is like driving into the parking lot. And Motivation is like parachuting down, landing on the roof, and picking the lock on the rooftop door.

**Motivation alone is not enough**. Suppose someone offers you a million dollars to lose ten pounds right now. There’s no way you can do this, even if your motivation is off the charts. Focus on A and P first.

#### In Tiny Habits, Motivation Is Already Present

  * Through Focus Mapping (more on this in Chapter 2), you choose only habits that you’re already motivated to do.
  * This makes Tiny Habits different from other approaches.
  * In Tiny Habits,**“I want to” is more important than “I should.”**



### A: Ability

Now that we’ve considered M (Motivation), let’s turn to the next variable in the B = MAP formula: A (Ability).

The best way to make a change is to keep things simple. But this isn’t usually how we approach change. We want to go “all in” on new changes, turn our lives upside down, and see fast results.

Sometimes bold action is necessary and helpful. For example, you might quit your job to pursue your dream of running a sub-2:30 marathon. But to create sustainable change in daily life, less is more. If you want to introduce a running habit, start by putting on your running shoes.

#### The Importance of Simplicity in Business

**Most successful companies begin by targeting the Ability dimension: They make our lives easier by offering something very small and specific**. This simplicity encourages people to use the product and develop habits that rely on it.

Instagram was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. (Krieger is a former student of Fogg’s.) They analyzed Burbn, an unsuccessful location-sharing app, and found that the feature users liked most was photo sharing.

This focus on photo sharing **targeted a Golden Behavior** : something that people were already motivated to do. Systrom and Krieger built a new app around this Golden Behavior, simplifying the process into a short sequence of clicks. By making photo uploads so easy, they targeted the Ability component of B = MAP, pushing photo-sharing behavior on the app well above the Action Line. They only added more features after their users had a well-established habit.

Now Instagram has over a billion users and is worth over $100 billion. Businesses that offer complex features right from the start often fail—so **if you’re offering a new product or service, aim for simplicity first**.

> **Example: Sarika and the Stovetop Burner**
> 
> One person who manipulated Ability with great success was Sarika, a project manager in Bangalore. Though successful at work, Sarika had a lot going on behind the scenes: She had bipolar disorder, and she was trying to come off her medication and manage the symptoms with a combination of healthy eating, exercise, therapy, and meditation. Developing and maintaining a routine was especially important, because any variations in the routine would act as early warning signs for episodes of mania or depression.
> 
> Unfortunately, Sarika found routine extremely difficult. The only thing that worked was to create little toeholds via the Tiny Habits method.
> 
>   * She introduced the habit of turning the stove burner on when she went into the kitchen in the morning.
> 
>   * She introduced the habit of putting her meditation cushion in the middle of the room, sitting on it, and taking three breaths.
> 
>   * She introduced the habit of putting out her yoga mat and stretching for thirty seconds.
> 
> 

> 
> These Tiny Habits grew into cooking herself breakfast, meditating consistently, and exercising. On days when she reverted to only turning on the burner or only doing thirty seconds of stretching, she didn’t beat up on herself—she celebrated because she had kept her habit alive. In time, Sarika noticed that practicing Tiny Habits had made her more emotionally resilient, probably because of the non-judgmental attitude toward stumbles and challenges.

**When you target Ability, you find a way to make the activity easier for yourself**. You can use the PAC (Person, Action, Context) dimensions for this:

  * Improve your skills (**P**);
  * Make the activity easier (**A**); or
  * Design your environment to boost your chances of doing the activity (**C**).



We’ll cover these more in Step 4 of the Behavior Design sequence (“Find the Tiny Version”) in the next chapter.

### P: Prompt

With M (Motivation) and A (Ability) clear, let’s turn to P: the Prompt.

The Prompt is**the immediate trigger for a behavior**. Without the prompt, the behavior won’t occur.

Prompts are ubiquitous in our daily lives. If we refer back to the PAC Person, we can see that prompts come from three sources:

  * **Person** : prompts that originate in your own body or mind. Feeling hungry and suddenly remembering that you need to call your grandmother are person prompts.
  * **Action** : prompts related to the activity you’ve just finished doing. Stepping out of the shower and then immediately drying off, or sitting down at the computer and immediately checking your email, are action prompts.
  * **Context** : prompts that come from your environment. Your pet reminding you it’s time for their dinner, a text message notification sound on your phone, and a red light when you’re driving are all context prompts.



Prompts can be either natural (bright sun comes out and you put on your sunglasses) or designed (you hear a smoke alarm and evacuate the building).

#### Prompts Have a Binary Structure

Prompts are binary (either you respond to them or you don’t). This contrasts with ability and motivation, which both vary within a wide range.

A prompt is like a switch: Without a well-timed prompt, there is no behavior, even if your ability and motivation are both high.

These days, our prompt landscape is very cluttered, and it’s easy to ignore most prompts by default. **If you want to make sure you’ll pay attention to a prompt when it comes around, the _design_ of the prompt is key.**

We’ll talk about the practical side of prompts—selecting and implementing them—in Chapter 3.
