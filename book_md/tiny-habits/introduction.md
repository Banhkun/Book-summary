## Introduction

In _Tiny Habits_ , Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg argues that the best way to change behavior is to start small. Based on years of experience running a Stanford lab and helping people make changes through monthly Behavior Design Boot Camps, Fogg encourages us to drop any moral judgment about “good” and “bad” habits and view our behavior scientifically, using specific behavior design skills to engineer lasting changes. Through Tiny Habits, Fogg argues that the tiniest changes in our behavior can ripple out and have far-reaching effects, both in our own lives and in the lives of others.

(Shortform note: The book is structured in a series of overlapping circles: Fogg introduces models, methods, and examples of people who have succeeded with the Tiny Habits approach and circles back to them throughout the book, adding more information each time. This summary rearranges the book’s content so that each chapter covers a self-contained principle.)

### What Is Behavior Design?

Many of us have tried to make behavior changes in the past. Sometimes we succeed; more often than not, we fail. And we blame ourselves for the failure. But **often _we_ are not the problem. We just haven’t designed the change properly**.

If you’ve tried and failed to make a change, the Behavior Design approach may be the answer.

#### The Information-Action Fallacy

Most approaches to behavior change are built on the belief that if people have enough information about _why_ they should make a change, they’ll make it easily and immediately. Fogg calls this the “Information-Action Fallacy” because lasting behavior change is rarely this simple.

We tend to believe that motivation is the only ingredient in behavior change. We think that if we can just build up our motivation enough, we’ll make the change. **This leads to self-judgment when we fail**. We believe that we failed because we lack self-discipline, or we’re weak, or we lack character. This shame stops us from trying again.

**Behavior Design stops you from getting caught in this cycle**. In Behavior Design, we look at behavior patterns scientifically and with curiosity. If you fail to introduce a habit, it’s because the habit is badly designed. Simply redesign it and try again.

**Positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, are the key**. We change best when we feel good. Tiny bursts of celebration help our brains to “wire in” the changes automatically.

The best example of the Behavior Design approach is the Tiny Habits method.

### Tiny Habits

Why should we work with tiny habits?

Tiny Habits are:

  * **Low on time demand.** Many of us have full lives and little time to fit in new habits. The idea of a daily ten-second habit is less daunting (and more realistic) than a half-hour one. The typical Tiny Habit **takes under 30 seconds**. You can do many of the habits suggested in the book in under five seconds. This means you can fit them in easily, no matter how busy you are.
  * **Effective immediately.** A well-designed Tiny Habit is one you can start right now.
  * **Psychologically safe.**
    * **Wobbles—even faceplants—are part of the process**. Babies fall all the time when they’re learning to walk, but it doesn’t hurt much because they’re already close to the ground. If you don’t succeed with your new habit the first time, you’re not a failure: Just stand up, tweak something, and try again. 
    * Tiny Habits are **private**. The changes are so small that nobody else needs to know. This means you can operate without any pressure, as well as avoiding You also avoid potential sabotage attempts by others.
    * It’s **impossible to fail**. It’s all an experiment—so if it’s not working, just fiddle with the controls and try again.
    * The self-compassion that you practice through Tiny Habits ripples out into your general approach to life.
  * **Set up for growth.** Tiny Habits **generate momentum that, over time, helps you accomplish bigger and bigger tasks**. You can create an ecosystem of carefully chosen small new habits that together have a big impact.
  * **Willpower-independent.** Motivation, or willpower, isn’t reliable. It comes and goes in waves, so we can’t depend on it to build consistent habits. In Tiny Habits, the target habits are so small that we need very little motivation to do them.
  * **Fun.** The essence of Tiny Habits is play and experimentation. There’s no grim “do or die” mentality—**you deliberately focus on activities that you _want_ to do**. And all Tiny Habits sequences include an instant celebration, which teaches your brain to do the behavior again.
  * **Tried and tested.** Throughout the book, Fogg gives examples of his own experience creating Tiny Habits. He also includes many anecdotes about the experiences of others who’ve attended his Behavior Design boot camps and online courses.



#### The Structure of a Tiny Habit

The structure of a Tiny Habit is like a sandwich, with the behavior in the middle. A good mnemonic is ABC:

>   1. **A** nchor: The point in your regular routine that your Tiny Habit will be tied to
> 
>   2. Tiny **B** ehavior: The new habit in simple form
> 
>   3. Immediate **C** elebration: Some brief but meaningful way to create positive emotions after you’ve executed your Tiny Habit successfully.
> 
> 


Let’s say you want to introduce the habit of going for a walk after your morning coffee. Your **A** nchor might be rinsing the cup and setting it down to dry. Your Tiny **B** ehavior might be putting your walking shoes on. And your immediate **C** elebration might be punching the air and shouting “Yes!”

#### “Recipes” for Tiny Habits

To capture the experimental feel of Tiny Habits, Fogg translates this sequence into a “recipe.”

1\. **After… [Anchor]**

2\. **I will… [Tiny Behavior]**

3\. **To celebrate, I will … [Celebration]**

> Here are some example recipes:
> 
>   * After I put my coffee cup in the dish drainer, I will put my walking shoes on. Then I will punch the air and shout “Yes!”
> 

>   * After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth. Then I will smile.
> 


If you like, you can write your habit recipes on physical recipe cards for quick reference.

As with any recipe,**if it doesn’t turn out well,** **experiment with the ingredients and proportions and try again.**

#### Terminology

Throughout the book, Fogg refers to three key frameworks he’s invented to codify and communicate his Behavior Design approach. These are the **Fogg Behavior Model** , the **Behavior Design Process** , and the **PAC Person**.

The **Fogg Behavior Model** is a way of thinking about behavior. It sees all behavior as directly caused by a combination of three things: Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. The formula for this model is B = MAP. You’ll learn about the Fogg Behavioral Model in Chapter 1.

The **Behavior Design Process** is a method for behavior change based on the Fogg Behavior Model. The method has seven steps that are divided into three broad phases: Selection (Steps 1-3), Design (Steps 4 and 5), and Practice (Steps 6 and 7). You’ll find information about Selection in Chapter 2, Design in Chapter 3, and Practice in Chapter 4.

The **PAC Person** is a heuristic for thinking about the resources available when executing a behavior. It shows us that there are three main types of resources available at any given moment:

  * **P** erson (qualities relating to the individual); 
  * **A** ction (qualities relating to the action being performed); and 
  * **C** ontext (qualities relating to the environment the individual is in).



For example, we can use the PAC Person to talk about where motivation comes from. The **person** components are your intrinsic enjoyment of the activity and how interested you are in doing it. The **action** components are any rewards or punishments for doing the activity. And the **context** components are any social influences on the activity, as well as conducive and non-conducive physical environments.

**Tiny Habits** is a name that refers to the entire set of processes and models, as well as to the scaled-down habits that are the centerpiece of Fogg’s approach. A **Habiteer** is anyone who practices the Tiny Habits method.

Because the Behavior Model and the PAC Person have some acronym letters in common (P for Prompt and Person; A for Ability and Action), references to these acronyms can occasionally be confusing. Wherever there’s any ambiguity, we’ll remind you of what each acronym letter means in context.

#### The Fogg Behavior Maxims

The two Fogg Behavior Maxims serve as Fogg’s reference point with his work training others in Tiny Habits. If you’re helping people to design their own behavior in the future and get tangled up in all of the steps and stages, referring back to these maxims will simplify things.

**Behavior Maxim #1:_Help people do something they already want to do._**

**Behavior Maxim #2:_Help people feel successful._**

For now, you’re focusing on yourself. To apply the maxims, rephrase them maxims as questions to ask yourself throughout the process: “Does this help me do something I already want to do?” and “Does this help me feel successful?”

> **Example: The Maui Habit**
> 
> Fogg invented this habit in Maui and has taught it to thousands of people at his boot camps. It’s a good way to start the day on a positive note.
> 
> **Recipe:**
> 
>   * After my feet touch the floor in the morning,
> 
>   * I will say, “It’s going to be a great day,” while feeling confident and optimistic.
> 
>   * To celebrate, I will smile.
> 
> 

> 
> Try incorporating this habit into your morning routine. Experiment with the recipe that works best for you.
> 
> You can change the anchor: “When I open my eyes…” or “When I look in the mirror…”
> 
> Adapt the habit to your circumstances. You don’t want this to feel fake. So if you know you have a challenging day ahead, you can use uncertain intonation and say, “Well, _something_ great is going to happen today…”

In Chapter 1 of this summary, we’ll break down the Fogg Behavior Model, considering Motivation, Ability, and Prompts in detail. In Chapters 2 to 4, we’ll look at how this model is applied in the Behavior Design process when focusing on one person (yourself). While Chapters 2 to 4 chapters talk about how to build in new habits, in Chapter 5 we’ll learn how to use Behavior Design to get rid of habits that aren’t serving us. In Chapter 6, we’ll broaden our application of Behavior Design past the individual and learn a range of strategies for changing as a group. Chapter 7, the Conclusion, revisits the Fogg Behavior Maxims and shows how we can apply them to improve people’s lives on a large scale.
