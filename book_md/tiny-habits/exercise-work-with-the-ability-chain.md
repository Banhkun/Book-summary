## Exercise: Work With the Ability Chain

Identify strong and weak links in the Ability Chain.

* * *

The “Ability Chain” has five links: time, money, physical effort, mental effort, and compatibility with daily routine. Think of a specific habit that you’d like to implement, or that you’ve been trying to implement without success. Assess each link in the chain individually. Which is the strongest? Which is the weakest?

Any chain is only as strong as its weakest link. How could you strengthen the link that you’ve identified as being weakest?
