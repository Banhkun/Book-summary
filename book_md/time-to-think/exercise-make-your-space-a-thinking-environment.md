## Exercise: Make Your Space a Thinking Environment

For the purposes of partnered or group thinking, use Kline’s tips to create a space that’s conducive to good thinking.

* * *

First, consider the perspectives that are going to be represented in your session. Do you have a diverse range of viewpoints to draw from? What can you do to bring in ideas from other perspectives?

Make sure everyone in your thinking space is on equal footing. What are some potential differences in power or status between you and your thinking partner, or between members of your thinking group, that could interfere with a sense of equality? How can you keep these differences from impacting everyone’s thinking?

Now consider the physical space in which you’ll be doing your thinking. Does the space convey a relaxed atmosphere? What can you add (such as a mini zen garden or a small fountain) or remove (such as a ticking clock) to make the space feel more relaxed?

Finally, how can you make sure your thinkers are coming prepared to cooperate rather than compete? How can you place emphasis on positive outcomes to get your thinkers excited about the process?
