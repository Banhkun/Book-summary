## Exercise: Be Your Own Thinking Partner

While Kline’s thinking session process is designed for pairs or groups, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to think through something without help from others. Try adapting Kline’s process to use as an individual.

* * *

Begin by explaining everything you think about the problem or topic you’re dealing with. Pretend you’re talking to someone who doesn’t know anything about it, and give yourself the same encouraging, open attention you’d give to another person. You may want to speak into a recording device or write your thoughts down so you can refer back to them as you go.

Once you’ve fully exhausted your ideas, decide what you want to accomplish next (your goal for the thinking session).

Next, identify what’s standing in the way of accomplishing this goal. What assumption is blocking your progress?

Use Kline’s formula to turn your assumption into a liberating question: “If I knew,” plus the liberating assumption, plus “how would I [approach the situation]?” Write this down since you don’t have a thinking partner to memorize it for you, and then ask yourself this question until you’ve said absolutely everything you can think of.

As with the partnered and group processes, end your individual session with appreciation. Identify something you like about yourself and say it out loud so you finish your session feeling encouraged and positive.
