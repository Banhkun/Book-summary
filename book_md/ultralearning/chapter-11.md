## Chapter 11: Principle 8—Deeper Knowledge and Intuition

Beginners often fixate on surface-level aspects of a problem or learning goal. In contrast, experts delve into deeper layers and principles. This approach is more successful because it leads to a more complete understanding of the problem and its solution.

Deeper understanding improves intuition. We often think of intuition as mysterious and unexplainable, but actually, intuition is the result of deep, detailed understanding. When you have a lot of experience and knowledge related to a problem, you are better equipped to think of novel ways to solve it.

It’s not enough to overlearn something—that won’t deepen your understanding. There are four critical rules to developing deeper knowledge.

#### Rule #1: Let Yourself Struggle

Force yourself to struggle when you encounter a difficult problem or obstacle to your learning goal. Encourage this by setting a timer for 10-15 minutes and pushing yourself to work on the problem at least until the timer goes off. Either you will solve the problem during that time, or you better support yourself to solve the problem later because as stated in Chapter 6, you boost retrieval when you allow yourself to struggle to come up with answers you don’t have.

#### Rule #2: Aim to Prove

We often think we understand things when in reality we have only a partial or rudimentary understanding. Researchers have deemed this phenomenon the “illusion of explanatory depth.” For example, you might think you understand what a bicycle is and how it works, but if you were asked to draw a detailed picture of the mechanisms, you might find that you don’t understand as much as you thought. We think we understand better than we do because we evaluate our understanding using indirect signals.

Always ask yourself, “Do I understand this well enough to explain how it works?” Experts don’t consider something to be understood unless it is understood deeply, and they usually define that differently than those who are less proficient. Whereas a beginner might replicate the processes of others and become proficient, experts master things because rather than copy the processes and results of others, they work through their own process of achieving the result. This can cause detours and delays, but the result is that you learn more deeply. If you start with the answer to a problem and figure out your own way of arriving at that answer, you will have a deeper understanding than if you simply followed the traditional route to reaching the answer. For example, you will learn math more deeply by starting with the solution of an equation and working backwards to understand it than you will memorizing the equation that creates the result.

#### Rule #3: Challenge Your Understanding

When you don’t know enough about a skill or topic, something known as the _Dunning-Kruger effect_ can make you believe you still know more than those with proven understanding. The more you know, generally, the more you question what you know. If you don’t challenge what you do know, you will consequently know less.

If you don’t ask questions out of a desire to “feel good” about your knowledge level, you rob yourself of deeper learning, and your overall knowledge suffers because you convince yourself you do know enough. Make sure your learning standards are strict and frequently question yourself. There is no such thing as a dumb question because the act of questioning supports you to gain knowledge you might have missed otherwise.

#### Rule #4: Prioritize Concrete Examples

It’s difficult for the human brain to comprehend abstract concepts. We need to connect the abstract information to concrete associations. This works best if you create your own concrete examples, because the way you think about what you’re learning directly impacts retention. If you process information by making deeper, more personal associations to it, you retain it at a deeper level. If you’re not able to come up with a concrete example, you likely don’t understand deeply enough.

For example, in a recent recall study, participants were shown a list of words. Half of the group was told they’d be tested on the words, and the other half was just told to study them. The groups were then split in half again, and one half was instructed to notice the words with the letter “e” in them (shallow processing), while the other was instructed to notice how the words made them feel (deep processing). It turned out that the testing motivation made no difference, but **those instructed to notice how the words made them feel retained twice as many words.** This “concrete association” method supports retention, develops intuition (deep understanding), and provides feedback because you need to understand what you’re learning deeply in order to create a concrete example.

Alternatively, say you’re studying the periodic table of elements (abstract information), and using flashcards to do so. Connect the abstract information to something concrete by imagining something you’d do with each element. For example, if you’re learning about copper, imagine making a penny out of copper.

### The Feynman Technique

Physicist Richard Feynman, known for his eccentric approach to learning, inspired an ultralearning method for developing deeper knowledge. It’s a valuable tool when you want to understand an idea intuitively. The method has three steps:

**Step #1:** Grab a piece of paper and document the issue or idea you’re seeking to understand.

**Step #2:** Underneath the idea, write an explanation of the idea as if you’re teaching another person.

  * If you’re exploring a problem, give a detailed description of how to solve it, and explain why it’s the best approach.
  * If you’re exploring an idea, describe it with the assumption that your reader has no knowledge of the idea.



**Step #3:** As you’re completing step #2, stop whenever you don’t feel able to clearly explain, and review your learning resources to get clarity. Then continue with your explanation.

This method helps you overcome the illusion of explanatory depth (which makes you think you know something better than you do) by making you describe what you’re learning in detail.

There are three significant scenarios this method can benefit.

#### Scenario #1: Lack of Understanding

When you don’t understand something at all, apply the method while going back and forth between it and your learning materials. This allows you to slow down and make sense of an idea until you understand it deeply enough to describe it to others.

#### Scenario #2: Problem-Solving Difficulties

When you come across a problem that feels unsolvable, or you’re struggling to master a skill or method, use the Feynman technique to create a standard explanation summary, but as you’re doing so, break the problem down step-by-step (in even greater detail than the summary). This keeps you from writing your explanations only in summary form, which may cause you to lose key details for your understanding. You invest more time upfront, but you save time later by solidifying your understanding in one practice session. For example,

#### Scenario #3: Intuition Development

Try developing your deeper understanding of an idea by exploring it in a wide variety of ways. For example, create abstract, visual representations rather than putting each detail into words, (the intention being to create examples that learners with less understanding will easily grasp).
