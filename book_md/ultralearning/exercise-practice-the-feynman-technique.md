## Exercise: Practice the Feynman Technique

Reflect on your topic or skill and identify an aspect you have some confidence in your understanding of.

* * *

How well do you feel you understand this aspect? Write about your understanding of it in as much detail as possible.

Now write about the aspect again, but this time, write about it as though you are teaching it to someone else.

If possible, draw a visual representation of the aspect below.

Compared to the beginning of this process, how deeply do you feel you understand the aspect now?
