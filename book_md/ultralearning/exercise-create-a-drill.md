## Exercise: Create a Drill

Consider your learning goals and review the drilling methods available to you (segmentation, replication, concentration, and chaining) to determine solutions for any areas of your process that need work.

Which aspects of what you’re learning are most challenging? Which are most important to the overall skill or topic?

Of the drilling methods (segmentation, replication, concentration, and chaining), what are two you might select to address the aspects? Why?

Describe how you’ll apply one of the drilling methods in practice today.
