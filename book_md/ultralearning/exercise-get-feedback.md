## Exercise: Get Feedback

Reflect on the 3 core types of feedback (outcome, informational, and corrective).

* * *

Considering your topic or skill, what is one way you can get outcome feedback (detail-less feedback based entirely on results)?

What are two ways you can get information feedback (solutionless feedback on what isnâ€™t working)?

What are two ways you can get corrective feedback (feedback that tells you both the problem and solution)?

Now consider the methods listed for improving feedback (noise cancellation, deliberate uncertainty, metafeedback, and intensive feedback). What is one method you can use to improve your feedback experience for your topic or skill? What might this look like?
