## Chapter 14: Ultralearning at Home and at Work

This final chapter explores methods for raising a child to become a proficient ultralearner (whether it be in one or multiple disciplines), using chess prodigy Judit Polgar sisters as a case study. The chapter then pivots to how to apply ultralearning strategies in your work and home environments.

### The Polgar Family Strategy

One of the most famous examples of a child ultralearner is Judit Polgar, the best female chess player in history. Trained with her sisters from a very young age by their father, Laszlo Polgar, Judit eventually became a grandmaster, and the 8th-best chess player in the world, shattering long-held gender barriers and becoming the only woman ever to compete in the World Chess Championship.

Judit and her two sisters were all raised from early childhood to become chess masters. Their father believed genius was a result of education rather than genetic factors. He began his daughters’ chess education by teaching them the basics, then taking them with him to play practice games in local chess clubs. While her siblings developed incredible chess skills, Judit was the most obsessive and ambitious of the three. She became skilled enough to develop a rivalry with chess king Garry Kasparov, losing their first game together and winning the second. His eventual defeat marked a positive change in the chess world’s attitude towards female chess players and proved the efficacy of Laszlo Polgar’s ultralearning strategies.

#### How to Raise Successful Ultralearners

Through the lens of the Polgar family’s story, consider how you can apply the following ultralearning principles with young learners.

##### 1\. Metalearning

Laszlo Polgar explored and identified the best ways to learn chess and created optimal learning conditions for his daughters. He designed activities, built a collection of materials, developed strategies, and constructed an incremental, long-term education plan that allowed his children to learn the game slowly and deeply.

##### 2\. Focus

Laszlo made concentration a top priority in his coaching of his daughters. He gave them opportunities to increase their endurance by signing them up for marathon chess tournaments.

##### 3\. Directness

A critical part of the Polgars’ chess education was direct practice. Laszlo started bringing them to live games very young, allowing them to learn how to adapt to real-life variables like differences in skill or time constraints. This made future competitions less intimidating.

##### 4\. Drill

Laszlo also took care to isolate aspects of the game or skill set for the girls to practice intensively. For example, he used games involving blindfolds to encourage quick thinking and creative problem-solving.

##### 5\. Retrieval

The Polgars often learned via the _Socratic method_ , solving challenges and answering questions formulated by Laszlo rather than reciting memorized information. For example, he would ask them to explain or practice plays without looking at the board (where the plays were documented).

##### 6\. Feedback

Judit and her sisters learned to pursue live chess play, but Laszlo set each of them up with opponents who generally matched their skill level. He made sure they were challenged, but not overwhelmed by the skill of others, and he made adjustments to the match-ups as their skills improved. In doing this, he was able to get direct and immediate feedback from the practice environment about the girls’ progress.

##### 7\. Retention

To reduce the chances of lost knowledge, Laszlo had the sisters play games at an accelerated speed while using previously learned chess patterns. He also deepened retention by using deliberately spaced practice.

##### 8\. Deeper Knowledge

The Polgars developed deeper knowledge by writing articles about chess (an iteration of the Feynman Technique), engaging in chess “play” (chess-related activities with no specific goals), and coming up with creative solutions to random challenges posed by Laszlo. This unstructured creative process allowed the girls to look at the game and their gameplay from new and deeper perspectives.

##### 9\. Experimentation

Eventually, the skills of the Polgar sisters exceeded the skill of their father, and they had to continue developing their gameplay through self-directed experimentation. Each of the girls chose strategies and areas of focus that began to define their individual playing styles.

As the sisters matured into adults, they continued to embody the standard ultralearner formula (obsessive, intensive, and self-directed learning). Judit and her sister Zsuzsa became grand masters, while Zsofia achieved the title of international master.

### Strategies for Successful Ultralearning in Any Environment

Ultralearning is not just limited to the experience of the individual. Ultralearning strategies and perspectives are valuable for all aspects of life and society. Broader goals might include self-sufficient students who understand how to direct their learning outside of the classroom or ambitious employees taking the initiative to improve their skill sets and contribute to the goals of their companies. Whatever the endgame, there are three strategies that will powerfully encourage an ultralearning approach in any environment.

#### Strategy #1: Prioritize Inspiration

Inspiration is a critical part of what motivates us to learn. That inspiration can be extrinsic, like the excitement of taking a new direction in your career, the hope that what you’re learning will result in financial success, or the anticipation of a fit body. It can also be intrinsic, like taking up dancing because you’ve always enjoyed watching others dance and you want to learn for fun. It doesn’t matter what your motivation is, as long as it’s powerful enough for you to invest in. For example, if you’re an educator, you might implement a lesson plan where your students get to design their own topic of study for a trimester. This allows them to get excited about a topic and pursue understanding from intrinsic inspiration.

#### Strategy #2: Use Competition to Your Advantage

Be mindful of how your learning environment can impact your confidence. If you have natural talent at a skill, try putting yourself in competitive practice environments with peers to encourage self-confidence. If you are of moderate or low talent, try a more creative and individualized approach to practice (this will encourage you to measure your growth in competition with yourself rather than your peers). In many cases, you may start out with a more individualized approach and evolve to competitive environments.

Early self-confidence is an important part of the ultralearning process. It’s not necessary to already be skilled at something to get invested in learning it, but it is necessary to believe it’s possible to _become_ skilled. For example, if your perception of math is that you’re terrible at it and will never learn, you will not feel motivated to improve (it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy). Alternatively, if your perception of math is that you don’t understand it but with time and effort could gain proficiency, you are more likely to pursue that goal.

#### Strategy #3: Focus on Learning

Rather than using a specific end result to motivate your learning, let learning itself motivate your goals. For example, if you’re an employer, give your employees work they can complete relatively easily, but regularly give them small projects requiring skills they don’t yet have. Your employees get to struggle through learning new skills and this encourages a collective learning driven mentality in the workplace.

In our society, we often use learning as a means to an end, rather than making it the goal on its own. For example, you take a coding class at work not to deeply learn coding, but to complete a list of new tasks your employer wants to add to your job. The benefit of focusing on learning is that it teaches employees to work through solving difficult problems and reveals individual and organizational strengths that might have otherwise gone undiscovered.

### A Note on Alternative Learning

While ultralearning strategies may be a perfect fit for you, there is still value to other learning approaches. There are two notable alternative approaches you might consider.

#### Approach #1: Low-Intensity Learning

Habits exist on a spectrum. On one end, habits require little to no effort, on the other, they require intensive effort (ultralearning). The majority fall into the middle, requiring moderate effort. Typically, as proficiency increases, so does enjoyment. Low-intensity learning habits (for example, practicing Spanish sporadically with no specific proficiency goals) can be enjoyable, but not as efficient or effective as ultralearning habits. They’re effective when you’re learning at a leisurely pace, for the purpose of enjoyment, or as a strategy for maintenance after the conclusion of an ultralearning project. For example, if you’re learning a new language but aren’t giving yourself time-constraints, or you are just learning for fun, you might, upon reaching basic proficiency, simply travel to the applicable country and naturally improve with immersion.

Habits are most effective when your learning process consists of a gradual addition of new pieces of knowledge or abilities. In contrast, the ultralearning approach is most effective when what is being learned is challenging, or triggers mental obstacles within the learner to be worked with and overcome. For example, if you’re upgrading your skill set in the sales field, you might use ultralearning to replace out of date communication skills with new communication skills that reflect the modern sales environment (like pitching to clients digitally versus making cold calls or conducting door-to-door sales).

#### Approach #2: Traditional Education

As stated, ultralearning doesn’t have to be done alone. It’s characterized by being self-directed, and if you determine that formal education is effective for you, the use of it is still aligned with ultralearning. What is most important is that you use ultralearning to create more opportunities for yourself. No approach is discounted.

There are a few benefits to prioritizing formal education over ultralearning.

##### #1: Credentials

If you’re learning for professional purposes and your target profession will benefit from credentials, formal education is a smart approach.

##### #2: Beneficial Learning Environment

Some elements of formal education slow or impede learning, but there are other elements you _only_ find in the traditional setting. For example, if you’re an artist, you’ll benefit from the apprenticeship-style approach of many well-regarded art schools. Other concentrations may benefit from programs that facilitate team learning experiences.

##### #3: Community

If you go to graduate school, you will likely have access to an entire community that lives and breathes your educational focus, which will provide you with invaluable information from specialists and access to opportunities you may not find learning on your own.

### Conclusion

In the end, the ultimate benefit of becoming a well-practiced ultralearner is that you set yourself up to continually strengthen and expand your capacity for learning throughout life. Through the use of ultralearning strategies, the possibilities for developing your full potential are limitless.
