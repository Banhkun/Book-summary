## 1-Page Summary

In _The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth,_ John C. Maxwell—a personal growth and leadership consultant—argues that personal growth is key to a successful, fulfilling life. Maxwell doesn’t explicitly define personal growth, except to say that **it enables you to become the best possible version of yourself—your “highest self.”**

His book offers 15 guiding principles for personal growth, based largely on lessons he learned from his career. Maxwell started out as a pastor and soon discovered that his calling is helping others grow. This led him to become an author and motivational speaker, and he has since founded several organizations that promote leadership.

This guide synthesizes Maxwell’s 15 laws of growth into five main principles:

  * In **Principle 1: Prioritize Character Building,** we explore the importance of building character before you pursue personal growth.
  * In **Principle 2: Know Yourself, Love Yourself,** we discuss the role of self-knowledge and self-love in personal growth.
  * In **Principle 3: Commit to Growth,** we describe the necessary step of making a commitment to grow.
  * In **Principle 4: Take Thoughtful Action,** we explain how to take thoughtful action toward your goals by planning strategically and consistently following through on those plans.
  * In **Principle 5: Become a Lifelong Learner,** we discuss the value of becoming a lifelong learner—someone who is perpetually committed to growth.



We’ll expand on these principles by comparing Maxwell’s advice with the perspectives of other self-help authors and current research on personal growth.

### Principle 1: Prioritize Character Building

Maxwell claims that **the foundation of personal growth is good, strong character.** By his definition, having “good, strong character” means that you embody three universally-valued traits: honesty, integrity, and generosity. Additionally, you’ll consistently act in accordance with these values, even when it’s inconvenient or challenging. According to Maxwell, **everyone should prioritize building character** **over all other goals**.

(Shortform note: Maxwell suggests three “universally-valued” traits that comprise good character, but according to moral relativists, there is no universal moral code—rather, the importance of different values is culturally determined, For example, some cultures consider obedience and devotion to your parents to be an essential component of good character. Even if your essential values are different from Maxwell’s, you can still prioritize building your character by living out the values important to _you_.)

Throughout this section, we’ll explain why Maxwell thinks building character is an essential part of personal growth. Then, we’ll look at two of his strategies to help you prioritize character-building.

#### Why Building Character Helps You Grow

Maxwell emphasizes building character not only because it _ensures_ that you achieve your highest self—the ultimate goal of personal growth—but also because it _maximizes_ the potential of your highest self. Let’s explore how strong character contributes to each of these outcomes.

##### Strong Character _Ensures_ That You Achieve Your Highest Self

As you pursue goals in different parts of your life, you’ll find yourself in some novel situations—you’ll meet new people, take on new challenges, and try new things. According to Maxwell, **having good, strong character will ensure your success in these situations** because demonstrating honesty will make people respect you, acting with integrity will show people that you hold yourself to a high standard of behavior, and showing generosity by treating people well will make people want to collaborate with you.

If you _consistently_ act in accordance with these values, people will find you more dependable and trustworthy, which will help you connect with people in your life who can help you achieve your goals.

On the other hand, **if you have bad or weak character, Maxwell says, you’ll be more susceptible to failure** **because you’ll disregard your values when making decisions.** If you see an easy way out of a dilemma, you’ll take it, even if it’s unethical. This might benefit you in the short term, but in the long run, it can set you back. For example, if you own a business, cutting corners might help you turn profits, but it could also ruin your reputation.

> **Strong Relationships Allow You to Flourish**
> 
> Research supports Maxwell’s claim that having good character can help you make and keep valuable connections with others. Psychologists have demonstrated that having good character helps win people over in all stages of life. In childhood, we’re more open to befriending people who display positive character traits like fairness and humor. We’re also more likely to have satisfying, sustainable friendships with people who are honest and kind. This holds true in the workplace, too—when coworkers practice honesty, kindness, and other key values with each other, it leads to a healthier work environment, which promotes collaboration, employee performance, and job satisfaction.
> 
> Research also supports Maxwell’s idea that healthy relationships are important if you want to succeed. While Maxwell focuses on how relationships can help you achieve various goals, maintaining fulfilling relationships may be a worthwhile goal in and of itself: According to an 80-year study by researchers at Harvard University, healthy, meaningful relationships with friends, family, and members of your community help you flourish in life because relationships are more emotionally enriching than wealth or career success.
> 
> Demonstrating strong character may also help you flourish financially: Research suggests that ethical companies outshine their competitors, and unethical business dealings can incur heavy financial consequences. However, it’s important to prioritize your relational success—and your character, since that determines the quality of your relationships— _over_ financial success. Psychologists say that if you prioritize your finances, you may be more motivated to act immorally in order to keep or build your wealth.

##### Character Building _Maximizes_ the Potential of Your Highest Self

Since character determines what you’re capable of achieving,**prioritizing the strength of your character can empower you to reach new heights.** If you improve your character, and therefore your moral integrity, Maxwell says you’ll get better at intentionally living out your values with relative ease. In turn, you’ll be able to make steadier progress toward your goals.

(Shortform note: In a sense, Maxwell’s character-building is a lot like developing a healthy habit: Routinely practicing a value like honesty will eventually make it feel like second nature to you rather than a conscious decision. As such, you can practice character-building the same way you’d develop a habit, by linking your desired behavior with both a cue that tells your brain it’s time to perform the behavior and a reward after you’ve performed it. For example, if you want to become more honest, you might make a conscious effort to give your honest opinion whenever someone asks you for it (the cue) and then take time to congratulate yourself for your honesty (the reward). Over time, you’ll develop a habit of honesty.)

**According to Maxwell, If you develop _excellent_ character, you might be able to make powerful, positive changes in the world and act as living proof of the benefits of personal growth**—and since having excellent character means being very generous, you'll feel compelled to help others grow, too. Maxwell believes that demonstrating excellent character makes the world a better place, one of the primary benefits of personal growth.

(Shortform note: Making a difference in the lives of other people is important to Maxwell, but why should it be important to _you_? Psychologists suggest that altruistic behavior has several benefits, including decreased stress and what’s known as “the helper’s high”—the positive feelings you might have after you show someone kindness. Additionally, helping others may prompt an increased sense of purpose, which is linked to improved life satisfaction and better lifelong health outcomes.)

#### How to Make Character-Building a Priority

Maxwell suggests two mindsets that will help you prioritize character-building: First, continually seek opportunities to serve others. Second, consciously act in alignment with your values. Let’s explore these ideas further.

##### Mindset #1: Seek Opportunities to Serve Others

Maxwell says that **you should generously invest time, energy, and money in ways that benefit the lives of others** —for example, you could volunteer or donate to a charity that helps people in need. Serving others will expand your capacity for generosity, which is one of the three traits Maxwell says comprise a healthy character.

(Shortform note: Maxwell encourages building character by giving to others—but before doing so, you may need to nurture your _sense of generosity_. Research suggests that _compassion is the emotional basis for generous behavior_ —so if you’d like to become a more generous person, start by cultivating your sense of compassion. One way to accomplish this is through loving-kindness meditation, during which you actively wish the best for others in your life.)

##### Mindset #2: Consciously Act in Alignment With Your Values

Maxwell argues that **in any situation, you should practice integrity by making a conscious choice to act in alignment with your values instead of acting impulsively.**

(Shortform note: While Maxwell encourages you to _always_ live according to your values, most people end up making some moral mistakes throughout life. According to research, you’re most likely to make these mistakes when you don’t fully grasp the ethical implications of a decision or when you feel social or situational pressure to behave immorally. If you notice yourself neglecting your values, try to understand the consequences of your actions or to change the circumstances that influenced you to act immorally. For example, if you value kindness but snap at your loved ones when you’re stressed, work to understand _why_ you snap and take steps to reduce your stress.)

### Principle 2: Know Yourself, Love Yourself

Maxwell says that in addition to strong character, **there are two vital competencies to have** **_before_ you can grow:**

  1. **Self-knowledge:** an understanding of your values, passions, and capabilities
  2. **Self-love:** a belief that you’re both worthy of being and able to become your highest self



(Shortform note: Maxwell notes that you need these competencies _before_ growth, but for most people, self-knowledge and self-love are lifelong projects. You’ll always be discovering new things about yourself—which is why it’s not uncommon to shift to a new career when your values change. And, for some people, self-love can be a lengthy journey: Research suggests that self-esteem, which is one component of self-love, waxes and wanes over the course of a lifetime. Since self-knowledge and self-love fluctuate so much, there’s no “right amount” to have of each before beginning your growth journey—you only need to know and love yourself well enough to get started.)

In this section, we’ll explain how these factors can help you achieve personal growth. Then, we’ll talk about how you can improve your self-knowledge and learn to love yourself more.

#### Why Self-Knowledge Helps You Grow

According to Maxwell, **self-knowledge helps you grow because it enables you to think _realistically_ about what your highest self looks like. **Once you understand your values, passions, and abilities, you can weigh them against each other and use them to pinpoint realistic, achievable goals.

(Shortform note: As you consider what your highest self might look like, make sure you’re taking into account _all_ of the parts of life that matter to you. In _Designing Your Life, _Bill Burnett and Dave Evans explain that it’s important to think about your highest self _holistically_ , creating realistic goals in four areas of your life: health, work, joy, and relationships. It’s important to set and pursue goals in all four areas—if you don’t, you’ll end up feeling unsatisfied with those parts of your life you don’t give attention to.)

It’s important to have realistic goals for two reasons: First, they make it possible to create a personal growth journey that’s both _accurate to_ and _possible for_ who you are _._ Second, they give you a clear target—if you don’t know what your highest self looks like, it’s hard to determine whether the steps you’re taking are in the right direction. Maxwell notes that the lack of a clear target can cause you to waste time pursuing a goal that you _think_ is your life purpose but isn’t right for you.

(Shortform note: Maxwell says that setting realistic goals helps you avoid making mistakes—but it’s important not to take this to the degree of perfectionism: the belief that if you make mistakes, you’re a failure. As you grow, you’ll probably make some mistakes, and that’s okay. Mistakes are just a way to refine your self-knowledge; you can learn from them and make better choices in the future.)

#### Why Self-Love Helps You Grow

**According to Maxwell, self-love empowers you to achieve your goals—it helps you know your worth, motivating you to invest in yourself.** You’ll see the value in opportunities to better yourself, and you’ll be more inclined to go after them. Self-love also naturally translates into self-confidence, which helps you overcome self-doubt and see your opportunities through.

(Shortform note: Maxwell’s suggestion—to work from a place of self-love—runs contrary to what many people do—use their self-loathing as motivation to change what they don’t like about themselves. Research suggests that Maxwell’s method is more effective: Self-criticism can hold you back from making progress toward your goals. Psychologists also say that self-bullying has a negative impact on your mental health, so it’s more effective to be kind to yourself when trying to achieve goals.)

#### How to Cultivate Self-Knowledge and Self-Love

We’ve covered _why_ self-knowledge and self-love are _essential_ to personal growth, as they’re responsible for your ability to create and pursue achievable goals. Now, let’s explore _how_ you can cultivate each of these skills.

##### Develop Self-Knowledge: Explore Who You Are

To get to know yourself better, Maxwell suggests you brainstorm to determine your interests and abilities:

**First, define your values, talents, and passions** by answering the following questions: What do you like to do? What are you already good at doing? What is it about these things that captivate you? Are these things important to you, and if so, why?

**Then, determine what you’re realistically capable of achieving.** Take stock of your strengths and weaknesses, your available opportunities, and your time, energy, and resources.

> **Use Self-Knowledge to Find Your Life’s Purpose**
> 
> As Maxwell notes, figuring out your purpose in life isn’t as simple as “following your passion”—passion _alone_ doesn’t necessarily lead to fulfillment. While Maxwell urges you to consider your values, talents, and passions, the authors of _Ikigai_ suggest _four factors of your life that must intersect if you want to discover your life’s purpose_ :
> 
>   * What you love doing
> 
>   * What you can realistically accomplish, given your skills and limitations
> 
>   * What you can contribute to the world to help meet its needs
> 
>   * What you can be paid for, if that’s important to you
> 
> 

> 
> These four factors may get you even _closer_ to success than Maxwell’s suggestions can, in several ways. First, you'll not only think about what feels good to you or comes to you easily, but you’ll also think about which of your talents or passions is _useful_ in terms of making a living. Second, as we discussed, Maxwell considers helping others one of the main benefits of personal growth. Consciously incorporating this into the way you think about your life’s purpose heightens your chances of accomplishing it.__

##### Develop Self-Love: Practice Self-Esteem Boosters

If you struggle to know your worth or to feel confident in yourself, Maxwell recommends several practices for bolstering self-love:

**1) Take pride in your character and previous achievements.** If you’ve made any good choices or a positive impact in someone else’s life, even in small ways, congratulate yourself.

(Shortform note: One way to celebrate your character and achievements is to reward yourself with something you enjoy, like an at-home spa day or a delicious treat. According to psychologists, rewarding yourself links desired behaviors with an increase in dopamine—a “feel-good” neurotransmitter that your brain releases when you do something pleasurable. Over time, you’ll associate desired behaviors with dopamine release, which encourages you to continue these behaviors in the future.)

**2) Practice positive self-talk.** Let go of limiting beliefs, such as the belief that you’re not smart enough to achieve your dreams, and tell yourself that you can do what you set your mind to.

(Shortform note: Limiting beliefs are those that tell you that you _can’t_ do something you want or need to do because you’re not good enough, smart enough, lovable enough, and so on. One way to dispel limiting beliefs is to challenge them—that is, reason out why these beliefs are probably untrue. For example, if you formed the limiting belief that you don’t deserve romantic love, you might explore reasons that you _are_ deserving of love, starting with a list of things that are lovable about you. Once you work through and reject these limiting beliefs, it’s easier to say—and believe—positive things about yourself.)

### Principle 3: Commit to Growth

Once you’ve developed the foundational mindset needed to pursue personal growth, Maxwell says **it’s time to take the next step of _committing_ to growth.** In the context of personal growth, commitment means _setting an intention_ to become your highest self—and, crucially, _following through on that intention_ by making the changes and seeking out the opportunities that will get you there.

(Shortform note: If you don’t feel ready to commit to personal growth, that’s okay—but don’t let that feeling hold you back from getting started. It’s normal to hesitate before undertaking growth-related challenges, but the only way to reap the rewards of growth is to push through discomfort and take action anyway. It may help to keep in mind that when it comes to personal growth, you’re aiming for improvement, not perfection. You don’t need perfect character or complete self-knowledge and self-love to commit to growth—you just need an intention to get better and a willingness to follow through on it.)

In this section, we’ll explain why Maxwell believes commitment is necessary and why you shouldn’t put commitment off. Then, we’ll explore some ways you can commit yourself to growth today.

#### Why Making a Commitment Helps You Grow

**Maxwell argues that making a commitment is necessary because growth can only happen intentionally— _not_ accidentally. **Many people make the mistake of expecting to grow automatically throughout their lives. Because of this, they never intentionally improve themselves; then, they wind up dissatisfied with how their lives turn out.

(Shortform note: Although Maxwell argues here that you can only grow intentionally, he has said elsewhere that accidental growth can happen—it’s just not as effective as purposeful growth. In any case, his position is that intentionality helps you achieve more than you would otherwise.)

#### How to Make a Commitment to Grow

Maxwell doesn’t just encourage commitment—**he encourages making a commitment to growth** **_today_ because the longer you procrastinate, the less likely you are to do it.** Here’s how you can cement your commitment and avoid procrastination:

(Shortform note: Maxwell argues against procrastination due to the way it can make you lose your motivation to follow through on growth. However, there’s another reason not to procrastinate on making commitments: It can lead to loss of _opportunities_. You won’t be able to take advantage of the opportunities to grow that are available to you right now, and they may not be available to you in the future. In _Predictably Irrational, _Dan Ariely recommends evaluating how time-sensitive your opportunities are and immediately pursuing any that are likely to disappear in the near future.)

##### Method #1: Evaluate Your Excuses

**If you don’t feel ready to commit to growth, a good place to start is to evaluate your excuses.** You might be able to think up some reasons for putting off growth, like fear of failure, not knowing how to get started, lack of time, or lack of motivation. But according to Maxwell, none of these are valid excuses—the benefits of personal growth outweigh whatever reasons you might have for putting it off. Don’t let your excuses hold you back; instead, find a way to overcome them.

For example, say that you’re worried you don’t have enough time to exercise. If you evaluate this excuse, you might realize that you spend a lot of time on non-essential activities like watching TV. In that case, your excuse wouldn’t hold up—you have plenty of free time; you just have to start spending it more wisely.

(Shortform note: Maxwell claims that no excuse should stop you from pursuing growth—but there _are_ situations where you may have valid reasons for putting off growth. If you’re “in survival mode”—focused on merely surviving from one day to the next—you’re not going to have the time, energy, or resources to start pursuing your bigger dreams. For example, if you’re exhausted because you’re caring for an aging parent, it’s probably not wise to add anything extra to your plate. However, you can still recognize your desire to grow and make a commitment to honor that intention _when the right time comes along._)

##### Method #2: Schedule Time to Grow

Once you have an intention in mind, you must set it in stone and give yourself time to follow through on it. That’s why Maxwell suggests **assigning time in your schedule every day, for at least a year, that you’ll devote to pursuing your personal growth-related goals.** For example, you might schedule time to practice the piano every evening after dinner.

(Shortform note: One benefit of scheduling personal growth is that it can help you manage your time more wisely—ensuring that you prioritize the right things in your daily agenda. If you fill your schedule with activities you really care about—in this case, growth-oriented activities—you won’t have as much time for, or waste as much time on, the things you _don’t_ care about.)

##### Method #3: Make Your First Move

**Today, find a way to make immediate progress toward achieving one of your goals.** For example, if you’ve made learning piano one of your goals, write down, right now, a time you plan to practice today—or even sit down and practice for 15 minutes. Taking _immediate_ action toward your goals will affirm your commitment to growth and help you avoid procrastination.

(Shortform note: Maxwell’s suggestion to take a tiny, immediate step forward is meant to make growth seem more easily doable. In _One Small Step Can Change Your Life, _Robert Maurer __ explains that breaking large goals down into small, achievable steps helps you avoid feeling overwhelmed by the amount of time and effort changes take, which is one of the main drivers of procrastination. Additionally, as you easily overcome these small steps,your successes will motivate you to keep going.)

### Principle 4: Take Thoughtful Action

Making a commitment to your growth and taking the first steps to follow through on that commitment is a _launching point_ for your personal growth journey. From there, to become your highest self, Maxwell says you’ll have to act __ on that commitment over the long term **by taking _thoughtful action._ This means __ planning challenges and opportunities for improvement in your life—and consistently rising to meet them. **

In this section, we’ll explain why thoughtful action helps you on your journey of personal growth. Then, we’ll discuss Maxwell’s tips for taking thoughtful action effectively.

#### Why Taking Thoughtful Action Helps You Grow

**Thoughtful action has two components: strategy and consistent follow-through.** First, you’ll _strategically plan the course of action_ you’ll take to progress toward your goals. Then, you’ll _consistently follow through_ on your plans by making a daily habit of pursuing your goals. Let’s explore how each of these components contributes to growth.

##### Strategic Planning Increases Productivity

**The strategic planning component of thoughtful action helps you grow because it helps you be more productive.** When you strategize effectively, you make tactical choices about how your time, effort, and resources are best spent. You then devote yourself to the opportunities that will actually help you achieve your goals. As a result, you won’t waste your time and energy on unnecessary challenges.

(Shortform note: Strategizing can help you make wise investments, but life is unpredictable—beyond being strategic, you’ll have to be adaptable if you want to continue productively pursuing your goals. Adaptability is about correcting your course when you realize that something you’re doing—or planning to do—isn’t going to work anymore. If your circumstances change and one of your goals suddenly seems impossible, adaptability allows you to determine what _is_ possible and revise your plans—or, if necessary, the goal itself—accordingly.)

##### Consistent Follow-Through Demands Concrete Effort

**The consistent follow-through component of thoughtful action helps you grow because it involves making a concrete, consistent effort to accomplish your goals.** Recall that Maxwell says you can only grow intentionally, not accidentally—if you want to achieve something, you have to take real action toward it. And, when you consistently act on your intention to grow, you’ll make slow but steady progress toward realizing your highest self.

(Shortform note: While Maxwell focuses on how consistent effort carries you toward your goals, it’s also beneficial in those situations where you _don’t_ accomplish your goals, in several ways. First, in _Keep Going, Austin Kleon_ explains that the process of pursuing a goal is more fulfilling than achieving the goal. Focusing on the consistent steps along the way to your goal will help you feel satisfied with how you spent your time—regardless of the _result_ of your effort. Second, effort doesn’t necessarily lead to success—uncontrollable life circumstances and social structures also play a role in what you’re able to achieve.**** If you’re sure you did what you could to pursue your goals, you’ll more easily avoid unnecessary self-blame, guilt, or shame when things don’t go your way for reasons you can’t control.)

> **Taking Thoughtful Action Builds Resilience**
> 
> Beyond productivity and concrete effort, thoughtful action—and the continual challenges it requires you to face—yields _resilience_ , or the ability to bounce back from failures. In _The Obstacle Is the Way, _Ryan Holiday argues that resilience is necessary to success in life, because things inevitably get hard. You must be able to _persevere_ through tough times and failures.
> 
> According to Holiday, you build resilience by dealing with life’s challenges head-on—resolving to accomplish whatever you’ve set out to accomplish, no matter what life throws your way. When you persist in the face of adversity, you teach yourself that you’re capable of doing hard things and boost your confidence in your ability to withstand, and move on from, even the most daunting challenges.

#### How to Take Consistent Thoughtful Action

Now that we’ve explained how thoughtful action can help you make progress toward your goals, we’ll share some of Maxwell’s tips for ensuring that your thoughtful action is both maximally productive and consistent.

##### Method #1: Make Short-Term Sacrifices

Maxwell argues that **when you take thoughtful action, you must be willing to make short-term sacrifices to achieve long-term goals.** He says that every decision you make has an opportunity cost—to succeed, you have to make smart choices about what you’re willing to lose _now_ in order to win _later._ For example, if you want to become more physically fit, you might have to exchange convenient, frozen foods for healthier, fresh foods and spend money on a gym membership.

(Shortform note: Here, Maxwell’s talking about the importance of delayed gratification—your ability to deny yourself satisfaction now so that you can reap a better reward later on. Delaying gratification can be hard—it requires both impulse control and faith that you’ll eventually receive the promised reward. You can bolster this sense of faith, and therefore your ability to delay gratification, by setting up regular reward intervals alongside your thoughtful actions. For example, if your goal is to go to the gym every weekday, planning to reward yourself every Saturday may help motivate you to follow through.)

##### Method #2: Set Yourself Up for Success

When you’re thinking about how to reach a given goal, Maxwell recommends that you **allow yourself twice the time, energy, and resources you think you’ll need.** This practice gives you extra room for any challenges you may encounter on your way to the goal, so you’ll be more able to overcome them and, therefore, more likely to succeed.

Additionally, by allowing extra time, energy, and resources, you create two possible outcomes: Either you avoid running out of these things before reaching your goal, _or_ you “beat your estimate.” Either way, you bolster your commitment: either by preventing feelings of discouragement and frustration that would make you give up or by boosting your morale with a “win.”

(Shortform note: What should you do with these extra resources if you beat your estimate? You might be tempted to reinvest those resources into another project, but remember that rest is productive, too—you need time to recharge your body and your brain so that you can perform optimally when you’re actively pursuing your goals. When you find yourself with extra time, money, or energy on your hands after a job well done, sometimes the best thing to do is relax and enjoy your success.)

##### Method #3: Stay Motivated

Maxwell says that if you keep yourself _consistently_ motivated to accomplish your goals, you’ll find it easier to take steady, thoughtful action. He suggests two ways to increase your motivation:

**1) Come up with as many “whys” as you can** —your reasons for pursuing personal growth, which should be based on your values, passions, and aspirations. Keeping these in mind can motivate you to keep going, even when it’s hard. And the more reasons you have to keep going, the more motivated you’ll be.

(Shortform note: While keeping your “whys” in mind is a good motivator, that’s often easier said than done—as you go about your day, you’ll likely be so busy that you won’t be able to keep them top of mind. Instead of keeping them in mind, try writing them down. Neuroscientific research suggests that writing down your goals can help you remember them for two reasons: First, having your goals in plain sight serves as a visual reminder of what’s important to you. Second, the very act of writing helps your brain process and more easily recall what you’re writing about.)

**2) Be accountable to yourself and others.** Concretely, this could mean keeping written track of the progress you make toward your goals or recruiting people in your life to check on your progress. According to Maxwell, this will motivate you because it makes your actions more consequential. If you don’t perform as you said you would, you’ll risk disappointing yourself and others—and since disappointment is uncomfortable, you’ll be incentivized to perform well.

(Shortform note: In some cases, you may be more motivated by extrinsic factors (such as accountability to others) than intrinsic factors (such as how personally rewarding an activity is for you). Extrinsic motivation is helpful because it gives you a good reason to do something you don’t really want to do. You may not _feel like_ cleaning the house, for example, but you may feel a sudden burst of inspiration if you invite someone over and realize they’ll see what a mess it is if you _don’t_ clean. But it’s also worthwhile to increase the effect of intrinsic motivators by searching for or creating personally meaningful reasons for your actions—for example, you might tell yourself, “I’m cleaning because I like having a clean house, and I’ll feel satisfied and cozy once it’s clean.”)

##### Method #4: Practice Self-Discipline

According to Maxwell, **if you want to take thoughtful action consistently, you’ll have to practice self-discipline:** following through on your intentions, no matter how tempted you are to do otherwise. This can help you be more consistent by enabling you to overcome the occasional bout of low motivation—you’ll keep moving forward even when you don’t particularly feel like it.

**To develop your self-discipline, Maxwell says you should train yourself to pursue growth _habitually._** For example, if you want to learn Portuguese, you might develop the habit of listening to audio lessons every time you cook. According to him, making a habit of your thoughtful actions takes the guesswork out of _how_ to pursue your goals because you have an automatic process.

> **Practical Steps for Improving Self-Discipline**
> 
> Self-discipline isn’t easy for most people since, according to psychologists, it requires you to prioritize logical decision-making over emotional decision-making. In other words, you have to be able to do what you _know_ is best for you in the long term, even if you don’t _feel_ like doing it right now. To improve your self-discipline, experts recommend these methods:
> 
>   * Practice mindfulness. Studies show that mindfulness—the practice of paying attention to what you’re experiencing without trying to change it—can train you to endure uncomfortable feelings. This makes it easier to exercise willpower because it helps you de-prioritize your emotions: Even if you don’t _enjoy_ doing what you need to do, you’ll know that you can get through it.
> 
>   * Identify and remove temptations. Temptations are things that feel emotionally satisfying in the moment but run counter to your long-term goals. By removing them, you decrease the risk that they’ll distract you—and appeal to your emotional side—when you’re deciding on the right thing to do. For example, if you’re working on your health, you might eat less junk food if you stop buying it.

### Principle 5: Become a Lifelong Learner

At this point, you’ve learned the skills and strategies you’ll need to move toward your highest self. But according to Maxwell, no matter how successful you become,**it’s vital to _never_ stop growing—which requires a lifelong commitment to learning from your experiences. **Ideally, throughout your entire life, you’ll continue to approach each new challenge and experience as a learning opportunity—gaining**** new tools, skills, and insights along the way.

(Shortform note: Maxwell focuses on how lifelong learning supports you in achieving your goals, but experts note that it has a number of other benefits. It can improve your cognitive health by strengthening your brain, which guards against dementia. It can also bolster your social life, as formal classes and other kinds of communal learning bring learners together. Lastly, it can support your self-esteem: People who continue to learn throughout their lives feel more confident in themselves, especially when they can put their knowledge to good use.)

In this section, we’ll explain why continual learning optimizes personal growth. Then, we’ll end with a few strategies to help you maximize learning and growth throughout your life.

#### Why Continual Learning Optimizes Growth

Maxwell says that learning contributes to growth in two ways: Learning from the past helps you achieve future success and helps you feel more fulfilled in life.

##### Learning From the Past Contributes to Future Success

Maxwell argues that **you’ll be more successful if you learn from past failures and successes.** If you internalize the lessons you learn from the challenges you’ve faced, you can apply them when you take your next steps forward—so instead of making the same old mistakes, you’ll be better prepared to do things right. As a result, you’ll be more likely to achieve each of your goals and, in the long run, become your highest self.

(Shortform note: One interesting way that learning from experience can contribute to your success is that it can improve your chances of being hired. Companies are showing increasing interest in candidates who demonstrate “grit” in their personal lives—the ability to persevere through difficult life circumstances and work hard to accomplish what needs to be done. Often, this asset comes from experiences such as unpaid care work, military service, travel, and so on.)

##### Learning Increases Your Sense of Fulfillment

Maxwell also argues that since it increases your chances of success, **learning also maximizes your overall life satisfaction.** If you continue to learn and grow for the rest of your life, you’ll set, and reach, increasingly loftier goals, which will help you feel like you’re making the most of your life. According to Maxwell, giving up on learning and the growth that comes with it means settling for a mediocre life.

(Shortform note: In his encouragement to never stop learning and growing, Maxwell is cautioning against “the arrival fallacy:” the erroneous idea that once you achieve success—in this case, your highest self as you envision it now—you’ll feel satisfied _for good_. While reaching goals can be fulfilling, they don’t create happiness forever. Researchers agree that happiness is more tightly linked to simply enjoying life in the moment. Committing to learning throughout your life means you’ll continue discovering things you enjoy—helping you maintain happiness, regardless of goal achievement.)

#### How to Become a Lifelong Learner

Now that you understand how lifelong learning can help you become your highest self, how exactly should you approach learning in the context of growth? Maxwell has a few recommendations:

##### Method #1: Practice Curiosity

Maxwell argues that curiosity enables you to learn valuable information and opens you up to innovative ways of thinking. He offers several strategies for practicing curiosity:

**1) Always ask, “Why?”** Practically, this means you should be open to, aware of, and inquisitive about the world around you. Viewing _every_ experience you have as a learning opportunity will help you amass a wealth of knowledge over time.

(Shortform note: Asking why can help you figure out the _root cause_ of problems—which means that you can address the actual issues causing the problem, not just the most evident symptoms of the problem. It’s like retracing your steps: If you can figure out how you got to Point Z from Point A, you’ll know exactly how to avoid arriving at Point Z again. It’s important to note that you can use this process to identify the root of _success_ as well—figuring out the precise tactics that helped you so that you can emulate them and replicate your success.)

**2) Seek out opportunities that are new and unusual to you and be open to diverse perspectives.** If you’re open-minded and innovative, you’ll maximize your chances of success because you’ll be able to overcome barriers that would otherwise hold you back. For example, say your goal is to learn Chinese but you can’t afford to take traditional classes. If you come up with a creative solution, like finding free lessons on Youtube, you’ll still be able to achieve that goal.

(Shortform note: To improve your open-mindedness, consciously practice intellectual humility and welcome challenges to your beliefs. It’s important to recognize that no matter how much you know about a topic, it’s likely that you don’t know _everything_ —you always have opportunities to learn more. Also, keep in mind that nobody’s life experience is universal, so there’s something to learn from everyone you meet. When someone challenges your beliefs, make an effort to listen to their perspective and consider the possibility that you could be wrong.)

##### Method #2: Choose Good Mentors

**Good mentors can teach you what you need to know to succeed in your personal and professional life.** According to Maxwell, you should choose mentors who have good, strong character, who have experience in what you’re trying to achieve, and who are willing and able to spend time working with you.

(Shortform note: When you’re looking for a mentor, first consider people you’re already in community with—the better your mentor knows you and your circumstances, the more personalized and helpful their advice will be. If you can’t find a mentor you already know, it’s okay to reach out to people you admire and ask them to meet with you. In these meetings, demonstrate that you’re someone worth mentoring: Be respectful of their time, expertise, and boundaries, and show them that you’re truly interested in learning from them.)

##### Method #3: Reflect

Maxwell argues that **you should take time _regularly_ to reflect on your successes and failures. **This helps you extract lessons from these experiences, which you can then apply to future opportunities.

To reflect, first write down questions that prompt you to think about challenges you’ve faced, rewarding experiences, opportunities for improvement, and what gives your life meaning. Then, write your responses to these questions. Finally, take time to think deeply about your responses, paying special attention to challenges that were painful for you. Pain is an excellent teacher—since humans are naturally averse to pain, you won’t be inclined to repeat decisions that have hurt you before.

**In pinpointing your painful experiences, make an effort to reframe them as valuable life lessons:** This will give you the necessary perspective to learn from your mistakes and implement any necessary changes.

(Shortform note: Reflection helps you overcome adversity because it gives you an opportunity to make sense of what happened, deal with negative emotions, and figure out how to grow from your experiences. In other words, going through the process of reflection can help you slow down, think about a situation clearly, and respond to a painful experience _rationally_ rather than _emotionally_.__ It’s best to write your reflections down—studies show that reflective writing helps you think more clearly about situations and doesn’t lend itself to rumination or overthinking the way mental reflection might.)
