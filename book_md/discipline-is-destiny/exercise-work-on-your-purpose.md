## Exercise: Work On Your Purpose

Holiday argues that working on your purpose is essential to the practice of discipline. Think of how you can adjust your life to make working on your purpose easier.

* * *

What is your purpose? Recall that Holiday defines purpose as work that’s _inherently_ enjoyable—not something you do in pursuit of external rewards.

How much time do you spend working on your purpose daily?

What’s the biggest obstacle that prevents you from working on your purpose? For example, you might wish to create music but struggle to do so because you lack energy after work.

Name three ways you could work around this obstacle. For example, you could stop eating junk food that makes you feel sluggish.
