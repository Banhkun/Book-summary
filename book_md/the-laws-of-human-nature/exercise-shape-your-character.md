## Exercise: Shape Your Character

There are four ways to shape your character: Become aware of your behavior patterns, create new habits, transfer your skills, and spend time with good influences.

* * *

What’s a recurring theme in your life? How might you become aware of this theme as it happens rather than only in hindsight? (For example, if you find yourself regularly being fired, consider whether there are any similarities in your behavior at any of the jobs.)

What’s a new behavior you’d like to develop? How could you reinforce it so it becomes routine? (For example, if you’d like to be more friendly, you might make a rule for yourself that every time you pass someone on the street, you say hello.)

What’s a trait you possess that’s making your character weak? (For example, you might be oversensitive.) How could you use this trait or the skills associated with it to strengthen your character? (For example, you might use your sensitivity to become more empathetic.)

Who do you know who has a strong character? How do you know? How could you spend more time with her?
