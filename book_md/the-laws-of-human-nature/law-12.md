## Law #12: People Are Bad at Long-Term Thinking

In the previous law, we looked at irrationality, a potentially self-sabotaging trait we all share. Now, we’ll look at a second universal trait—our inability to think long term.

**Humans tend to be concerned with the present rather than the future** because our brains evolved to look for immediate rather than far-off danger. This was beneficial in earlier times when all our problems were animal-like—eat, sleep, avoid predators, and so on. **We didn’t need to understand complex situations or reason; we needed to notice the most dramatic elements of a situation and react quickly.** We also tended to assume the current conditions were permanent.

Now, however, this evolutionary adaptation is to our detriment. **The world is more complicated and long-term dangers are larger problems than most of what we’ll encounter in the present.** For example, we pay more attention to terrorism than global warming, even though global warming is far more dangerous. Additionally, our attention spans are even worse because of technology, which is distracting.

In this law, we’ll learn how to control our own nature by replacing shortsightedness with long-term thinking.

### Control Your Own Nature: Escape Shortsightedness

We all think that we’re aware of the long term because we all have goals (though many of our goals are vague and more like wishes than plans). Of course, none of us is as immune to this law as we think we are.

First, we’ll look at some signs of shortsightedness. Then, we’ll look at how to escape this mindset.

#### Signs of Shortsightedness

If you see any of the following four signs, you might be suffering from shortsightedness:

##### Sign #1: Nonconsequential Thinking

Whenever you do something, **there are complicated consequences that you might not be able to predict.**

  * For example, in 19th-century India, venomous cobras roamed the streets of Delhi. British authorities decided this was a problem and offered a reward for every dead cobra turned in, anticipating this would lower the cobra population. Instead, locals bred cobras so they could kill them, turn them in, and make money. When the authorities realized this was happening, they canceled the bounty. The breeders retaliated by releasing all their cobras, and the cobra population increased by 300%.



**If you find yourself thinking that if you do something, your action will directly lead to only _one_ outcome, you may be suffering from short-term thinking. **It’s impossible to predict _all_ the consequences, but the best long-term thinkers consider as many outcomes as possible.

A spin-off of nonconsequential thinking is believing that if your intentions are good, the outcome will be good. This is not always the case.

##### Sign #2: Battles That Won’t Win the War

If you’re involved in many struggles, and none of them are going anywhere, but **you don’t want to give up because you’ve spent so many resources already, this reluctance to retreat may signal shortsightedness.**

##### Sign #3: Nervous Impatience

Today, we can get information almost instantly—news is reported the moment it breaks and we can see what’s trending on any social media platform in real time. This makes us impatient and shortens our attention spans.

**If you find yourself assuming that whatever’s currently happening will continue to happen indefinitely, or reacting to moment-by-moment trends, you may be falling victim to shortsightedness.** In reality, snapshots aren’t usually representative of the larger context—for example, a stock price at 10 a.m. gives no indication of what the price will be in a week or even an hour.

##### Sign #4: Too Much Information

**The fourth sign of this law beginning to take hold of you is if you can no longer prioritize** —you feel overwhelmed by the amount of information surrounding you. Knowing all the details can give you a false sense of control because you know a lot, but you don’t know what to do with it or what’s important. This will overtax your brain and potentially lead to confusion and headaches.

  * For example, King Philip II of Spain wanted to know every detail about the government, from toilet placement to clergy payment to national security. Since he never paid attention to the right information, he caused disastrous military events—in 1588, when he sent the Spanish Armada to England, he’d studied the English navy and the country’s defenses, but he didn’t check the weather reports, so storms destroyed his ships. 



#### Adopt a Farsighted Perspective

When you see any of the signs of shortsightedness in yourself, you can break out of this law’s thrall by adopting a farsighted perspective, which involves simulating hindsight and giving yourself perspective unclouded by emotions.

There are three elements to a farsighted perspective:

  * **Detachment.** When you encounter a problem or decision, try to look at it without emotion.
  * **Completeness.** When you encounter a problem, there will be some obvious, attention-grabbing elements. Look at _all_ the context, not just what’s most obvious. 
  * **Prediction.** For every possible decision, consider the negative consequences, new problems that might arise, and long-term goals.



This is easier said than done—**most of us don’t like to think too much about the future because sometime in the future, we’ll die.** We usually don’t think more than a few years ahead, and usually only vaguely.

**The past also makes us think of the passage of time, so we avoid thinking of that too.** This disconnects us from our past selves—the person we were back then doesn’t seem much like the current version of ourselves.

Thinking only about the present, however, is full of so many ups and downs that it causes anxiety. Accepting the passage of time will make it easier to manage your emotions.

  * For example, if you can think about how you’ll see a current problem in a year, this will calm you down.



To change your views on the past and future:

  * **Cast time as an ally.** Youth is fun, but you gain perspective with age.
  * **Create concrete goals and a clear path to achieve them.** Anticipating your future accomplishments will be just as satisfying as enjoying the present.
  * **Remember that your character was set when you were a child.** You’re still connected to past versions of yourself and recalling this maintains your identity. Additionally, if you can keep this in mind, you’ll be able to learn from the past.



> **Extended Example: The South Sea Company**
> 
> In the 1700s, the South Sea Company created contagious shortsightedness in England that resulted in widespread financial ruin.
> 
> In 1719, the French Mississippi Company, which exploited resources in Louisiana, was doing very well and **everyone in France was becoming rich as they bought and sold shares. This made English businessman John Blunt jealous and angry, and he decided to start a similar venture with the South Sea Company** , which he led. The South Sea Company had a monopoly on trade between England and South America but did little trading. Its main job was to help the English government manage debt.
> 
> Blunt came up with an ambitious plan—the South Sea Company would take over the government’s large national debt, receive interest, and then sell the debt as South Sea Company shares.
> 
> However, there was one glaring problem with this plan—to make shareholders rich, the share price had to keep rising, but the company didn’t actually do any trade or have any assets. **Blunt should have realized this—he was normally a shrewd businessman—but the hype in France got to him and made him focus on the present rather than the long term.** Everyone else in England got caught up in the fever as well and invested their savings in shares, including very logical people like Sir Isaac Newton.
> 
> There were unexpected (from Blunt’s point of view) consequences. Blunt had inspired others to start new ventures and sell stocks, which increased competition for South Sea stocks. People cashed out their stocks to buy land, which was a safer investment. The Mississippi venture crashed and the French economy fell into a recession, foreshadowing a crash in England.
> 
> **Blunt could only think of short-term solutions and many of them caused new problems.** Soon the economy crashed, people committed suicide, and there was an attempt on Blunt’s life.
