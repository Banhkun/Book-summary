## Part 2 | Chapter 11: Take Control of Your Mind’s Operating System

In Part 1, we discussed the power you possess to radically transform your life for the better, and you gained the tools to control your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. **You now have the building blocks for transformative change, and in Part 2, you’ll get the blueprint for change through learning about your Master System.**

Your Master System comprises five elements, some of which we’ve already discussed and some of which we’ll talk about in the next few chapters:

  1. Mental-emotional-physiological state (Chapter 5)
  2. Habitual questions (Chapter 6)
  3. Values (Chapter 12) 
  4. Rules, which are a type of belief (Chapters 4 and 13) 
  5. References (Chapter 14)



**Your Master System controls your “evaluations” or interpretations of everything you experience in life,** which in turn determine what you think, feel, and do. Think of your mind as a computer, and your Master System as the operating system, which dictates everything about how you take in, interpret, and react to data.

**You can often make broad changes in all aspects of your life by making simple changes to your Master System.** In the following chapters, you’ll learn the information and skills you need to take control of this powerful system.

### Understand That Your Evaluations Shape Your Life

To understand the importance of your Master System, you need to know that its evaluations determine decisions that affect your health, relationships, career, and overall quality of life. There are some critical things to know about evaluations:

**1) Two people can evaluate the same situation differently, based on the context and the unique makeups of their Master Systems.** For example, imagine you’re playing basketball and you miss a shot. You evaluate it as an embarrassing miss, while your teammate evaluates it as an opportunity to rebound and score, and your opponent evaluates it as a chance to reclaim possession of the ball and win the game. Similarly, when your teammate misses a shot, the beliefs, state, questions, values, and references that comprise her Master System may cause her not to consider the miss to be embarrassing—as you did—but rather as motivation to make the next shot.

**2) People tend to generalize their evaluations** , which can quickly snowball. For example, after you miss the shot in the basketball game, you might start to think that you always shoot bad balls, which puts you in a disempowering state that could lead you to miss your next shot, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. From there, you may start thinking that you’re a terrible basketball player in general, which leads to thinking that you’re bad at all sports, which leads to thinking that you’re not very skilled at anything in your life.

**3) Successful people do a better job of evaluating things.** Put another way, people who have Master Systems that produce empowering or unique evaluations are more successful than people whose Master Systems create disempowering evaluations. For example, Wayne Gretzky is the National Hockey League’s all-time high-scorer because he evaluated the game differently than other players—while his teammates and opponents skated toward the puck, Gretzky skated toward where the puck was headed. Gretzky’s evaluations weren’t necessarily more _empowered_ than other players’, but they were more _clever_.

### Master the Five Elements of Your Master System

Although we briefly discussed the five elements of your Master System, let’s look at them each in a little more detail and discuss how they impact the system’s evaluations:

**1) Your mental and emotional state impacts your evaluations because it has a large influence on your decisions and behavior as a whole.** This means that you could make entirely different evaluations of the same situation depending on your state. For example, if you come home to find that your roommate forgot to take out the garbage, you’re likely to evaluate the situation negatively and react more explosively if you had a stressful day at work, and were thus in a negative state, than if you had a peaceful and productive day, and were thus in a positive state. Thus, if you want to make empowering evaluations, it’s critical to be in a resourceful and empowered state when you make them. (Review more about how to alter your state in Chapter 5.)

**2) The questions you ask yourself set the tone for your evaluations.** Questions such as “What is going on?” and “Will this lead to pain or pleasure?” determine how you evaluate a situation. If you habitually ask disempowering questions—such as “What if something bad happens?”—then your evaluations will lead to disempowering decisions and actions. (Review more about the power of questions in Chapter 6.)

**3) Your values dictate every evaluation and decision you make.** Your values are based on your pleasure and pain associations, which are determined by your life experiences. For example, you may value wealth because money was always tight for your family when you were growing up and you associate _lack of money_ with pain. On the other hand, another person may associate _wealth_ with pain because she grew up with plenty of money but her parents were more focused on their careers and material possessions than parenting. (We’ll talk more about values in Chapter 12.)

**4) Your beliefs determine not only _how_ you evaluate a situation but also _whether_ you evaluate it to begin with. **Let’s look at two types of beliefs: global beliefs and rules. First, as we’ve previously discussed, your global beliefs dictate what you believe to be true and what you expect from life, other people, and yourself. These are the beliefs that determine whether you evaluate something at all. For example, if someone asks you to name your biggest regret, you may have no answer—meaning you can’t evaluate this topic—because you believe that every failure is an opportunity to grow, rather than something to regret.

Second, your rules are your personal set of standards that dictate what must happen to fulfill your values. Rules aren’t necessarily objectively factual, but they still guide your perceptions, evaluations, decisions, and actions. For example, you may have a rule that your value of love is only fulfilled if the relationship is effortless, meaning that if you face challenges with your partner, it indicates a lack of love. That rule will doubtlessly dictate how you evaluate and behave in your relationships. (We’ll talk more about beliefs and rules in Chapter 13.)

**5) Your reference experiences impact how you interpret an experience and how you react to it.** As we discussed in Chapter 4, your references can be the life experiences that created your beliefs. They can also guide your decisions by serving as reference points to draw meaning from new experiences. For example, if you have many reference experiences of people taking advantage of you, you’ll develop a belief that people can’t be trusted, and you’ll react skeptically when someone offers to help you. Your references will cause you to evaluate the help offer as a ploy with an ulterior motive.

Going forward, be conscious of how you take in and interpret new reference experiences. Although you can’t control your past experiences, you can control how you use them to create either empowering or disempowering beliefs. (We’ll talk more about references in Chapter 14.)

#### Alter Your Master System to Change Your Behavior

Through the following chapters, you’ll learn how to alter elements of your Master System to change your life. Until now, any efforts you’ve made to improve your life have likely targeted the _effects_ instead of the _root_ of the issue. For example, you may have tried to combat your habit of being sedentary by implementing a daily exercise routine, but that approach addressed only your _behavior_ , which is the symptom of the problem. The real change you need to make may be to your underlying _beliefs_ about whether you’re an active person, how pleasurable or painful exercise is, and what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. Now, **by customizing your Master System, you’ll be targeting the _cause_ of your challenges—and when you eliminate the cause, you automatically eliminate the negative effects. **

With the information and skills you’ll learn, you can improve your life by changing your Master System so that it asks only empowering questions, rejects disempowering beliefs, and no longer computes certain evaluations.
