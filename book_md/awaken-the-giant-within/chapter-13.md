## Chapter 13: Set Rules That Help You Reach Your Values

In the last chapter, you identified, evaluated, and tailored your values to lead you to your compelling future. You learned that the greatest fulfillment in life is to not only know your values, but also to live by them—but, as we’ll explain in this chapter, **you’ll only feel that you’re living out your _values_ if your _rules_ set you up for success.**

As a reminder, your rules are the beliefs you have about what needs to happen in order for you to feel that you’ve fulfilled your value. For example, you may have a rule that you need a certain amount of money in the bank in order to feel that you’ve fulfilled your value of security.****

You can live a more fulfilling life by simply changing your rules to make them more achievable. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

  * How rules can empower or disempower you
  * How you prioritize your rules in a hierarchy 
  * How rules (and sub-rules) impact relationships
  * How you can identify, evaluate, and alter your own rules for a more fulfilling life



### Make Rules That Bring Pleasure and Empowerment, Not Pain and Disempowerment

Your rules determine the conditions for you to feel pain or pleasure: **If you have rules that are achievable, then you’ll often feel the pleasure of living out your values. But if you have rules that are unreasonable or inadequate, then you’ll frequently feel the pain of falling short.** For example, if you value success, your rule might be that you need to make a certain salary to feel successful. If this is your rule, you’ll feel constant pain and disappointment until you earn that salary and finally feel that you’ve fulfilled your value. Alternatively, your rule could be that you need to do your best every day at work to be successful. In this case, it will be much easier to feel the pleasure of fulfilling your values immediately and consistently.

Unfortunately, most people have disempowering rules, which cause unnecessary pain because they:

  * Have criteria that are impossible to meet
  * Depend on external factors over which a person has no control
  * Have few routes to happiness and many routes to pain—for example, if a person’s rule is that they must meet five stringent conditions in order to feel loved, then they’re creating countless ways to fail and feel pain and few ways to succeed and feel pleasure.



Many people adopt disempowering rules because society conditions them to believe that strict rules are necessary to motivate them to succeed. In reality, if your rules are so tough that you frequently fall short and feel frustrated and disappointed, then you’ll begin to believe that you can never reach your aim. Over time, you’ll associate the pain of failure with any effort to fulfill your values, and you’ll eventually develop learned helplessness. Furthermore, your self-esteem is dependent upon you feeling in control, and if your rules are impossible to satisfy, then you’ll feel that you have no control over achieving your values. Your self-esteem will suffer.

Fortunately, **you can rework your rules to make them empowering and achievable, which will make you feel in control almost effortlessly, and your self-esteem will soar.** We’ll talk about how to customize your rules later in this chapter.

### Recognize Your Rule Hierarchy

Just as you have a hierarchy of values, you also have a hierarchy of rules. There are two kinds of rules in the hierarchy:

  1. Threshold rules are rules that are so important to you that you wouldn’t even consider breaking them because it would cause you so much pain. These rules govern things you feel you _must_ and _must never_ do.
  2. Personal standards are the rules that you occasionally break, though you feel bad about it when you do. These rules govern things you feel you _should_ and _should never_ do. 



**Understanding your rules hierarchy is key to ensuring that you have an empowering set of rules.** The balance of your threshold rules and your personal standards impacts your life and well-being. On one hand, if you have too many threshold rules, they are likely to cause you stress because they create a lot of rigidity in your life. **Too many musts can weigh down on you and crush your motivation, happiness, and sense of control**(which directly impacts your self-esteem). On the other hand, you need enough musts to push you to follow through on actions. **Having too many shoulds and not enough musts gives you more leeway to potentially fall short of reaching your values.**

### Be Aware of Rules in Relationships

So far we’ve talked about how your rules impact _your life_ , but they also impact _people you have relationships with_ —and, by the same token, their rules affect you. Everyone has their own rules, and no one’s rules are more or less correct than someone else’s; they’re all arbitrary. Still, we expect others to live by our rules, even if we never articulated or they never explicitly agreed to those rules. In fact, **every time we get upset with someone, the root of our agitation is that we feel that person broke one of our rules.**

For example, imagine that you have a rule that people who care about each other show their interest by asking the other person questions about herself. Now imagine that your friend has a conflicting rule that people who care about each other don’t prod for personal information, but rather share information about themselves unsolicited so that the other person feels free to do the same. If neither of you articulate your rule but expect the other person to abide by it, you’ll both end up extremely upset and questioning the quality of your relationship; you’ll be waiting for your friend to ask you questions and your friend will be waiting for you to open up.

In order to avoid such conflicts, it’s critical to your relationships—both personal and professional—that you:

  1. **Become aware of your rules** , especially those that directly impact your relationships (such as rules that govern how people show love and respect).
  2. **Clearly communicate your rules** to the other person.
  3. **Be willing to listen** to and follow some of the other person’s rules, as well.



**You’ll have stronger relationships when you understand people’s rules** , because you’ll be able to predict and interpret their behavior and to make them happy by fulfilling their rules. Still, you probably won’t be able to prevent all conflict, so follow these steps next time you get upset with someone:

  1. Stop and remember that you’re upset because of _your rules_ , not because of _the other person’s behavior_. Ask yourself whether you value your relationship or your rules more.
  2. Remind yourself that, although your rules are important to you, they are arbitrary. Everyone’s rules are different. 
  3. Let the other person know that you’re upset.
  4. Explain the rule they broke, and ask what their rule is for the situation. Try to distinguish between threshold rules and personal standards, so that you both especially avoid breaking each other’s musts. 
  5. Find a way to satisfy both your rules. 



#### Understand the Role of Sub-Rules

Even when you know someone else’s rules, you can still run into challenges when you, or other people, have _sub-rules_ and _exceptions_ to your rules. For example, you may have a rule that if someone is listening attentively, then they should respond to what you’re saying— _unless_ you’re talking about something serious or sensitive, then they should listen silently.

**Be aware of your sub-rules so that you can communicate them to others, and make an effort to learn about their sub-rules so that you can avoid violating them.** Uncommunicated sub-rules can create issues in a relationship when both people think they’re clear on the rules and then one of them violates the fine print without realizing.

### Apply It: Revamp Your Rules

**Now that you know the power of rules, it’s time to evaluate your own to ensure that they’re not holding you back from living the life you want.** Take some time to evaluate and update your own rules. First, answer the following questions:

  1. What needs to happen for you to feel loved? 
  2. What needs to happen for you to feel confident?
  3. What needs to happen for you to feel successful? 
  4. What needs to happen for you to feel that you’re excelling in something? 



This will help you to clearly identify your rules.

Second, review each rule and ask yourself:

  1. Is this reasonable? 
  2. Is this dependent only on my actions and things I can control?
  3. Does this make it easy to feel good? 
  4. Does this make it hard to feel bad?



If you answered “no” to any of these questions, link pain with your disempowering rule and redesign the rule to be more empowering. Check to make sure that your new rule is empowering by asking each of these four questions again—you should be able to answer all of them with an emphatic “yes!” As you redesign your rules, consider these tips:

  * **Come up with multiple possible ways to satisfy each rule** , so that you have lots of ways to achieve it and few ways to fail.**** For example, your rule for “health” could be that you feel healthy anytime you choose a healthy food, get a good night’s sleep, or do something to take care of your mental or physical well-being. 
  * Be creative and have fun. These are your rules—they can be anything, as long as they empower you.
