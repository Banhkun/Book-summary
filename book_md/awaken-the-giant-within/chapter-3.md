## Chapter 3: Recondition Your Neuro-Associations

Now that you know how easily you can _develop_ disempowering neuro-associations and the negative impact they can have on your life, let’s talk about how to _change_ them. **Since your neuro-associations are wired into your brain, the only way to change them is to recondition yourself by creating new neural pathways and weakening the old ones.** To do this, associate pain with your old, disempowering behavior and pleasure with a new, healthier habit.

In this chapter, we’ll explain how to do this using the Science of Neuro-Associative Conditioning™ (NAC). This is a six-step process through which you condition your nervous system to develop neuro-associations that support the changes you want to make:

  1. Decide on your destination, and identify your obstacles.
  2. Create a sense of urgency to change.
  3. Disrupt your pattern. 
  4. Create a positive pattern to replace the old, negative one.
  5. Reinforce your new pattern.
  6. Make sure your conditioning is successful. 



But first, let’s briefly dispel some common misconceptions about change.

### Alter Your Beliefs About Change

The NAC process we’ll discuss can trigger significant changes in your life instantly. **However,** **people often mistakenly think that significant change takes a long time.** There are a couple of reasons why so many people perpetuate this falsehood:

1) People often spend years trying—and failing—to make changes through willpower. However, as we talked about, willpower doesn’t alter the neuro-associations at the root of your behavior. As long as those neuro-associations are intact, the behavior they cause will ultimately persist.

2) Our culture perpetuates the idea that profound change must take a long time. The flip side of this is the belief that if you _can_ change quickly, you must not have really had a problem in the first place. For example, smoking is a notoriously tough addiction to break—so if you go from being a regular smoker one day to quitting the next day, the people around you are likely to be skeptical either that the change will stick or that you had much of a smoking habit to begin with.

However, as we’ll see, change doesn’t have to take a long time, and you don’t gain anything by prolonging your change—in fact, the opposite may be true, because procrastination delays achieving the goal of change you’ve set for yourself.

In reality, it takes just one action to initiate a change, and transformation can happen in an instant—you just have to commit to the change and do it. However, **you must put in sustained effort to make that instant change last.** In fact, you must _condition yourself_ to make lasting changes to your thoughts and behaviors by making a change, reinforcing it, and then training your nervous system to maintain it. The conditioning process requires that you adopt certain beliefs:

  1. **Something absolutely has to change.** You need this level of certainty to support a true commitment to change. Stop saying that it “should” or “could” change. 
  2. **You are the sole person responsible for your change.** Don’t look for anyone else to do the work for you or to blame if the change doesn’t stick. 
  3. **You have the power to make this change.** Use the tools you gain from this book to create the life you want. 



Once you have the beliefs to support your change, follow the six steps of NAC to condition your change.

### Step 1: Decide on Your Destination, and Identify Your Obstacles

**The first step to creating a positive change is to decide exactly what you want, which gives you a destination and a direction.** The more specific you are about what you want to do, the clearer you’ll be on your destination, and the better your chances are of reaching it.

Be sure to frame your destination in a positive light: in other words, in terms of what you _do_ want. When it’s time to make a change, people often focus on what they _don’t_ want instead. However, that way of thinking leads to getting even more of what you don’t want.

Additionally, **figure out what’s standing between you and your goal.** The reason you haven’t made this change already is that you’re associating more pain with making the change—or with the unknown that comes with change—than with maintaining the status quo. Identify what pain you’re associating with the change, and then use the NAC process to eliminate that pain association so that you can reach your goal.

### Step 2: Create a Sense of Urgency to Change

**Once you know what change you want to make, create a sense of urgency about making it.** Often, people don’t make the changes they want to because they continually delay them. They know that the change would improve their lives, but they don’t muster up the motivation to actually do it.

This lack of motivation often occurs because people have mixed emotions about change: They associate both pain and pleasure with it. Sometimes those mixed emotions come from a **secondary gain** , which is an often-subconscious association of pleasure with the bad behavior you want to change. For example, a smoker who wants to quit may associate pleasure with the thought of better health and the savings from not buying cigarettes, but she may also associate pleasure with the social aspects of smoking. These mixed associations prevent you from committing your full focus and energy to making the change.

If you’re struggling to get enough motivation to make a change _now_ , due to a secondary gain or something else, you need**psychological** **leverage**. Psychological leverage is a tool that makes the heavy burden of change more achievable, just as physical levers are used to lift heavy items. You gain this leverage when you reach the _pain threshold_ , where the pain associated with continuing your behavior finally outweighs the pain of change. This is the moment when you feel you just can’t take it anymore, and that feeling gives you the motivation to finally take action.

You can have external leverage, when someone or something pushes you to make a change—for example, when your spouse nags you to stop smoking or your doctor implores you to lose weight. However, you’re more likely to push back and rebel if someone else is pressuring you to change.

By contrast, the most effective leverage is _internal leverage,_ when you’re motivated to make the change for yourself. One way to gain internal leverage is by realizing that the behavior you want to change contradicts your personal standards, values, and principles. **Realizing that you’ve failed to act in a way that honors your standards and your identity causes a lot of pain, which in turn creates a strong motivation to change.** Gain insight into whether your behavior is undermining your principles by asking self-reflective questions, such as “How does this specific behavior support these specific values?” and “What kinds of actions support this specific value?”

#### Apply It: Create Leverage

If you have a behavior or emotional pattern you want to change, first, go through Step 1 and identify what you want and why you haven’t achieved it yet. Then, create motivating leverage by asking yourself:

  * What are the immediate physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual costs of not changing?
  * What are the future consequences of not changing? 
  * What will my life be lacking if I don’t change? 
  * How will my loved ones be negatively affected if I don’t change? 



Next,**ask yourself questions that reinforce the pleasure you’ll gain from making the change** , such as:

  * How will I feel about myself if I change? 
  * If I change, what kind of momentum could that create in my life? 
  * If I make this change, what other goals would that enable me to reach? 
  * How much will this change increase my happiness? 
  * How will my loved ones feel if I change?



### Step 3: Disrupt Your Pattern

Once you know what you want to change and have gained the motivation to do it, **refine your approach to creating change.** If you’ve continually seen the same results in your life, despite your desires and efforts to change things, it’s probably because you’ve developed patterns of thinking that cause you to consistently focus on the same things—things that aren’t helping you to change. **Given the power of your thoughts on your decision-making and actions, your unwanted behavior will continue until you change your pattern of thinking.** Even if you gain leverage to make changes, your efforts won’t be effective until you’ve addressed this root issue.

To truly create change in your life, interrupt your old patterns of thinking by doing something unexpected and totally different than previously. For example, to interrupt a pattern of lashing out at coworkers when you’re stressed, the next time you feel that way, stand up and yell something silly and ridiculous. The sudden outburst and change in mood will snap you out of your usual pattern of yelling at other people. Create the disruption in the middle of the pattern—before the pattern reaches its usually destructive conclusion—and consistently disrupt the pattern every time you start slipping into it. **Over time, these disruptions will distort and weaken the neural pathways responsible for your old pattern of behavior.**

#### Scramble the Sensation

Patterns of thoughts and behavior arise not only _during_ experiences, but also when you’re _remembering_ certain events. Sometimes you may replay negative thought patterns and obsess over past experiences, which intensifies your negative emotions about the situation you’re recalling.

Although you can’t change what you’ve already experienced, **you can change how you feel about what happened by scrambling the memory to disrupt the pattern.** Since a memory is a bundle of sensations you recall from an experience—the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings recorded in your brain—scrambling certain sensations distorts the memory, causing you to feel differently about it.

To practice this, think of an incident that frustrates, saddens, or angers you. Then, follow the first few steps of NAC by asking yourself:

  1. How do you want to feel about the incident, and why?
  2. If you don’t make a change, how will you keep feeling about the situation?
  3. If you made a change right now, how would you feel? 



Next, scramble the sensations you associate with the memory:

  1. Envision the scene of the incident in your mind. See it as if you’re watching a movie—like a third-party observer, without emotional attachment. 
  2. Alter the scene. Replay it in your mind as a cartoon. Then, imagine it playing backward. Replay it forward and backward, in slow- and fast-motion, with different colors and other silly effects. Replay the scene in different exaggerated, humorous ways at least 12 times. 
  3. Think about the incident again. How do you feel now? Your negative feelings shouldn’t be returning as strongly, if at all: You should have broken the original emotional pattern you attached to the memory. **Your emotional response was tied to the images, sounds, and other sensations that you’d associated with the memory;** by altering those features and sensations, you broke the connection to your repetitive emotional response of becoming upset. 



As you practice this, your old, negative neural pattern will weaken, making it easier to replace with a new, empowering pattern. When you stop using your old pathway, it will weaken and its influence over you will diminish. This method can work for memories of negative incidents that happened yesterday or years ago.

### Step 4: Create a Positive Pattern to Replace the Old, Negative One

**Once you break your old, negative pattern, you need an empowering pattern to replace it with.** Your new pattern should still produce the pleasure you got from your old behavior, without any of the negative side effects. For example, if you want to quit smoking but enjoy the social aspect of the habit, develop a new habit of writing check-in letters or emails to friends instead. If you don’t have a positive alternative to your old behavior, the change won’t last and you’ll revert to your old pattern or to a new, negative one. (For example, sometimes when people quit smoking, they gain weight because they replace their habit of smoking with eating.)

Research proves that having a new habit to replace the old one increases the likelihood that the change will be long-lasting. One study evaluated how successful three groups of drug users were in kicking their habits:

  1. The first group quit using drugs based on external pressure by the legal system, and the change only lasted as long as the pressure was applied. In other words, they were forced to refrain from drug use while they were in jail, and they resumed the habit when they were released. 
  2. The second group had intrinsic motivation to quit drugs, and their changes lasted longer than the first group—the longest being about two years. However, when they experienced major stress, the pain of the stress pushed them to find pleasure in drugs, since they hadn’t implemented an alternative, empowering habit to replace drug use.
  3. The third group replaced their drug use with positive alternatives, including meaningful relationships and passionate careers. These alternatives satisfied the pleasures the participants had gotten from drugs, or they provided different and even greater pleasures than drugs. Most members of this group remained sober for more than eight years, and many never used drugs again. 



### Step 5: Reinforce Your New Pattern

**Once you’ve replaced your old pattern with a new one, condition the new behavior to reinforce it so that it endures long-term.** Reinforcement makes the difference between a change that eventually becomes automatic and one that ultimately fades. There are two kinds of reinforcement:

  1. Positive, such as praise, a smile, or a gift
  2. Negative, such as a frown or punishment



**Use positive reinforcement to cement your new pattern by creating a reward system.** Determine goals or milestones that you’ll reach quickly as a result of your new pattern, and reward yourself as soon as you hit one. For example, if your goal is to work out every day, reward yourself after your first workout. Reinforce the behavior early and often, and you’ll quickly strengthen the pleasure association with your new pattern.

The positive reinforcement must happen immediately after the behavior, so that you link the pleasure association to the pattern. Additionally, the consistency of the reinforcement impacts its effectiveness:

**1) Varied or intermittent reinforcement is the most effective way to encourage consistent effort.** If you never know when you’re going to be rewarded for your performance, you’re more likely to keep your effort high so that you’re _always_ deserving of a potential reward. For this reason, when you try to break a habit but allow yourself to indulge every once in a while, you’re actually reinforcing the habit you’re trying to break because you are intermittently enjoying the pleasure you get from that habit. (Shortform note: To read about how social media companies use intermittent rewards to keep people hooked on their sites, read our summary of Digital Minimalism.)

**2) A jackpot** —when an intermittent reward is occasionally much larger than usual—**is an even stronger method of intermittent reinforcement, because it builds the anticipation for the possibility of a big prize.** This can also be used to jump-start performance with someone who’s not motivated to do anything to earn a reward. Give her a jackpot for no reason, and the unexpected reward may be enough to spark her motivation to start acting in hopes of earning another reward.

**3) Scheduled reinforcement** (for example, being rewarded every fourth time you implement the positive behavior) **is less effective,** because you come to expect the reward and the pleasure loses its luster.

Reinforce your new response by playing it out in your head over and over to strengthen the neural pathways. When you imagine something with a lot of emotional intensity, your brain reacts the same way it would if you were actually experiencing what you imagine; in other words, _rehearsing_ the new pattern in your head repeatedly is the same to your brain as _doing_ the new behavior over and over.

#### Use Pattern Reinforcement at Work

Companies often employ different forms of reinforcement to motivate employees, with mixed results:

  1. **Negative reinforcement and punishment:** This causes people to live in fear of punishment until, finally, they push back by complaining or quitting. 
  2. **Financial incentives:** This is effective up to a point, but past that threshold, the returns plateau: People don’t work any harder or better. Additionally, people link money as the primary motivation to work, which leads them to expect a financial reward for every accomplishment. This becomes expensive and infeasible for the company. 
  3. **Personal development opportunities:** Offering employees opportunities to grow as individuals is the most effective approach because they become empowered, which makes them internally motivated to do good work. 



**Optimize workers’ performance using the principles of intermittent reinforcement, through unexpected rewards, bonuses, promotions, and other forms of recognition.** If employees know that they’re often rewarded for good work, but that those rewards are unpredictable, then they’ll consistently work hard in an effort to earn a reward.

### Step 6: Make Sure Your Conditioning Is Successful

Through the first five steps of Neuro-Associative Conditioning, you’ve successfully made a change and conditioned yourself to make the new behavior consistent. The final step of the process is to ensure that the change will last in the future.

To do this,**make sure that the changes you’ve made have strongly changed your associations and will also fit your lifestyle, principles, and beliefs** :

  1. When you think about your old pattern, make sure that you feel only pain associated with that behavior. 
  2. When you think about your new pattern, make sure that you feel only pleasure associated with it. 
  3. Make sure that the new pattern gives you all the pleasure and benefits that you got from the old pattern. 
  4. Use a technique called “future pacing,” in which you imagine a scenario that would trigger your old response and check whether your response has changed. This will be a good indication of whether your new association will stick when you encounter this situation in real life. For example, imagine that when someone would cut you off in traffic, it used to make you feel angry. As you envision someone cutting in front of you, notice whether it still makes you feel angry, or if your new, conditioned response has taken over. 
  5. Make sure that your new pattern is aligned with your beliefs, values, and rules. (In Part 2, we’ll talk more about beliefs, values, and rules and how they impact your Master System, which controls how you interpret and react to your experiences.)



**If your old response surfaces as you’re future pacing, go back through the first five steps of NAC** :

  1. Reflect on whether you’re totally clear on what you want and why. 
  2. Increase your leverage. To do this, you may need to enlist family and friends to keep you accountable. 
  3. Reconsider your approach and find a new way to disrupt your pattern of thinking. 
  4. Identify a new, positive alternative to replace your old response. Be sure that this replacement is as convenient and as pleasurable as your old pattern. 
  5. Use intermittent as well as scheduled reinforcement to cement your new pattern.
