## Chapter 8: Interpret and Learn From Your Emotions

As we’ve learned, you can use various techniques to control your emotions instead of allowing them to be dictated by external stimuli. However, sometimes, **in order to _shift_ your emotions, you first need to _learn from_ them. **Emotions provide feedback on your actions: Positive emotions let you know that you’re doing something right, and negative emotions signal that you need to alter something. For this reason, negative emotions—or “action signals”—are actually invaluable, because they guide you to the life you want, _if_ you know how to use them.

In this chapter, we’ll:

  * Examine three methods people typically use to deal with their emotions, and why those methods will prevent you from living the life you want
  * Discuss how to identify, decode, and address your emotions in a healthy way
  * List the 10 most common types of negative emotions and explain what each of them signals



### Reject Disempowering Ways of Addressing Your Emotions

Although using and learning from your emotions is the most effective way to maintain mental and emotional well-being, most people instead respond to their emotions in one of three _disempowering_ ways. Let’s discuss each of these methods, so you can understand and reject them:

**Method #1: Avoidance**

People who fear certain emotions often avoid situations that risk triggering those emotions, or have a general rule of trying to avoid _all_ emotions. For example, people who fear rejection often either avoid serious relationships or try to suppress their emotions when they are in relationships.

_Problem:_ When people avoid scary emotions, they miss out on the meaningful experiences that accompany them, such as love and intimacy.

**Method #2: Denial**

People sometimes refuse to accept that an emotion exists. They insist that they’re fine and _attempt_ to dissociate from the emotion. However, their thoughts and questions continue to focus on the emotion.

_Problem:_ If you try to suppress your emotions, they become increasingly intense until you finally acknowledge them. In other words, pretending there’s no problem makes the problem grow until it’s too big to ignore.

**Method #3: Internalization**

Sometimes people give up trying to avoid or deny their difficult feelings and instead make the emotions part of their identity. They use their negative feelings to one-up everyone else’s misfortunes, and they find a sense of pride in perpetually enduring such difficulties.

_Problem:_ When people identify with their negative emotions, they become trapped in them. If being unhappy is part of your identity, then it feels like you can’t become happy without losing your sense of self. This mentality leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy because you must remain unhappy in order to be who (you think) you are.

### Process Your Emotions in a Healthy Way

People try to avoid and deny their negative emotions because feeling those emotions is unpleasant. But **negative emotions arise to let you know that something you’re doing is causing you pain, and that you need to change some aspect of your approach.** Therefore, it’s important to listen to these emotions and process them in a healthy way.

As you evaluate and resolve your own negative emotions, you’ll often find their source in your perceptions, your communication, or your actions:

  1. **Your perceptions can create pain if you focus on disempowering things.** For example, you may feel hurt if you focus on the fact that your sister didn’t come to your birthday party instead of feeling loved because so many other friends and family members did show up. Use some of the techniques we’ve discussed to change your focus by adjusting your physical position or by asking yourself different questions. 
  2. **The way you communicate your wants and needs to the people around you can create pain if they misunderstand you.** Try explaining your needs and desires differently—perhaps more directly or more gently—so that others are more receptive.
  3. **Your actions can create pain if you’re doing things that disempower you.** Either stop or change the behavior. 



Let’s look at a step-by-step approach to handle painful emotions. The following six steps of emotional mastery explain how to **break your limiting emotional patterns, find the useful lessons behind your painful emotions, and carry those lessons into the future so you don’t have to learn them again.** Try to use these steps as soon as you feel an unpleasant emotion coming on, before the emotion gains strength and momentum. The more you use this process, the more adept you’ll become at managing and learning from all of your emotions.

#### Step 1: Identify the Emotion

**The first step in dealing with your emotions is to identify what you’re feeling.** When you have painful emotions—such as loneliness, anger, or resentment—you may feel so overwhelmed by them that you can’t distinguish what, precisely, the emotion you’re feeling _is_. However, it’s important to put a name to the emotion because identifying your pain immediately lessens its sting.

Additionally, in the process of identifying your emotion, you may realize that your pain is rooted in something that wasn’t immediately apparent to you. For example, imagine that your best friend moved out of state last month and has been too busy to catch up over the phone. You may initially feel _rejected_ by your friend and _hurt_ that she hasn’t made time for you. However, if you stop and reflect on that feeling, you might realize that you’re actually feeling _sad_ about her leaving and a sense of _separation_ due to the move. This insight can help you have a more empowered response in which you:

  * Stop blaming your friend for not making time for you
  * Are more understanding that she’s probably busy getting acclimated to a new place
  * Take a proactive approach to maintaining your friendship by coming up with ways to stay connected despite the distance



#### Step 2: Embrace Your Emotion

Once you’ve identified your emotion, recognize that it is serving a helpful purpose: It’s meant to guide you toward happiness. **Resist the urge to label an emotion as “bad” or “wrong,” and instead embrace all emotions as helpful feedback.** When you acknowledge and appreciate your painful emotion, it often becomes less intense.

#### Step 3: Decode Your Emotion

With the knowledge that your emotion is a signal, reflect on what that signal could be telling you. **This response changes your focus from _feeling_ that emotion to _investigating_ it**, which:

  * Shifts your focus, thereby changing your emotional state
  * Helps you resolve the issue
  * Helps you learn from the emotion so that you avoid feeling this way again in the future



When you feel a negative emotion, consider what you might learn from it. Do you need to alter the beliefs that are causing you to feel this way? Do you need to take a different action in the situation that’s making you feel this way? How can you prevent this feeling from returning in the future? Investigate your emotions by asking yourself these questions:

  1. What do I want to feel, instead of the pain I’m feeling now? 
  2. What belief would cause me to feel the way I feel now? 
  3. What am I willing to do to resolve whatever’s causing this pain right now? 
  4. What can I learn from this experience? 



Later in this chapter, we’ll explain the meanings of various “action signals,” which you can use to help decode your negative emotions.

#### Step 4: Remember That Your Emotion Is Temporary

Remind yourself that you will get to the other side of this painful emotion. Think of another time you’ve felt this way, and use that memory as a reminder that you eventually got over the feeling. Furthermore, **reflect on the strategies you used to handle this emotion in the past** , such as talking to a friend, changing your focus, or journaling. Consider using those same strategies to deal with the emotion now.

#### Step 5: Use This Experience as an Empowering Reference for the Future

As you work through this difficult emotion, **use this success as a reference for your ability to handle it so that next time, you know _what to do_ and you know that _you can do it_.** Take some steps to reinforce what you’re learning through this experience:

  1. **Reflect on what you’ve learned** about what this emotion is signaling you to do and what strategies you’re using to resolve the issue. 
  2. **Imagine yourself going through the whole process again in the future** —feeling this emotion, using the strategies, and resolving it. 
  3. **Write down three or four additional strategies you could use** to alter your perception, communicate your needs differently, or change your actions. 



#### Step 6: Reinforce What You’ve Learned

Now that you’ve worked through this emotion today and also made a plan for getting through it in the future, pat yourself on the back. Next, take an action that proves that you’ve learned from and resolved your painful emotion. (Shortform example: If you were previously feeling rejected by your friend who moved away, but you’ve worked through your feeling of rejection and you now recognize that your friendship will simply have to function differently now, you could buy your friend a housewarming gift, such as a framed photo of the two of you.)

### Understand Your Negative Emotions

You can shortcut the six-step process above if you already know what your emotion is signaling. This section is a cheat sheet: **Nearly every painful feeling is a form of one of the following emotions**(or a combination of them)**, and understanding what the emotion is signaling allows you to heed its message and quickly resolve the pain** without needing to go through all six steps**.**

Read through this list multiple times, highlight the emotions that resonate most with you, and jot down their messages and solutions on an index card to carry with you. Learning these 10 action signals and consistently using the guidelines to address them will enable you to master your emotions.

#### Action Signal #1: Discomfort

Discomfort comes in the form of impatience, boredom, mild embarrassment, unease, or distress. These emotions let you know that **something is not quite right** ; your perception of a situation may be skewed, or your actions may not be creating the results you want.

**Solution** : Although discomfort is only mildly painful, it will intensify if you don’t deal with the issue. Deal with your discomfort before it grows by:

  1. Changing your state (do this by changing your focus or your physiology, as discussed in Chapters 5, 6, and 7)
  2. Identifying what you want, if the problem is that your actions aren’t producing your desired results. When you are clear about what you want, then you can take the next step, which is: 
  3. Changing the way you approach the situation—a different approach will produce different results. 



#### Action Signal #2: Fear

Fear encompasses apprehension, concern, anxiety, worry, fright, and terror. The purpose of fear is to urge you to **prepare to _deal with_ a situation or prepare to _change_ a situation.** Don’t allow yourself to amplify fear by imaging the worst-case-scenarios, or to pretend the fear doesn’t exist.

**Solution** : Reflect on what’s causing your fear and what kind of preparation you can do to mitigate that fear. For example, if you’re dealing with stage fright because you’re about to make a big presentation at work, ensure that you’re thoroughly prepared for every aspect of the presentation to ease your fears. If you’ve done all the preparation you can and you’re _still_ fearful, use the strategies we’ve discussed to change your focus and remind yourself that you’re well-prepared and that fears are often overblown.

#### Action Signal #3: Hurt

When you feel hurt, it generally means that **you feel a sense of loss, and that loss typically comes from an unmet expectation**. For example, if you expected your friend not to tell anyone something you shared—even if you never explicitly expressed this expectation—and they shared it with someone else, you probably feel a loss of intimacy or trust.

**Solution** : Reevaluate the situation and the reason you’re feeling hurt:

  1. Acknowledge that your loss may be _perceived_ , not _real_. For instance, if your friend didn’t know it was a secret and had no intention of violating your trust, then you haven’t actually lost trust and you should reasonably be able to trust your friend in the future. 
  2. Consider whether you may be judging this as a loss prematurely, or that your judgment may be too harsh. For example, if your friend reveals that she’s moving far away, you may feel hurt because you anticipate the loss of your friendship. However, you’re mourning the relationship prematurely because you don’t know yet _if_ the distance will diminish your relationship.
  3. Tell the other person how you feel. For example, simply tell the friend who told your secret that when the situation happened, you misinterpreted her actions to mean that she didn’t care about you, and ask her to explain what really happened. Hearing her perspective may change your perception of the situation and eliminate the feeling of loss and hurt. 



#### Action Signal #4: Anger

You can feel anger through irritation, resentment, fury, or rage. Feelings of anger let you know that **you or someone else has violated a rule or standard that is important to you.** (We’ll talk more about rules in Chapter 13 but, briefly, they are the conditions you decide must happen in order for you to feel that something has been satisfied or fulfilled. For example, you may have a rule that in order for a relationship to be healthy and intimate, both people must divulge their deepest secrets to each other.)

**Solution** : Reevaluate the situation that’s angering you, similarly to the way you do when you’re hurt:

  1. Recognize that you could be misinterpreting the situation. The person who violated your rule probably didn’t know that it was important to you; they may not even realize they did anything wrong. 
  2. Acknowledge that the standards you hold for yourself are not the same ones that everyone holds for themselves, and that may be true of the person who angered you. Alternatively, the person may hold the same standard, but it might carry less weight for her than it does for you. 
  3. Remind yourself that, despite this misstep, this person does care about you. Consider what you can learn from this situation, and brainstorm how to let this person know that this is an important rule for you so that they don’t violate it again in the future. 



#### Action Signal #5: Frustration

Frustration is actually a positive signal because it means that **you’re within reach of something you want, but the methods you’re using to get there aren’t working.** This is a sign that you need to change your approach to get what you want.

**Solution** : Think of frustration as a tough-but-fair coach who’s pushing you to achieve greater things. Try these strategies to use your frustration for progress:

  1. Recognize that frustration is a sign that you’re close to something positive. Brainstorm ways to alter your approach to achieve the results you want. 
  2. Emulate someone who has reached the goal you’re working toward. Ask that person how she achieved it, and compare her approach with your own. 
  3. Reflect on what you can learn from this frustration so that you can get past it this time and, in the future, you can work through it more quickly—or avoid it entirely. 



#### Action Signal #6: Disappointment

Disappointment can feel like sadness, defeat, being let down, or feeling like you’ve missed out on something. Disappointment is similar to frustration because it’s a sign that you’re falling short of your goal—however, **whereas frustration signals that your goal is _achievable_ if you change your approach, disappointment signals that your goal is _impossible_ to achieve**.

**Solution** : In order to cope with disappointment, reassess your goal and your approach. There are various ways to do this:

  1. Think about what you can learn from this situation. After gaining more knowledge and skill, you may be able to achieve this goal in the future. 
  2. Set a new goal that’s not only more achievable, but also inspiring enough to motivate and energize you, which will ease your disappointment. The new goal should be something you can immediately start making progress toward reaching. 
  3. Consider whether your _goal_ is impossible, or if your _timeline_ is impossible. You may simply need to allow more time to reach this goal. Extend your timeline for reaching this goal, bolster your patience, and brainstorm a new approach to achieve what you want. 
  4. Keep your expectations about the future optimistic, and don’t allow this disappointment to dictate your attitude about approaching goals and challenges in the future. 



#### Action Signal #7: Guilt

Guilt, remorse, and regret are all in the same family of emotions. **Guilt arises when you break one of the highest standards you set for yourself** , and it’s meant to deter you from ever violating that standard again. Most people want to avoid guilt more than almost any other emotion, which means that it’s a powerful motivator (pain avoidance). There are three ways people react to guilt:

  1. They try to ignore and suppress it, which only causes the guilt to intensify. 
  2. They submit to it, continue to feel inferior, and potentially develop learned helplessness. Some people perpetually feel guilt because they constantly set standards that they fail to meet. 
  3. They use it to create strong leverage to change the behavior that caused them to violate their standard. 



**Solution** : In order to make constructive use of your guilt, follow these steps:

  1. Acknowledge that you’ve broken a standard that’s important to you.
  2. Vow to yourself that you won’t violate this standard again in the future. Envision yourself repeating the scenario you feel guilty about, but imagine how you _could have_ acted in a way that would not have broken your standard. 
  3. Let go of your guilt. Once you’ve committed to changing your behavior, the guilt has served its purpose and you can release it. 



#### Action Signal #8: Inadequacy

Inadequacy is the feeling of being unworthy because you can’t do something that you believe you should be able to do. This emotion signals that **you may not have the right tools, resources, strategies, knowledge, or confidence to perform this task.**

**Solution** : Inadequacy often results from setting unrealistic expectations for yourself. First, evaluate whether it’s reasonable to think that you can meet the expectations you set in the first place. Second, determine whether it’s fair for you to feel bad that you couldn’t achieve these expectations. If you still feel that your expectations are reasonable, then you have two options:

  1. Remember that your feeling of inadequacy is merely a signal that you need to keep looking for more knowledge, tools, and strategies. Release unrealistic expectations. Commit to constant and never-ending improvement (CANI!). 
  2. Find someone who’s done what you’re trying to achieve, and ask them for help. Embrace your role as a student, and try to get as much knowledge and advice as you can from this person. 



If you allow yourself to believe that you’re innately and permanently inadequate, you’ll succumb to a pattern of learned helplessness. By contrast, if you recognize that you’re simply lacking an acquirable skill, then you’ll be empowered to learn and achieve your goal.

#### Action Signal #9: Overload or Overwhelm

When you feel that you’re facing problems that are beyond your control and that provide no empowering lessons, you’re likely to feel overwhelmed, overloaded, depressed, aggrieved, or helpless. This means that you feel that you can’t deal with the _quantity_ , _intensity_ , or _pace_ of problems coming at you—and you’re right. This emotion signals that **you’re trying to deal with too much at once, and that it’s infeasible.**

**Solution** : Since the problem is that you’re trying to do too much, the solution is to narrow your focus:

  1. Reflect on all of the things in your life that you’re dealing with, and decide which are the most important. 
  2. Write down the most important things for you to achieve, in order of priority. Seeing them on paper should give you a sense of control over the situation. 
  3. Tackle the first task on your list. Once you’ve mastered that, move on to the next task. As you make progress, you’ll feel an increasing sense of control. 
  4. Continue focusing on what you can control, which will help you release your feeling of being overwhelmed. Recognize that you can always change your focus to avoid feeling overwhelmed.



#### Action Signal #10: Loneliness

Loneliness can cause you to feel alone or somehow separate from others. This emotion signals that **you need connection with other people.**

**Solution** : Lonely people often assume that the connection they need is romantic or sexual, but seeking merely sexual connection can cause frustration and more loneliness because it doesn’t satisfy your deeper emotional needs. A better strategy is to:

  1. Recognize that there are people all around who you could connect with. 
  2. Reflect on the type of connection you’re yearning for. You may be in need of a friend, a confidante, or an intimate partner. 
  3. Remember that loneliness is a good sign, because it means that you care about people and want to connect with them. 
  4. Take steps immediately to connect with someone.



### Nurture Your Emotions of Power

If you think of your mind as a garden, the 10 action signals we just discussed are weeds: They must be addressed before they get out of hand and encroach on your flowers (positive emotions). While you address and learn from your negative emotions, be sure to also nurture your positive ones. **The more you nurture your positive emotions, the better protection they provide against negative emotions.**

Here are 10 common positive emotions, or “emotions of power”:

  1. **Love and warmth** are among the strongest antidotes to negative emotions. If someone approaches you with anger or another painful emotion and you continually respond with love and warmth, you will eventually soften their negative emotion. 
  2. **Appreciation and gratitude** show your love for the gifts you’ve been given in life, and cultivating these emotions raises your quality of life. 
  3. **Curiosity** infuses your life with wonder and makes you want to do things that may have previously seemed unappealing, which can lead to empowering experiences. 
  4. **Excitement and passion** increase your energy and enthusiasm toward life. Passion inspires you to progress toward your goals more quickly because it turns _challenges_ into _opportunities_. 
  5. **Determination** is the difference between _succumbing_ to challenges and _overcoming_ them. You need determination in order to accomplish your goals and improve your life. Determination requires courage to carry on in spite of challenges, and courage banishes frustration and disappointment.
  6. **Flexibility** aids your determination because it allows you to adjust your approach when needed, which can make the difference between failure and success. If you’re too rigid and refuse to be flexible, then you’ll inevitably become stuck in the face of an obstacle. 
  7. **Confidence** gives you the strength to carry on in spite of uncertain challenges and outcomes. Cultivate confidence by having faith in your ability to do something and reach your goals. The more you _practice_ being confident, the more you will _feel_ confident. 
  8. **Cheerfulness** goes beyond feeling inwardly happy—cheerfulness spreads happiness to those around you, while also vanquishing painful feelings such as anger, depression, disappointment, fear, frustration, guilt, hurt, and inadequacy. Being cheerful doesn’t mean that you deny having challenges, but that you feel assured that you have the tools to overcome them, which raises your self-esteem. 
  9. **Physical vitality** is essential so that you can enjoy the other power emotions to the fullest. Remember from Chapter 5 that many emotions start in your physiology, meaning that there are physical adjustments you can make to improve your emotional health. For example, make sure that you’re getting enough sleep (six to seven hours is optimal) and breathing in a way that circulates enough oxygen throughout your body, both of which will energize you. 
  10. **Contribution** —or giving back to those around you and the world as a whole—is the key to living a rich and fulfilling life. Improving someone else’s life and making others feel better are two of the most powerful ways to improve your own life. However, contribution does not equate to martyrdom; be sure to continue taking care of yourself as you help others.



### Apply It: Practice Emotional Mastery

**Mastering your emotions takes time, practice, and persistence.** Start the process now with these two simple practices. Take note of how these practices positively affect you, and start conditioning them to become habits:

  1. For the next two days, use the six steps of emotional mastery every time you feel a negative emotion. 
  2. Adopt global beliefs that minimize how often you feel painful emotions, such as “this too shall pass” and “where there’s a will, there’s a way.”
