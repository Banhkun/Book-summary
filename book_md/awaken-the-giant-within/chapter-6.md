## Chapter 6: Use Questions to Direct Your Focus

In the last chapter, we talked about the importance of altering your state by shifting your focus to positive things, and we discussed how to do that by manipulating your physical position and submodalities. In this chapter, **we’ll explore more strategies to control your focus through the questions you ask yourself.** Specifically, we’ll discuss:

  * How your questions influence your thoughts and emotions
  * What _empowering_ and _disempowering_ questions are
  * Why you must be cautious in the way you word your questions
  * Which questions to ask yourself every day to make you feel more empowered and happy
  * Which questions to ask yourself to help you persevere and find solutions when you’re facing challenges



### Make a Habit of Asking Empowering Questions

The first strategy for using language to direct your focus is to be mindful of the types of questions you ask yourself. **The questions you ask yourself set the tone for your thought patterns, so it’s critical to make a habit of asking yourself positive, empowering questions that will lead to empowering thoughts.**

Thinking is merely a sequence of asking and answering questions—in other words, virtually every thought you have is preceded by a question, even if it’s not one you consciously asked. Some questions are straightforward ways of evaluating your environment, like asking what made a noise. Other questions interpret your circumstances subjectively, and the answers you come up with strongly influence your emotional state.

Everyone has a set of subjective habitual questions or types of questions that they ask themselves regularly. Since your habitual questions create your thought patterns, and thoughts determine your behavior, **if you consistently ask yourself disempowering questions, you will _feel_ worse and you _do_ less to improve your life. **You can change your life by becoming aware of your habitual questions and changing those that are disempowering. Disempowering questions include:

  * What’s the point?
  * Why is this happening to me? 
  * Why should I even try?
  * What’s wrong with me? 



By contrast, questions like these will promote more empowered thinking:

  * What in your life makes you happy? 
  * What’s good about your life?
  * What are you grateful for? 



For example, imagine you’ve tried and failed to skateboard three times in a row. In this situation, you can ask yourself two different questions that both attempt to diagnose the problem, but which will elicit two distinct answers:

  1. “Why can’t I get it?” This has a fairly defeatist tone, and it’s likely to lead to answers such as, “I’m not coordinated enough” and “This isn’t the sport for me.” This simple question could _discourage_ you from continuing to try, ultimately preventing you from ever learning to skateboard. 
  2. “What do I need to do differently?” This question is framed to find a solution, and it could lead to answers with more concrete ideas, such as, “Adjust my footing” and “Put my arms out for balance.” This question is likely to _encourage_ you to keep trying, and it could lead you to become a skilled skateboarder.



#### Understand the Importance of Questions in Changing Your Emotional State

**Questions are such a powerful force to change your mental and emotional state because answering an empowering question requires you to come up with empowering references to support your answer.** Let’s look at the process step by step:

  1. You ask an empowering question.
  2. As you think of an empowering answer, you naturally come up with empowering references to support it. 
  3. The process of scanning your brain for empowering references naturally focuses your attention on those positive references.
  4. As we discussed, focus determines your state—in this case, focusing on empowering references puts you in a positive state.
  5. Your empowered state then influences your subsequent questions, creating a feedback loop. 



The same process occurs when you ask yourself _disempowering_ questions, so **it’s critical that you start with _empowering_ questions so that you create a positive cycle **instead of a negative one. For instance, imagine you’re feeling down. Let’s look at how an empowering question and a disempowering question would each take you down a different mental and emotional path:

  1. The disempowered path: You ask yourself, “Why do I feel so depressed?” In search of an answer, you focus on all the unfortunate circumstances in your life (references) that could cause you to feel depressed. Thinking of all these reasons to be depressed then makes you feel _more_ depressed, leading to more disempowering questions like “Why is my life so awful?”
  2. The empowered path: You ask yourself, “What could I do to make myself feel happier?” You then think of empowering references, such as happy memories, things in your life that bring you joy, and activities you could do that would lift your spirits. With your focus on these positive references, you may then ask yourself more empowering questions such as, “How did I get so lucky?”



#### Word Your Questions Carefully

**Be conscious not only of the questions you ask yourself, but also of the way they’re worded and what they assume or cause you to ignore.** Some questions include a presupposition, or an assumption that’s built into the question and, thus, the answer. For example, if you ask yourself, “Why do I always choose the wrong partner?” then your question has made your consistent poor romantic choices a fact without ever stopping to consider whether that’s even true. As a result, your answer will provide evidence for this supposed fact, reinforcing the belief and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Additionally, the questions _others_ ask you can also contain presuppositions. Be aware of how questions are phrased before accepting the question as fact or framing your answer around it.

### Apply It: Ask Yourself Empowering Questions Every Day

Now that you know how powerfully your internal questions impact your state, it’s time to **take stock of your own habitual questions and condition yourself to ask empowering questions.** In order to seize your power and control your questions, use the NAC steps, which are (briefly):

  1. Become aware of what you want.
  2. Identify your limiting pattern.
  3. Create leverage. 
  4. Interrupt your pattern.
  5. Create a new, empowering alternative with better questions.
  6. Rehearse your new questions to condition them to be consistent.



Let’s elaborate on the fifth step of NAC: Creating new, empowering questions to replace old, disempowering ones. First, we’ll look at questions you can ask yourself daily to maintain a positive, empowered mindset.

**Each morning, ask yourself a series of questions to set the tone for your pattern of thinking for the day.** For each of the questions, think of two or three answers, elaborate on _how_ it makes you feel, and specify _why_ you feel that way. If you struggle to come up with an answer to any question, add “could” to the question—for example, if you can’t think of anything that makes you happy, try to come up with an answer for “What _could_ make me happy?”

The Morning Power Questions include:

  1. What in my life makes me happy? 
  2. What in my life excites me? 
  3. What in my life am I proud of? 
  4. What in my life am I grateful for? 
  5. What in my life do I enjoy most? 
  6. What in my life am I committed to? 
  7. Who do I love? What makes me a loving person? 
  8. Who loves me? 



Also consider asking yourself questions each evening that help you reflect on your day and find empowerment in your experiences. **When you make a habit of asking these questions, they’ll begin to shape your experiences.** For example, if you always ask yourself what you’ve learned each day, you’ll start going through your days looking for things you can learn.

The Evening Power Questions include:

  1. In what ways did I give today? 
  2. What have I learned today? 
  3. How can my experiences today improve my future? 



Customize these questions and add questions to fit you and your life. If you ask yourself these questions every day, they will become habitual, and they will shape your thinking, beliefs, and behavior.

#### Ask Yourself Strategic Questions to Overcome Challenges

It’s one thing to ask yourself empowering questions under normal circumstances, but it can be difficult to keep that mindset when you’re facing challenges. However, **the questions you ask yourself when you come up against obstacles are critical to helping you overcome those challenges.** Consider these five questions any time you’re dealing with a problem:

  1. **What’s good about this problem?** This question shifts your mindset from being upset about the problem to focusing on what you can learn and gain from it. For example, if you’re busy and exhausted and feel overwhelmed by the dozens of phone calls you have to make, you could find good in the fact that you have such a robust network that there are so many people who want and need to talk to you. 
  2. **What still needs improvement?** This question looks for ways to solve the problem. Additionally, the wording presupposes that improvement is imminent and the situation _will_ improve. For example, you may realize that you need to change your schedule and build in more time to rest and recharge so that you don’t feel overwhelmed again. 
  3. **What am I willing to do to improve the situation?** This question seeks specific actions that lead to resolution. For example, you may decide that you’re willing to make more space in your schedule by saying “no” to more commitments.
  4. **What am I willing to stop doing to improve the situation?** Since making lasting change requires starting a new behavior and ending an old, harmful behavior, this question aims to identify which disempowering habits you need to stop in order to reach a resolution. For example, you may commit to no longer agreeing to every invitation you get and you may also decide you’ll no longer complain about your schedule when you have the power to control it. 
  5. **How can I enjoy the resolution process?** Now that you’ve identified what the problem is and how you’ll tackle it, this question helps find pleasure in fixing it, which will ensure that you actually follow through. Additionally, when you answer this question, you may realize that you have resources that you had previously overlooked. In this way, questions influence what you believe is possible and, therefore, what you do to make that possibility a reality. For example, you may decide to make your phone calls from the Jacuzzi in your backyard, which will enable you to relax while being productive. The Jacuzzi is a resource that you’ve had the whole time, but you weren’t in the mindset to recognize it when you were feeling upset and overwhelmed. 



Besides questions that work toward a solution, you can also ask empowering questions that simply put you in a more positive state of mind, such as “What am I (or could I be) happy about in my life?” and “What can I learn from this problem?” **When you’re in a more empowered state, you’ll be better able to identify resources and come up with a solution.**

Still, questions aren’t magic spells that effortlessly produce answers—merely reciting the words may not be enough. When you ask yourself questions, ask with the certainty that you’ll come up with an answer. You may even have to ask repeatedly; as long as you maintain confidence and conviction that you’ll find the answer, the question will keep your mindset on track as you search for a solution.
