## Chapter 15: Recognize How Your Identity Dictates Your Behavior

As you expand your references and alter the beliefs they support, you may find yourself feeling like a new person. This is because your beliefs about yourself and what sets you apart from others comprise your _identity_ ; so, changing your beliefs may make you feel like your _identity_ is changing.

**Although your identity is not fixed or innate, it dictates your behavior, as people subconsciously strive to act in ways that reinforce their identity.** For example, if you identify as a low-achieving person, you’re less likely to push yourself to excel—regardless of natural ability—than someone who identifies as a high-achieving person. As such, your identity determines your decisions, actions, and fate; so, it’s important that it pushes you in a positive direction. Ensuring that this is the case may involve needing to remake your identity, if it’s not currently pushing you to be who you want to be.

In this chapter, you’ll learn:

  * How your identity forms
  * How your identity influences your actions
  * What happens when your behavior _conflicts_ with your identity 
  * How changing your behavior and your identity go hand-in-hand 
  * How to remake your identity to one that promotes positive behavior and moves you toward the life you want



### Define Yourself

Before we talk about how your identity dictates your actions, let’s discuss how you adopt your identity and what it encompasses. Your identity has developed through your life experiences and the influence of other people and things. **Like your beliefs, and values, you probably adopted your identity without consciously thinking about it.**

**Your identity can encompass myriad traits** , including:

  * Behavior (for example, I’m a procrastinator)
  * Emotions (for example, I’m an anxious person)
  * Faith (for example, I’m Muslim)
  * Income (for example, I’m a minimum-wage earner)
  * Physical appearance (for example, I’m overweight)
  * Possessions (for example, I’m a homeowner)
  * Profession (for example, I’m a writer)
  * Role (for example, I’m the breadwinner)
  * Title (for example, I’m a senior producer)
  * What you’re _not_ (for example, I’m not a gambler)



Additionally, your identity depends on the time frame you focus on: **Do you define yourself based on your past, your present, or your future?** For example, many people define themselves based on past traumas or achievements, such as being an abuse survivor or a former beauty queen. Some people define themselves by the present (for instance, a new parent) or by their future (such as an aspiring chef).

**The way _you_ identify is also a reflection of the way you perceive your _friends’_ identities. **For example, if you consider your friends to be fun and adventurous, you probably identify that way too. This perception of your identity can extend to people outside of your friend group, too, who also assume you’re fun and adventurous because you associate with people like that. For this reason, it’s important to be selective about who you surround yourself with, since _their_ identities impact how you and others perceive _your_ identity.

#### Know That Your Identity Defines Not _Who You Are_ but _What You Do_

People tend to think of their identities as an immutable part of them—after all, your identity is _who you are_ , isn’t it? In reality, **you can change your identity** (we’ll talk more about how to do that later in this chapter). However, you’ve been conditioned to resist such radical change: Your identity amounts to a set of beliefs about yourself, and our society says that changing your beliefs makes you flaky, wishy-washy, and unreliable.

As a result of this societal pressure, **people strive to be consistent with their beliefs, so they act in ways that reinforce their existing identities, creating self-fulfilling prophecies.** For example, if you believe yourself to be strong, smart, and hard-working, then you’ll behave in a way that means live up to those traits. By the same token, if your identity involves self-destructive behaviors, you’ll continue to engage in those actions despite the harmful effects. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Mindset to find out more about how your identity determines your performance.)

In fact,**if you attribute a certain behavior to being part of your identity, you’ll struggle to stop doing that behavior because you think that it’s part of who you are.** With this view, changing that behavior becomes tantamount to changing—or losing—your identity, and that prospect seems more painful than the pain of continuing the behavior. Instead, view your behavior as something transient and changeable.

For example, if you’ve been overweight for a long time, being an _overweight person_ has probably become part of your identity (whether you like it or not). As long as that’s how you define yourself, you’ll struggle to maintain weight loss and exercise habits because they conflict with your core sense of self—plus, you can conveniently make the excuse that this is just who you are, shirking your responsibility along with any hope of change. By contrast, if you think of yourself as someone who has merely _adopted unhealthy habits_ , then you’re more likely to successfully change those habits because you haven’t internalized them as part of who you are.

#### Refrain From Actions That Conflict With Your Identity to Avoid an Identity Crisis

**If you take actions that conflict with your identity, it can create internal confusion that leads to an identity crisis.** Identity crises cause you to feel disoriented, question your beliefs, and fear the pain of the unknown. For example, if you identify as an honest person and then you lie to your spouse, on top of your guilt for lying, you may be in disbelief that you lied because it goes against who you are, and you may start to question whether you truly know yourself.

**In other cases, identity crises are triggered not by actions you take, but by experiences you have.** One common example is the midlife crisis, which results from a struggle to transition from the identity of a young person to that of an aging person. A midlife crisis is usually triggered by something that conflicts with your perceived identity as a young person: You reach a certain age, you notice your body aging, or someone says something to you that they wouldn’t say to a younger person.

Anytime you adopt an identity that’s tied to something that changes—such as your age, attractiveness, or job—you’re almost guaranteeing an identity crisis at some point down the road.

### Change Your Identity to Change Your Behavior, and Vice Versa

To avoid an identity crisis, **if you want to change your behavior, change your _identity_ to fit the _behavior_ you want to maintain. **Since your identity comprises your beliefs about yourself, use the strategies we’ve already discussed for changing beliefs to do this. For example, if you want to lose weight and become stronger, you need to shed the identity of an overweight person (and the belief that this is fundamentally who you are) and adopt the belief that you are a healthy person. With your new identity, when someone gives you the choice between a donut and oatmeal, you’ll be less tempted to indulge in the donut because _that’s just not who you are_ —rather, you are someone who values your health and longevity, and the way to support those values is to choose the oatmeal.

In some cases, you may not need to _discard_ your old identity entirely, but rather _expand_ it to encompass your ideals. There may be nothing about your current identity that is holding you back from achieving your goals and living the life you want—except that it doesn’t include certain beliefs. As long as the beliefs and characteristics that you want to adopt don’t conflict with your current identity (which could cause an identity crisis), decide to expand your identity to encompass these traits. (Shortform example: If you’re an ambitious introvert with dreams of becoming a top-selling realtor, you don’t have to abandon your introversion _or_ your dream. Instead, become an ambitious introvert who is _also_ confident, personable, and an expert in architecture and design.)

Paradoxically, **although you can’t change your behaviors without changing your identity, neither can you change your identity without changing your behaviors to reinforce it.** In order to change your identity, first, change what you believe about yourself. Then, internalize those beliefs through your behavior: in other words, through your words and actions. The more you walk the walk and act as if you _are_ the person you’re trying to be, the more you will become that.

### Apply It: Customize Your Identity

Take a few moments now to evaluate your current identity and the identity you’d like to embody:

  1. **Relax.** Get into an open-minded state. 
  2. **Ask yourself, “Who am I?”** Write down whatever comes to mind. Repeat this multiple times, each time writing whatever occurs to you. Continue until you hit on something that resonates with you. 
  3. **If you’re having trouble figuring out who you are, try this exercise** : If there were an entry about you in the dictionary, what would it say? Alternatively, if you created an ID card that reflected who you really are, what information would it include and what would it exclude? Would it have your photo, physical description, beliefs, affiliations, motto, aspirations, abilities, accomplishments?
  4. **Reflect on the way you’ve just identified yourself.** Does your identity evoke pain or pleasure? If it carries pain, remember that you’ve _chosen_ to adopt this identity—it doesn’t define you—and you can just as easily choose to alter it. 
  5. **Write a list of all of the qualities you would want your identity to include.** Think of people who possess these traits. Now, imagine yourself embodying these qualities. How would it affect how you talk, think, and feel? 
  6. **Describe, in detail, who you want to be** when you assume this new identity. What kinds of actions, thoughts, and emotions do you want your new identity to trigger? 
  7. **Create a plan for embodying your new identity.** What behaviors would you need to adopt to be consistent with your new identity? Which friends would you spend your time with to reinforce your new identity? 
  8. **Commit yourself to this change.** Every day, use your new label to describe yourself—both when you’re thinking to yourself and talking to others. And tell your friends and family about your new identity. If you and everyone around you begin to see you in this new light, you will eventually internalize your new identity. 



Once you’ve made this identity shift, you’re not finished. **Due to age, experience, and circumstance, you change constantly, and your identity needs to change to reflect that.** Regularly evaluate and expand your identity and continually improve the rules you’re implementing to reinforce it and the references you’re using to support it.
