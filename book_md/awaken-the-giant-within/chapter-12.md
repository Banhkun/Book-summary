## Chapter 12: Live by Your Values

The first element of your Master System that we’ll discuss how to alter is your values. As we talked about briefly, your values dictate your evaluations, decisions and actions, which create your destiny. **_Knowing_ and also _living by_ your values brings deep fulfillment, inner peace, certainty, and joy.**

When you’re clear on your values, they act as your compass, guiding you unequivocally toward any action that upholds them. By contrast, if you’re unclear on your values or if you have conflicting values, it can cause enduring unhappiness and frustration. For example, if your highest value is independence and your second-highest value is intimacy, you may frequently struggle in relationships between wanting to connect and yearning to be untethered. Furthermore, if you haven’t identified and committed to your values _at all_ , you may sometimes act in ways that don’t align with them, bringing you further unhappiness.

In this chapter, we’ll explore how to identify your values, recognize how they’ve shaped your life, and alter them to support the life you want.

### Understand the Role of Values

Before we talk about how to identify your values, let’s explain why you probably don’t know exactly what your values are, despite their impact on your life.

In short, you may not be aware of what your values are because **you didn’t consciously choose them: They developed largely without your awareness or input.** You adopted your values through life experiences and conditioning from your parents, teachers, friends, culture, and other external forces. When your actions aligned with their values, you were rewarded with social approval, encouragement, or other forms of reinforcement. But when your actions went against their values, you were punished, excluded, or ignored. You also may have picked up values from your role models and from the media.

If you don’t know your values, then you don’t have a compass to guide you to the future you want, which leads to disappointment, frustration, and the sense that you could be getting more from life. Furthermore, not knowing your values means you can’t set goals that help you live up to those values. People in this situation often try to fill the void created by that uncertainty with self-destructive habits such as drinking, smoking, using drugs, and overeating.

Later in this chapter, you’ll have a chance to reflect on what your values actually are. As you reflect on this, it’s important to understand that there are two types of values:

  1. **_Ends_ are the emotional states you want to experience**, such as love, happiness, and security. These are the values that make life fulfilling. 
  2. **_Means_ are the ways you expect to reach the ends—**for example, you may value family because it’s a means to love and happiness. 



Distinguish between your values that are means and those that are ends to avoid pursuing values that are merely means without ever achieving their ends. For example, you may value owning your own business because you see it as a way to set your own schedule, enjoy more freedom, and have more time to spend with your family, so you set and achieve a goal to launch a startup. However, as your company grows, your responsibilities expand and you end up with less freedom and less time for your family. If you focus only on your _means_ —the business—and forget about your _ends—_ freedom and family time—you could reach your means while ending up further from your ends, leaving you unfulfilled.

### Recognize Your Value Hierarchy

Although all of your values are important to you, some are more important than others, creating a value hierarchy. Your hierarchy determines how you make decisions—the values that are highest in your hierarchy will determine your decision, outweighing lower-priority values..

**When you are clear on your value hierarchy, you can improve your life by deciding to actively pursue the values that mean the most to you and will bring you the most fulfillment.** For example, if you are offered a great promotion at work but it would require you to move overseas, you must determine whether you value success above connection with family and friends, or adventure over comfort.

You actually have not one, but _two_ value hierarchies that guide what you do and don’t do:

  1. **Your hierarchy of “moving-toward values” ranks the values that bring you pleasure** , such as love, power, and freedom. The values at the top of this hierarchy are those that you would do almost anything to fulfill. 
  2. **Your hierarchy of “moving-away-from values” ranks the values that you want to avoid because they bring you pain** , such as confrontation, fear, rejection, and loneliness. The values at the top of this hierarchy are those that you would do almost anything to avoid. For example, if your coworkers invite you to karaoke, you may not want to go because you want to avoid the humiliation of singing in front of everyone, but you may go anyway because your fear of social rejection is greater than your fear of humiliation, and you don’t want your coworkers to reject you if you pass on their invitation.



#### Beware That Your Hierarchies Can Cause Conflicts

Knowing your hierarchy of values is critical not only because it guides you to pursue only the most meaningful values to you, but also because it gives you the insight to see when your hierarchy is creating challenges in your life. This can happen in one of two ways:

  1. **If you have conflicting moving-toward values that are ranked next to each other, you’ll face frequent dilemmas and dissatisfaction.** For example, imagine that passion is your highest priority value and comfort is your second-highest. For the last 10 years, you’ve had the same job—it’s stable, comfortable, and familiar, but you’re not passionate about the work. You have a constant, nagging urge to make a career change to pursue your passion, but the risks and discomfort are too great, so you live in limbo. Many people go through life like this, but a simple reordering of priorities could resolve it (we’ll explain how to reprioritize your values next). 
  2. **When your top moving-toward value and your top moving-away-from value conflict, you’ll end up in a cycle of self-sabotage.** For example, if you want intimacy above all else but you also want to avoid rejection more than anything, you probably crave relationships but tend to sabotage them before you get close enough to risk rejection. Furthermore, as we discussed in Part 1, pain avoidance is a stronger motivator than pleasure-seeking, which means that your desire for intimacy will never outweigh your fear of rejection. This kind of conflict can plague your life, unless you reprioritize your values.



### Apply It: Customize Your Values

Now that you know the role your values can play in shaping your decisions and your destiny, harness that power by taking stock of your values and adjusting them to guide you to the life you want. (If you don’t have a clear vision of the life you want, revisit the last section of Chapter 9 to create your compelling future.)

**First, become aware of how you currently prioritize your _moving-toward_ values. **There are countless values that you could hold and adopt, but, to get started, rank the following values in order of priority:

  * Love
  * Success
  * Freedom
  * Intimacy
  * Security
  * Adventure
  * Power
  * Passion
  * Comfort
  * Health 



When you’re clear on how these forces drive you and which are the strongest forces, you’ll understand how these values have shaped your life.

**Second, once you’ve identified your current moving-toward values hierarchy, assess it to see what you’d like to shift in order to create the life you want.** Initially, you might feel reluctant to change your values, because they’re such an integral part of who you are—but they don’t define you. Not only will you still be _you_ when you shift your values, but you’ll be _you in control_ of your life and destiny. Remember that you didn’t consciously choose this values hierarchy in the first place, and now you have the opportunity to tailor it to fit who you are and who you want to be.

With that in mind, follow these steps:

  1. **Think of the values you would need** in order to be the best person you could be and live the best life you could. Consider values that aren’t already on your list. As you think of additional values, decide where they fit best in your hierarchy. 
  2. **Ask yourself which values you can eliminate** from your priority list. You may eliminate values that are important to you, but which you have achieved sufficiently to take your focus off of them. For example, you may decide to remove “stability” from your hierarchy because, while it’s still important to you, you’ve achieved a high level of stability in your life and you realize that your continued focus on it is making you less willing to take necessary risks to fulfill other values. 
  3. **Look at each value on your list and assess what benefits you get from that value and from placing that value in its particular position** in your hierarchy. For example, why does prioritizing “achievement” above “happiness” shape your life in a positive way?
  4. **Look at each value on your list and ask yourself what the drawbacks are of having that value in its particular position** in your hierarchy. For example, having “success” as your highest priority may help you to achieve great things, but it may also force you to make sacrifices in fulfilling your “love” and “health” values. 
  5. **Reviewing your revised list of values, ask yourself what priority order they need to be in** to guide you to the future you want. Just like cooking, you can have all the right ingredients, but you won’t get the result you want unless you put them in the right order. 



After doing this exercise, you can feel confident and at peace knowing that you’ve harnessed the powerful force of your values to drive your decisions and actions toward creating the life you want. Of course, merely putting these words into a list won’t change your life—you need to **condition yourself to internalize these values.** Hang your values list where you’ll see it frequently, and create leverage by asking the people in your life to hold you to your new values.

To ensure that your hierarchy of _moving-away-from_ values don’t hamstring your progress, the next step is to do the same process with _those_ values. First, rank the following values in order of how far you would go to avoid each:

  * Rejection
  * Anger
  * Frustration
  * Loneliness
  * Depression
  * Failure
  * Humiliation
  * Guilt



Then, follow the steps above to reevaluate the importance of these values to you and determine where they should _really_ appear in your hierarchy.
