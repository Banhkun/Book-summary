## Part 3 | Chapter 16: Take the Seven-Day Challenge

Throughout this summary, you’ve learned principles and the practical strategies to completely transform your life. Now, **jumpstart your transformation with this seven-day challenge.** Each day for the next week, you’ll tackle an assignment to begin improving a different area of your life.

### Day 1: Master Your Emotional Patterns

**First, change your _habitual emotional patterns_ to experience fewer negative emotions and spend more time in positive, empowering states. **We’ve discussed several strategies throughout the book to alter your emotional patterns—some of these strategies help you shift your focus and physiology, and others anchor those changes in new habits. These strategies include:

  * Adopting empowering beliefs 
  * Imagining a compelling future 
  * Altering your identity 
  * Using empowering metaphors 
  * Changing your neuro-associations through Neuro-Associative Conditioning
  * Controlling your focus through questions
  * Using empowering references
  * Adopting empowering rules 
  * Manipulating your submodalities 
  * Using Transformational Vocabulary
  * Living by your values 



#### Assignment: Create Plans to Minimize Negative Emotions

This exercise will draw your attention to your current emotional patterns so that you can use the strategies above to alter them:

  1. **Write a list of every emotion you experience** in a typical week.
  2. **List the triggering situations and events** beside each emotion. 
  3. **Circle or star all of the negative emotions** on your list, and revisit the list of action signals in Part 1 to decode each of these emotions. 
  4. **Using that insight, develop a solution-oriented plan for responding to each** of these action signals, which will quell the negative emotion. For example, if you frequently feel frustrated with your colleagues for not carrying their weight, remember that frustration is a signal that you need to change your approach. Make a plan to change your question from “Why aren’t they helping?” to “What can I delegate?” and ask for help. 
  5. **Throughout the day, focus on replacing your negative emotional patterns with your new, empowering patterns.** The more consistently you do this, the more you will condition this change.
