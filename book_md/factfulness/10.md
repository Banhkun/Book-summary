## 10: The Urgency Instinct

The Urgency Instinct is the impulse to make snap decisions immediately, before fully considering the facts and weighing the alternatives. This sense of urgency is often false and alarmist, and can lead to destructive unintended consequences:

A hasty overreaction to a mysterious outbreak in Mozambique led the government to shut down the roads. This led to the unintended consequence of women and children drowning in the river when they were forced to take to leaky boats to bring their goods to the market: they could not afford to lose a day of sales in this impoverished country. Later, it was revealed that the outbreak was caused by people eating unprocessed plants, _not_ by a communicable disease. The roadblocks were completely unnecessary.

This catastrophe would have been averted had the government taken the time to pause, think it through, and assess the full ramifications of its decision _before_ acting. Their reactiveness was a classic example of the Urgency Instinct at its worst.

#### Now or Never

**Salespeople and activists are skilled at exploiting the Urgency Instinct**. It plays on basic fears. For salespeople, urgency makes us fear that we will miss a special, fleeting opportunity if we don’t buy their product immediately. For activists, it helps focus attention and resources on the problems they care the most about. They tell people that if we don’t act now (and act big), humankind will suffer irrecoverable damage.

#### Climate Change

Climate change really _is_ a problem that threatens our survival on this planet. But overstating or exaggerating the urgency of the threat can undermine the cause of climate action if these warnings are revealed to be overblown. Despite Al Gore’s insistence that “we need to create fear,” what we _really_ need is fact-based solutions. Useful information like quarterly published data on greenhouse gas emissions will do far more good than making dubious and unsupported claims about the coming flood of “climate refugees.”

#### Ebola

Thee 2014 ebola outbreak in West Africa caused a great deal of panic in the region and in the world at large. However, much of this panic (and the resultant calls for drastic action) was overblown. Many of the suspected cases were false positives driven by confounding variables: ebola-like symptoms were really caused by other factors like poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. In the end, the ebola outbreak subsided because of common-sense, easy-to-implement public health measures like strict hygiene measures in public places and limiting unnecessary bodily contact. The solution did not come from drastic measures like border controls and mass quarantining.

#### Real Global Risks

Of course, there are still _real_ problems that we should be focusing our attention on.

Consider pandemics, to which people at Level 1 are especially vulnerable. We need strong institutions like the WHO to provide the knowledge, resources, and infrastructure to combat deadly communicable diseases.

Another financial crisis would throw tens of millions of people around the world out of work, destabilize global trade, wipe out retirement savings, and erode trust in democracy and free markets. The growing complexity of the modern financial system makes financial crises very hard to predict (like in 2008). We need better regulation to reduce the complexity of the system and empower non-experts to make more rational financial decisions.

A new world war would certainly be devastating (especially one with nuclear weapons). To reduce the risk of global conflict, we need international cooperation, trade, exchange programs, and any other measures that break down cultural barriers.

As we said above, climate change is a genuine risk. We need global solidarity to ensure that all nations cooperate in reducing emissions. Our success in reducing ozone depletion and eliminating leaded gasoline suggests that we _can_ do this.

We’ve talked a lot about the extreme poverty of Level 1. Despite the improvements we’ve seen, 800 million people still live in these conditions. To free people from this kind of poverty, **we need peace, access to education, adequate healthcare, and basic infrastructure like water and electricity**.

### Causes of the Urgency Instinct

Why are we so vulnerable to appeals to immediate and drastic action?

Because salespeople, activists, and leaders are very skilled at convincing us of the need for urgency. Moreover, some problems seem so large that it’s hard for us to imagine a piecemeal approach being the right one (as it was for ebola and will be for global warming). So **we fall into the trap of doing large-scale actions to match large-scale problems**.

Lastly, the Urgency Instinct probably served our pre-civilization ancestors quite well. Natural selection almost certainly favored individuals prone to quick action rather than cautious inaction.

### Problems Arising From the Urgency Instinct

Acting in haste without analyzing the facts leads us to enact solutions that can do more harm than good.

#### Unintended Consequences

As we saw with the response to the outbreak in Mozambique, the instinct to do something _right now_ led to suffering and death that could have been avoided if someone had taken the time to do a proper analysis.

#### Panic

The fear caused by the urgency instinct leads to panic, and **we never make good decisions when we’re in a state of panic**. Instead, it leads to foolish and harmful decisions.

#### Loss of Credibility

**We undermine the credibility of data when we overstate problems**. By crying wolf, experts make it less likely that their warnings will be heeded in the future. This poses a grave risk, since it’s very hard to regain this trust.

### Overcoming the Urgency Instinct

Make sure you have all the facts before succumbing to urgency.

#### Get the Numbers

Numbers aren’t the whole picture (as we saw with the Size Instinct) but they can tell us a lot. Before supporting rash decisions and quick action make sure you have data that is relevant and accurate.

#### “Now or Never” Is Usually Wrong

It’s almost _never_ “now or never.” Very few good solutions come from forsaking careful analysis and thought. Take a breath and analyze before committing.

#### You’re Not A Fortune-Teller

You don’t know for sure what’s going to happen to _you_ tomorrow, let alone what the world will be like in 10, 20, 30 years. This doesn’t mean we should avoid predictions altogether, but we should always be skeptical and not take them at face value.

#### Don’t Believe the Worst-Case Scenario

Insist on the full range of possible scenarios. Most of the time, the worst-case scenario isn’t what happens. A quick look at any probability distribution will show you that both the worst-case and the best-case (the “tail risks”) are unlikely.
