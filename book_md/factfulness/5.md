## 5: The Size Instinct

The Size Instinct is the mistaken impulse to overestimate the importance of any single data point or incident, without putting it in the proper context (like how the data has changed over time). Combined with the Negativity Instinct, it severely distorts our worldview.

For example, 940,000 people died of HIV/AIDS-related illnesses in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. That statistic, _when viewed in isolation,_ is certainly horrifying: 940,000 is a lot of people!

But your perception of the situation would probably change a lot if we told you that this figure was 1.9 million back in 2004 (the peak year for AIDS deaths). This means there has been a **51 percent _decrease_ in AIDS deaths** in less than two decades: something you would have completely missed if you had _only_ looked at that one 2017 statistic. This is the Size Instinct in action.

#### Focusing on the Small Picture

**The Size Instinct causes us to misjudge reality** and devote disproportionate attention (and resources) to small details and to the _symptoms_ of problems, rather than to large problems and their deeper root causes.

In 2016, 4.2 million babies died before the age of 1, according to the latest UNICEF data.

Obviously, that’s objectively awful: one case of infant mortality is one too many. But focusing _solely_ on this figure causes us to lose perspective. In 1950, the number was 14.4 million, and the population of the world was much smaller. This means that both the absolute _and_ relative number of infant deaths was far higher.

Or take a look at bear attacks. These freak events certainly are horrifying when they occur. A fatal bear attack in Sweden in 2004 received wall-to-wall coverage. But this inordinate focus on one incident obscured a crucial fact: this was the country’s first bear attack _since 1902_! The Size Instinct just made them seem far more likely and dangerous than they actually were.

Swine flu has generated a lot of panic, particularly in the media in Level 4 countries. During a two-week period in 2009, the disease killed 31 people worldwide. During that same period, 253,442 articles were written about swine flu: over 8,000 articles per death! Meanwhile, over 63,000 died of tuberculosis, mostly in level 1 and Level 2 countries, but swine flu received 82,000 times the coverage.

The Size Instinct was at work in all of these examples: the focus on a relative handful of extreme cases caused the world to overlook the bigger picture.

### Causes Of the Size Instinct

Why do we focus so much attention on single incidents and isolated data points?

#### Human Compassion

When we hear a story about a dead child or a freak event that resulted in a death, it is natural for us to feel compassion and devote attention to the story. **We have a bias toward things that we can see and feel** : when we see one instance of suffering, we extrapolate that to form our view of the broader world. Again, this is an evolutionary inheritance: our hunter-gatherer ancestors weren’t data-crunchers. Instead, they had to make quick decisions based on conditions right in front of them. Anecdotal, one-off examples were all they had.

#### Storytelling

Journalists are drawn to the soft-focus, human interest story. It makes a more compelling narrative (since journalists are storytellers and we all seek to create stories and meaning out of the world around us) to focus on a single story of human suffering, with identifiable “characters.” It’s harder to make a five-minute news segment about impersonal data points or long trends changing over time.

### Problems Arising from the Size Instinct

The Size Instinct, driven by our basic sense of compassion, ironically _contributes_ to human suffering.

#### Disproportionate Focus

As mentioned above the Size Instinct causes us to overestimate relatively minor sources of suffering (like swine flu) at the expense of widespread causes of suffering and death. For all of the attention devoted to terrorism, **simple diarrhea is a much greater source of danger, killing over 2,000 children in Level 1 and 2 countries _daily_** (more than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined).

#### Misallocation of Resources

**When you focus on limited data, you will make unproductive decisions** with resources of money and personnel that actually _hurt_ people. Opening fancy new hospitals to combat child mortality in places like Mozambique is only addressing a fraction of the problem (since most kids won’t even get to the hospital). The better solution would be to take a holistic approach to the problem by investing in education, clean drinking water, infrastructure, and community health workers to improve community health standards _before_ children need to go to the hospital.

When you’re dealing with Level 1 extreme poverty, cost-effectiveness (avoiding the Size Instinct) _is_ compassion.__ It’s _inhumane_ to be inefficient.

### Overcoming the Size Instinct

To steer clear of the Size Instinct, **compare and divide the numbers you’re given, and always make sure to get the _whole_ picture**.

#### Compare Numbers

Never accept a statistic in isolation. Like the child mortality numbers or the bear attacks above, always place it in proper context: Ask yourself, “Has the frequency of this phenomenon changed over time? Is this incident or figure truly representative, or is it an outlier?”

#### Divide Numbers

**Divide the number by a total** to get a better sense of proportion and perspective. This method helps you understand the relationship of the part to the whole.

For example: with the 4.2 million infant deaths in 2016 vs. 14.4 million in 1950, dividing gives us an even greater idea of the scale of change:

14.4 million / 97 million (the total number of babies born in 1950) = 15 percent.

4.2 million / 141 million (the total number of babies born in 2016) = 3 percent. The rate declined by _80 percent_ during this time.

#### The 80/20 Rule

**In most datasets, 80 percent of the results come from 20 percent of the causes** (this is also known as the Pareto Principle). This rule applies to a variety of datasets, including causes of death, line items in a budget, and energy sources. A few big-ticket items are responsible for the vast majority of the effects. Knowing this, you should look for the largest numbers in a dataset to figure out which are the most important and the ones most deserving of attention.
