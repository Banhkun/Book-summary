## 3: The Straight Line Instinct

The Straight Line Instinct is the tendency to believe that trends will continue at their current rate forever. Data and some common sense demonstrate that this is _not_ the case:

For example, a child might grow over 35 percent in their first six months after birth, but they obviously don’t _continue_ at this rate for the rest of their lives (otherwise, we would see a lot more seven-foot tall five-year-olds)!

The Straight Line Instinct is the cause of a lot of misplaced pessimism, particularly with regards to **world population growth**. Magazines, newspapers, and pundits warn of an unsustainable growth in population that will diminish the planet’s food supplies, push climate change past the point of no return, and spark human conflicts as different groups compete for ever-shrinking resources.

(Shortform note: This isn’t a new source of fear. In his 1798 book _An Essay on the Principle of Population_ , the English scholar Thomas Malthus warned that a similar population explosion threatened to doom his generation to poverty and immiseration. Based on what you’ve already learned in this summary, you know that this didn’t happen.)

The idea is widely accepted: 85 percent of surveyed “experts” in Level 4 countries overestimated population growth. And, sure, if you looked at a graph like this, you might be seriously alarmed:

![factfulness-population.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/factfulness-population.png)

It looks like population is just exponentially growing with no end in sight! Once again, however, popular belief is wrong: population growth is projected to begin levelling off as we approach the end of the 21st century. In fact, **the number of children in the world in 2100 is projected to be the same as today**.

#### A Population Explosion? Think Again

The world’s population _is_ increasing: but it’s _not_ increasing exponentially and the rate has already begun slowing down. World population will settle between 10 and 12 billion by 2100, a figure far lower than a straight line projection from today’s figure of 7.6 billion would have you believe.

Why will population slow down? Because the number of children will stay flat. One of the benefits of people moving out of Level 1 is that they have fewer children: and indeed, **the worldwide average number of babies per woman has halved over the past 50 years**. This is because people at Levels 2 and 3 (remember, this is where most of the population now lives) have better access to contraception and less of a need to have children since they don’t need more hands for subsistence agriculture.

**As more people leave Level 1 for Levels 2,3, and 4, this will only continue**. The trend then starts to become self-sustaining: the new generation of people _born_ at higher income levels will have fewer children than the generation that preceded them. The expected, modest increase in population will come from these children and young adults today growing up and becoming the middle-aged and elderly of the future: there will simply be _more_ adults.

It’s useful to put population in some historical context. World population was approximately 5 million during the prehistoric era and stayed flat throughout antiquity and well into the modern era, due to high rates of child mortality. It only reached 1 billion around 1800 as the Industrial Revolution was dawning. Today’s population is around 7.6 billion. The majority of the increase has come only since the mid-20th century.

_How_ the rate of increase is slowing is itself a cause for optimism. People are choosing to have fewer children because they’re rising out of poverty, gaining new economic opportunities, and for women, gaining autonomy of their reproductive choices. It’s a process driven by choice. Contrast that with how population has been held in check for most of human history: child mortality, epidemics, and famine. The new population equilibrium is much better than the old one.

### Causes of the Straight Line Instinct

Why do we continue to believe that things will keep moving in the same direction and at the same rate that they are now?

Like many of these instincts, the Straight Line Instinct is a cognitive inheritance from our prehistoric ancestors. For our Neanderthal forebears, it would have been a handy survival tool, telling you that the projectile headed your way would continue on that trajectory until it smashed into your face. This form of visual forecasting probably played a key role in natural selection: that’s why we have the instinct today. Unfortunately, it’s a poor tool for the complexity and nuance of the modern world.

### Problems Arising From the Straight Line Instinct

The Straight Line Instinct, when applied specifically to the problem of overpopulation, does real harm to global welfare. If you believe that exponentially growing population is hurtling the planet toward a sustainability crisis, then you would be opposed to investing in healthcare and education services around the world. After all, wouldn’t doing so only exacerbate the problem of overpopulation?

Of course, we’ve learned that the answer to this question is “no.” Lifting people out of poverty is the humane thing to do on its own merits and actually _alleviates_ population growth by bringing people into Levels 2,3, and 4, making them likely to have _fewer_ children. Unjustified fears of overpopulation have always been used to justify regressive and harmful social policy.

### Overcoming the Instinct

It’s useful to remember that **statistical trends follow _many_ different types of curves**, not just a straight line. As people move from Level 1 to Level 4, these trends follow different patterns.

#### S-Bends

![factfulness-s-curve.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/factfulness-s-curve.png)

These curves are low and flat at Level 1, rise sharply at Level 2, and flatten off at Levels 3 and 4. Trends that follow this type of curve include female literacy, vaccination rates, and refrigeration. This is because once people reach Level 2 they can afford these luxuries and start consuming them _en masse_. But the increase slows down in Levels 3 and 4 because everybody already has them by then.

#### Slide Curves

![factfulness-slide.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/factfulness-slide.png)

These curves are the inverse of S-Bends: flat at Level 1, a sharp _decrease_ at Level 2, and then a flattening at Levels 3 and 4. A significant example of a phenomenon that follows a slide curve is babies-per-woman. Women have fewer kids as they get more access to contraception and escape extreme poverty in the transition from Level 1 to Level 2. But children _born_ at Levels 3 and 4 are less likely to have fewer kids, so the rate of decrease drops.

#### Hump Curves

![factfulness-hump.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/factfulness-hump.png)

Hump curves are low at Level 1, rise sharply at Levels 2 and 3, and decline again at Level 4.An interesting example of a trend that moves along a hump curve is cavities. People can’t afford sweets at Level 1, so they have fewer cavities. As they get richer, they can start to afford candy and soda, but not dental care, so cavities peak at Levels 2 and 3. By Level 4, however, people are wealthy enough to afford adequate dental care, so cavities decline once again.

#### Doubling Curves

![factfulness-exponential.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/factfulness-exponential.png)

This type of curve shows an exponential increase from Level 1 to Level 4. Examples include distance, spending, and CO2 emissions. The reason is that all of these are directly correlated with income. The more money you have, the more you will travel, spend, and contribute to emissions. However, the effect of money is different at all levels: the marginal increase of $1 is life-changing at Level 1, but fairly meaningless at Level 4.

#### See the Big Picture

Always remember to ask when you’re shown a trend: which part of the curve are you seeing?

The straight line you’re seeing could be just one small part of a trend that’s actually an S-Bend, slide curve, hump curve, or doubling curve.
