## 2: The Negativity Instinct

The negativity instinct is the tendency to believe that the world is bad and getting worse. You might fret about the looming threat of global warning, the frequency of terrorist and shooting attacks, and the ever-uncertain condition of the economy.

A factful worldview, however, demonstrates that this is _not_ the case. Across a variety of standard of living measurements, **the state of the world is better than it’s ever been**.

Extreme poverty (Level 1) has _halved_ over the past 20 years. This rate of progress is remarkable when you consider that nearly all of humanity lived this way for most of recorded history until very recently: a full 85 percent of the world’s population was at Level 1 in 1800, 50 percent did as recently as 1966 (well within the living memory of billions of people alive today).

Global average life expectancy has risen to 72: it was 30 at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1800. This positive trend has been driven by _another_ positive trend, namely the drastic decline in infant mortality.

Even today’s poorest Level 1 countries like Lesotho or Zambia enjoy a better standard of living than today’s Level 4 countries like Sweden or the United States did only a few generations ago.

#### A World of Improvements

A combination of a _decline_ in bad trends and an _increase_ in positive trends has made the present the best time to be alive in human history.

Just take a look at some of the **bad trends that have declined** :

  * Slavery: Once a near-universal institution, it’s only legal in three countires today.
  * HIV: Rates of infection per million are half of what they were in 1996.
  * Child mortality: A shocking 44 percent of children died before their fifth birthday in 1800. Today this figure has been whittled down to 4 percent.
  * Combat deaths: At the height of World War Two, there were 200 combat deaths per 100,000 people. Today that number is 1, even _with_ the ongoing Syrian Civil War.
  * Hunger: 28 percent of people worldwide were malnourished in 1970. Today, that figure is 11 percent.



And as a corollary, check out these **good trends that are on the rise** :

  * Women’s suffrage: At the dawn of the 20th century, almost no countries allowed women to vote. Today, 193 out of 194 do.
  * Food production: Crop yields have nearly quadrupled since 1961. This has been a major driver of the aforementioned decline in worldwide hunger.
  * Access to electricity: The share of people with access to electricity increased from 72 to 85 percent from 1991 to 2014.
  * Access to clean drinking water: More people than ever can drink safe, treated water, with that figure going up 30 percent from 1980 to 2015.



### Causes of the Negativity Instinct

With things so clearly improving, why are we so prone to negativity? Why don’t we see the progress that’s happening all around us?

#### Nostalgia

We are misinformed by nostalgia. We exalt the past as being a better time whose standards and values we’ve forsaken. And we usually attribute today’s problems to the abandonment of those values. But this is flatly wrong.

But this is flatly wrong. In fact, by most statistical measures, **earlier historical periods were _always_ worse than the present day**. For example, India’s material standard of living (even in remote rural areas) increased greatly from the 1970s to the 1990s as the country progressed from Level 1 extreme poverty to Level 3 middle-income status. When the Swedish author Lasse Berg travelled to India in the 1990s, he showed the residents of a remote village pictures of their community during the 1970s. They were incredulous: how could the recent past, a time they thought they remembered so well, be so starkly different from the images in their heads?

Or consider ancient graveyards. For all our fascination with and admiration for these civilizations, antiquity was a pretty grim time to be alive: their graveyards display levels of infant and child mortality that would be unfathomable today.

#### Selective reporting

Journalists, activists, and politicians are storytellers and **they have a bias toward a dramatic and negative worldview**. With the Internet, we have more access to information than ever. This makes us more _aware_ of human suffering, causing us to think that it is pervasive and on the rise. But we’re only becoming aware of things that were _always_ happening. And as we’ve seen, the bad trends we read about are on the decline.

#### Overuse of Intuition

We tend to form conclusions based on our intuition or our gut, rather than using the reasoning powers of the human mind or the vast quantities of trustworthy data we have at our disposal.

This makes some sense. After all, we evolved from creatures whose survival instincts were based on intuition, quick judgements, and a reliance on what their eyes and ears told them. This benefited early humans who lived in relatively small, close-knit communities that consisted mostly of kin. They didn’t have to grapple with data. Thinking _too_ much, in fact, could get you killed.

As we’ll see with some of the other instincts, **this mindset is totally unsuitable for the modern world**. Today, you need data and analytical tools to make sense of the reams of information you have to process. You need more than just your gut to separate the signal from the noise.

### Problems Arising from the Negativity Instinct

The Negativity Instinct can and does cause real harm.

We become more willing to embrace radical and urgent solutions to problems if we believe the world is in a dire state. These solutions tend to cause more harm than good, because no one bothers to think through their full ramifications.

The Negativity Instinct also causes a loss of hope and an abandonment of efforts to improve things. If you think things are _so_ bad, you’ll eventually start thinking that things are bad beyond redemption. You are simply overwhelmed by your mistaken ideas of how dire things are. Once you believe that, there’s no incentive to improve things, since they’ll never get better anyway. It’s a vicious cycle: misplaced negativity leads to apathy, which leads to _more_ suffering, which leads to more apathy. This is a tragic loss, because there still _is_ poverty and suffering that demands attention.

### Overcoming the Negativity Instinct

How do we avoid falling into a pessimistic (and false) view of the world? By managing our expectations about the news we read and bringing some nuance and perspective to our understanding.

#### Bad _and_ Improving: Not Mutually Exclusive

Things can be _both_ improving and still objectively bad. You’ll come to the wrong conclusions if you only look at a bad situation without considering the broader context.

Ask yourself: “Is this bad situation _better_ than what it used to be? Is it bad compared to _other_ examples of the same phenomenon? Is it improving?”

Think of a baby in the NICU. Obviously, _any_ baby needing intensive care is terrible. And that baby is certainly in objectively poor health at any given point in time. This doesn’t mean, however, that the baby’s health isn’t better today than it was yesterday or the week before.

#### Price In the Bad News

It’s just reality: **negative news is repeated and shared in the news media, while positive news isn’t.** This is because bad news is a better fit for the dramatic worldview: it’s sudden and its consequences are felt immediately.

Good news, meanwhile, usually entails the gradual improvement of basic conditions over _very long periods of time_. Which do you think makes a better headline:: “Plane Crash Kills 300” or “Extreme Poverty Halves Over 20 Years”?

#### Don’t Censor History:

Don’t romanticize the past and don’t fall prey to the historical amnesia we discussed above. For much of human history, people’s lives were “nasty, brutish, and short,” to quote the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. You miss the forest for the trees when you overlook the extraordinary progress that society has made.
