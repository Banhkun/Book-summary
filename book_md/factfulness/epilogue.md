## Epilogue: Factfulness in Practice

We’ve now examined all ten instincts, looking at:

  * What they are.
  * Why we believe in them.
  * The damage that they do.
  * How to overcome them.



How can we apply what we’ve learned going forward, so that we can lead more factful, reason-based lives?

#### Education

We should teach children about how **countries around the world fall into four different income levels** , and how these income levels determine much of the differences that we see in standards of living and even cultural values.

We should teach them about how societies change over time and how the world has made great strides in improving quality of life.

Above all, we should teach them to be curious and humble and to embrace the complexity of the world. There are no easy problems, and there are even fewer easy solutions. Know what you don’t know and be open to new information that challenges your worldview.

#### Business

For businesses, **be aware of the opportunities (and the risks) of globalization**.

Accurate information about the world has never been more critical: to make smart long-term investment decisions, you _need_ to know that much of Asia and Africa has advanced to Level 2, and that the bulk of people will live on these continents by 2100.

Above all, businesses must know that they are now speaking to a truly global audience. Western-centric marketing campaigns and products will no longer resonate.

#### Journalists, Activists, and Politicians

These groups should try to place events in their proper historical and proportional context, to avoid feeding into the instincts.

However, the pressures of the market (more drama means more eyeballs on the page or the screen) are probably too great for us to expect these groups to embrace a truly factful worldview. Ultimately, **it will be on _us_ as consumers and voters to apply a more multicultural, discerning lens to the news that we hear.**

#### Your Organization

Within your organization, don’t rest on laurels and accept the status quo.

**Hunt for ignorance among your colleagues (and within yourself)**. Always be asking, “What don’t we know? What opportunities might we be missing? What are our cultural biases and blind spots?”

Remember, a factful worldview is not just more accurate than a dramatic one. It’s more useful, comforting, and inspiring.

### The Instincts: A Refresher

As you’ve seen, most of the instincts have a few things in common. To help you get the big picture details, we’ve boiled them down to their essentials here.

#### Causes of the Instincts

Broadly speaking, most of these instincts are vestigial characteristics that we’ve inherited from evolution. Making snap judgements and assumptions based on the environment immediately around us was probably a good survival instinct for our ancestors: that’s why _they_ survived and got to pass these instincts down to _us_. In today’s data-heavy and complex world, however, these instincts lead us to faulty conclusions.

We also live in the age of the 24-hour news cycle. To beat out the competition and keep eyeballs on the screen, media outlets over-dramatize stories, emphasizing themes of loss and hyping up fear. Remember, journalists are human beings and are subject to the same misconceptions we are. It’s only natural that their coverage reflects this distortion.

#### Problems Arising From the Instincts

The instincts lead us to incorrectly perceive the world around us. We overgeneralize, draw too much from small sample sizes, and display in-group biases as a result of leaning on these largely-obsolete evolutionary crutches. When we do so, we make poor judgements, contribute to general ignorance, neglect pressing problems, and misallocate resources to problems that don’t need solving.

#### Overcoming the Instincts

Most of these instincts are overcome by a willingness to accept what you don’t know and absorbing new information. Some of the most useful strategies for doing this are engaging with people who disagree with you, insisting on data rather than anecdotal evidence, and embracing complexity. Above all, be skeptical of ideas and solutions to problems that seem too simple: because they probably are.
