## 8: The Single Perspective Instinct

The Single Perspective Instinct is the attraction that people have for simple, reductive ideas and one-size-fits-all solutions, as in, “All problems have one cause which we must always oppose,” or “All problems have a single solution which we must always support.”

**The instinct leads people to embrace all-encompassing ideologies** and worldviews that distort and whitewash the complexity and nuance of the real world.

For example, extreme free-market libertarians believe that all problems are caused by government interference, so they push for unfettered free markets everywhere. Of course, they ignore problems _caused_ by free markets (like pollution).

On the other side of the political spectrum, communists believe that everything bad in the world stems from capitalism, so they fight for nationalization of the means of production. Similarly, they ignore problems _caused_ by government interference (like the failure of collective farming in the former Soviet Union).

Clearly then, _both_ ideologies can’t be the solution for all things all the time. Once we understand this, we come closer to understanding the Single Perspective Instinct.

### Experts, Activists, and Ideologues: The Hammer/Nail Problem

Experts and activists are often well-informed and well-intentioned people trying to bring greater global attention and resources to some of the world’s most pressing problems. However, they are also prone to the same instincts and misconceptions as anyone else. They also tend to overstate the likelihood and prevalence of the problems they are focused on. For example, animal rights activists downplay the fact that many formerly endangered species have been moved off the endangered list.

There’s an old expression, **“to a person with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.”**

People with expertise want to put it to good use and they see a reason to put it to use _everywhere_. But this leads to experts and activists overstating problems and proposing their pet solutions as the cure-all for complex and nuanced global challenges.

Even advocates of democracy can fall prey to this mode of thinking. Democracy is _not_ always the solution. In fact, the countries that have undergone the greatest economic growth and escape from Level 1 in the 20th century (China, South Korea) were not democracies: they were one-party states and military dictatorships.

#### Look _Beyond_ the Numbers

Data (as important as it is) does not tell the full story. You still need to **look _behind_ the numbers** to see real people and lives.

The Prime Minister of Mozambique measures economic progress in his country by things that he can see with his eyes: how many people have shoes and how many new houses are being built. He emphasizes that a disproportionate focus on cold, impersonal stats like GDP and FDI growth obscures the reality of progress on the ground.

#### Look Beyond Medicine

Doctors tend to see medicine as the single best way to treat deadly diseases. This causes them to ignore holistic approaches that involve non-medical expertise (which are often more effective in improving lives).

Halfdan Mahler’s efforts in the 1950s to eradicate tuberculosis in India stemmed from his belief that poor health in that country was driven only by that one disease. In fact, a holistic approach focused on improving _general_ health (diarrhea, child delivery sanitation, and broken bones) would have been more effective. Improving transportation to the hospital is a far more effective way to reduce child mortality than direct investments in doctors, nurses, and new hospitals.

### Causes of the Single Perspective Instinct

Why are we so quick to embrace easy answers and quick fixes?

Because **simple ideas are attractive** : they clarify a complicated and messy world. It also speaks to our own capacity for ego and self-regard: it’s easy to feel powerful when you think you have one idea that explains the whole world

And last but not least, we can thank the media. Th**e 24-hour news cycle is not designed for nuanced analysis of the world** or explaining why ideologies can be flawed.

### Problems Arising From the Single Perspective Instinct

As we’ve seen, the Single Perspective Instinct can be very damaging.

#### Limited Imagination

When you blindly adhere to one idea, you close yourself off to alternatives that might provide better solutions. In the case of political leaders who hold to rigid ideologies, this failure of imagination can have grave consequences for millions of people.

#### Misapplication

As with the (now discarded) advice to put babies to sleep on their stomachs, the Single Perspective Instinct leads us to apply the wrong solutions to the wrong problems. **Just because something works in one scenario doesn’t mean it will work in another.**

### Overcoming the Instinct

To overcome the Single Perspective Instinct, embrace complexity and question your assumptions.

#### Avoid Echo Chambers and Ideologues

Seek out the opinions of people who don’t agree with you. Do they perhaps have knowledge that you don’t that might account for your difference of opinion? Also, avoid the extreme ideologues: history is full of utopians who got a lot of people killed through their Single Perspective Instinct.

#### Look Outside Your Expertise

Don’t assume that the thing you’re good at or that you know the most about is the right tool to use in every situation. If you’re a doctor, look for non-medical solutions. If you’re a socialist, look at how free markets might possibly deliver more benefits in certain situations.

#### Embrace Complexity

Don’t be afraid of a confusing, complicated world. Problems are usually solved on a case-by-case basis through trial-and-error and a blend of ideas.
