## Chapter 6: Spreading from Trendsetters to the Masses

Now that we’ve examined the three principles of pushing potential epidemics to their tipping points, in this chapter we’ll take a further look at how these principles play out in practice. Each epidemic is different and requires a unique approach to get the masses to adopt that particular product or idea, so we’ll discuss how you can **use the Law of the Few to adjust your messaging and make your idea appeal to trendsetters and regular Joes alike.**

### How Ideas Become Epidemics: The Diffusion Model

The diffusion model is a term in sociology for the way a contagious idea or product spreads among people who adopt it at different phases.

  * First, the Innovators take hold. Innovators are a fairly small group of more adventurous people or companies who are willing to take the risk and go out on a limb to try this idea. 
  * Then, the Early Adopters join in. They are also risk-takers, but slightly less so. Early Adopters are respected, thoughtful opinion leaders who observed the Innovators before taking the plunge themselves. 
  * After the Early Adopters, the masses jump on board in two waves: the Early Majority and the Late Majority. These majorities are more cautious and skeptical to try something new until the well-respected Early Adopters test it out. 
  * Finally, the Laggards join just as the swell of the epidemic falls off. Laggards are slow to adopt new innovations because they see no reason to change; why fix what’s not broken?



> **Case Study: Iowa Farmers Try a New Corn Seed**
> 
> The diffusion model is well illustrated in a study of how Iowa farmers adopted a hybrid corn seed in the 1930s. Although this new seed was superior to what farmers were using, it took more than a decade after the seed was introduced before nearly all of the farmers had made the switch.
> 
>   * In the first five years, only a handful of the 259 farmers studied had adopted the new seed. These were the Innovators.
> 
>   * In the sixth year, 16 made the change, then 21 in the following year. These were the Early Adopters, who had seen the Innovators’ success and followed suit.
> 
>   * In the following three years, 36, 61, 46 farmers jumped on board, respectively. These were the Early and Late Majority, who had waited for eight to 10 years after the seed’s introduction before trying it.
> 
>   * In the following years, 36, 14, and finally 3 farmers adopted the new seed. These were the Laggards, who — despite seeing the new seed’s undeniable success in other farmers’ fields — were in no rush to change, even for the better.
> 
> 

> 
> If you graphed the number of farmers adopting the new seed each year, you would see a model epidemic curve that starts gradually, tips with the Early Adopters, climbs dramatically with the Early and Late Majority, and tapers off with the Laggards.

**Different factors come into play each time an idea or product advances to the next group of adopters, because each group’s attitude and reasoning for adoption is different.** Both Innovators and Early Adopters have a revolutionary mindset and are inherently open to innovations that will give them an edge, despite considerable risk.

  * In a market setting, these are small companies who are willing to take big risks and try new ideas or products before they have been proven or before their prices have dropped.



However, before an idea or product moves from the Early Adopters to the Early Majority, a gap must be bridged; the fundamental difference in the visionary attitude of Early Adopters versus the caution of the Early Majority creates a chasm where would-be epidemics can fall off. This is where the Law of the Few becomes critical: **Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen can act as translators to make the seemingly revolutionary actions of the Innovators and Early Adopters attractive to the more mainstream and traditional majorities.**

  * In a market setting, the Early Majority would be the big companies that have a more complex and established workflow that needs to be adjusted to accommodate new innovations. These companies will take the extra time to build safety nets and manage risks if they decide to adopt a new technology.



### Translating Messages, Products, and Services

In general, most people naturally resist change and innovation in favor of what’s familiar, comfortable, and working well enough. A much smaller population (the Innovators and Early Adopters) give an idea or product its kickstart, but the masses ultimately must get on board for an epidemic to take hold. This is where **translation is necessary to make new ideas or products more palatable and bridge the gap between the risk-takers and the rest of us.**

  * (Shortform example: Think of this in terms of fashion trends. Fashion-forward Innovators may start wearing jeans that are totally ripped and shredded. That’s a little extreme for the mainstream shoppers, but translators take it back a notch and wear jeans with smaller holes in the knees, bridging the gap and making the trend more appealing to the majority.)



**Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen each use their strengths differently to translate messages in a way that they take on a deeper meaning to the people receiving the message (thus making it stickier).**

  * As members of so many different worlds, Connectors are able to act as an intermediary in translating ideas from one community to another.
  * Mavens’ extensive knowledge and detailed understanding of (sometimes complex) topics allows them to adeptly explain information to people with less or no expertise. 
  * Salesmen use their nonverbal abilities and ability to connect emotionally with people to make information and ideas more relatable.



> **Case Study: How Airwalk Got Preppy Kids to Wear Skater Shoes**
> 
> A San Diego-based shoe company named Airwalk began producing shoes in the mid-1980s aimed at hard-core skateboaders, but achieved epidemic popularity in the 1990s through an advertising campaign that translated skater fashion trends to mainstream buyers.
> 
> Airwalk’s advertising agency, Lambesis, hired a Maven named DeeDee Gordon to spot social epidemics that were about to tip — from kung-fu movies to interest in Tibet and the Dalai Lama. Gordon contracted a team of Innovators across the country, and regularly checked in with them to find out what music, fashion, television shows, and topics they were interested in. By noting their varied interests over time, then seeing what the mainstream caught onto several months later, she was able to track and forecast trends and ideas that would soon advance from the Innovators and Early Adopters to the Majority.
> 
> Lambesis put a twist on those themes and, just as the trends were hitting mainstream popularity, incorporated them into the shoe ads in a way that appealed to young buyers (e.g. a kung-fu parody where the Airwalk-wearing main character uses his skateboard to fight off the ninja villains). Gordon used her Mavenly knowledge of trends to tap into the public’s interests and translate a niche shoe designed for skateboarders to mainstream popularity.
> 
> Lambesis’s ad campaigns not only rode the wave of these trends, but themselves helped tip these trends into epidemics by translating less accessible ideas into more digestible forms. For example, they took many young adults’ growing interest in the Dalai Lama and the occupation of Tibet and created an ad showing a Tibetan monk cheating on a test by looking at notes he’d scrawled on the sides of his Airwalk shoes. The ads tweaked somewhat obscure trends and translated them into a context that was more familiar to the mainstream.

> **Case Study: Distributing Clean Syringes to Drug Users**
> 
> **Translation can also take the form of an action to spread a product or service, rather than a form of communication to spread a message or idea.** For example, the City of Baltimore distributed clean syringes to inner-city neighborhoods in an effort to combat AIDS, which was spreading through the reuse of dirty needles among drug users. But their effort was limited by a few factors.
> 
>   * A van distributed clean needles in specific locations on certain days of the week. But if drug addicts did not meet this schedule, they missed the opportunity.
> 
>     * Heroin addicts tend to go through a lot of needles, so they were likely to run out of their supply of clean syringes if they only restocked from the van once a week. 
> 

> 
> Researchers who were assessing the program’s success assumed that drug users who were using the program would take a grocery-shopping approach and visit the van during its scheduled stops to stock up on enough needles for the week. Instead they discovered something surprising: A small group of drug users were each grabbing hundreds of clean needles from the van every week, then selling them to addicts in the streets.
> 
> City officials initially had misgivings about this unintended effect, which gave these so-called super-exchangers a way to fund their own drug addictions. However, they soon realized the super-exchangers were acting as translators: They could provide clean needles to addicts around the clock and in any location, responding to the need better than the city could on its limited route and schedule. **The super-exchangers were Connectors, who knew a lot of people in the drug community, and translators, who bridged the divide between the city’s efforts and the drug users’ behavior.**

### Rumors: When Translation Creates Word-of-Mouth Epidemics

**Translation necessarily involves some tweaking or distorting of the original message to make it digestible to the people receiving the message. One form of this is rumors** , which are the most contagious social messages and excellent examples of word-of-mouth epidemics.

Stories and messages undergo a distinct, three-step process when they become rumors. This process of simplifying and distorting happens in the retelling of a story among many people (like in the children’s game, Telephone), as well as in our own recollection of a memory.

  * First, the story is leveled, omitting many of the details and important context of the story. This is the first way the meaning of the original story becomes misconstrued. 
  * Second, the story is sharpened. This is when the details that haven’t been omitted are made more specific and pronounced, further distorting the truth.
  * Third, there is a process of assimilation, altering the story to make it make more sense to the people sharing the rumor. 



> **Case Study: The Rumor That Turned a Chinese Scholar Into a Japanese Spy**
> 
> You can see each step of the rumor process in the evolution of a story about a Chinese teacher taking a vacation in Maine in 1945, just before Japan surrendered to the Allies in World War II. The teacher’s guidebook recommended a viewpoint at the top of a nearby hill, so he stopped in a small town to ask someone for directions to the hilltop. This ignited a rumor among the locals that a Japanese spy was going to the top of the hill to take photos of the region.
> 
>   * Rumor spreaders leveled the original story by dropping the details about the teacher’s courteous, earnest approach, and the fact that his nationality was actually unknown.
> 
>   * The story was sharpened with the assumptions that the man was Japanese, that he was a spy, that his sightseeing was instead an act of espionage, and that he had a camera in his hand instead of a guidebook.
> 
>   * Finally, the story was assimilated to make more sense to the locals: In the context of wartime hostility, it seemed more logical that an Asian man would be an enemy committing espionage than a vacationing scholar interested in sightseeing.
> 
> 

> 
> (Shortform note: The book doesn’t offer any information on the Chinese teacher’s fate or the consequences of the rumor.)
