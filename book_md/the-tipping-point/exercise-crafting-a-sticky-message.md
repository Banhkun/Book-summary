## Exercise: Crafting a Sticky Message

To create an epidemic, you have to be deliberate about how you present your idea and how people receive it. Use this exercise to help identify how you can make your idea sticky and create a context that makes people more open to it.

* * *

Think of a product or idea you are trying to tip into an epidemic. Who is your targeted audience, or whose ideas and behaviors are you trying to influence?

Think about how you have presented your idea so far and how effective your message has been. How might you be able to present your idea differently to make it more memorable and impactful?

What is the context in which your audience is operating, and how is that influencing their current behavior? Consider the environmental and social context.

What could you change about the environmental or social context of the situation to make people more likely to adopt the idea or behavior youâ€™re trying to spread?
