## Exercise: Reflect on Greenblatt’s Investing Strategies

Greenblatt’s special-situation investing is foreign to most investors, whose portfolios are typically managed by professionals in charge of investing funds. In this exercise, reflect on your own investments and consider whether Greenblatt’s approach could complement your portfolio.

* * *

Which stocks comprise your investment portfolio? What was your rationale for investing in these stocks?

Of the special situations that Greenblatt discusses (spinoffs, orphan equities, acquisitions, restructurings, stub stocks, and LEAPS), which would you be _least_ likely to invest in? Why?

Of the special situations that Greenblatt discusses, which would you be _most_ likely to invest in? Why?

In light of your answer to the previous question, find and research one upcoming example of the special situation you would most likely invest in. For instance, this might involve looking at _The Wall Street Journal_ for announcements of future spinoffs or acquisitions. Do you think this situation could provide a lucrative investment opportunity? Why or why not?
