## Exercise: Find a Better Balance Between Your Life and Your Work

Lipsky argues that finding a better work-life balance helps you rest and restore your capacity to care. Apply some of her tips to build healthier habits at home and at work.

* * *

Describe a typical day of work for you. Is your schedule reasonable or overwhelming? Do you have any unhealthy habits at work, such as skipping meals?

What’s one healthier habit you can practice next time you go to work? For example, you might try taking stretch breaks every hour or bringing nutritious snacks.

When the workday’s done, how well do you really “leave” work? Do you still check your work email or respond to client calls after you’ve left the office? Think about one or two things unrelated to work that you can do instead, such as socializing with friends or exercising.

To recover from the pressures of work, Lipsky recommends you practice gratitude more often. Think about one to two things that you’re grateful for—it could be as small as seeing pretty flowers blossoming or smelling your favorite food cooking.

Finally, process any negative emotions that have built up during the workday by being mindful. What’s one activity you can be entirely present in? For example, you might practice being fully aware when you’re gardening or baking.
