## 1-Page Summary

In _Trauma Stewardship_ , Laura van Dernoot Lipsky provides a guide on how to care for others who have gone through trauma by learning to care for ourselves—a practice she calls _trauma stewardship_. Trauma, loss, and suffering are unfortunate, everyday realities: Disadvantaged people struggle to meet basic living needs, natural disasters damage homes, and habitat loss threatens the survival of endangered species. While the effects of trauma are damaging to those who directly suffer from it, there's another group at risk: the caregivers who witness and tend to the trauma of others.

Lipsky argues that to be fully present and emotionally available to people who are suffering, we must acknowledge and address the impact that secondary trauma (the harm we experience when exposed to others’ trauma) has on us and our ability to help others. Lipsky's trauma stewardship framework covers how to manage secondary trauma and support yourself so you can support others to your fullest capacity.

Lipsky is a leading expert in the field of trauma exposure and the founder and director of The Trauma Stewardship Institute, which seeks to raise awareness about the effects of trauma and provide guidance on how to care for those who experience it. She has worked with trauma survivors for over three decades.

In this guide, we’ll first explain what trauma stewardship and secondary trauma are and how they’re related. We’ll also discuss the warning signs of secondary trauma and provide five ways you can replenish your energy and ability to care for others healthily and effectively. Along the way, we’ll provide insights from psychology about trauma and provide actionable advice from other experts on self-care and compassion.

(Shortform note: Lipsky created the term “trauma stewardship” to describe her vision of a healthy and sustainable approach to caring for others. She doesn’t provide a direct definition of trauma, but Bessel van der Kolk defines trauma in _The Body Keeps the Score _as your emotional, neurological, and physiological response to a distressing or disturbing event. Lipsky does, however, explain her reasoning behind the term “stewardship,” which is broadly defined as the responsible caretaking of something entrusted to you. For trauma workers—people like social workers and environmental activists who regularly support people who have trauma—this means being responsible to both others and _themselves_.)

### What Are Trauma Stewardship and Secondary Trauma?

According to Lipsky, practicing trauma stewardship means **tending to your own needs and emotions so that you can fully and compassionately help others who are suffering.** To practice trauma stewardship, we must recognize that trauma takes a mental, physical, and emotional toll on caregivers. Lipsky refers to this toll as your _trauma exposure response_ , also known as secondary trauma. When you're regularly involved with traumatic experiences, the stress and negative emotions can begin to wear on you.

If you lack a proper way to cope, secondary trauma can damage your worldview, quality of life, ability to care for others, and health. Secondary trauma can also lead you to develop emotional defense mechanisms that block your ability to empathize with and care for others. Therefore, to remain healthy, self-care is crucial for anyone who’s immersed in environments of loss, hardship, and pain—healthcare workers, animal rights activists, military personnel, people caring for ill family members, and environmentalists, to name a few.

> **Why Other People’s Pain Affects Us and Tools to Recognize Secondary Trauma**
> 
> If you’re a caregiver, you might worry that thinking about your own needs or admitting that __ you’re also struggling is selfish. However, research supports Lipsky’s assertion that you must take care of yourself to give better care: Witnessing other people’s pain triggers the same parts of your brain that activate when you experience pain firsthand. Some researchers believe we have this ability to mirror other people’s emotional and physical states so we can help reduce their pain. While this allows you to empathize with other people, it also explains why being in traumatic environments for extended periods of time can erode your ability to care for others.
> 
> To better recognize how your exposure to others’ trauma takes a toll on you mentally, physically, and emotionally, consider taking an assessment. Here are three tools that researchers have developed to assess secondary trauma and stress:
> 
> The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS): This consists of a list of 17 statements that you can rate on a scale of one to five, with one meaning “never” and five meaning “very often.” You can use this scale to determine how frequently you experience secondary trauma symptoms.
> 
> The Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Measure: This tool, intended for anyone in a helping profession, measures both the positive and negative effects of your work on your quality of life.
> 
> The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS): This scale contains a list of 43 common life stressors that you can identify and add up to determine how much stress you’re carrying.

Many people who work with trauma have the opportunity to dramatically improve or worsen someone’s life. Lipsky argues that with so much on the line, you must find a healthy middle ground between numbing yourself to other people’s pain and letting it overwhelm you in order to be an effective caregiver. Addressing the effects of secondary trauma allows you to truly be present for others not just physically, but emotionally.

(Shortform note: Some experts believe that we can improve the lives of both trauma sufferers and trauma workers by teaching more workers about vicarious resilience. Vicarious resilience occurs when you grow stronger and more capable of overcoming adversity after witnessing the people, animals, or environment you’re caring for bounce back from hardship. The more trauma workers become aware of this effect, the more likely they are to experience it and give better support. This creates a positive feedback loop: Vicarious resilience leads to better caregiving and successful healing, which leads to more opportunities to develop resilience.)

#### How Secondary Trauma Affects Us

According to Lipsky,**people react differently when exposed to others’ trauma and experience different symptoms of secondary trauma.** It’s important to note, however, that secondary trauma is _normal_. In many lines of work, there’s a damaging belief that self-care is for the weak and that trauma workers should put on a brave face. This suppression of emotions, however, gets in the way of our ability to interact with others honestly and wholeheartedly. Instead, we must acknowledge how trauma affects us to become better listeners, advocates, and supporters.

(Shortform note: Research reveals just how normal secondary trauma is: It affects approximately 40% to 85% of professional trauma workers. So why is the belief in “toughing it out” so prevalent? According to other experts, some organizations perpetuate this harmful belief by praising self-sacrificial behavior, such as when workers refuse to take time off. The expectation of self-sacrifice pressures employees to work harder at the expense of their well-being. Many argue that it should be the organization’s responsibility to _reduce_ workers’ feelings of guilt about self-care, not to intensify them.)

Lipsky writes that three factors influence how we’re exposed to and impacted by the trauma of others:

**Individual experiences** : Your personal history of pain and suffering can affect how you view other people’s hardships, making you more sensitive to some people’s trauma than others. Lipsky stresses that you must learn to view your own traumas as separate from that of others to work with them in a way that’s healthy and effective.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle refers to your history of pain and suffering as your _pain-body_ : The negative energy you carry from all of your painful life experiences. Anything can trigger your pain-body, causing you to feel negative emotions like irritation, anger, or sadness. If you let these emotions control your thoughts, they make you act in unhealthy ways that only deepen your pain, perpetuating a cycle of hurt that affects yourself or others. To free yourself from your past pain, Tolle suggests you observe it without judgment. This helps you recognize that your former pain doesn't have power over how you feel and behave.)

**Workplace environments** : Trauma workers’ environments can increase or decrease how much other people’s trauma affects them. A negative work environment worsens the effects of trauma exposure while a positive environment diminishes them. According to Lipsky, many trauma workers lack the support they need to do their best work, whether it’s a lack of resources or an unreasonable workload. As a result, many have to budget their time and energy and settle for providing minimally adequate care, which Lipsky describes as “service rationing.” This leaves workers feeling tired, unfulfilled, and discouraged.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that organizations can further mitigate the effects of trauma exposure on workers by reducing the amount and severity of trauma they’re exposed to. One way of doing this is having workers alternate between two different types of tasks—the more emotionally-draining tasks and the more emotionally-rewarding tasks. For example, an animal rescuer could take time to socialize and play with the animals in between responding and saving abused animals.)

**Systemic oppression** : Lipsky argues that systemic oppression in our society, or the mistreatment of certain groups as a result of flawed institutions and beliefs, both causes some people to be more susceptible to trauma and hinders our ability to combat trauma. First, since we don’t live in a society of pure equality and justice, certain groups experience trauma more than others. Second, many people share a wider oppressive belief that care is a _burden_ to society, that people should worry about their own lives, and that people get what they deserve. Lipsky argues that this perception of care makes trauma workers feel less supported and receive less support.

(Shortform note: Other experts add that the fact that certain groups are more at risk for trauma than others should influence how trauma workers care for people with different backgrounds. Rather than assume a person’s needs, recognize that people may communicate differently about them or expect different methods of care. Different cultures also have different attitudes toward caregiving that affect how much support caregivers receive. For instance, in Latin America, caregiving for family members is typically seen as virtuous, and the—mostly female—population of caregivers can be a source of cultural pride.)

### Signs of Secondary Trauma

According to Lipsky, people have different responses to trauma exposure, and **you must first understand how secondary trauma affects you so you can better care for others.** Let's look at eight signs that you may be experiencing secondary trauma.

(Shortform note: Lipsky focuses on the negative responses of secondary trauma, but other experts point out that responding to and caring for the trauma of others can also have no impact or even a positive impact. Trauma exposure might have no impact on you if you have resources like coping strategies or support systems that cancel it out. Trauma exposure can have a positive impact if you draw meaning and inspiration from your work.)

#### Sign #1: Feeling Like Your Actions Don't Matter

Lipsky explains that **many people regularly exposed to other people’s trauma develop a sense of helplessness.** A major difficulty when working with trauma sufferers is that the source that causes the trauma rarely goes away. The magnitude of colossal crises such as homelessness or the threat of extinction can feel impossible to combat as an individual and causes people to feel overwhelmed. Thus, carers may feel like they're unable to make a real difference and think that their efforts are never enough.

(Shortform note: Feeling like your actions don’t matter can lead to depression. In _Learned Optimism_ , Martin Seligman discusses how he conducted an experiment where people were told they could press buttons to stop an unpleasant noise. The buttons didn’t work for some subjects, and their inability to silence the noise caused them to exhibit some symptoms of depression like resignation and lethargy. If you think your actions don’t matter, ask someone to say your thoughts out loud—for example, “You can’t do anything to change your circumstances.” Then, practice defending yourself against the thought. Hearing another person express your beliefs can help you view them differently and recognize how unreasonable they might be.)

#### Sign #2: Feeling Angry or Fearful

Lipsky writes that **witnessing the trauma of others can cause you to build up feelings of anger and fear**. She explains that these feelings are natural but that most of us haven’t been taught proper ways to process them. As a result, we often try to suppress them rather than address them—for example, by responding with cynical humor that helps us avoid our feelings rather than understand and work through them.

Fear and anger limit our ability to navigate and approach trauma with nuance and sensitivity because they influence our actions. When we allow fear and anger to continue influencing how we approach new situations, we risk taking those emotions out on others—for example, rather than take productive measures to help others, we might always look for someone to blame or withdraw from situations that make us feel vulnerable.

> **Fear and Anger Narrow Your Sensory Perception**
> 
> Experts explain why fear and anger hinder your ability to react to situations with sensitivity: They trigger your fight or flight response, which constricts your attention and prevents you from being able to fully process all of the sensory input that could help you respond intelligently to sensitive situations and provide quality care. Specifically, when you’re in fight or flight mode, your peripheral vision blurs and you tune out certain noises.
> 
> Sometimes it can be difficult to tell if you're reacting to something due to fear or anger. To help you identify whether you’ve built up these negative emotions, look for physiological symptoms you might be experiencing. When you’re angry, you might experience a rapid heartbeat, tight chest, churning stomach, sweating, and tense muscles. When you’re fearful, you’ll experience a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, sweating, and trembling.

#### Sign #3: Feeling Guilty

According to Lipsky, **another common sign of secondary trauma is feeling guilty about enjoying your life**. If you’re frequently surrounded by people experiencing hardship, you might feel guilty about the good things in your life because you’re aware that many others are suffering. Lipsky writes that this guilt is a sign that you’ve blurred the lines between yourself and others, which can make it harder for you to enjoy the people, things, and experiences you’d otherwise derive happiness from.

(Shortform note: When you feel guilty about the good things in your life, you’re experiencing happiness guilt, which is similar to survivor’s guilt (the guilt you feel when you survived a traumatic event when others didn’t). Experts say that happiness guilt is a “meta-emotion”—an emotion you have in response to another emotion (in this case, happiness). Not allowing yourself to feel certain emotions can lead to negative feelings and depressive symptoms. Instead, embrace your happiness by taking time to celebrate, and use it for good by letting it energize you at work.)

#### Sign #4: Feeling Constant Exhaustion

According to Lipsky, another sign that you may be experiencing secondary trauma is that **your physical, emotional, and mental reserves are always drained**. In fact, many have the misconception that putting in good work means that you _should_ be exhausted at the day’s end. Often, this belief causes people to accept unreasonable workloads or responsibilities. However, Lipsky argues that this self-sacrificial way of thinking makes it harder to provide quality care. When you push yourself past your limits, the quality of your work decreases as you lack the energy to navigate traumatic environments with sensitivity and care.

(Shortform note: The constant physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion of secondary trauma can be thought of as burnout. In _Burnout_ , Amelia and Emily Nagoski define burnout as a state of exhaustion caused by excessive stress, in which you feel inadequate and struggle to care about things or connect with other people. They add that women often experience burnout because patriarchal societies expect them to devote time and energy to supporting others in addition to supporting themselves.)

#### Sign #5: Struggling to Detach From Work

Lipsky states that **people who work regularly with trauma sufferers often find it hard to leave work when the day is done.** The cause and the people you’re helping feel too important to detach for even a minute. However, when you become overly focused on your job, Lipsky explains, you neglect the aspects of your life that are equally important, such as your relationships and your health. Let’s look at four ways work can become all-consuming.

  * **You become hypervigilant of danger:** People experiencing secondary trauma often remain in a hyper-alert state to try to anticipate threats and prevent anything bad from happening. 
  * **You experience moments of dissociation:** You regularly tune out of the present moment and lose track of what you’re doing because you’re recalling a traumatic event.
  * **Work becomes your source of self-worth:** You become obsessed with your work because helping others and making a difference makes you feel like _you’re_ important.
  * **You avoid everything:** When work becomes so draining, some people grow to dread it and try to avoid it entirely. You might wish an excuse would come up so you don’t have to show up to work. Lipsky argues that avoidance can become a habit: You might feel like your personal life is just as draining as your work and start to isolate yourself from family, friends, and positive activities. 



> **How Struggling to Detach From Work Harms Your Health and Relationships**
> 
> Trauma work is often very stressful, and if you struggle to detach from your work, the excessive stress can take a serious toll on your health. In _Mind Over Medicine,_ Lissa Rankin argues that when you don’t give your body the time to rest and repair, stress can affect your health in a number of ways: It can damage your blood vessels, increase your risk of heart attacks, weaken your immune system, and lead to muscle strain and stiffness. In fact, she cites a study revealing that people who don’t take annual vacations had a 21% higher risk of dying from any cause and an increased risk of cancer.
> 
> Additionally, the symptoms of overwork are similar to the symptoms of trauma. In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk describes some common symptoms of trauma, and by examining them, we can get a better understanding of how overwork affects trauma workers.
> 
> **Hypervigilance:** Van der Kolk argues that trauma causes hypervigilance because it’s so overwhelming that the brain separates the event into pieces—into sounds, sights, emotions, or sensations. After the event is over, your brain remains hypersensitive to threats, and a particular and otherwise harmless sound might trigger your brain. This can make it hard to relax and connect with other people.
> 
> **Dissociation:** People exposed to trauma dissociate to protect themselves from negative feelings and sensations. This becomes a problem, van der Kolk argues, as regularly tuning out can cause you to lose a sense of self and make it harder to manage your emotions. For example, you might struggle to relieve tension in your body if you don’t recognize that it’s your stress that’s causing it.
> 
> **Obsession:** People who have suffered trauma (and likely those exposed to it) sometimes become addicted to it, actively seeking out stress to crowd out other feelings like boredom or anxiety. Repeating or engaging with that trauma, however, only leads to more feelings of pain and fixation.
> 
> **Avoidance:** While Lipsky discusses avoidance as a result of feeling overwhelmed by work, van der Kolk adds that people who have experienced trauma also avoid social settings because they feel unable to be understood. Interacting with others, then, becomes exhausting as they constantly view others as threats.

#### Sign #6: Struggling to See Nuance

Lipsky writes that**trauma exposure can cause people to view people and situations in simplistic ways and develop polarized opinions**. When trauma work leaves you drained mentally and physically, you lack the capacity to consider things deeply and from different perspectives. This might lead you to see things only in black-and-white or label things and people as “good” or “bad.” Lipsky explains that while some trauma sufferers adopt this generalized way of thinking to feel a sense of certainty and security about themselves and their environment, this way of thinking can prevent you, as a caregiver, from navigating situations with sensitivity and without judgment.

Beyond diminishing your capacity for complex thought, secondary trauma reduces your ability to think creatively, which in turn impacts your ability to come up with innovative solutions and make good decisions. According to Lipsky, this is because you can only be creative and entertain many possible options when you’re relaxed. However, the more you get wound up in the trauma of others, the harder it is to relax.

> **How Our Threat Response Affects Complex and Creative Thinking**
> 
> Psychologists refer to the inability to view situations and people in a nuanced way as _dichotomous thinking_ and suggest that it emerged as a part of our fight or flight response. In early human history, we had to be able to quickly label something as threatening or nonthreatening so that we could launch into an appropriate response. People who have gone through trauma, Bessel van der Kolk explains, have brains that are hypersensitive to threats, and they tend to misjudge things as immediate threats. Given this, it’s all the more important for caregivers to avoid dichotomous thinking and approach situations with nuance so they can better help trauma sufferers.
> 
> In terms of creative ability, some psychologists paint a more nuanced picture, arguing that trauma can make some people unable to access their creativity, but others can use their creativity as a way of healing. While trauma can affect creativity in different ways, it ultimately prevents people from expressing themselves with authenticity and vulnerability, which is why healing trauma is an important step to restoring their authentic creativity.

#### Sign #7: Struggling to Be Compassionate

According to Lipsky,**people who regularly work with suffering and loss become desensitized to it.** They no longer feel emotionally moved by the pain experienced by others. This desensitization makes it harder for them to be compassionate listeners. Instead of listening with an open mind, they might compare the hardships of different people and minimize those that are less severe. This subconscious act prevents them from giving the same compassion and attention to all people in need of support.

(Shortform note: Beyond desensitization, another symptom of secondary trauma, the silencing response, also hinders a caregiver’s ability to show compassion. This occurs when caregivers try to avoid feeling distressing emotions by unintentionally silencing those they’re caring for. Rather than being unaffected by other people’s painful experiences, they feel overwhelmed by them and close off their ability to listen as a coping mechanism. This response manifests in different ways, causing trauma workers to change topics, minimize situations with humor, and struggle to pay attention.)

#### Sign #8: Struggling With Addiction

Lipsky explains that **many people experiencing secondary trauma also struggle with addictions**. She elaborates that trauma workers often turn to drinking alcohol, playing video games, or overworking themselves to avoid coping with difficult feelings they’ve developed from their trauma work. These distractions, however, are only temporary and, over time, deplete their ability to cope with emotions and be present when helping others.

(Shortform note: In _Dopamine Nation_ , Anna Lembke explains why addiction is a common coping mechanism: Your brain uses the same parts to process both pain and pleasure, so you can only feel one or the other at a time. As a result, when people do immediately pleasurable activities (like drinking or video games), they don’t feel pain. However, Lembke argues that the brain is always seeking balance, so each time you repeat that pleasurable experience, it brings you less pleasure because your suppressed pain has been building up. When you stop doing that pleasurable activity, you experience discomfort that drives you to resume it. When you keep relying on an activity to relieve pain, you become addicted to it.)

### Practice Self-Care to Practice Trauma Stewardship

Now that we’ve discussed the signs of secondary trauma, let’s discuss how you can practice trauma stewardship to manage this type of trauma. To be more reliable, accessible, and effective for the people, animals, or environment that you’re tending to, Lipsky says you must **practice self-reflection and self-care.** Since secondary trauma results from you internalizing or “taking on” the pain of others, you must focus on healing yourself from within—by addressing your _own_ needs, feelings, and intentions with mindfulness.

(Shortform note: While Lipsky argues for the importance of self-care for trauma workers specifically, Steven Covey argues that people of all professions should take care of themselves to maintain their capacity to do good work. In _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Covey says you must take care of your well-being in four ways: physically (by eating well, exercising, and sleeping enough); spiritually (by meditating or spending time in nature); mentally (by learning new information); as well as socially and emotionally (by seeking mutually-beneficial relationships and collaborating with others). He adds that maintaining your health allows you to improve your efficiency and grow not only in your work, but in your overall life.)

Lipsky provides five strategies for practicing self-care to be a better trauma steward:

#### Strategy #1: Make Time for Reflection

According to Lipsky, the first step of embracing a more mindful approach to trauma care is to **regularly reflect on your needs, motivations, and emotions**. You can do this by setting aside a small window of time in the morning for reflection. You can also practice meditation and breathing exercises.

Lipsky explains that understanding ourselves is key to processing the effects that secondary trauma has on us. Often, we get so caught up in our daily routines and work stresses that we lose connection to our personal needs and the reasons why we wanted to help others in the first place. This can cause us to feel like we have no control or options in our lives when we really do.

(Shortform note: In _Who Will Cry When You Die?_ , Robin Sharma recommends you reflect on your purpose every morning and at the end of each day to be more connected to your personal needs, purpose, and motivations. He argues that thinking about your purpose every morning allows you to eliminate unnecessary obligations from your schedule. Every night, Sharma suggests you reflect on your purpose by writing about any lessons and experiences you had during the day. This helps you assess whether you’re living according to your purpose so that you can better adjust your mindset and actions tomorrow.)

When you practice reflection, ask yourself: “What is my reason for doing what I’m doing?” This question helps you realize that trauma doesn’t control you and that you have a choice in what to focus on when working with trauma. Lipsky recommends you discuss your reasons with people you trust or write them down as a reminder for the future. As you reflect on your reasons, consider whether continuing in your current work is good for your health. It’s possible that the work you do may no longer be in your best interest if it’s negatively impacting your well-being.

(Shortform note: Beyond posing yourself questions or discussing your reasons with others, consider visualizing a personal wellness meter to regularly assess your needs and determine whether your work has become harmful to your well-being. Imagine your meter has a green zone, a yellow zone, and a red zone, with green meaning you’re at your best and red meaning you’re distressed and overwhelmed. Picture in detail how it might look and imagine putting it on a dock that tells you how much stress and trauma you experienced during the entire workday.)

One reason many people engage in trauma work, Lipsky explains, is a desire for _trauma mastery_ —a coping mechanism to recapture a sense of control that they didn’t have during a past traumatic experience. For example, you might work in the medical field if you had lost a loved one to illness when you were younger.

If trauma mastery is part of the reason you pursue your line of work, Lipsky advises that you **seek support and healing for your original trauma** so you don’t use your work as the main way to cope with your trauma. People with personal stakes tied to their work, she argues, might put an unhealthy amount of pressure on themselves. One way you can better understand how to manage your desire for trauma mastery while working with the trauma of others is by studying how others have dealt with their personal trauma while involved in trauma work.

(Shortform note: The urge to reengage with your past trauma is called _repetition compulsion_. According to psychologists, this compulsion happens when you’re unable to resolve or heal your former trauma. This causes some trauma survivors to want to repeat similar situations and causes others to engage in trauma work as a way to regain a sense of control. Pursuing trauma mastery can be damaging because repeating traumatic events rarely leads to a feeling of mastery and only increases your exposure to trauma. However, certain variations of reenactment, like telling stories about a deceased loved one, may have positive effects for coping with the trauma of the loss.)

#### Strategy #2: Focus on the Positives

When exposed to trauma, you might feel overwhelmed by how bad situations seem and how little control you have over them. However, Lipsky argues that you can **restore your sense of agency by** **deliberately choosing to focus on the positives rather than negatives** —on what you _can_ do instead of what you _can't_. This practice reminds you that you have a choice in every moment and allows you to reframe situations in healthier ways and take productive action. When you regularly choose to focus on positive things, it becomes easier to notice the positives. Lipsky cautions, though, that reframing situations to see their upsides doesn’t mean _suppressing_ your negative emotions.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor writes that learning to see the positives during challenging moments allows you to grow and become more resilient. Seeing the positives doesn’t mean ignoring problems or your feelings; rather, you’re choosing to notice the good that’s there _alongside_ the problems. To do this, Achor recommends making a short list of what makes you happy or grateful every day or writing about a positive experience.)

To take control of your focus, Lipsky offers a few suggestions:

**Focus on your resources.** When you feel overwhelmed or distressed, think about the sources of support and comfort you have in your life—the memories you’ve had, the people you know, or the places you’ve visited that you associate with peace and calm. For example, you might imagine your favorite reading nook or your pet. When you direct your awareness to your resources, you draw your attention away from what’s distressing you. This allows you to snap yourself out of your panic and calm your nervous system.

(Shortform note: While Lipsky advises you to think about the resources you have in your life, you can also think about anything that makes you happy—what Rhonda Byrne calls “thought lifters.” In _The Secret_ , Byrne adds a layer of specificity to Lipsky’s suggestions on how to redirect your focus in stressful moments: First, make a list of thought lifters, such as cute animals or a beautiful sunset. When you’re feeling negative emotions, close your eyes and smile for at least a minute. Then, concentrate on a thought lifter and how it makes you feel, and move down the list until you’re feeling better.)

**Make a Plan B.** Create an alternative vision of your life, whether it involves a shift in your career, a move to a different location, or an entirely new lifestyle. When you consider alternative options, you recognize that you have a life outside of your work and that you always have the freedom to choose how you want to live it.

(Shortform note: In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans suggest you plan out three different lives to remind yourself that there are multiple paths to happiness and fulfillment. Your first plan should be the life you’re currently living. Your second plan should be what you would do if your current line of work disappeared. Your third plan should be what you’d do if money or the opinions of others didn’t matter. To create each plan, write a short title and a timeline containing the experiences and activities you’d like to enjoy. By having multiple plans, you might better recover a sense of control over your life.)

#### Strategy #3: Find a Supportive Community

According to Lipsky, **a supportive community can help you rebuild your ability to be compassionate toward yourself and others.** This community could be the members of your gardening club, your group of gaming friends, or your hiking partners—all that matters is that they support your growth and encourage you to be a better person.

A community helps you restore your compassion because its members validate your feelings and help you navigate your unhealthy habits. When others are nonjudgmental and supportive toward you, you begin to view your own feelings and struggles in the same light. This self-compassion, in turn, makes you more able to understand people you both agree and disagree with and treat them without judgment or malice. This compassionate approach, she argues, is necessary when working with people in pain or crisis.

> **The Components and Benefits of a Support System**
> 
> Other experts weigh in on what makes a group supportive and what benefits can come from having a support system. In _Burnout_ , Amelia and Emily Nagoski write that a supportive relationship should be one in which both parties display empathy and share attention equally. Beyond increasing your compassion, regularly connecting with and being close with others has additional benefits: It can lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and stress, while elevating your mood.

> Lipsky points out that a supportive group can make you more compassionate, but the authors of _Burnout_ offer a way you can practice self-compassion and be nonjudgmental of yourself when others aren’t around: Pretend an imaginary friend is telling you about the worries you’re having. This allows you to view and respond to your thoughts from a distance similarly to how the members of a supportive group might.

#### Strategy #4: Create a Healthy Work-Life Balance

While laboring until complete exhaustion and dedicating every second of time to your cause might feel like the best way to make a difference, Lipsky argues that this is not the case. To properly care for others, she argues, you must**take a healthier approach to your work—one in which you give yourself time and space to rest and renew.**

(Shortform note: While Lipsky encourages finding balance and establishing hard boundaries between yourself and your work, Kim Scott argues that you should _integrate your work and life_ instead. In _Radical Candor,_ she explains that a balance implies that work takes energy from your personal life while taking personal time drains the energy you devote to work. Integration, on the other hand, means that your work life and your personal life enhance one another—you devote yourself to work so you can better relax at home, and you relax at home so you can better devote yourself to your work.)

Lipsky offers several tips for how to create a healthier work-life balance:

**Encourage healthier work habits.** Reflect on whether your work schedule is reasonable and consider how you can better care for the well-being of you and your coworkers. For example, make commitments with your coworkers to take breaks for lunch instead of eating in front of your computers.

(Shortform note: To determine whether your work schedule is reasonable, pause and pay attention to your feelings. Often, trauma workers are so busy that they don’t have time to reflect on how overburdened they are. When you pause and tune into your emotions, any negative feelings that you have might point to what’s currently not working for you at your job, such as an unreasonable workload or schedule. Then, you can reconsider your priorities and implement changes to how you work.)

**Take your mind off work.** Reflect on your daily routine and identify times when you can disengage from work and check in with your needs and feelings—for example, while you’re boiling a cup of tea. Additionally, build up your life outside of work by engaging in new hobbies, interacting with supportive people, and making a conscious effort not to check your devices. By taking time to recharge your physical and emotional batteries, you’ll be more effective when you’re at work.

(Shortform note: To prevent your work from seeping into your personal life, experts suggest you create a starting and ending routine to help you transition into and out of work. Establish an activity to do every day before work, such as getting in a quick exercise or meditation session, that signals your brain that it’s time for work. Then, before you leave work, create a wrap-up routine, such as reviewing and closing your to-do list, that reminds you to intentionally detach from work once your routine is done.)

**Practice gratitude.** Even during routine tasks like microwaving a meal, recognize opportunities to express your gratitude. Negative emotions like irritation and disappointment are natural when you're exposed to suffering. While valid, harboring these emotions can harm your well-being and hinder your work. By practicing more gratitude, you can increase your resilience and make work feel more fulfilling rather than draining.

(Shortform note: While Lipsky writes that you can always identify something to be grateful for, some say it's perfectly acceptable not to be grateful all the time. If you suppress your negative emotions and force yourself to be grateful, you succumb to toxic positivity—the belief that you should be positive no matter what. Some studies show that gratitude reduces depressive and anxious symptoms less than once believed. Experts suggest you practice gratitude if it works for you, but focus on improving your well-being in other ways if it doesn't.)

**Process your pain and emotions.** To approach your work in a healthier way, acknowledge and find a way to process your negative emotions. Lipsky explains that people who do trauma work often absorb the pain and suffering of others. However, if you hold on to these feelings, your mental, emotional, and physical health will suffer. To process your emotions, Lipsky recommends you practice mindful activities—ones in which you’re focused on the present moment—such as meditation, physical exercise, creative hobbies, or going out into nature. When you practice mindful activities, you allow yourself space to think about, acknowledge, and release negative energy instead of letting them build up inside you.

(Shortform note: Repressing negative emotions may be just as harmful as holding onto them. Both approaches result in greater emotional pain. According to physician Gabor Maté, when we repress our emotions, we prevent ourselves from being able to recognize how much stress we’re under. In _When the Body Says No_ , he elaborates that stress causes various diseases including cancer, and if we’re unable to recognize the stress we’re under, we remain susceptible to more illnesses. Like Lipsky, Maté advises you to acknowledge all feelings, not just positive ones, and tune in to your body for signs of stress such as a fast heart rate, excessive sweating, headaches or back pain, or digestion problems.)

#### Strategy #5: Create a Daily Practice

To engage in sustainable and fulfilling trauma work in the _long term_ , **make mindfulness a daily habit and regularly practice the four strategies for self-care.** According to Lipsky, the more you connect with yourself, the more aware you become of your resources and autonomy, and the more motivation you have to do the work that you do.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness offers health and work benefits that support Lipsky's suggestion to make it a daily practice. Some researchers suggest that mindfulness reduces your stress, improves your immune functioning, enhances your working memory and focus, and helps you better manage fear and other emotions. Some studies on therapists have shown that mindfulness increased their ability to empathize, show compassion to themselves and others, and practice more effective counseling.)

To make mindful self-care a regular practice, Lipsky offers two suggestions:

**Set a daily goal.** At the start of each day, identify a small goal you want to accomplish, such as eating healthier snack options or practicing more conscious breathing. According to Lipsky, identifying a daily goal gives you a sense of control, reminding you that the stress or the situations you encounter at work don’t determine your day— _you_ do.

(Shortform note: If you decide you want to do one of your daily goals _every_ day, turn it into a tiny habit: a small behavior that you work into your routine. In _Tiny Habits_ , BJ Fogg writes that to make a tiny habit, you need an anchor (a behavior you already do regularly, like refilling your water bottle), a small behavior you will do after your anchor, and then a celebration to complete it. For example, if your daily goal is to practice more conscious breathing, your tiny habit might be: After I sit down at my desk, I will take five mindful breaths and then give myself a thumbs up. Fogg explains that the ideal tiny habit should take less than 30 seconds to do.)

**Set mindfulness reminders.** Consider setting alarms on your phone, scheduling small parts of your day, or creating specific triggers to be mindful (like every time you enter a new location). Lipsky explains that being present in our daily activities can be difficult to achieve—urgent deadlines might make us irritated at a slower team member or you might be distracted by an upcoming social outing with friends. By setting reminders, you can be mindful more regularly, which allows you to think and approach your work with intentionality and control.

(Shortform note: If you find yourself ignoring the reminders you set for yourself, consider partnering up with a self-care buddy at work who can hold you accountable to your mindfulness goals. Arrange for specific times you will check in with each other, share your feelings, talk about your challenges, and celebrate your successes.)
