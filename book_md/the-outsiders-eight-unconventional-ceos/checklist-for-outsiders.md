## Checklist for Outsiders

Here’s a 10-step checklist for outsiders:

  1. The CEO should lead capital allocation decisions, not delegate them to advisers or employees.
  2. Determine the hurdle rate—the minimum return necessary to approve a project. The hurdle rate should generally exceed the cost of capital (usually in the midteens or higher).
  3. For all investment options available, calculate returns and risk profiles. Higher-risk projects should have higher returns to compensate. 
     * Keep it simple—understand the key assumptions of the project that drive returns. Be conservative.
     * Be cautious about calling a project “strategic”—it often means “low return.”
  4. Make sure you calculate the return for stock buybacks. This should be the hurdle for all acquisitions.
  5. Make sure you calculate after-tax returns, since different projects may have different tax properties. Consult tax counsel.
  6. Determine acceptable cash and debt levels for the company. Do not stray outside these margins of safety.
  7. Consider decentralizing your management. How can you reduce staff at corporate headquarters? 
  8. Retain earnings only if you have projects that clear your hurdle rate. Otherwise, consider a buyback or paying dividends (always being mindful of taxes).
  9. If prices are high, consider selling businesses or stock. 
  10. Close struggling business units if they are unable to produce acceptable returns.
