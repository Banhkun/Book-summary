## Chapter 6: Bill Stiritz and Ralston Purina

Ralston Purina was a consumer packaged goods company producing commercial animal feed, consumer pet food, and human foods. When Stiritz joined as CEO in 1981, Ralston had a muddled focus (having purchased a hockey team and ski resort) and a stagnant stock price. Stiritz revitalized the company with discipline, divesting unprofitable business units and acquiring new genuinely synergistic businesses. In 2001, Ralston merged with Nestle in a transaction worth $10.4 billion.

### Performance

From 1981 to 2001, Ralston showed a 20.0% annual return rate, compared to 14.7% for the S&P 500 and 17.7% for peer companies.

$1 invested at the beginning would have been worth $38 by 2001. This outperformed the S&P by 2.5 times, and his peers by 50%.

### History

In the 20th century, consumer packaged goods companies like Heinz and Kellogg largely moved together as a pack. They were considered stable blue-chip stocks, paying out dividends and resisting recessions. During the 1960s and 1970s, they acquired aggressively in pursuit of synergy and vertical integration, ending up in industries like restaurants and agriculture.

Ralston Purina had done the same. With its core in agricultural feed, it had ended up with broad interests in a fast food chain (Jack in the Box), crop farms, a hockey team (the St. Louis Blues), and a ski resort. In 1980, when CEO Hal Dean stepped down, its stock price was the same as a decade prior.

During the board’s search for CEO, an internal executive Bill Stiritz submitted an **unsolicited plan for revitalizing the company—sell businesses that were performing poorly, and reorganize the company around its high-margin consumer brands**. The board director read the plan and knew it was the right direction. Stiritz got the job.

Stiritz had spent his early career at Pillsbury as a field rep and at an advertising agency. This would provide on-the-ground experience in both distribution and marketing. In 1964, at 30 years old, he joined Ralston Purina in the consumer products division (pet foods and cereals), considered one of the weakest divisions of the company. He introduced still-famous brands Purina Puppy and Cat Chow, and, during his time in the division, its profits increased 50-fold.

Unlike other outsider CEOs, Stiritz had been an insider at the company for over a decade. But he brought an unconventional plan that deviated from competitors. He knew that the consumer brands had attractive economics (high margins, low capital requirements), and focusing on this core would propel Ralston to new heights of profitability. When he became CEO in 1981, he implemented his plan decisively.

First, **he sold the non-core businesses** such as Jack in the Box, the hockey team, and the agricultural operations.

Then he **made two large acquisitions** —Continental Baking (including Twinkies and Wonder Bread) and Energizer Battery, totaling over $2.2 billion and 30% of Ralston’s market capitalization. **Both businesses had languished under their previous owners, due to neglect or insufficient skillset.** Ralston quickly improved its performance by improving marketing (launching the Energizer bunny campaign), improving distribution, launching new product lines, and reducing costs. Over their lifetime at the company, Energizer would generate 21% annualized returns, and Continental 13%.

Over the 1980s, he continued executing the plan, adding acquisitions that would strengthen the consumer brand core while divesting businesses that could not generate sufficient returns. The company’s financial metrics improved considerably—return on equity increased from 15% to 37%, and pre-tax profit margins increased from 9% to 15%.

In the 1990s, he continued focusing the company. He spun-off smaller brands like Chex cereals into a new company, Ralcorp, and he sold the last of the agricultural operations to DuPont.

His last two moves were defining moments:

  * In 2000, he spun off Energizer Holdings, which then represented 15% of Ralston’s enterprise value. This left Ralston with a sole focus on pet food.
  * In 2001, he negotiated a sale of Ralston to Nestle for $10.4 billion, or 14-times cash flow.



With this done, Stiritz had turned around a stagnating company, made it the dominant player in consumer goods, and returned considerable value to shareholders.

### Management Practices

#### Analytical Approach

Stiritz took a quantitative approach to management. A poker player in his youth, he saw capital allocation like poker—read the table, calculate odds, and know when to bet big when you’re likely to win. He would use his quantitative approach in capital allocation, such as deciding between repurchasing shares and conducting an acquisition, based on return on investment.

He saw analysis as critical to independent thinking, particularly in the CEO position. He felt that CEOs who lacked an analytical mindset (for instance, if they came from areas like marketing or legal) were handicapped in their role.

#### Focus on Core

Stiritz’s first focus was on improving the high-margin, low-capital-requirement consumer businesses. He exited businesses that were once critical but had become commoditized, such as agricultural feed, while reinvesting in its key consumer brands.

This generated cash flow to use to raise debt, buy back stock, and make acquisitions.

#### Use of Debt

Stiritz was fond of using leverage to achieve higher returns on equity. This followed the leveraged buyout practices of private equity firms, but it was an unorthodox move for packaged goods companies, which preferred having conservative balance sheets. Over his tenure, he kept an average debt-to-cash flow ratio of 2.6, compared to 1.7 for his competitors.

#### Share Repurchases

Buying back shares was controversial in the 1980s, since it meant shrinking the company or admitting that there were no worthwhile investments to make. Instead, Stiritz used buybacks as a yardstick for return on investment—if an acquisition or internal investment could beat the return on buying back shares, it was worth doing. As with other outsider CEOs, most shares were purchased when company stock was at low P/E ratios.

#### Acquisition Strategy

Stiritz focused on companies that could be reinvigorated by Ralston’s expertise in marketing, product development, and distribution. **He liked companies that had been neglected by their previous owners** , such as Continental Baking and Energizer.

When purchasing companies, Stiritz preferred to negotiate through direct contact, not with investment bankers, whom he considered parasitic. He would often show up alone to meetings where the opposition was staffed with a row of advisers.

#### Unconventional Financial Analysis

Like Malone at TCI, Stiritz rejected the conventional metrics of the day, such as reported earnings and book value. Instead, he focused on more meaningful metrics like EBITDA and internal rate of return, both of which had gained early acceptance among private equity investors.
