## 1-Page Summary

The author, a founder of an investment firm, studied companies that outperformed their peers and the larger market over extended periods of time. He ended with eight CEOs and companies with standout performance in the latter half of the 20th century. Looking deeper into their management practices, he found **virtually identical patterns to their management style** that were unorthodox but directly caused their outsized results. These CEOs and their management practices are the subject of _The Outsiders_.

The author found uncannily strong patterns among the outsider CEOs that distinguished them from typical CEOs. This concerned three areas:

  1. Their approach to capital allocation
  2. Their management practices
  3. Their personality traits



In all three areas, outsider CEOs departed from common wisdom about how to operate a company and behave as a CEO.

This departure from conventional thinking makes logical sense. **By doing the same things as everyone else, you’re restricted to average performance. You need to do unorthodox things to get unorthodox results.**

### Capital Allocation

In general, CEOs have to do two things to succeed:

  1. Run operations efficiently to generate cash.
  2. Deploy the cash productively.



Most CEOs and most management books focus on the former. In contrast, Henry Singleton of Teledyne and the other outsider CEOs in the book focused on the latter. Rather than seeing themselves as company operators, the **outsider CEOs saw themselves as investors and capital allocators first and foremost**.

Despite the importance of capital allocation, little training is devoted to it. Business schools don’t feature capital allocation in curricula, and CEOs are promoted from functional roles (like product or marketing) without strong experience with investment in the business. Outsider CEOs saw it as their core job.

#### How do outsider CEOs deploy capital differently?

As a baseline, businesses can deploy cash in five basic ways—invest in the existing business, acquire other businesses, pay dividends to shareholders, pay down debt, or buy back stock. They can also raise money by issuing debt or raising equity. These are all tools in capital allocation, and the specific usage of these tools determines a company’s performance.

How to decide between these options? Universally, outsider CEOs were rational—**they calculated the return on each investment project, then made the most profitable choice**. They ignored conventional wisdom and what their peers were doing.

Compared to their peers, outsider CEOs tended to allocate capital differently:

  * They aggressively **bought back company stock** when it was cheap (for instance, when price-to-earnings ratio was in single digits). This would increase earnings per share and, consequently, price per share.
  * They **rarely issued shares** to raise funds, preferring to avoid dilution.
  * They **rarely issued dividends** , seeing this as a tax-inefficient way of rewarding shareholders. Dividends are essentially taxed twice, first as corporate tax on earnings, then as personal tax on capital gains.
  * They were judicious about acquisitions. They didn’t acquire companies out of empire-building ego, with little care for cost. Instead, they **bought companies only when it was a good deal** ; many had hard rules for what to buy, for instance based on a maximum P/E ratio or projected rate of return. 
  * This didn’t mean timidness—outsider CEOs were capable of **making large, bet-the-company acquisitions** when they felt it was a high-probability bet. Every CEO in the book made an acquisition worth at least 20% of their company’s enterprise value.



Outsider CEOs thought about their companies as investors and made cool, rational decisions based on what provided the best returns. **Ego and a desire to build empires were never part of the decision.**

In contrast, typical CEOs issued shares to fund costly acquisitions, preferred not to buy back stock or raise debt, and paid dividends frequently. In the conglomerate era, they aggressively acquired companies believing they could improve profits through scale or synergies; this was often a mirage that never materialized. All these activities tend to result in lower performance by the author’s favorite metric—price-per-share.

Note that the optimal choices vary from company to company, from industry to industry, and between different time periods. **The point is not to blindly mirror what the outsider CEOs did—it’s to examine all of the tools in your toolkit, and choose the best one based on rational analysis.**

### Management Practices

Beyond capital allocation decisions, the outsider CEOs ran their businesses in unorthodox ways.

#### Decentralization

In their management of people and business units, outsider CEOs were relentlessly decentralized. They hired entrepreneurial operators for their business lines and left them alone. They kept a skeleton staff at headquarters, which reduced overhead and anxiety about office politics—the way to get ahead in the company was to outperform in your business unit.

Examples:

  * Teledyne employed over 40,000 people but had fewer than 50 at its headquarters.
  * Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway rarely expects managers of his portfolio companies to contact him unless they have questions.



In contrast, typical companies tend to bulk up headquarters, featuring layers of vice presidents and MBAs. Not only does this increase overhead, but it also encourages office politics.

Decentralization also came in the form of spin-offs and tracking stocks. Instead of being buried within a large conglomerate, spin-offs gave individual business units more autonomy and better-aligned incentives with management.

#### Frugality

To outsider CEOs, cash was vital to the business, since it could be redeployed in their capital allocation strategies. Therefore, **outsider CEOs cut operating expenses to a minimum**. They avoided typical corporate perks like private cars and airline seats and kept headcount lean and efficient. When they acquired companies, they instilled this lean culture into the new company.

#### Focus on Cash Flow

Outsider CEOs resisted focusing on reported earnings, which present a muddled reflection of company performance because of capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other accounting artifacts. Instead, they focused on cash flow and then-innovative metrics like EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). This affected their operations deeply, from how they financed acquisitions to their compensation schemes for employees.

This relentless focus on cash flow also allowed them to avoid counterproductive distractions, such as costly acquisitions for the sake of growth that would later prove unprofitable.

#### Focus on Shareholder Returns

Typical CEOs let their egos get involved in strategic decisions. They enjoy empire building, growing revenue and headcount without concern for profit or long-term outcomes.

In contrast, **outsider CEOs focused on shareholder value as their top priority**. Having low egos, they didn’t hesitate to shrink the size of the company if it meant better returns to shareholders. For instance, Henry Singleton of Teledyne actively spun out businesses, believing they would independently perform better than under one large umbrella. This reduced the size of Teledyne but improved total shareholder performance.

#### Minimal Interaction with Investors

**Outsider CEOs saw investor relations as a waste of time.** They spent little time talking to Wall Street and managing expectations. Instead, they preferred to spend their time on the business. Most of the companies were situated outside the financial Northeast, in places like Omaha and Denver, where they would be insulated from the conventional wisdom of Wall Street.

#### No Particular Stroke of Luck

Outsider CEOs outperformed because of how they managed their businesses, not because of idiosyncratic strokes of luck, like intellectual property advantages or groundbreaking new ideas. Other than management, they didn’t have any discernible advantages over their peers, and so their outsized performance can be attributed directly to their management and capital allocation strategies.

In contrast, some high-profile CEOs like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg had highly unusual circumstances. They had powerful new ideas taking advantage of technology trends, and they executed the ideas relentlessly. These situations are unlike those facing most business managers, and so lessons of a Steve Jobs or Zuckerberg are rarely generalizable to the business community at large.

#### Strong COOs as Partners

Among outsider CEOs, there was a pattern of having COOs who focused on day-to-day operations, while the CEO focused on long-term strategy and capital allocation. In essence, **the COO generated the free cash flow, and the CEO spent it**.

Examples:

  * Capital Cities Broadcasting: Tom Murphy was CEO and the capital allocator. Dan Burke was COO and managed their media stations.
  * Teledyne: Henry Singleton was CEO and the capital allocator. George Roberts was President and enforced results at its portfolio companies.
  * Washington Post: Katharine Graham was CEO. Dick Simmons was COO and demanded operational excellence from its newspaper and media properties



#### Flexibility

**Outsider CEOs tended to be strategically flexible, changing company strategy as the circumstances required.** Rather than adhering to a preset strategy, outsider CEOs evaluated all possible options at each point in time, then chose the option that was best.

For example, General Dynamics aggressively sold business lines like Cessna during one phase of the company’s turnaround, then decades later reversed course and _acquired_ large businesses like Gulfstream when the environment had changed.

Likewise, at one time, share buybacks might be the best use of cash; in another time, using high-priced stock to buy companies might be preferable.

#### Personal Negotiations

The outsider CEOs tended to negotiate directly instead of through a layer of advisers.

Examples:

  * When running Ralston Purina, Stiritz made his acquisitions through direct contact with the sellers, avoiding auctions whenever he could.
  * Warren Buffett avoids auctions for businesses. Instead, he prefers that owners call him and offer a price, with Buffett returning his answer within 5 minutes.



#### Focusing on the Important Factors

When making capital allocation decisions, outsider CEOs avoided complicated financial models and pages of analysis, which they knew to be imprecise. Instead, **they tended to simplify understanding of a business down to a handful of key assumptions** —market growth trends, competitive dynamics, and cash flow. This allowed them to make fast decisions when an opportunity appeared.

### Personality and History

The outsider CEOs also showed patterns to their personalities that informed how they ran their businesses.

#### Independent Thinkers

Outsider CEOs preferred to come to their own conclusions instead of following conventional wisdom. They were analytical and rational about their businesses. All were quantitative people, with more having engineering degrees than MBAs.

This independent thinking often led to unorthodox practices, such as buying back shares when none of their peers were, or ignoring traditional measures of value like reported earnings and book value. But even when observers were skeptical, outsider CEOs cared little what others thought. This iconoclast personality allowed them to avoid the peer pressure of imitating other CEOs.

They were also broad thinkers, familiar with a variety of industries and disciplines, which translated into new perspectives and approaches. Using the metaphor of a “hedgehog,” who knows one thing very well, or a “fox,” who knows many things, the outsider CEOs were foxes. For example, Bill Stiritz of Ralston Purina had an unusual blend of marketing acumen and financial astuteness.

#### New to the Job

The CEOs featured in the book were first-time CEOs, with little management experience. Only two had MBAs. In fact, many were new to their industries. This inexperience might have helped their management, as they were unbound by conventional wisdom and built their practices independently, from first principle.

#### Understated

Outsider CEOs were humble and did not seek the spotlight. They avoided magazine covers and public talks. They weren’t considered charismatic. They were not household names in business, and so few people other than sophisticated investors and company fans know about them. They lived seemingly boring lives and were happily married. They were patient and tolerated waiting long periods of time for compelling opportunities to arise.

Again, this did not mean timidness. When outsider CEOs saw a great opportunity, they acted boldly and decisively.
