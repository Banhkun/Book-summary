## Introduction

If you’re asked who the greatest CEO of the last century was, one name might naturally come to mind: Jack Welch. During his 20-year tenure as CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001, GE stock had a compounded annual return of 20.9 percent. $1 invested in GE stock in 1981 would have turned into $48 20 years later.

As a result, Jack Welch has been lionized as the classical power-CEO. He was a famously active manager, diving deep into business units and traveling among GE’s locations. He communicated regularly with Wall Street and focused intently on managing GE’s stock price. He earned a public persona as a charismatic high-performance manager, gracing the covers of business magazines and authoring management books like _Winning_.

But is Jack Welch really the greatest CEO of the century? According to the author of _The Outsiders_ , **no—not even close**.

There are two common issues with assessing the performance of CEOs like Jack Welch:

  1. The macroeconomic context greatly affects stock price. Therefore, the **performance of the CEO needs to be compared relative to the rest of the market** —namely, returns of peer companies and of the broader market over the same period of time. If a company can outperform its peers _consistently_ , this suggests a real difference in managerial abilities rather than in the external environment. Jack Welch ran GE during one of the greatest extended bull runs in US stock market history, during which the S&P had a 14% annual return. In this context, Welch’s performance, while still impressive, is less distinguished.
  2. People disagree on the metric by which CEOs are compared. Often, the business press emphasizes vanity metrics like growth in revenue or earnings, or total headcount. The author argues this would be like fixating on the tallest NBA players or the heaviest football linebackers. In reality, **only one metric in business really matters—the company’s per share value**.



Taking these two points into account, there are CEOs that outperformed Jack Welch by multiples. For example, Henry Singleton of the conglomerate Teledyne operated during a 30-year period when his peers were returning 11% per year. In contrast, **Teledyne returned 20.4% in the same period**. $1 invested in Teledyne at the beginning of the period (1963) would have returned $180 by 1990, compared to $27 in a basket of conglomerates, or $15 in the S&P 500. Singleton achieved 5-times better performance relative to peers, in a worse time that featured multiple bear markets.

The author investigated CEOs like Henry Singleton who had outlier performance compared to the rest of their industry and the market. He found 8 CEOs whose companies showed remarkable financial performance over the course of decades. Furthermore, he found uncannily strong patterns among the outsider CEOs that distinguished them from typical CEOs. These CEOs and their management practices are the subject of _The Outsiders_.
