## Chapter 1: Tom Murphy and Capital Cities Broadcasting

Capital Cities Broadcasting was a media company owning television stations, radio stations, and print publications. Outsider CEO Tom Murphy was CEO from 1966 to 1996.

In 1966, the market capitalization of Capital Cities was 6% that of CBS, the dominant media business in the country.

By 1996, when Capital Cities sold to Disney, it had rocketed past CBS and was now worth **three times as much as CBS**. It had acquired media giant ABC, which was dubbed by the press as akin to a “minnow swallowing a whale.” Relative to CBS, Capital Cities had grown nearly 50 times as much in the same period.

The strategy was simple and repeatable: buy media properties with attractive economics, improve operations to generate more cash, and use the cash to buy more media properties. Capital Cities had a management playbook that made it very effective at increasing revenue and cutting costs at its newly acquired companies. This created a “perpetual motion machine for returns.”

### Performance

From 1966 to 1996, Capital Cities showed a 19.9% annual return rate, compared to the 10.1% for the S&P 500 and 13.2% return for leading media companies.

$1 invested at the beginning would have been worth $204 by 1996. This outperformed the S&P by 16.7 times, and his peers by almost 4 times.

### History

Tom Murphy served in World War II and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1949. He worked as a product manager in consumer packaged goods for Lever Brothers until 1954, when his father’s friend Frank Smith told him about a TV station in Albany he’d purchased from bankruptcy. With no broadcasting experience, Murphy left to run the station day-to-day, with Smith running the business from downtown New York.

Murphy’s strategy was to improve programming to raise revenue and manage costs to reduce expenses. After a few years of losses, Murphy turned the station into a profitable cash generator. In 1957, they bought a second station in North Carolina, then a third one in Providence, and continuously from then on.

When Smith died in 1966, Murphy became CEO of Capital Cities. Murphy in turn promoted Dan Burke, a Harvard MBA he had hired 5 years earlier, to COO. **They had a clean division of labor—Burke would focus on the day-to-day operations, while Murphy was responsible for capital allocations and acquisitions.** In essence, Burke generated the free cash flow, and Murphy spent it.

At the time, Capital Cities had revenues of $28 million. Over the next few years, Murphy made large acquisitions.

  * In 1967, Murphy bought a Houston ABC affiliate for $22 million, then the largest acquisition in broadcast history. 
  * In 1968, he bought Fairchild Communications, a trade magazine publisher, for $42 million. 
  * In 1970, he bought broadcaster Triangle Communications for $120 million.



At the time, the FCC allowed a company to own a maximum of five VHF TV stations, and Capital Cities had reached this maximum. Thus they turned to newspaper publishing, which had a similar business model as broadcasting. Once again, he had an appetite for acquisitions, buying newspapers for values in the high 8-figures in the 1970s. In 1980, he entered cable television by buying Cablecom for $139 million.

During the bear market of the early 1980s, **Capital City shares were at single-digit P/E (price to earning) multiples. Murphy aggressively repurchased Capital City shares** , eventually buying back close to half of standing shares.

In 1984, the FCC relaxed its maximum station limit, and in 1986 Capital Cities bought the ABC network for $3.5 billion, with financing help from Warren Buffett. As the largest transaction in business history outside of oil and gas, it stunned observers. ABC was bigger than Capital Cities at the time.

But Capital Cities treated ABC no differently than small local stations it had acquired. **It cut costs aggressively** , including ABC’s plush executive perks; it improved programming, in turn leading to better ratings and revenues. Soon ABC became more profitable than its competitors CBS and NBC.

In 1993, at 65, Burke retired from Capital Cities. Now without a clear successor, Murphy met with Michael Eisner (CEO of Disney) in 1995, who was interested in buying Capital Cities. Murphy negotiated a $19 billion price, which was **28 times net income**.

### Management Practices

#### Financial Practices

As a prototypical Outsider CEO, Murphy **rarely issued stock to fund acquisitions, which would dilute existing shareholders**. Instead, he raised debt to fund acquisitions. Since Capital Cities enjoyed industry-leading margins, he would often pay off debt ahead of schedule. Then, with the new profitable asset, he would leverage it to buy other assets. This was a highly repeatable strategy that they employed dozens of times over Murphy’s tenure.

Capital Cities also repurchased $1.8 billion of shares, mostly at single-digit ratios of price to cash flow.

#### Focus on Core Businesses

When acquiring companies, Capital Cities **focused on businesses it knew it could run well—media businesses that it could buy, make more efficient using its operating playbook, and thus turn into productive assets that could fuel further similar acquisitions**. They knew the business model well—advertising-driven revenue with good margins and strong competitive barriers.

In contrast, its peer company CBS engaged in the conventional practice of acquiring unrelated businesses, such as toy businesses and the Yankees baseball team. The conventional thinking was that these acquisitions would lead to diversification, thus avoiding the variability of economic cycles, as well as synergies, where larger companies magically become more profitable through efficiency. However, like many acquisitions by conglomerates of this era, these did not materialize in meaningful synergies or better profits. Often, conglomerates acquired too rapidly and underestimated the difficulty of improving operations to realize cost efficiencies.

#### Acquisition Style

When acquiring companies, Murphy prospected carefully for good deals. He had a **simple benchmark—the acquisition should have a “double-digit after-tax return over ten years without leverage.”**

He was known for being fair. He’d ask the seller what a fair price was, and if he thought it was fair, he’d pay it. If he didn’t, he countered once—if rejected, he walked away. He never engaged in hostile takeovers.

Often, the reputation of Capital Cities preceded him. They were known for being market leaders and fair employers. This lowered the hesitation of potential acquisition targets.

#### Decentralization

Capital Cities strongly believed that the best decisions were made at the local level. **Headquarters gave responsibility and authority to individual publishers and station managers.**

As a result, its headquarters was tiny. It saw its role purely as supporting the general managers. There were no vice presidents in functional areas like strategy or marketing and no PR department. This drastically reduced overhead, contributing to Capital Cities having the highest margins in the industry.

In this environment, entrepreneurial general managers thrived. Managers were expected to deliver margins and to outperform their peers. If they met their numbers, they rarely heard from headquarters.

High-performing managers were trusted to take over a newly acquired business or to enter a new industry, even if the manager didn’t have prior experience in the industry.

#### Lean Operating Expenses

Businesses that rely on advertising face variability in revenues, often as a result of the larger economic environment. **Capital Cities knew that their businesses couldn’t control revenue, but it _could_ control costs.** Therefore, they cut wasteful expenditures aggressively, particularly around headcount and perks.

In a famous story, when Murphy first arrived in Albany in 1956, Smith asked him to paint the TV station’s exterior to look better to advertisers. Murphy painted only the two sides facing the road, leaving the other two sides the same.

This spirit carried throughout Murphy’s management. Each year, every general manager prepared detailed budgets for the upcoming year and met with Burke and his CFO at headquarters. Burke would go line-by-line and scrutinize each expense.

When Capital Cities acquired ABC, they immediately cut unnecessary expenses like executive limo service, and they laid off 1500 redundant positions.

#### Choice Investments in Product

Despite their philosophy of lean expenses, Capital Cities made choice investments in quality programming to drive more advertising revenue. They realized that the number one station in local news often ended with a disproportionate share of local ad revenue, and so they invested heavily in news talent and technology to lead local markets. Most of the media properties in Capital Cities were local leaders.

As an example of a Capital Cities transformation, newspaper _Kansas City Star_ was purchased in 1977 for $95 million, with $12.5 million in cash flow and single-digit margins. In 1996, cash flow grew to $68 million and margins grew to 35%.
