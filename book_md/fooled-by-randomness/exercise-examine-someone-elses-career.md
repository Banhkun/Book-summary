## Exercise: Examine Someone Else’s Career

Though hard work, skill, and intelligence are often necessary first steps toward success, they rarely account for _runaway_ success, which is far more often due to luck: a positive rare event plus a lack of negative rare events.

* * *

Think back to your time at school, your early adulthood, or your early days in a new company. List two or three people you considered at that time to be somewhat equally talented and intelligent.

Compare their career paths since that time. Did any of them achieve significantly more success than the others?

Consider the choices these people made—was their success or lack of it an inevitable result of those choices? Can you see where luck might have played a part anywhere along the line?
