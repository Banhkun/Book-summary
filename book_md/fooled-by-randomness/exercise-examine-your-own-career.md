## Exercise: Examine Your Own Career

People often underestimate the influence of luck on success. We very often attribute luck to skill and randomness to determinism.

* * *

Look back on your own career progression. What were the major turning points along the way—the pivotal moments where you were either faced with a choice or an opportunity found you?

Do you think these pivotal moments were due either in part or in whole to chance? Why or why not?

Describe a time along the way when a choice you made regarding your career—or a gamble you took—might have turned out differently.

Had you made this choice differently, how might that have affected your career path?
