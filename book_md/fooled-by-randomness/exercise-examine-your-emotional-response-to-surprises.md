## Exercise: Examine Your Emotional Response to Surprises

The primitive and emotional sections of our brain pay much closer attention to surprises than to run-of-the-mill news, and we attach greater significance to shocking events even if they are not ultimately important. This can lead us to prepare for the wrong things.

* * *

Describe a time you started to prepare for something unlikely because it was in the news cycle. What was the event or circumstance that you felt compelled to prepare for?

How did you determine the event or circumstance was something to worry about? How did it turn out to fulfill your expectations? (For instance, was it more or less of a risk than you had prepared for?)

Next time you encounter startling news, what can you do to ensure you are assessing the risk properly? How can you research it more fully?
