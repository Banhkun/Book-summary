## Part 5: Early Winter

Although Junior doesn’t think he’ll make either the varsity or junior varsity team, he tries out for basketball anyway. There are 40 students competing for 24 varsity and junior varsity spots.

After running 100 laps around the gym, the team hopefuls play full-court one-on-one games so the coach can assess their skills. Junior is paired with Roger. Predictably, Roger easily steals the ball from Junior as he starts to dribble, then knocks Junior over when it’s Junior’s turn to play defense. The coach acknowledges that Roger’s much bigger than Junior and asks if Junior needs a break. **Junior really wants a break, but knows that if he takes it, he’ll lose his shot at making the team.** He has to prove his tenacity.

The next time Roger knocks Junior down, he jumps up and chases the ball, which has bounced into the stands. He grabs it and sprints back to the court, not even bothering to dribble, running like a fullback. By the time he gets 15 feet away from Roger, who’s ready to tackle him like a linebacker, both boys are screaming. Junior nails a jump shot, then Roger grabs the ball and takes it to the opposite end of the court. Junior stays with him and fouls him to keep him from making a layup.

Having seen enough, the coach calls them off the court, but he doesn’t seem bothered by their untraditional strategies on the court. Roger offers Junior his fist for a fist bump, and Junior knows at this moment that he’s going to make the team. He doesn’t just make the team—he makes varsity.

### Junior’s First Game Against Wellpinit

The first game of the season is against Junior’s old school, Wellpinit High. Junior is so nervous about the game that he vomits four times before it starts.

Not long before, Junior had told Gordy about how people on the reservation call him an apple: “red on the outside and white on the inside.” He says that **many Indians think you become as good as white if you aspire to a better life.** Junior has had to deal with people on the rez calling him a traitor or ignoring him since he started school at Reardan, but now he faces the unappetizing prospect of returning to the rez in the company of the very people he left them for.

When the Reardan bus pulls up to Wellpinit High, little kids throw rock-filled snowballs at them. As the Reardan team walks toward the gym, Junior can hear the Wellpinit fans chanting. It takes him a moment to realize they’re chanting “Ar-nold sucks! Ar-nold sucks!” They’re making a point of calling him by his Reardan name, Arnold, rather than his reservation name, Junior.

Junior’s coach asks Junior if he’s okay. When Junior says he’s not, his coach tells him he can sit this game out, but Junior refuses.

When the team walks into the gym, the fans go silent. Then, **all at the same time, all the spectators in the stands turn their backs on Junior.** Junior’s angry, in part because he thinks that if his community had been this organized when it came to educating its children, he might still be there. Thinking about this irony makes him laugh, the sole sound in the gym.

Rowdy, on Wellpinit’s basketball team, is the only Indian who hasn’t turned his back on Junior, but it’s not out of kindness. Rowdy is glaring at Junior as he passes a ball around his body. He looks like he wants to kill Junior and is tired of waiting. This makes Junior laugh even harder.

Junior’s coach starts to laugh with him, and then the entire Reardan team starts to laugh, and they laugh their way to the locker room. Once in the locker room, Junior starts to cry. The coach tells the team that **crying is ok. It means you care. He advises the team, especially Junior, to use that pain to get mad and go out fighting.**

#### The Game

Junior does get mad and he’s ready to play, but as he runs onto the court, someone from the stands throws a quarter that hits him on the forehead. Because he’s bleeding, he can’t play and has to go back to the locker room.

His dad’s friend Eugene, a newly-certified EMT, meets Junior in the locker room and tells him he’ll need stitches. Junior asks Eugene to stitch him up so that he can go back out and play. Eugene finishes in time for Junior to join the second half of the game. Almost as soon as he’s on the court, Junior steals the ball and runs for a layup, with Rowdy close behind him. Mid-air, Rowdy elbows Junior in the head and knocks him unconscious. As the ambulance takes Junior to the ER, the cops at the game try to restrain the Indian adults who have flooded the court to join the two teams, whose players are shoving each other.

**The white referees are scared of the Indians** , so to please them, they give Rowdy a technical foul for elbowing Junior, but they give the Reardan team _four_ fouls for unsportsmanlike conduct. Wellpinit wins by thirty points, and the doctors say Junior is fine.

### Junior’s Christmas

Junior’s family doesn’t have money for presents at Christmas, so his father does what he always does when there isn’t enough money for something: He takes what they _do_ have and gets drunk. He’s gone from Christmas Eve until January 2nd.

When he gets back, he’s so hungover that he can’t get out of bed. Junior goes into his room to say hello, and his dad apologizes about there being no presents at Christmas. Junior tells him it’s okay, but it isn’t. He realizes that **he’s once again trying to protect the man who repeatedly breaks his heart.**

Junior’s dad tells Junior that he has a present for him now, which he’s been storing in his boot. Under the foot pad, Junior finds a wrinkled five dollar bill. He can’t believe that his father was able to keep himself from spending his last $5 on a bottle of whiskey and two more days of drunken bliss. Junior turns to thank his father for saving the money for him, but his father has already fallen back asleep.

Since being at Reardan, Junior has come to understand what good parents he has. Yes, his dad is an alcoholic and his mom is an “ex-drunk,” but they show how much they care about Junior with the sacrifices they make and the way they talk to him honestly and listen to him sincerely. This is more than many of Junior’s white peers can say. Junior notices that the parents, especially the fathers, of many of his classmates ignore their kids.

Conversely, on the rez, everyone knows everyone else. There might be problems on the rez, but everyone is close. It’s like a big family.

### Junior’s Grandmother

One day, Junior’s grandmother, Grandmother Spirit, is walking home from a local powwow when she’s hit by a drunk driver. She dies during surgery at the hospital.

In remembering his grandmother, Junior reflects on her gift of tolerance. **In the past, Indians celebrated people who were different** : people with epilepsy often became shamans because of the tribal belief that God gave visions along with the seizures; people who were gay were seen as both masculine and feminine, and therefore both warriors and caregivers—their dual roles gave them an elevated position in society.

According to Junior, this tolerance evaporated when white people and their Christianity brought prejudice to America. **Now, Indians are as intolerant as any other race.** But not Junior’s grandmother: She loved everyone. She’d even talk to homeless people, and if they were talking to imaginary friends, she’d talk to those imaginary friends too. She believed that **the point of life was to meet new people** , and she was consequently completely supportive of Junior’s decision to go to a new school. Her last words were a plea for her family to forgive the drunk driver who killed her.

#### The Wake

Two thousand people attend the wake for Junior’s grandmother, moved to the football field to accommodate them all. None of them taunt Junior. This is a turning point in Junior’s relationship with the members of his community: People on the rez stop ignoring or bullying him. They witness the grief of his family, and in their sympathy, they seem to stop viewing Junior as the enemy.

A white man shows up at the wake. Junior recognizes him as a Spokane billionaire famous for his wealth. The man stands to speak, and everyone’s excited to hear how this white billionaire knew Grandmother Spirit. They’re all disappointed when he starts talking about how much he loves Indians. **Too many white people come to the reservation to tell the people living there how much they love them. It’s patronizing, and it’s boring.** What’s worse, this man is a collector. White people collecting Indian art and artifacts makes the Spokane “feel like insects pinned to a display board.” The thousands of Indians at the wake become uncomfortable as Ted the billionaire talks about his collection.

Ted tells the group that his collection includes powwow dance outfits. Everyone suddenly wakes up—it’s unusual for powwow outfits to leave the tribe. He says an Indian stranger sold it to him, and even though the billionaire knew that the item was probably stolen, it was so beautiful that he paid the man and kept it for himself. Years later, guilt prompted him to search for the original owner of the outfit. He’s found her: Grandmother Spirit. He asks any children of Grandmother Spirit to step forward so he can return the outfit.

Junior’s mom stands to meet the billionaire. He asks for her forgiveness, but she tells him there’s nothing to forgive—the outfit wasn’t Grandmother Spirit’s. It couldn’t have been. She was never a powwow dancer. In fact, when Junior’s mom looks at the outfit, she doesn’t think it’s Spokane at all. She tells the billionaire that the anthropologist he’d hired to research the outfit didn’t know what he was talking about.

Embarrassed, the billionaire hurries away, taking the outfit with him. For a couple of minutes, everyone at the wake is silent, not knowing what to make of this odd interruption. Then, Junior’s mom starts to laugh. Her laughter is contagious, and soon, all two thousand guests are laughing. **They laugh for the rest of the wake, laughing and crying as they bury Grandmother Spirit.**
