## Exercise: Examine the Power of Expectations

Junior believes that one of the most powerful sentences in the world is “You can do it.”

Why do you think Junior plays basketball better at Reardan than he did on the reservation?

Think of a time when someone’s expectations of you (high or low, positive or negative) affected your performance. What were the expectations? How did they affect you?

Who can you turn to in the future to set the bar high for you? If negative expectations hurt your performance in the past, what’s something you could do in the future to counter these negative expectations?
