## Part 6: Late Winter

In February, Eugene and his friend Bobby, both drunk, argue in a 7-Eleven parking lot over who gets the last sip of wine. Bobby shoots Eugene in the face, killing him. Once in jail (and sober), Bobby hangs himself.

Junior has no idea how to deal with his grief. He copes by reading lots of books and drawing lots of cartoons. He loses track of how many days of school he’s missed—fifteen, maybe twenty.

Junior wonders why God would make his family suffer so much. He finds his answer in the Euripides play _Medea_ , which Gordy has shown him. In it, the title character asks, **“What greater grief than the loss of one’s native land?”** This hits a chord. Junior suddenly understands his family’s grief and the suffering of his community on the rez: Indians have lost their native land. In fact, they’ve lost everything: their languages, their dances, their songs, and their relationships with each other. **The only way of life they know is “how to lose and be lost.”**

Junior’s so angry at this unfairness that he wants to kill God. He also thinks he’s cursed his family and his tribe by leaving Wellpinit to go to school at Reardan. He blames himself for his grandmother’s and Eugene’s deaths, and he thinks about leaving Reardan for good.

### Junior’s Classmates Stand up for Him

Somehow, Junior finds the will to get up one morning and go to school. As he sits down, his social studies teacher, Mrs. Jeremy, refers to Junior as her “special guest” and sarcastically remarks that she didn’t know he was still a student at Reardan (because he’s missed so many classes).

Junior’s enraged by this mockery. He asks her, “What did you just say?” His classmates are silent as Mrs. Jeremy continues to chide Junior for missing so much school, but Gordy breaks the silence, standing up and dropping his textbook on the floor. Following Gordy’s lead, Penelope stands up and drops her book. She’s followed by Roger and the rest of the basketball players. Mrs. Jeremy stands at the front in silence, flinching as each book hits the floor.

After this demonstration, all Junior’s classmates walk out of class, leaving Junior behind with Mrs. Jeremy. Junior starts to laugh at the thought that his classmates have left behind the person they’re standing up for. He compares it to hypothetical people who trample over baby seals so they can get to the beach and “protest against the slaughter of baby seals.” When Mrs. Jeremy asks Junior why he’s laughing, he tells her that he used to think everyone fell into tribes based on race. **Now, he knows there are only two tribes: Assholes, and people who are not assholes.** Then, he walks out of the classroom.

After this incident, Junior tries to survive his grief by focusing on the people and things that give him joy. He makes list after list of these things: People, musicians, foods, books, basketball players. Drawing cartoons of things that make him mad and making lists of things that bring him joy is his own private “grieving ceremony.”

### Junior at the Rematch

To his surprise, Junior has become a good basketball player. In fact, he’s the best shooter on the team. He suspects it’s because people’s expectations of him have changed. On the rez, people see him as the bottom of the barrel. At Reardan, **Junior’s coach and teammates expect Junior to be good, so he is.**

The Reardan team has won 12 games in a row. They’re so good that the community compares them to the greats: Roger is the “new Joel Wetzel” and teammate James is the “new Keith Schulz.” **But nobody compares Junior to a legend.** It doesn’t even occur to them to compare a little Indian boy to a white player. To them, it’s like comparing apples and oranges. Junior hopes that, someday, they’ll compare Reardan student athletes to _him_.

Junior’s eager for Reardan’s rematch with Wellpinit, even though he feels like the “Indian scout who led the U.S. Cavalry against other Indians.” After Wellpinit beat them so badly in their first game, Junior wants revenge. His particular goal is to embarrass Rowdy, the best player on Wellpinit’s team.

Before the game, the Reardan coach is honest with his players: The Wellpinit team is better than they are. However, Reardan has more heart. In a surprise move, Coach announces that Junior will be starting and that he’ll be guarding Rowdy all night.

This terrifies Junior. He’s much smaller than Rowdy and doesn’t believe he can prevent him from dominating the game. But Coach keeps telling Junior he can do it, and Junior starts to believe it. **He realizes that this simple sentence, “You can do it,” is one of the most powerful sentences in English** , especially coming from an adult.

During warm up, Rowdy and Junior try to ignore each other, but they’re sending “hate signals” across the court. Junior thinks that **you have to love somebody a lot in order to hate them that much.**

#### The Opening Play

The players take their positions, and Rowdy laughs when he sees that Junior’s guarding him. The game has just started when Rowdy steals the ball. Junior knows Rowdy well, and he knows what Rowdy’s intending to do: Rowdy plans to dunk the ball, a dramatic opening move meant to embarrass Reardan in the first play.

Junior chases Rowdy down the court and does some quick calculating: Rowdy will probably start his jump 5 feet away from the basket; Rowdy can jump 2 feet higher than Junior can. So Junior makes the split-second decision to jump first. He and Rowdy rise together toward the basket, but, as if by magic, Junior starts to rise higher than Rowdy. It’s the first time in his life that he’s outjumped Rowdy. **Mid-air, Junior steals the ball from Rowdy’s hands and observes the look of complete shock on Rowdy’s face.** _No one_ in high school basketball makes plays like this.

Junior lands with the ball and runs to the opposite end of the court, with Rowdy screaming behind him. Junior halts abruptly at the three-point line and head-fakes. Surprisingly, Rowdy falls for it, jumping in front of Junior as Junior patiently waits for him to pass. They make eye contact while Rowdy’s in the air, and Rowdy knows he’s made a stupid mistake.

Junior has time to stick his tongue out at Rowdy before swishing a three-pointer. Junior’s teammates, coach, and parents are ecstatic. In that moment, everyone knows that the game is already won.

#### The Celebration

After the game, Junior’s teammates lift him to their shoulders. Junior’s thrilled and searches the stands for his dad, who may be an “undependable drunk” but never misses a game. Junior finds him, but his dad isn’t cheering. Instead, he’s watching the Wellpinit team, who are dejectedly watching Reardan celebrate its victory. Reveling in Wellpinit’s defeat, Junior cheers, comparing himself to David, who knocks out Goliath with a stone. But then, still on the shoulders of his teammates, he realizes something: **Reardan isn’t David, the underdog; Readan is _Goliath_ , the giant, the team with all the advantages.**

Junior’s teammates, drive their own cars, carry their own cell phones, have parents with good jobs, and will go to college. In contrast, more than one kid on the Wellpinit team probably didn’t eat breakfast. Two of them have fathers in prison. None of them will go to college, and Rowdy’s father will beat him for losing the game.

Junior escapes to the bathroom, vomits, and cries tears of shame. He wants to apologize to Rowdy for breaking his heart.

Later, after the season ends, Junior emails Rowdy to apologize for beating Wellpinit so badly. Rowdy responds, writing that Wellpinit will kick Reardan’s ass next season, and Junior will “cry like the little faggot” that he is. Junior’s delighted. He got a response from Rowdy! He emails Rowdy, “I might be a faggot, but I’m the faggot who beat you,” to which Rowdy replies “Ha-ha.” Junior’s thrilled that he’s communicating with Rowdy again.

### Junior’s Sister Mary

Junior says **the biggest difference between white people and Indians is the number of funerals they attend in their lifetimes.** In Junior’s 14 years, he’s attended 42 funerals. 90% of the deaths were the result of alcohol.

One morning, the Reardan counselor pulls Junior out of chemistry class. When Junior asks her what’s wrong, she starts to cry. She tells Junior that his sister has passed away.

Junior refuses to accept this. When the counselor repeats that Mary is gone, Junior says, “I know...She lives in Montana now.” He knows this is idiotic, but he tells himself that **if he doesn’t accept the truth, maybe it won’t be true.** But he can no longer pretend when the counselor clarifies, “No, she’s dead.”

Junior runs out into the snow to wait for his father, who’s on his way to pick Junior up. Junior’s suddenly hit by the premonition that his father is going to crash because the roads are icy. The longer Junior waits, the more terrified he becomes. After a half hour, he’s convinced that his father has also died.

#### Dad Arrives

Junior’s on the verge of a breakdown when his father pulls up. Junior’s so relieved his father is alive that he starts to laugh, and he doesn’t stop laughing until they reach the border of the rez. Finally calmer, Junior asks his father how Mary died.

His dad tells him that Mary and her husband had had a party in their trailer. They passed out in the back, and one of the guests accidentally left a hot plate on, which eventually burned the trailer down.

Junior’s dad tries to console him by telling him that she was so drunk she didn’t even wake up. Junior doesn’t find it comforting that his sister was “too freaking drunk to feel any pain when she burned to death.” The absurdity of the situation sets him off again, and he laughs uncontrollably while his dad silently drives him home.

When they’ve parked, Junior’s dad starts to cry. He tells Junior he loves him, something he hardly ever says. They go into the house, which is full of dozens of family members eating their food. Junior’s mother is curled up on the couch, and Junior knows that she’s “now broken and that she’ll always be broken.” She pulls Junior to her and tells him that he better not ever have a drink of alcohol. Before he can respond, she slaps him. Then she slaps him again, hard, two more times. **He promises not to drink, and she stops slapping him, but she doesn’t let him go.** She cries and holds him like a baby for hours, soaking his hair and clothing with tears.

#### The Funeral

After Mary’s coffin is lowered at the funeral, Junior can’t stand to stick around any longer. He runs toward the forest, hoping to never be found, but he runs straight into Rowdy, who’s been watching the burial from a hiding spot. Rowdy’s crying. When Junior tells him it’s okay to cry and touches his shoulder, Rowdy swings at him, but he misses. When Junior taunts him for missing, Rowdy claims he missed on purpose, but Junior retorts that he missed because he can’t see through his tears. Rowdy never misses a punch, and rarely cries—once again, the whole situation seems so absurd to Junior that he starts to laugh uncontrollably. This makes Rowdy cry harder because he thinks Junior is laughing at him.

Junior doesn’t want to laugh. He wants to hug Rowdy. He feels like he needs Rowdy, and his behavior is pushing Rowdy away, but he can’t stop laughing.

Through his tears, Rowdy accuses Junior of killing Mary. He says **she’s dead because Junior left the reservation.** This makes Junior stop laughing. In fact, he believes he may never laugh again. Rowdy’s right. Mary only got married and left because Junior had already left the rez, and she couldn’t let him one-up her. Rowdy screams “I hate you!” three times, then runs out of the forest.

Junior doesn’t want to stay home from school the next day because staying home from school means spending the day with all his cousins, who will be drunk and unhappy. At school, his classmates hug him and gently punch his shoulder, silently communicating their sympathy. After a rough start, they now care about him. And Junior cares about them.
