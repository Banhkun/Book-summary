## Shortform Introduction

Set in 2006, _The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian_ is a semi-autobiographical novel by Sherman Alexie. Although based on the author’s childhood, _True Diary_ is a work of fiction.

Throughout, Alexie’s narrator, Junior, refers to the Spokane tribe as “Indians” rather than “Native Americans,” “American Indians,” or “Indigenous Peoples.” We’ve followed suit to remain faithful to the narrator’s voice.

A note on organization: _The Absolutely True Diary_ is comprised of short, unnumbered chapters. We’ve organized these chapters into larger thematic sections for ease of reading.

A unique feature of this book is the illustrations. Junior loves to draw cartoons (“words are too limited”), and his comic depictions of his life say as much about his personality as his narration does. We’ve woven into the summary some of the content and opinions expressed in these cartoons, but you might find it valuable to refer to the book to see how the illustrations deepen its themes of identity, poverty, and art as a means of finding your purpose.
