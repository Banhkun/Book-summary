## 1-Page Summary

In _I Thought It Was Just Me (but it isn’t)_ , author and researcher Brené Brown discusses one of the most taboo topics of our culture: shame. She explains that shame is an intense feeling similar to embarrassment. It triggers feelings of fear, blame, and disconnection that can consume us and cause us to lash out at ourselves and others.

Brown says many people lack the skills necessary to handle and overcome shame, despite it being an all-encompassing and common sensation. Our inability to deal with shame wreaks havoc on our health, happiness, and relationships, and it perpetuates the cultural acceptance of shaming others.**** Brown contends that to live a happy, empowered life and help others to do the same, you must learn how to combat shame by practicing empathy toward yourself and others.

_I Thought It Was Just Me (but it isn’t)_ is Brown’s first book, written in 2007 when she was a professor and researcher studying women’s experiences of shame. Today, Brown is an author of numerous best-sellers, a research professor, a lecturer, and a podcast host who studies courage, vulnerability, empathy, and shame. Some of her most popular books include _The Gifts of Imperfection, Daring Greatly, Dare to Lead, _and _Atlas of the Heart. _She’s the host of two podcasts, _Unlocking Us_ and _Dare to Lead_ , and is well-known for her 2010 TEDx talk on the power of vulnerability.

This guide will explore Brown’s research on shame and “shame resilience”—her original term for the skills and techniques people use to combat shame with empathy. First, we’ll discuss what shame is, why it happens, and how it negatively impacts your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Next, we’ll explain what empathy is and how the different elements of empathy will help you combat shame. Finally, we’ll discuss practices you can integrate into your daily life to help build empathy. Throughout the guide, we’ll provide other expert opinions on the causes and impact of shame. We’ll also compare Brown’s ideas to similar concepts in books like _The Power of Now_ by Eckhart Tolle and _Radical Acceptance _by Tara Brach.

### Shame Causes Fear, Blame, and Disconnection

**Brown defines shame as a toxic, excruciating feeling that occurs when something or someone makes us feel like we’re defective and unworthy of love and connection**. Shame most often happens when we believe we’re being labeled with an identity that we don’t want to be associated with.

For example, if you value being important, you might feel shame when another person outwits you because it makes you feel unimportant. Or, if you want to be seen as hardworking, you might experience shame when your boss suggests you spend more time on your work because you fear they think you’re a slacker.

Ultimately, when our desired identities are threatened by identities we disdain, we experience shame.**** And according to Brown,**when we allow shame to consume our mind, it produces three feelings that cause harm to our health, happiness, and relationships: 1)_fear, 2) blame_ , and 3) _disconnection_.**

(Shortform note: Most experts agree with Brown's definition of shame, but some argue that shame isn't always toxic—sometimes, it can have positive effects. They call this kind of shame “healthy shame” and explain that it helps us survive by teaching us how to behave acceptably and fit in with our community. Rather than shame inevitably leading to fear, blame, and disconnection, they argue that healthy shame can have positive effects like self-correcting unhealthy behaviors, making amends with others, and personal growth. They call the shame Brown refers to—the kind that’s self-punishing and lingers after the negative experience— _toxic shame_.)

#### Outcome #1: Fear

**According to Brown, shame causes _fear_ because being associated with identities we disdain makes us afraid that we’re unworthy of love and connection**. In other words, we _fear_ that others won’t want anything to do with us if they associate us with that identity. For example, someone who feels shame over being unimportant fears that this identity will make them a lesser person whom others don’t want to associate with.

Brown says our fears (the identities we disdain) usually develop due to _societal expectations_ and the expectations of our _inner circle_ —friends, family, peers, bosses, and so on. _Societal expectations_ have historically caused many non-conventional identities to become disdainedand a point of shame. Similarly, your _inner circle_ might have caused you to see “creativity” as a disdained identity if you grew up in a family that looked down on artistic expression.

> **The Ego Is the Root of Our Fears**
> 
> In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle explains that our shame and fears are the result of our _ego_. Like Brown, Tolle argues that humans have an inherent fear of “not being enough.” He explains that the ego is a part of our mind that helps us avoid this fear by controlling our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The ego does its job by triggering urges to improve our identity and gain superiority over others. For example, we might fear being seen as “poor,” so our ego causes us to always crave new clothes to appear wealthy. It also makes us look down on people who aren’t wearing this year’s fashion in an attempt to feel better about ourselves and gain superiority.
> 
> Like Brown, Tolle explains that the ego’s concept of an acceptable self-image largely comes from societal expectations and the expectations of those close to us. For example, if we’re surrounded by people who think being “outdoorsy” is cool, we’ll likely try to adhere to that identity to feel and be seen as “good enough.” He contends that instead of being focused on societal expectations and external gain, we should instead focus on mindfulness and becoming one with our inner selves.

#### Outcome #2: Blame

Shame also leads to anger and _blame_.**This is because experiencing anger and assigning blame allows us to expel the negative emotion of shame**. Anger replaces the painful feeling of shame, and assigning blame allows us to direct that anger either inward or outward. Brown argues that blame in any form is unproductive because it expels negative feelings without addressing their root cause and inspiring change.

**When we direct our anger inward, we blame ourselves for being defective in some way and ultimately deserving the shameful experience.** For example, if someone makes you feel unattractive, you might escape the feeling of shame by directing your anger inward and blaming yourself for being foolish enough to ever believe that you _were_ attractive. Blaming yourself overrides the feeling of shame by inducing self-hatred and self-pity instead.

**When we direct our anger outward, we blame others for being unjust and feel better by believing that we didn’t deserve the shameful experience.** For example, if someone makes you feel unimportant, you may escape shame by directing your anger outward and blaming the other person for being pompous.

> **Blame Protects Our Ego**
> 
> In _The Power of Now, _Eckhart Tolle explains that shame, anger, and blame are all a result of our _pain-body—an element of our ego that craves suffering and causes us to react emotionally, inflicting further suffering on ourselves and others._ The pain-body craves suffering because the more pain we experience, the larger it gets and the stronger our ego becomes. Tolle explains that the suffering caused by our pain-body can be directed internally through actions like self-anger and self-pity (inward blame), or externally through anger and resentment towards others (outward blame).
> 
> Tolle agrees that we give into these negative emotional reactions because they give us temporary relief from negative emotional experiences (like shame) or restore our self-image (ego). He explains, like Brown, that giving into these negative emotional reactions is unproductive because doing so avoids addressing the negative underlying thoughts and beliefs that are the root of the issue.
> 
> For example, when we direct negative emotions inward (through actions like self-blame), we add to our pain-body and make ourselves more prone to negative reactions in the future. And when we direct negative emotions outward (through actions like blaming others), we strengthen our ego by making ourselves feel “right” and others “wrong” in an attempt to achieve superiority.

#### Outcome #3: Disconnection

**Finally, Brown notes that shame causes _disconnection_ from ourselves and others when we allow it to control our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors**—when it makes us feel _afraid_ and __ angry and causes us to assign _blame_. There are three ways that the effects of shame cause _disconnection_ :

**1) Our _fear,_ inward anger, and _blame_ cause us to intentionally disconnect from others (emotionally or physically) to hide our shameful identities**. You might avoid social events and end up disconnected from friends and peers.

**2) Our _fear,_ outward anger, and outward _blame_ cause us to unintentionally disconnect from others**. For example, someone who feels shame over being unimportant might outwardly direct anger and blame by getting defensive and asserting superiority over anyone who threatens them. This aggression might cause them to unintentionally disconnect by making others dislike and avoid them.

**3) Our _fear_ of being associated with identities we disdain makes us pretend to be someone we’re not, disconnecting us from _ourselves_.** For example, someone who feels shame over being seen as “nerdy” might give up certain “nerdy” passions in favor of activities that seem “cool.” This can disconnect them from their true identity and cause confusion about who they really are and what’s truly important to them.

> **The Three Biological Responses to the Pain and Fear of Disconnection**
> 
> While Brown suggests that shame and the fear of being unworthy are the causes of disconnection, it’s possible that disconnection itself can cause shame and emotional distress. For instance, some experts claim that disconnection creates emotional pain (such as shame) that’s as acute as physical pain.
> 
> Why is this the case? These experts argue that this pain is an ancient adaptive advantage to help us survive, and like shame, it causes three responses that correspond to the three forms of disconnection Brown discusses.
> 
> Originally, the pain of disconnection urged us to change ourselves to rejoin the tribe for survival reasons—access to food and safety from predators. (This aligns with Brown’s Effect #3—pretending to be someone we’re not and disconnecting from ourselves.) However, reconnecting isn’t necessary for survival in the modern age, as we can easily find food by ourselves and face fewer physical threats. This means that many people internalize the pain of disconnection and enter fight or flight mode.
> 
> Flight mode is when people actively remain isolated to avoid pain that others might cause them. (This aligns with Brown’s Effect #1—intentionally disconnecting from others.) Fight mode is when people become outwardly aggressive to protect themselves from pain others might cause. (This aligns with Brown’s Effect #2—unintentionally disconnecting from others.)

### Empathy Is The Solution To Shame

Based on her research, **Brown argues that _empathy_ is the solution to shame**. Brown defines empathy as using our own experiences to understand others’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors from _their_ perspectives without judgment.

While we can’t entirely avoid experiences of shame, Brown says that strengthening our ability to empathize with both ourselves and others makes us less reactive to shame and combats the feelings of _fear_ , _blame_ , and _disconnection_ that shame causes.

(Shortform note: Brown’s definition of empathy departs slightly from the definition commonly used by psychologists. Experts consider empathy as having two forms: affective and cognitive. Affective empathy is experiencing the feelings and emotions of another person. Cognitive empathy is taking another person’s perspective to identify and understand their emotions. While psychologists see affective and cognitive abilities as two separate forms of empathy, Brown asserts that both abilities are required to practice “empathy.” She also argues that empathy requires you to practice these abilities without _judgment_ , a component not included in many definitions.)

Brown says there are three components of empathy that combat the products of shame: courage, compassion, and connection.

#### Component #1: Courage

**Brown defines _courage_(what she calls “ordinary courage”) as the ability to be your genuine self and confidently share that identity with the world**.

**_Courage_ is important because it combats _fear._** People who possess _courage_ actively work towards accepting and expressing who they are by overcoming their _fear_ of certain identities. Because they value their authentic identity despite what others might say or think, people with courage are less likely to be consumed by fear and shame.

For example, imagine that you’re a naturally curious person and you fear being identified as stupid. This fear might prevent you from exploring your curiosities, especially if someone calls you stupid for asking questions. However, with _courage,_ you’ll have the ability to realize that your questions aren’t stupid—they’re important to improving your knowledge. Courage will also encourage you to embrace your curiosity and keep asking questions rather than getting discouraged by someone’s negative comment.

> **Courage, Fear, and Apathy**
> 
> In _Courage Is Calling, _Ryan Holiday defines courage more broadly than Brown, explaining that courage is the ability to do the right thing despite being afraid. On the other hand, Brown's definition specifically pertains to the concept of “authenticity”—instead of just “doing the right thing” generally, Brown says that courage is accepting and expressing your “authentic self.”
> 
> Further, while Brown says that _courage_ is the combatant and opposite of _fear_ , Holiday argues that hope is the combatant and opposite of fear. This is because hope is what causes courage, and fear is what causes _apathy_ —a state of inaction in which we exhibit unproductive behaviors (like blame and disconnection) to avoid our fears. So to overcome shame according to Holiday’s argument, we _first_ need to develop hope to combat our fears. _Then,_ hope will allow us to develop the courage to do the right thing (for instance, to accept and express our authentic selves) and face our fears (confront the identities we disdain).

#### Component #2: Compassion

**Brown defines _compassion_ as the ability and willingness to empathize without judgment and face pain**. _Compassion_ means looking at your own actions with understanding rather than anger and doing the same for others. It requires you to reflect on your pain and empathize with others by sharing the pain that they feel.

**_Compassion_ is crucial to overcoming shame because it combats _blame._** First, practicing compassion helps us avoid self-blame because we can acknowledge that our shame (and thus, our blame) is caused by our _fears_ , not by the fact that we’re defective in some way.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that self-compassion not only prevents self-blame but also improves your health, relationships, and general wellbeing by lowering levels of depression and anxiety. You can boost your self-compassion with simple practices like comforting your body (eating well, resting, and getting outside) or writing yourself a letter that describes the events of a painful situation without blaming yourself or anyone else.)

Second, compassion prevents us from blaming others because it can help us see that other people are struggling with shame and fear, too. If the other person intentionally shamed us, it’s probably because they’re also experiencing the fear of certain identities. Blaming them won’t help them to overcome this, and it won’t heal our shame, either.

For example, if someone shames you for being nerdy, having _compassion_ will help you avoid self-blame by helping you acknowledge that there’s nothing wrong with your interests: Rather, you’re experiencing shame because of unjust societal standards. You’ll also see that while the other person’s actions might not be right, they’re probably struggling with fear about being seen as “nerdy” as well.

> **Compassion and Empathy: Related but Separate Practices**
> 
> While Brown explains that compassion requires you to empathize and share others’ pain and emotions, other experts argue that empathy and compassion, while closely related, are fundamentally different. They define compassion as a _desire to help others_ that’s often sparked by, but doesn't require, empathy.
> 
> They add that in many cases, compassion is _more effective_ (in doing things like combating blame) when practiced with emotional _distance_ from the person or situation. This is because tapping into intense emotions (whether our own or others’) can overwhelm us and prevent a productive, compassionate response.
> 
> Further, requiring ourselves to have empathy to practice compassion can actually _reduce_ our ability to show compassion. We can’t understand _everyone’s_ emotions, so relying on empathy to practice compassion can result in a biased practice in which we’re only compassionate to those we understand. Further, if we require an emotional connection every time we practice compassion, we’ll eventually become emotionally drained and unable to continue being compassionate.

#### Component #3: Connection

**Brown defines _connection_ as the ability to share experiences and establish systems of mutual support with others.** Practicing _connection_ both requires and strengthens the elements of _courage_ and _compassion_ —to fully practice connection, you must be able to share your true self with others (_courage_), provide others with support and understanding without judgment (_compassion_), and request that they do the same for you.

_Connection_ is crucial to overcoming shame because it combats _disconnection_. When we share who we truly are, discuss our experiences and pain, and listen to others do the same, we realize that our experiences aren’t that strange or rare. We realize that others have gone through similar experiences and that if we can accept others, they can accept us.

_Connection_ therefore prevents us from intentionally disconnecting from others due to self-hatred or self-pity, unintentionally disconnecting from others by lashing out, and becoming disconnected from ourselves by pretending to be someone we’re not.

For example, someone who represses their interests because they think they’re nerdy will likely become disconnected from their true self. However, if they practice _connection_ and share their interests with others instead, they’re likely to form a deeper connection with themselves _and_ find a like-minded community that they connect with.

> **Practice Radical Acceptance With Others to Combat Shame**
> 
> Like Brown, Tara Brach explains in _Radical Acceptance_ that connecting with others is one of the most effective ways to heal, and to prevent ourselves and others from experiencing pain (like shame). However, Brach refers to what Brown calls _connection_ as “practicing _Radical Acceptance”_ in relationships.
> 
> Brach’s radical acceptance is a broader practice than Brown’s _connection_ that encompasses both your relationship with yourself and with others. Practicing radical acceptance of yourself means accepting yourself, your experiences, and your feelings (what Brown calls practicing courage and compassion toward yourself). Practicing Radical Acceptance with _others_ (what Brown calls connection) means sharing your experiences, listening to others’ experiences, providing support, and demystifying and destigmatizing these experiences (expressing your courage and showing compassion to others).
> 
> Like Brown, Brach explains that practicing connection with others heals our pain and makes us more resilient to painful experiences (like shame) by affirming that our experiences, emotions, and identities aren’t “wrong.” We also learn to share love and acceptance with others and receive it in return. When we do this, Brach explains that we create _sangha—_ the Buddhist word for community. Buddhists believe that _sangha_ is a key component of the spiritual path that leads to complete Radical Acceptance, peace, and freedom from pain and suffering—like shame, fear, anger, blame, and disconnection.

### How To Build Empathy and Combat Shame

Now that we’ve explored what shame and empathy are, let’s look at some specific practices for overcoming shame and building empathy. There are three main practices that Brown recommends you integrate into your daily life:

#### Practice #1: Acknowledge Your Shame and What Causes It

**First, Brown notes, to start building empathy and combating shame, you must recognize when you’re experiencing it and what’s causing it**. Recognizing your shame and its causes will allow you to separate from your negative thoughts and emotions before they can cause you to experience _fear_ , react with _blame,_ and become _disconnected_ from yourself and others. Acknowledging your shame will enable you to practice _courage,_ _compassion_ , and _connection_.

> **Overcoming Shame by Breaking Neuroassociations**
> 
> In _Awaken The Giant Within, _Tony Robbins agrees that the key to overcoming negative actions and reactions (like shame, fear, blame, and disconnection) is to identify what’s causing them. In his view, these actions and reactions are caused by neuroassociations: connections in our brain that form between experiences and emotions. These connections help us identify and avoid situations that might cause pain.
> 
> Robbins explains that all of our actions and reactions are the result of these neuroassociations. For example, if you’re shamed for wearing your favorite old sweater, you’ll form a negative neuroassociation between “wearing old clothes” and “shame,” and you’ll avoid wearing old clothes in public in the future. Robbins says that uncovering and correcting these neuroassociations is the key to combating negative actions and reactions like shame.

There are two parts to this practice. The first is to identify how shame feels. The second is to identify the identities and situations that cause that shame.

##### Step #1: Identify How Shame Feels

**Brown explains that you can identify shame by reflecting on how it feels in your body**. She says shame feels different for everyone—for some people, it might feel like a knot in their stomach, and for others, a pounding in their chest.

To identify how _you_ react to shame, think of a recent experience you’ve had with shame—where in your body did you feel its physical effects? What did they feel like? For example, you might have felt burning, throbbing, or numbness. Are there any other sensations you experience? For example, maybe you get a metallic taste in your mouth. Are there any instincts that pop into your mind? For example, you might want to run, fight, hide, or yell.

**Remember how shame feels for you so you can recognize it the next time it crops up and stop it from controlling your thoughts, behaviors, and actions.**

(Shortform note: Sometimes, it can be difficult to recognize experiences of shame, even when we’re reflecting on past experiences as Brown recommends. If you’re still struggling to identify experiences with shame, some experts recommend conducting Brown’s recommendation backward: First, understand common reactions to shame. _Then,_ use this knowledge to identify situations where you reacted similarly and might have been experiencing shame. Once you’ve identified experiences of shame, you can then expand on how they felt as Brown recommends. Experts explain that some common reactions that might indicate you’re experiencing shame are sudden feelings of panic, difficulty breathing, the urge to flee, or flashbacks to traumatic events.)

##### Step #2: Identify the Root Causes of Your Shame

**Brown explains that to identify the root causes of your shame, you must confront the disdained identities that trigger you.** To do this, consider the identities that you value and want to uphold and the identities that you look down on and don’t want to be associated with. For example, if you highly value the identity of being smart, one of the causes of your shame might be being associated with the opposite—being stupid.

Identifying the identities you disdain is crucial for two reasons. First, it allows you to recognize situations that may trigger your shame so that you can respond productively with _courage_ and _compassion_ rather than being consumed by _fear_ and _blame._ Second, identifying the identities you disdain will indicate which negative beliefs you need to work on overcoming so they no longer cause you shame—we’ll discuss this further in Practice #2.

> **Identify Your Disdained Identities Through Self-Testing**
> 
> While identifying your shameful identities may provide the benefits Brown lists, the process might not be as straightforward as she presents. Psychologists explain that identifying core beliefs (like the identities you disdain and why you disdain them) can be difficult because they’re often deeply ingrained and unconscious. So, Brown’s advice might not be enough to pull them from the depths of your mind.
> 
> Instead, experts recommend conducting a self-observational experiment. For one week, immediately write down every negative thought that pops into your head—in Brown’s context, ones that pertain to someone’s (or your own) identity. For example, if you see someone wearing ripped jeans and cringe at their fashion sense, write it down.
> 
> At the end of the week, reflect on each negative thought to uncover patterns and the negative core beliefs that caused them. In Brown’s context, this would mean analyzing your thoughts to ascertain which disdained identities caused them and uncovering _why_ you hold those beliefs about that identity. For example, maybe you realize that you have a pattern of looking down at people who dress in a way you perceive as “revealing.” This might be because you went to a conservative private school where this style was banned for being "inappropriate."

#### Practice #2: Develop Critical Awareness of Shame

**Brown explains that a second vital practice in developing empathy and combating shame is to understand shame with _critical awareness_**. Brown defines critical awareness (as it relates to shame) as an understanding of why we deem certain identities as shameful, how shame around these identities impacts society, who’s most affected by the shame of identities, and who benefits the most from them. Try to understand each of the disdained identities you identified in Practice #1 with critical awareness.

To develop critical awareness about shame, think of an identity that makes you feel ashamed. Which components of this shameful identity contradict society’s or your inner circle’s expectations? Then, think of the ideal you feel like you're supposed to be living up to instead, and consider its impact on society at large: Who suffers because of this ideal's existence, and who profits from it?

For example, you may feel ashamed for looking “poor” rather than “upper-class.” Looking “poor” could mean wearing unfashionable clothes or owning outdated technology instead of always wearing new, fashionable clothes and having the newest technology—these being things that society expects “upper-class” people to do. On a societal level, the shame around this identity causes people to judge each other's worth based on the materials they own. This materialism probably serves to benefit big businesses at the expense of average people who feel ashamed for looking poor.

**Critical awareness makes you realize that most disdained identities are unfairly demonized and stem from unrealistic expectations that harm one group of people to benefit another.** Brown explains that this realization helps you combat shame in a few ways.

First, it makes you understand that failing to meet unrealistic or unfair expectations _doesn’t_ make you defective (boosting _courage_). Second, it makes you realize that you’re not the only person suffering from these expectations and pressures—others are dealing with similar pain (fostering _compassion)_. Finally, sharing this realization with others can decrease the prevalence of shame and help de-stigmatize “shameful” identities (helping you _connect_ with others).

> **Classical Conceptualization and Interpretations of Critical Awareness**
> 
> Originally, the concept of critical awareness, also called critical consciousness or critical perspective, was developed by a Brazilian philosopher, Paulo Freire, in an attempt to help students overcome academic oppression. He defined critical consciousness as the ability to recognize oppressive social constructs and expectations that shape society and take action to derail them—for instance, taking action to deconstruct the oppressive societal expectation of appearing “rich” that we discussed above. While Brown’s use of critical awareness applies specifically to “shame” rather than "oppression" as a whole, the underlying purpose of Brown’s critical awareness remains the same—to identify how and why people feel or are treated as lesser so that we can combat it.
> 
> While some experts interpret Freiro’s concept of critical awareness as only having one component, _reflection_ , many experts interpret it as having two: _critical reflection_ and _critical action_. Brown’s explanation of critical awareness seems to fall into the two-component interpretation of the concept.
> 
> _Critical reflection_ requires you to (1) think critically about accepted beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and assumptions, (2) determine the hidden interests underlying these constructs, and (3) identify how they impact everyday life. This process of reflection aligns with Brown's recommendation on how to develop critical awareness of shame.
> 
> _Critical action_ requires you to act to minimize the oppression you discovered during your critical reflection. Experts note that critical action often manifests as women sharing advice, support, and information with each other. This process of critical action mirrors Brown’s advice to use your critical awareness to share your insights, provide support to others, and de-stigmatize disdained identities to prevent them from causing shame (and to boost courage, connection, and compassion in turn).

#### Practice #3: Learn to Talk About Shame and Connect With Others

**Brown’s final practice for developing empathy and combating shame is learning how to talk about shame and connect with others.** We connect with others by sharing experiences and establishing mutual support. This is crucial to combating shame because it facilitates the empathy element of _connection,_ which helps you put _courage_ and _compassion_ into action. Further, once you learn how to express your own shame and ask for support, you’ll be better equipped to listen to others and provide _them_ with support.

(Shortform note: Research supports the idea that having social support systems is crucial to building resilience against negative experiences and emotions (like shame). Studies have even noted a link between social support and the neurocognitive systems and genetic mechanisms related to resilience. However, like Brown, Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen explain that learning _how_ to talk about our experiences and listen to others is crucial to ensuring that these connections have a _positive_ effect. In _Difficult Conversations, _Stone, Patton, and Sheen explain that if we don’t share our feelings in a productive way and truly listen to others when they share theirs, we could end up misunderstanding each other, not getting what we need, and ultimately damaging our relationships).

##### How To Talk About Shame

**Before you can effectively connect with others, you must first learn how to talk about shame**. Brown explains that shame is a complex and often undiscussed topic, meaning most people don’t have the vocabulary to express their feelings and experiences. Consequently, to have a productive discussion, you must understand how to effectively express yourself and understand others.

**To constructively talk about shame, put everything you’ve learned in Practice #1 and Practice #2 into words—** explain the identity that’s causing your fear, how it makes you feel, why it makes you feel that way, and what kind of support you need instead.

For example, if you ask a question in school and a classmate makes you feel stupid by implying that your questions are dumb, you can explain to them:

“When I ask questions and you say things like ‘wasn’t that obvious?’, you really hurt me and make me feel stupid. I ask questions because I want to ensure that I fully understand topics, but when you make negative remarks like that, it discourages me from wanting to learn and creates a hostile environment. Instead, I’d prefer if you either offered to answer my questions or remained quiet so the professor can answer them.”

(Shortform note: While the authors of _Difficult Conversations_ agree with Brown’s recommendations for talking about feelings (like shame), they recommend a slightly different approach to truly _ensuring_ a positive outcome. First, control your emotions before entering the conversation. Otherwise, you may engage in negative behaviors like yelling or blaming. Further, instead of sharing your fears, feelings, explanations, and needs all in one go, give the other person the opportunity to respond to each factor. After explaining why you feel the way you do, let the other person share their own feelings. Then, solve the issue _together_ so that both parties' needs are fulfilled.)

##### How to Connect With Others

Once you’re able to effectively express your experiences of shame to others and ask for their support, Brown says that **you can use these abilities to support others and prevent shame**.

**To support others, be willing to listen to their experiences and pain**. When they share their story with you, you can laugh, cry, and feel their emotions with them by tapping into your own experiences. You can share your story with them and let them know that they’re not alone in their pain. You can reassure them that they aren’t defective and provide them with a critical perspective on shame to help them see the bigger picture.

(Shortform note: When you’re listening to others, sharing their emotions and stories, and offering them strategies for overcoming shame, how can you ensure you come across as sincerely _empathetic_ rather than merely _sympathetic_ or pushy? Experts offer various suggestions for ensuring the people you support feel truly heard and valued. First, don’t do things like change the topic, try to make the other person feel better by sharing your “worse” experience, or provide advice unless they ask for it. In addition, thank them for being brave enough to share with you, clarify that you understand what they’re feeling and why, point out their strengths, and remind them that you care and are always there to listen.)

**Another way to support others and change the culture of shame is speaking up when you see people being cruel.** If you’re in a group, you can stop a shamer by asking a question that makes them reconsider their actions, and you can redirect the conversation away from shame.

For example, if someone is casting doubt on another person’s intelligence, you can redirect the conversation by saying something like, “Maybe he’s really busy with work and didn’t have time to study. I wonder if it would help to form a study group and ask if he’d like to join.” That way, you’re making the shamer confront their negative actions while simultaneously suggesting a way to provide support to the person being shamed.

(Shortform note: If you’re constantly trying and failing to shift the conversation away from a culture of shame, the healthier thing to do might be to make better friends. Experts explain that our mindsets and expectations of what’s acceptable (and not) are often shaped by the people we spend time with. So if your friends seem unwilling to give up their shaming behaviors, the next best thing is probably to remove yourself from those friends and their shame culture, and make friends that have healthier mindsets and a stronger resilience to shame.)

When questioning and redirecting the conversation doesn’t work, directly address the issue with the shamer in a private conversation. Use the technique from the previous section to explain to the shamer how they’re causing shame, how it makes others feel, why it makes them feel that way, and how they can provide support instead. Brown emphasizes avoiding confrontation in a group setting because you’re likely to cause more shame when you bring public attention to the shamers' bad behavior.

(Shortform note: Many experts agree that holding others accountable for their bad behavior (like shaming) is important to creating positive environments and culture. However, others explain that it’s not always your place to do so—even if you think you’re witnessing a shaming incident like those Brown discusses. For example, maybe you think someone is being shamed and is too shy to confront their shamer, but they actually don’t feel ashamed at all. In this scenario, confronting the perceived “shamer” could create issues for everyone involved. Before interjecting on someone else's behalf, have a conversation with that person to determine how they feel about the situation and whether they feel intervention is necessary.)
