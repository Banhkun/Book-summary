## Chapter 2: Teenage Years

Ed would spend even more time with computers in his teen years.

### Age 12: The Internet

> **Context: Complete Separation of Online and Real Life**
> 
> **In the 90s, unlike today, your online persona was completely separate from your real self.** This anonymity meant you were free to be as creative and open as you liked. You never had to worry about your reputation, or looking like a hypocrite, or if people would make fun of your tacky GeoCities site. People posted about whatever they liked, hoping to sway others to their opinion. Because the Internet was anonymous, you could easily change your mind and reinvent yourself anytime.
> 
> The Internet also encouraged creating new, separate identities via role-playing games, especially MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games). To play these games, you had to create an avatar, or “alt.” You could be any of a group of stock medieval characters including a thief, wizard, or warrior. You could also have more than one “alt” and switch between them whenever you liked.
> 
> **Everything would change in the 2000s when the government and businesses started to link online personas to people’s real-life identities.**

When Ed was approximately 12, he decided to spend as much time as he possibly could online. The Internet became an obsession. He became paler, sedentary, and slept at school instead of at night. His grades fell again. He didn’t mind because he was getting an education online and his parents were happy enough with this reasoning—for a while.

Ed especially liked learning about technical subjects and playing games, but he learned about all sorts of subjects. **He sometimes felt like he wanted to consume the entire Internet. Every moment he wasn’t online new things were going up and he was missing them.** When his family members kicked him off the computer, he’d print things to read, or he’d sneak online at night when everyone else was asleep.

#### Chatting Online

There were a few ways to chat with people online, and Ed liked online bulletin-board systems (BBSes). Ed mostly used them to ask questions about building computers and received plenty of personal, generous responses. Reflecting back on this as an adult, Ed thinks most people on the Internet were civil because there was a high bar for entry. It wasn’t easy or convenient to use the Internet—you had to plug your computer into a phone jack and it could take whole minutes to establish the dial-up connection. If you were willing to go to the trouble to get online, you were worth talking to.

Ed loved the freedom anonymity gave him. He didn’t have to be a 12-year-old boy, he could be anyone, and he created a variety of personas for himself. Whenever he had what he considered a stupid or amateur question, he’d ask it on an amateur board under a new name. Or, if he posted something inflammatory and people hated the post (they couldn’t hate _him_ because they didn’t know who he was), he’d drop the name and pick up a new one. Sometimes, he’d even use the new name to join the mob complaining about what he’d previously posted himself. He felt this was a relief. Thinking back to this time as an adult, **Ed thinks it was important that he could do or say stupid things on the Internet and not be held accountable.** When he made mistakes, no one knew it was him who’d made a mistake, and it was easy to recover.

Ed finally had to reveal his age after one of his BBSes tried to set up in-person meetings. People wanted him to go and he finally had to explain why he couldn’t. No one minded that he was young though; in fact, his correspondents became more encouraging.

#### MMORPGs

When Ed played MMORPGs, he enjoyed trying to figure out which alts belonged to the same person. Based on how their alts spoke or acted, he could see patterns between characters that suggested they were voiced by the same person. He also liked trying to make his alts as distinct as possible so that no one would figure out they were played by the same user.

#### Family Tensions

Ed’s obsession with the computer was inconvenient for his family, especially his sister. The Internet was dial-up, so the phone and Internet couldn’t be used at the same time, and Ed would use the Internet so frequently Jessica would miss calls from her friends. As revenge, sometimes she’d pick up the phone when Ed was in the middle of something online to break the connection. You can’t save or pause MMORPGs because they’re live—other people are playing it at the same time—so when you get interrupted, your character dies.

Ed’s parents handled this by installing another phone line and switching the Internet plan to unlimited.

### Age 13-15: Hacking

> **Context: Hacking**
> 
> Hacking doesn’t only happen in the tech world.**Hacking is simply finding a way to exploit the weakness of a system**. When people build systems, they rely on assumptions they haven’t necessarily thought through and sometimes don’t even test their systems. They only consider how their system is supposed to work. A hacker discovers how it actually works, or how they could make it work differently.
> 
> Hacker culture is based in playfulness and cleverness, and it generally comes with antiauthoritarian politics. Many hackers believe more things should be free and publicly accessible.

As Ed entered his teenage years, he encountered the same struggle all teenagers have to deal with—feeling like they’re adults but being treated like children. This was where he really started questioning the rules—if there wasn’t a good justification for a rule to be followed, it was just a power trip. At this time in his life, Ed thought in terms of black and white—binary is only 0 or 1, false or true. He hadn’t developed nuance.

Ed’s teenage rebellion consisted of hacking, which he considers to be the most educational, healthiest, and sanest way to establish independence. **Hacking is a great way to put yourself on equal footing with an adult because all you have to do is reason, which doesn’t have anything to do with your age.**

#### Hacking School

On Ed’s first day of school when he was 13, his teachers gave out their grading policies and syllabi. **For the first time, Ed knew how grades were calculated. And once he knew how the system worked, he could see how to hack it.**

Homework, papers, class participation, tests, and quizzes were all worth a percentage of his history grade. Homework took Ed a long time, he didn’t need to do it to do well on quizzes and tests, and it was only 10 percent of his grade. If he stopped doing it and just forfeited the 10 percent, he’d still easily pass the class. Other classes had similar percentage breakdowns, and he stopped doing homework.

This gave him a lot of free time—until he explained his calculations to his math teacher when asked why he never did homework. His teacher smiled, but the next day, he gave out a new syllabus that stated anyone who missed more than six homework assignments would automatically fail.

#### Traditional Hacking

Ed also did some computer hacking. He didn’t steal anyone’s identity—even if that had occurred to him and he’d wanted to, the Internet wasn’t yet monetized and the only theft he’d heard of was “phreaking,” getting free phone calls. Instead, **he hacked games to give himself extra lives or special abilities.**

**Ed also hacked the website of the US’s nuclear research facility,** Los Alamos National Laboratory. Ed was worried about nuclear war and found himself researching the US nuclear program. He ended up on the Los Alamos National Laboratory website and quickly discovered a security problem.

The lab used an open directory structure on their website. This means that the website’s URL showed where and how the site’s files were organized. For example, a URL in an open directory structure might look like this: site.com/sitefiles/docs/publicfile.doc. Publicfile.doc is the document the website intended to show you, but you can access all of the documents in the file tree by typing site.com/sitefiles.

Using this knowledge, **Ed was able to access some documents that only employees with security clearances should have been able to.** It was personal info rather than blueprints of the plant, but it still scared him. He emailed the lab’s webmaster, who never responded. Next, Ed tried calling the lab. He left a voicemail for the IT department and waited, checking the site regularly to see if the structure was fixed. Weeks later, the lab called to tell him they’d fixed it and thanked him. They realized he was a teenager and told him to get in touch when he was 18.

#### Divorce

Ed’s parents got a divorce. Lonnie moved out, and Wendy sold the house and moved to a condo in Ellicott City with Jessica and Ed. Jessica got into the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and also moved out.

**Ed blamed himself for his parents’ divorce—if he’d been a better child, it wouldn’t have happened.** He tried to be more grown-up and got a cell phone that he wore attached to his belt like an adult. He became closer to mentors rather than his parents. After the divorce, everyone in the family started keeping secrets.

#### Mononucleosis

In sophomore year, Ed came down with mononucleosis. He was so tired he couldn’t go to school or even stay awake long enough to do more than play games on the computer. **He eventually became too sick to even play on the computer and it was a dark time emotionally.** He missed four months of school and then got a letter that told him he’d have to repeat the year. He absolutely did not want to do this and it kicked him out of his slump. He looked for a hack.

**Ed discovered you don’t actually need a high school diploma to get into college and got himself accepted at Anne Arundel Community College.** He went to class two days a week, which was all he could handle as he was still recovering. It wasn’t a very social experience—the college didn’t have much of a campus life, but Ed didn’t mind. He was younger than anyone else, too sick to do much socializing anyway, and was fine with the anonymity. He liked his college classes better than his high school classes. (He did eventually get his GED.)

### Ages 16-17: Ed’s First Tech Job

> **Context: The Tech Industry**
> 
> _Professional Certification_
> 
> **In the early 2000s, professional industry certifications were becoming a requirement for jobs in the tech industry.** Job postings were starting to require official accreditation from companies like IBM and Cisco if the job was working with their products.
> 
> Microsoft Certified Professional series certifications were the most prestigious. There were a few options and the highest certification was Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), with which you’d get a starting salary of $40,000. It wasn’t an easy certification to get, but it also didn’t require you to be a genius.
> 
> There were more general certifications as well, that didn’t have to do with specific companies’ products. You could get “A+ Certification” for serving and repairing computers and “Net+ Certification” for networking.
> 
> **Though these certifications were becoming an industry standard, they weren’t necessarily an indicator of skill, and they changed as the industry invented new ones.**
> 
> _Freelance Industry_
> 
> During the dot-com boom, when a large company wanted a stronger Internet presence and a website, they’d hire a PR firm or ad agency. The PR firm or ad agencies didn’t know much about the Internet, only enough to write a job description for a web designer. They’d post this on a freelance work portal and mom-and-pop companies would put in bids for the job.
> 
> The mom-and-pop companies were so competitive that they priced their services very low. Additionally, the companies had to pay a cut to the work portal, so it was hard to make any money. Companies also didn’t get any credit—the PR firm or ad agency would claim they’d done the project. It was easy for clients to take advantage of mom-and-pop companies.

When Ed was attending college, he met Mae in Japanese class. Mae was a published artist who also owned a web-design business. Ed was infatuated with her and started working as a web designer for her company.

Mae was good at the business side of things, especially once Ed took over some of the web design work, and she’d try to get jobs directly rather than going through the work portals. She was an illustrator so she could also offer logo design and branding services.

Ed enjoyed the job—even though it was sometimes repetitive, he got to spend time with Mae—but realized he needed to certify to go farther in the field. He got his MCSE certification from Johns Hopkins University.

### Age 18: 9/11

> **Context: 9/11**
> 
> 9/11 changed many things in the US. The government gave itself, and its intelligence agencies, larger budgets and more power, the extent of which wouldn’t be discovered for years. The threat of terror was used to justify everything, including the secrecy around all the changes.
> 
> There was a shift in the population too. The world narrowed into two groups, America and its supporters, and everyone else. There was a huge surge in patriotism and fear. Shooting ranges put Arab men on targets. People bought guns and cell phones.

On September 11, 2001, Ed arrived at Mae’s house for work. Mae lived on base and her husband worked at Fort Meade, so Ed and Mae heard about the attack on the Twin Towers quickly. The base evacuated because Fort Meade could have been the next target.

As Ed left Mae’s, he was able to get in touch with his mother, who was safe, but it took him some time to find out about the rest of his family. Ed was particularly worried about his grandfather, who now worked for the FBI and regularly visited federal buildings. Fortunately, he was fine.

**Later in life, Ed would develop more nuanced feelings about the government’s response to 9/11. At the time, though, he fully supported the war.** Mae didn’t, and they grew apart. Ed distanced himself from the anti-institutional views of hacker culture and his parents’ apolitical patriotism. **He’d never wanted to serve before, but he did now.**

#### How to Serve?

Ed thought he’d be most useful behind a computer, but a normal IT job didn’t seem like enough of an outlet for his newfound patriotic fervor. Hacking for the NSA or CIA would have been ideal, but they required a college degree, and Ed only had community college credits and his MCSE certification. (However, intelligence agencies would sometimes waive their requirement for a degree if you were a military veteran.)

Ed enlisted. He chose the army, which his family didn’t approve of because the Coast Guard considers the army leadership crazy.
