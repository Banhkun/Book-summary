## Chapter 5: Working for the CIA

> **Context: CIA Backgrounder**
> 
> _Headquarters_
> 
> Contrary to what you see in movies, CIA headquarters isn’t in the building in Langley, Virginia with the agency seal on the floor. That’s the Old Headquarters Building. **The New Headquarters Building is in McLean, Virginia, and that’s where most CIA employees work.**
> 
> _Reorganization_
> 
> **9/11 was a massive intelligence failure and as a result, Congress and the executive branch reorganized the CIA and adjusted its powers.** Previously, the director of the CIA was in charge of the whole American intelligence community. Congress reduced the director’s power to control of only the CIA, and forced out the existing director, George Tenet. They replaced him with Porter Goss, who was a former CIA officer but also a politician, a Florida Republican congressman.
> 
> The CIA was reorganized into five directorates, the Directorates of:
> 
>   * **Operations.** The DO did the actual spying.
> 
>   * **Intelligence.** The DI analyzed and synthesized the information gained from the DO spying.
> 
>   * **Science and Technology.** The DST was like the Q character in James Bond films—they supplied, built, and taught spies how to use weapons, communication devices, and computers.
> 
>   * **Administration.** The DA liaised with the government and included departments like HR and law.
> 
>   * **Support.** The DS was the largest and included everyone who supported the agency, including tech workers, doctors, cafeteria workers, and so on. The DS’s main function was to work with the CIA’s global communications infrastructure—basically, ensuring that the other directorates could communicate with each other and agencies, but only as much as allowed. DS maintained security and controlled digital access to CIA servers.
> 
> 

> 
> _Morale_
> 
> **After 9/11, morale at the CIA was at an all-time low.** CIA employees viewed the reorganization and other political maneuverings as betrayal. They felt blamed for some of the Bush administration’s mistakes and they didn’t like Goss as a director because he was a politician. They felt that having a partisan director was an attempt to weaponize the agency. Additionally, Goss was unpopular because he forced retirements, laid people off, and fired people. The CIA, now understaffed, used even more contractors than before.
> 
> The CIA was also unpopular with the public because information about black site prisons and other activities was leaked around the same time.
> 
> _Indoctrination_
> 
> On their first day, contract technologist employees go to a session called Indoc, short for indoctrination. The session has a few goals:
> 
>   * Convince the attendees that they’re special, elite, and would have access to information even Congress wouldn’t. The author says computer geniuses don’t need much convincing—they already have a healthy sense of their own importance. They’ve always been able to do and learn things with computers that others haven’t. They’re used to making decisions on behalf of others, acting independently, and controlling machines.
> 
>   * Emphasize security practices, such as not telling anyone where you work or what you do, being careful with documents, and not bringing your insecure cell into the workplace.
> 
>   * Present the bad guys. The Indoc leaders show a Powerpoint presentation of former contractors and employees who betrayed the CIA, accompanied by warnings about ruin and imprisonment.
> 
> 

> 
> **Entering the intelligence community affects a person psychologically.** She suddenly has access to a bunch of insider information, she’s supposed to play a part—an ordinary person—and the indoctrination creates a group mentality that the group is loyal to the intelligence community, not the law.
> 
> _How to Be Ordinary_
> 
> The intelligence community tries to get all its employees to be “ordinary.” As an employee, you try to be just like everyone else, act the same, talk the same, drive the same boring car, live in an ordinary house, wear mainstream clothing, and so on. Your thrills come from successfully convincing others that you’re just like them. This self-denial can have a profound effect on your psychology. **As you learn more about others, so you can copy it, you forget bits of yourself, including things like politics.**
> 
> _CIA Technology_
> 
> The CIA has its own intranet and versions of Facebook, Wikipedia, and Google. The CIA intranet contains far more detail than the media about current events and the government.
> 
> **Whenever someone uses a computer at the CIA, she has to consent to her activities being monitored by checking a box.** The author suspects this is the reason people working in intelligence aren’t very concerned about online tracking. They don’t give mass surveillance a pass because they think it protects the country; they’re just so used to not having any privacy that they don’t empathize with the public’s desire for it.
> 
> _Times of Change_
> 
> When the author entered the CIA, it was during a time of change. **The older generation of CIA employees (not contractors), hadn’t or didn’t want to keep up with technology, and were working at tech jobs such as the help desk. The young, incoming contractors were doing the work that required high security clearances.** The younger generation generally had low opinions of the career civil servants.

### Contract Work With the CIA

Ed’s first contracting job was with COMSO. **He was part of the CIA’s Directorate of Support and his job was to manage CIA server architecture.** He would have access to all the systems that stored and accessed intelligence. He also had access to COMSEC (communications security), which involves the codes that are used to protect all CIA information. These codes are considered some of the most secret of the CIA’s secrets. **At the time, it didn’t occur to Ed that the breadth of his access might be indicative of a problem.**

Ed worked the night shift with a man named Frank. Ed didn’t find the job too difficult and wrote scripts to do his work for him. **This gave Ed most of his shift to do whatever he wanted, which was usually looking things up in the CIA intranet.** This put him back in touch with his childhood curiosity with the Internet and his desire to know everything. The media might report a quote from an anonymous senior official, but in the CIA database, Ed could find the person’s real name and access their entire personal and employment history. He also searched for conspiracy theories like aliens and chemtrails.

Frank didn’t do much work and Ed eventually learned that **the most important part of Frank’s job was doing a storage backup on a miniature tape format that was so old Ed didn’t recognize it.** Tape backups are more reliable than digital technology, and Frank was one of the only people both old enough to know how to use them and willing to work a night shift.

#### Lindsay

The CIA’s Virginia headquarters was a long commute from Ellicott City in Maryland. Lindsay couldn’t move to join Ed because she was still finishing school, but they met up on weekends.

### Training for the CIA

> **Context: Basic Telecommunications Training Program**
> 
> _The Hill_
> 
> **The Hill is a training facility in Warrenton, Virginia** , that teaches, among other things, the Basic Telecommunications Training Program. The Hill is central to the field communications network of the CIA, has two data centers, and is more important than CIA headquarters.
> 
> _Technical Information Security Officers (TISOs)_

In foreign countries, the CIA doesn’t want any outsiders working inside government facilities, so they hire TISOs to work at missions, embassies, or consulates. **TISOs deal with all technical infrastructure ranging from computers to solar panels to security—anything that gets plugged in or has something plugged into it is their domain.** Additionally, TISOs have to know how to both build and destroy a lot of these systems. If a location is under siege, the TISO is responsible for destroying all the data before getting out themselves and/or sending just-learned information home.

> TISO is a CIA job instead of a State Department job, even though the State Department is the organization that actually owns the embassy buildings, because these days, embassies are primarily used for espionage. There’s no reason to have a physical presence in a foreign country now that airplanes and electronic communication exist. Embassies do some paperwork such as renewing passports or sending demarches, but they’re mainly used to legitimize intelligence gathering. TISOs are usually called “attachés.”

After exploring the CIA databases, Ed realized how international the CIA is and decided that he wanted to work abroad as a CIA employee rather than as a contractor. He applied for a CIA tech position and was accepted. **Getting into the CIA required an Indoc session, just like for contractors, but as a government employee, Ed also had to swear an oath to the US Constitution.**

#### Training

Ed went to the Hill to train to be a TISO. Ed, like other students, lived in a dilapidated Comfort Inn hotel during the six-month training period.

Ed’s classes were about all things technology. For example, he once had to haul an eighty-pound suitcase of Cold War-era communications gear up the roof of a building. Then, using only a sheet of coordinates and a compass, he had to find CIA stealth satellites and send CIA headquarters a radio message. He also learned about Van Eck phreaking (mirroring someone else’s monitor), how to service cables (physical cables connecting agency sites underground and underwater), and terminals (computers). Ed’s was the last year that TISOs studied these older technologies.

One day, the stairs at the Comfort Inn collapsed. This was a turning point—many of Ed’s classmates had been concerned about how the school’s administration was violating federal labor laws by requiring unpaid overtime, refusing to honor family benefits, or denying leave. Ed wasn’t too bothered because he was used to this kind of exploitation in the industry, but some of his older classmates weren’t having it.**Ed’s classmates approached him and asked him to talk to the school’s head about their concerns because he was well-liked.**

Ed agreed, partly because he valued justice, partly because it sounded fun. He wrote an email to the school’s head, who told him that the class would have to just suck it up for the remaining 12 weeks of the program. At this point, his classmates gave up. They were used to broken management and didn’t have the time to keep making a fuss. Ed, however, was now fueled by justice, and wrote an email to the school head’s boss, and then his boss.

**Ed’s emails improved conditions a lot; however, he’d violated the chain of command** and caused his superiors to question his loyalty to the mission. Instead of posting him to the Special Requirements Division, where he’d hoped to work, they sent him to Geneva.

### Employment With the CIA

> **Context: Intelligence Backgrounder**
> 
> _Types of Intelligence_
> 
> There are several different types of intelligence. _Permanent Record_ refers to the following three types:
> 
>   * **SIGINT** is short for signals intelligence. This type of intelligence comes from intercepted communications such as phone, fax, and computers.
> 
>     * Cyber intelligence specifically refers to intelligence gathered from the Internet.
> 
>     * The NSA focuses on SIGINT.
> 
>   * **HUMINT** is short for human intelligence. This type of intelligence is collected by case officers (COs) who gather intelligence face-to-face, by talking to people.
> 
>     * COs tend to be a particular brand of people—good liars, cynics, smokers, and drinkers.
> 
>     * The CIA focuses on HUMINT.
> 
>   * **LOVEINT __** is short for love intelligence. This is an inside joke rather than a real intelligence type. LOVEINT refers to using surveillance for personal use, such as spying on your ex-girlfriend.
> 
> 

> 
> **Since the birth of the Internet, SIGINT has become more widely applicable than HUMINT.** For example, before the Internet, if a spy wanted to get something off of someone’s computer, she had to find a way to physically access it. There was plenty of opportunity to get caught while downloading info or installing new hardware or software. After the Internet, if a spy wanted to access someone’s computer, all she had to do was send their target an email with malware. She didn’t have to try to bribe, turn, or coerce her target. Her target need never even know he was being spied on.
> 
> As a result, the roles of HUMINT and SIGINT changed. **HUMINT would figure out who was worth hacking, and the SIGINT would take care of collecting the intelligence.** SIGINT and HUMINT often work together. For example, the author once created an infected thumb drive that could hack UN delegates’ computers, and someone else had to do the actual plugging in of the thumb drive.
> 
> _Anonymity on the Internet_
> 
> The Internet made a lot of things both easier and harder at the same time. For example, if a CO couldn’t find information about a target on the CIA databases,**the CO would probably be able to find the target on the public Internet. However, on the public Internet, any search was trackable.**
> 
> Whenever you search something on the Internet, your request typically goes directly to the website you’re aiming for. Your request is tagged with source and destination headers, which tell anyone who’s looking where the request is going and where it came from.
> 
> The CIA didn’t have a good solution. Whenever a CO needed to search someone on the public Internet, they were supposed to contact the CIA and get them to do the search for them. The CIA would do so using a “nonattributable research system,” which involved setting up a front business that would have some legitimate reason to do the search. Setting up a front was a lot of work—it needed a physical address, URL, website, and servers—and if it wasn’t done properly, the business could be traced back to the CIA.
> 
> _Tor_
> 
> **The best way to maintain anonymity on the Internet is to use the Tor Project.** Tor works a little like the front business, but better.
> 
> When you request a website using Tor, your request doesn’t go directly to the website you’re aiming for. Instead, it goes through a chain of Tor servers. The servers are hosted by volunteers all over the world.
> 
> The first server—the gateway—knows what your request is, but not where it’s going. By the time your request eventually gets to the website you’re looking for, it’s source header is the last Tor server in the chain. As a result, the content of the request can never be connected to where it came from.

Ed worked as a TISO at the US embassy in Geneva for almost three years. Geneva was home to many important world organizations such as the EU, the World Trade Organization, and CERN. As a result, the Geneva embassy piloted the most up-and-coming programs and technology, and**Ed began to learn more about how big-picture intelligence and surveillance worked.**

Part of Ed’s job was to teach COs how to use SIGINT, for example, how to use Tor. Ed loved Tor. It was a bit of a return to the anonymous Internet of his childhood.

#### Ed’s HUMINT Experience

Once, a CO brought Ed to an embassy party and Ed happened to sit next to a banker who handled Saudi accounts. The US suspected Saudi Arabia was financing terror, so Ed acted curious and listened (the usual HUMINT technique). Then Ed found a CO, Cal, and pointed out the banker.

Cal worked on the banker but got nowhere, so Cal finally took the banker out drinking and convinced him to drive himself home. Cal called the cops and the banker was arrested for drinking and driving. Cal insinuated himself into the banker’s life—driving him places and helping him pay the fine—but when Cal finally talked to the banker about becoming an asset, the banker said no. The HUMINT operation had taken a month and gone nowhere. Ed understood why the intelligence community was moving from HUMINT to SIGINT.

#### Lindsay

While Ed was training, he rarely talked to Lindsay on the phone or went to visit her. Now that she’d finished school, she moved to Geneva to join him.
