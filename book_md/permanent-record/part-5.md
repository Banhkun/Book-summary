## Part 5: Blowing the Whistle | Chapter 9: Revealing Mass Surveillance

Parts 1-4 covered Ed’s life until approximately 2012. Part 5 starts on May 20, 2013, the day Ed left the US to blow the whistle, and continues until 2019, when _Permanent Record_ was published.

### Preparing to Leave the US

In spring 2013, Ed made preparations to meet the journalists outside the US. He had a hard time setting up meetings with them because he couldn’t give them a time or date too far in advance, and they didn’t even know who he was. Ed also had trouble finding a place to meet them. He eventually settled on Hong Kong because it had unrestricted Internet and was independent enough to resist the US.

Ed made preparations to leave. He took out cash for Lindsay, so the government couldn’t seize the money in his accounts, and he erased and encrypted his computers. He also encouraged Lindsay to go camping for a weekend and invited his mother to visit immediately after, so that they could support each other after he’d left

#### Leaving

The morning Ed left, May 20, 2013, he still couldn’t tell Lindsay anything. She noticed he was being unusually affectionate but believed him when he said he was sorry that he’d been so busy with work lately. The moment she left, he cried.

Then he told work he needed emergency time off because of his epilepsy, packed, left a note for Lindsay that he’d had to go away for work, and flew to Hong Kong.

### Meet-Up in Hong Kong

Ed was in Hong Kong, but the journalists weren’t. He knew Laura Poitras, who already had some documents, was definitely interested in meeting, but she wasn’t coming until she’d convinced Glenn Greenwald to come too. This was very stressful for Ed—if the NSA figured out what Ed was up to before he could share his documents, the world would never find out about STELLARWIND.

Ed hid in the Mira Hotel for ten days, not leaving his room because he worried someone would come in while he was gone and set up bugs. He spent this time pleading with the journalists to come and organized the material he was going to give them. He expected people would be skeptical of what he was saying so he worked on the best way to explain it. While he was most interested in how the tech worked, he planned to explain in terms of programs, using a more narrative approach.

#### Breaking the News

Laura, Glenn, and Glenn’s colleague Ewen MacAskill meet Ed in Hong Kong on June 2. From June 3-9, Ed talked to Glenn and Ewen while Laura filmed. At night, Ewen and Glenn would write up the day’s work, and Laura would edit her video and work remotely with another journalist, Bart Gellman.

**The _Guardian_ released Glenn’s first story on June 5.** It was about the NSA collecting data from Verizon, which the FISA Court had permitted. On June 6, a story about PRISM appeared in both the _Guardian_ and _Washington Post_.

#### Coming Forward

Ed’s office had tried to get in touch with him—he was supposed to have returned to work May 31—and he ignored their messages. The US government was working hard to identify the source of the leak and Ed knew that they’d soon figure out it was him. Ed also knew that if they identified him, they’d spin the story to misrepresent him so he looked crazy or morally suspect, and they’d shift the focus from what they’d done to what he’d done.

**Ed decided he’d reveal himself as the source of the leak before the government could.** Ewen wrote a story about him and Laura suggested doing a video statement. They didn’t have time to polish a video statement, so Laura used footage from the first day they’d met. The video went live on June 9.

#### Consequences

Ed knew that coming forward would have consequences including:

  * **Legal charges.** Ed had shared top secret information with the media, which was illegal. Ed was charged with political crime—crime against the state instead of against a person—under the Espionage Act on June 14.
  * **Extradition.** Ed should have been exempt from extradition because he was charged with political crime. (Often, those charged with “political crime” haven’t actually committed crimes; the charge is simply a way for an authoritarian government to control dissent.) However, the US government requested his extradition on June 21, expecting that Hong Kong, like most countries, wouldn’t dare to defy them.
  * **Discrediting of his character.** In the agency databases, Ed read about what the government did to other whistleblowers. The intelligence community would go through their surveillance of a person, find something, even something small, and then use it to discredit someone’s character. 
    * For example, the government tried to discredit Ed by referring to him as a contractor and “former Dell employee.” They also mentioned that he was a “job-hopper,” implying that he was overambitious and had problems with authority. 
  * **Harassment of his family, particularly Lindsay.** Ed thought Lindsay would understand why he’d done what he had, even if she wouldn’t forgive him.
  * **Public outcry.** When citizens found out that their governments had surveilled them, they would demand change and call for justice.



#### Legal Help

After Ed revealed his identity, two attorneys, Jonathan Man and Robert Tibbo, volunteered to take him on. They helped him get out of the Mira hotel when the press figured out he was staying there. Robert was good at finding safe houses, and Ed stayed with some of his other clients, refugees who had been unable to get permanent residency status. They were lovely, hospitable people and Ed was forever grateful for their help.

Ed appealed to the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, but while the UN tried to get him protection in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government decided to consider the US’s request for extradition. Ed cleared his computers and prepared to run.

### On the Run

> **Context: Ecuador**
> 
> **Ecuador and the US aren’t on particularly friendly terms.** Rafael Correa, when elected in 2007, rolled out policies intended to correct US interference in Ecuador, one of the major ones being that the country would consider its national debt “odious.” Odious debt is national debt that’s incurred while a country is being oppressed (in Ecuador’s case, by the US). As a result, no one can force the repayment of odious debt. A lot of US foreign policy is made by financiers, and they weren’t happy that Ecuador wouldn’t have to pay debts.
> 
> In 2013, Ecuador also supported political asylum and the Ecuadorian embassy in London hosted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks.

**Ed decided to head for Ecuador. However, there were no direct flights from Hong Kong, so getting to Ecuador was going to be a challenge** —even just passing through other countries could be dangerous. Ed would only be safe if he landed in non-extradition countries, and he shouldn’t even cross the airspace of any countries the US could manipulate.

The route was to fly to Moscow, then Havana, then Caracas, then Quito. It was the only possible route and it wasn’t perfect—there was a 20-hour layover in Russia, and going from Russia to Cuba involved crossing NATO airspace and going over Poland. Poland had helped the US government in the past, notably by allowing the CIA to torture people at black sites.

#### Help From WikiLeaks

Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, wanted to help Ed. A lot of people thought he had selfish motives for this, but reflecting back, Ed thinks Assange believed in the public’s right to know and simply wanted to help Ed stay out of prison. (A previous whistleblower who had been involved with WikiLeaks, Chelsea Manning, _had_ gone to prison.) Assange couldn’t personally help because he was also avoiding extradition, so he helped through Sarah Harrison, an editor for WikiLeaks and a journalist.

Sarah helped Ed because of her own conscience. She believed that journalism should challenge the government more than it did and wanted Ed to have a “better outcome.” (She never explained whose or what outcome she was referring to).

**Sarah flew to Hong Kong and set Ed up with a _laissez-passer_ —a UN travel document that was usually used for refugees who needed to cross borders.** Sarah traveled with Ed and on June 23, they landed in Sheremetyevo in Moscow.

#### Russian Customs and Airport

Ed had been trained by the intelligence community, especially the CIA, on how to go through customs inconspicuously. But, of course, his passport had his name on it, so he was automatically noticeable.

As Ed was going through passport control, he was told there was a problem with his passport. **Two security guards took him and Sarah to a room where an agent of the Federal Security Service, one of Russia’s intelligence agencies, tried to recruit him.** Ed cut the agent off right away—if you don’t stop a pitch and it’s recorded, a listener can decide that you were considering it, and even if you eventually say no, your reputation is still ruined.

**The Russian officials told Ed that US minister John Kerry had canceled his passport.** Sarah looked it up and discovered it was true. Ed was shocked that the US government would have stranded him in Russia, of all places.

The intelligence officer tried to recruit him again, after showing him a media scrum, and again, Ed refused. **The officials ignored the _laissez-passer_ document, and Ed and Sarah were stuck in the airport.** Ed got in touch with 27 countries, asking for political asylum, but none of them would take him, or said they’d only consider if after he’d already traveled there, which was impossible.

#### Asylum

**After 40 days in the airport, Ed eventually got temporary asylum from Russia.** The president of Bolivia had attended the Gas Exporting Countries Forum in Moscow, and when he left, the US diverted his plane to Vienna because they thought he had Ed aboard (the president had expressed solidarity for Ed).

This was hugely insulting to Russia and they knew the US would do the same thing again if they ever suspected Ed was on another plane. As a result, Ed got his asylum. Sarah got to go home, and Ed stayed in Russia, where he still lives as of 2019.
