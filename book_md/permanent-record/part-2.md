## Part 2: Army Career | Chapter 3: Service

Part 1 covered Ed’s childhood. Part 2 covers his brief stint in the army in 2004.

> **Context: Army Backgrounder**
> 
> _18 X-Ray_
> 
> After 9/11, many US programs were changing. **A new program called “18 X-Ray” screened incoming army applicants for Special Forces’ qualification courses at sign-up.** Previously, to get into Special Forces courses, you had to already be in the army.
> 
> _Injuries_
> 
> The army has a stigma about injuries for a few reasons:
> 
>   * The goal is to make soldiers feel invincible.
> 
>   * The army doesn’t want to be liable for mistraining.
> 
> 

> 
> **This results in injured recruits being seen as whiners or fakers, and it encourages people to hide injuries.** For example, one recruit hurt his hip but ignored it. By the time he got it looked at a week later, he had to go straight into surgery—his hip was broken and the break was sharp enough to slice nerves.

Ed qualified for the X-Ray program based on his performance in his entrance exams. Before he could take any special training, however, he had to go through basic training, which for him was held at Fort Benning, Georgia. Ed spent most of the journey there next to a giant man nicknamed Daisy who became one of his regular training partners. The buddy carries were tough for Ed because Daisy massively outweighed him. However, the army also used a lot of bodyweight training, which Ed had an advantage in because he was slight.

**Ed’s main impression of training was that the point was to make the recruits so exhausted that they couldn’t rebel or question orders.**

### Ed Is Injured

During a land navigation movement drill—map and compass navigation—Ed fell and injured himself. He was diagnosed with bilateral tibial fractures. The only way to heal was to keep weight off his legs, so he was benched for a few days before he would be reassessed. Ed was worried—if you miss more than three or four days of training, you’re in danger of having to restart basic training or being sent home. He’d lose his spot in the 18 X-Ray program if he didn’t complete basic training on time.

While Ed was injured, he was put on fireguard. His partner decided to go AWOL, which is a crime. Ed asked why the man had even told him—Ed was injured and the man would have had plenty of time to run away while Ed was at the latrine. He explained that Ed was the only one who listened. Ed believed him, went to the latrine, and didn’t tell anyone that the man was leaving.

**Ed was reassessed and the doctor said he couldn’t continue with basic training.** Ed could try again later, outside of the X-Ray program, or, he could leave the army on “administrative separation.” The doctor explained to Ed that this was a quick, low-paperwork way to leave the army that didn’t involve either an honorable or dishonorable discharge. Ed liked the idea and agreed. Then he saw the paperwork.

Ed had to sign a statement that said he was completely healed. It was a hack. The government was trying to get out of liability and paying him disability benefits. But Ed couldn’t get free without signing, so he did.
