## Chapter 8: How to Blow the Whistle

> **Context: Whistleblowing and Legislation**
> 
> _The History of Whistleblowing_
> 
> The first whistleblowers were sailors on the _Warren_ in 1777. Their _Warren_ was commanded by Commodore Esek Hopkins, who refused to fight in the Revolution, treated prisoners badly, and in general wasn’t fit for command. (He was also the Continental Navy’s commander in chief.) Ten sailors from the _Warren_ wrote to the Marine Committee, the highest level in the chain of command, letting them know what Hopkins was doing. Hopkins took legal action—a criminal libel suit—against two of the officers who had written to the Marine Committee.
> 
> Before the trial started, another sailor brought the issue to the Continental Congress. **The Continental Congress was horrified by the idea that someone could dismiss a serious complaint as libel and enacted a law to protect whistleblowers.** If someone in the government was misbehaving, authorities wanted to know about it—speaking up was a duty.
> 
> _The Fourth Amendment_
> 
> The Fourth Amendment protects “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects.” Computers didn’t exist at the time of the writing, but **the essence of the amendment is that if law enforcement wants to search you, your home, or your stuff, they need to prove there’s a good reason to do so.** Additionally, the reason must be specific—law enforcement thinks you’ve committed a specific crime. The warrant will specify the scope of the search and how long anyone has permission to search.
> 
> **The NSA had to carefully interpret the Fourth Amendment to justify mass surveillance.** According to the NSA, modern technology couldn’t count as “papers” or “effects,” and data couldn’t be considered personal property. For example, since you made a phone call, you’d already “shared” data with your phone company, so you no longer had any right to privacy.
> 
> The founders who wrote the Constitution saw the potential for abuses of power. The founders tried to mitigate abuses by dividing power into three government branches with equal powers. However, all three branches failed when it came to privacy and mass surveillance:
> 
>   * The **legislative branch** is the two houses of Congress. Congress didn’t stay informed about the capabilities and actions of the intelligence community, or if they did know, couldn’t or wouldn’t do anything about it.
> 
>     * For example, in 2013, the director of National Intelligence said under oath that the NSA didn’t mass surveil US citizens. Some of the congresspeople knew that wasn’t true but didn’t speak up.
>   * The **judicial branch** in the case of intelligence is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Its job is to grant warrants for collecting foreign intelligence. Before 9/11, the warrants were specific and individual; after, they were more general and could approve mass surveillance programs like upstream collection.
> 
>   * The **executive branch** is the president, and this is where all the problems started. Bush told the NSA to start mass surveillance after 9/11.
> 
> 


### Deciding to Act

In 2012, the intelligence community celebrated Constitution Day and Citizenship Day by sending around an email and setting up a table with free hard copies of the Constitution. Ed always took a copy, and this year, with everything weighing on his mind, he read it closely. The Fourth Amendment in particular resonated with him, because it covered privacy.

Unlike the NSA, Ed considers that our computer files count as “papers” and our data, including metadata, falls under “effects.” Our phones, clouds, and computers are also our “homes”—are you any more comfortable giving a stranger your unlocked phone than you are letting them into your house?

#### Leaking vs. Whistleblowing

Ed thinks leaking and whistleblowing are different. Leaking is releasing information for your own gain, while whistleblowing is releasing information for the good of the public. The intelligence community sometimes leaks their own information, which is often poorly thought out. For example, to announce the death of US citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi, the CIA had to admit their top secret drone program and kill list existed. The government tends to be okay with leaks when they benefit them. They ignore leaks that caused problems.

In the digital edge, the most effective whistleblowers come from lower down in the organization, the people who aren’t as inclined to maintain the status quo and who haven’t been with the intelligence community so long that they’re cynics.

#### How to Blow the Whistle?

**Ed couldn’t blow the whistle by talking to someone higher up the chain of command because the highest authorities knew—and had authorized—mass surveillance.**

He considered self-publishing (posting the docs online and sharing a link), but while it would have been the safest and easiest, he rejected it because it didn’t lend him enough authority. People on the Internet are always claiming to be leaking top secret information, and he didn’t want anyone to think he was just another conspiracy theorist. Additionally, no one would understand the documents without context.

Ed decided he needed an institution or a person to release the information to prove authenticity, mitigate his biases, and help explain the information. He considered WikiLeaks, but felt this would be too much like self-publishing—WikiLeaks would simply present the documents, unredacted and without context.

Therefore, **Ed decided to talk to journalists.** He needed to find people who the public trusted and who wouldn’t be scared off by the government trying to stop them from publishing things. At first, Ed tried to find journalists on his own, and then realized the NSA already kept track of the kind of people he needed. He approached two people:

  * **Laura Poitras.** Poitras is a documentarian who has focused on foreign policy since 9/11. She’d reported on William Binney, an NSA cryptanalyst, and the 2005 Iraqi elections during US occupation. She was regularly harassed by the government.
  * **Glenn Greenwald.** Greenwald is a columnist who used to be a civil liberties lawyer. He had written about the unclassified PSP report in 2009.



#### Getting in Touch

Ed knew better than anyone that it’s hard to be anonymous on the Internet. **He got in touch with journalists using a variety of different identities and used encrypted email.** He had to convince and/or teach the journalists to use encryption too.

Additionally, Ed used other people’s Internet connections. However, he couldn’t use free public wifi at a cafe or library for two reasons. First, in public places, he’d be recorded by security cameras or seen by other people. Second, every wireless device has a unique Machine Address Code (MAC). Wifi networks store the MACs of every device that connects to them, so his connection would be traceable.

To get around this, he went “war-driving.” **War-driving involves driving around looking for wifi connections.** All you need is an antenna, GPS sensor, and laptop. The antenna helps you find wifi and the GPS sensor tells you where you’ve found it. Ed’s laptop used an operating system called TAILS, which erases anything he’d ever done on it the moment he shut it down. He used TAILS to hide the laptop’s MAC address and used Tor. Sometimes Ed had to break into other people’s wifi, but often it wasn’t secure or minimally secure.

Interestingly, the law doesn’t care if you share classified information with your enemies or the press, or why you do so. The punishment is the same. The only distinction Ed ever encountered was in his Indoc to the intelligence community, when **he was told that selling enemies secrets is slightly better than sharing them with the press because at least the enemy won’t tell the public.**

### How to Break Documents Out of the NSA

> **Context: Counterintelligence**
> 
> _NSA Counterintelligence_
> 
> The NSA keeps an eye on the people who have worked for it via counterintelligence programs such as logs (keeping track of what’s done on a computer) and single-user documents (marking files with an invisible tag to indicate their source).
> 
> _FBI_
> 
> The FBI handles crime in the intelligence community. Most of the time, the FBI arrests people on their way home from work as they’re trying to smuggle out documents. Additionally, the FBI wires people’s houses when it suspects them.

**Ed decided he was going to leak the intelligence community’s original documents rather than simply describe STELLARWIND to the press.** This meant that he had to access the documents, organize them, and then remove them from the NSA building.

#### Accessing the Documents

Access wasn’t a problem. Heartbeat allowed Ed to collect any information he wanted, and while the NSA would log that Ed had read files, he was the manager of Heartbeat, so no one would find this suspicious.

#### Organizing the Documents

However, organizing the files was more difficult. Ed didn’t need everything Heartbeat pulled—he only wanted to leak documents about mass surveillance, not the NSA’s other secrets. Additionally, he had to do some work on the files such as encrypting, compressing, and deduplicating. The Heartbeat server kept a log of what was done on it, and if Ed tried to work with the files directly on the server, the NSA would see what he was up to. Additionally, he couldn’t organize the files on a regular office computer because the NSA had upgraded to computers that did all their processing and storage on the cloud.

There were, however, some older computers in the office with enough power to do their own local processing. **Ed invented a compatibility project—he wanted to make sure that Heartbeat was compatible with older operating systems—and transferred files onto the old computers.** As long as he was careful about what networks he connected the older computers too, no one would see what he was doing on them.

#### Getting the Files Out of the NSA

Finally, Ed had to get the files he wanted out of the NSA building. The safest and easiest way to get a file off a computer is to pull it up on the monitor and take a picture. Smartphones aren’t allowed in NSA buildings, but people often bring them in by accident, and Ed might have been able to get away with it. However, he’d need to take thousands of photos to get everything and he’d have to find a way to hide the photos well enough that even NSA forensic experts could search his phone without finding them.

Instead, **Ed decided to transfer the files to micro and mini SD cards.** He switched to the night shift so he could transfer files off the computers to the cards. Then, Ed would smuggle the cards out of the building inside a Rubik’s Cube, in his sock, in his cheek (so he could swallow them if he needed to), and finally in his pocket when he got more confident.

#### How Not to Get Caught

**Ed had access to a lot of intelligence data including, importantly, FBI reports on how they caught people.** Since the FBI would usually arrest people on their way home from work, Ed paid particular attention to how he interacted with security on his way out. He’d worked security back in the job that got him his clearance in Maryland and he knew it was boring, so he’d banter with the guards and chat about his Rubik’s Cube.

After Ed got home from work, he’d hide his laptop under a cotton blanket in case the FBI had bugged his house. Then, he’d transfer the files from the SD cards to a bigger, very securely encrypted, external storage device.

Just like at work, Ed was careful not to leave any traces of what he was doing on his technology at home.

#### Coming Forward

**Ed thought about trying to keep his name out of the leak, but ultimately decided not** to for a couple of reasons:

  * He was probably the only person in the intelligence community who had access to all the files he was going to leak, so it wouldn’t take the intelligence community long to figure out he was the source. The only way to avoid this would have been to share fewer files, which would have weakened his story. 
  * The files might contain identifying metadata. Metadata is more than just the date a file was accessed; the tags can be invisible and Ed didn’t know what they all might be. To erase even the ones he knew about, he’d have to alter the files, which might cause people to question if they were real and authentic.



#### Lindsay

Lindsay worried about Ed’s health. He couldn’t tell her anything.

### Encrypting the Documents

> **Context: Protecting Yourself From Surveillance**
> 
> _It’s Impossible to Truly Delete_
> 
> It’s not really possible to delete digital files. When people first built computers, they knew users would make mistakes. Engineers also knew that users wanted to feel like they had control and agency. They might not know how to fix computers and had to agree to terms of service, but at least they’d be able to delete their own files.
> 
> However, **when you delete a file on your computer, it usually only looks like it's gone.** What actually happens is the reference to it. It’s deleted from the file tree so you can’t search for it or easily get to it, but it’s still there if you look hard. The best you can do is overwrite it, again and again, until it's so covered up it's unusable, but that’s not foolproof either because your computer might have a copy of it somewhere you can’t find.
> 
> _Encryption_
> 
> **Encryption is the only way to really protect yourself against surveillance**. Think of encryption as a much more advanced version of a cipher. When you encrypt data, you’re using a key to transform it into gibberish. Therefore, anyone trying to look at your data won’t be able to make sense of it because they don’t have the key.
> 
> Encryption algorithms are very complicated math problems—problems so complicated even computers can’t solve them. Usually, the longer an encryption key is, the safer it is, because the math is harder. **The math and computing power required to break a 4096- or 8162-bit encryption key don’t exist.**
> 
> As a result, **the government doesn’t try to break the encryption, they go after the keys or the locksmiths:**
> 
>   * To go after the key, the government attacks the programs that do the encryption.
> 
> *To keep keys safe, you can use a method called “zero knowledge.” Zero knowledge involves encrypting data before you upload anything so that the key never leaves your computer.
> 
>   * To go after the locksmith, the government either forces companies who make tech to build weak encryption or tries to get international standards organizations to sign off on insecure algorithms.
>

In late 2012, laws about mass surveillance were under fire. Both the UK and Australian governments were proposing legislation about recording metadata. These laws were pitched as security measures. This was the point when **Ed realized that no matter how much he tried to reconcile technology and the government, it was impossible. He couldn’t be part of both circles, and the government was the one to leave.**

Ed still liked teaching and wanted to help the public defend itself against mass surveillance. **Even though he was leaking information about mass surveillance, he knew that wasn’t going to be enough to allow people to retain their privacy.** He taught a workshop on encryption. This was also practice for explaining things to a layperson’s audience, which he’d have to do when he blew the whistle. Many of the people who showed up weren’t particularly worried about mass surveillance, they just wanted control over their privacy.

#### Zero-Knowledge Keys

Ed’s encrypted drive had zero-knowledge keys within zero-knowledge keys. The key was divided up and separated. For example, pretend you had a party with 20 guests. You give each guest a number as they leave and none of the guests overhear. You can only put the key back together by bringing all the guests back together in the same room and having them regurgitate their number in the same order. Ed also had a number. If even one of the guests, including Ed, lost or destroyed their number, the key was permanently broken.

### How Mass Surveillance Works in Practice

Ed wondered if there was anyone in the world that the NSA couldn’t get to. He took a new job with the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii to find out. Ed’s new job was to actually use mass surveillance technology to research targets. He became the person who “acquired” information about particular people who’d thrown up flags.

#### Return to Fort Meade

Ed returned to Fort Meade for training and to meet his new colleagues and bosses. **It would be the last time Ed would see his family.** He went for dinner with his dad, who he knew wouldn’t have approved of what Ed was about to do—Lonnie would have called the cops or had him committed.

#### XKEYSCORE

One of the major programs for mass surveillance was called XKEYSCORE. Ed had known that the mass surveillance tech existed from what he’d found, but being trained on it was a whole different matter.

**XKEYSCORE allowed Ed to look up almost everything anyone does on the Internet.** He could type in almost anyone’s—including the NSA’s director or the president’s—IP address, phone number, or address and have access to their recent online browsing. Sometimes even a recording of their screen was available. Ed hid his searches by typing them in a machine format that was readable by XKEYSCORE but incomprehensible to people.

Most of what he saw was personal rather than professional abuse—LOVEINT. People would spy on their spouses or exes. If you use surveillance like this you can get ten years in prison, but no one in the NSA had ever been sentenced. The NSA couldn’t publicly prosecute anyone because to do so, they’d have to admit the secret mass surveillance system existed.

Ed learned as much as he could about the mass surveillance programs from the people working with them, justifying his curiosity by saying he wanted to teach everyone back in Hawaii the latest methods. Everyone he met was excited about the tech, was happy to show it off for him, and didn’t think about how it was being used.

Ed also learned that almost everyone does two things on the Internet: store images of their family, and watch porn. Ed found the family element the most uncomfortable. Ed found a video of a target working on his computer with a young child sitting on his lap, and the child stared directly into the camera as if he knew Ed was watching.
