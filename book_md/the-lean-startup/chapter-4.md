## Chapter 4: Experiment like a Scientist

Lean Startup treats building a startup as science:

  1. Create a hypothesis. What do you believe that’s important to your business? 
  2. Design an experiment to directly test that hypothesis. Run the experiment and gather data.
  3. Reflect on the data – can you validate or reject your hypothesis? 



Once again, this stands in stark contrast to the typical “launch and we’ll see” approach. You’re forced to question what your assumptions about your business are, and you’re encouraged to test those assumptions as quickly and cheaply as possible.

#### Startup Hypotheses

What are hypotheses in a startup? Your hypotheses should revolve around the most important problem of a startup – how to build a sustainable business around your vision.

Commonly, there are two critical hypotheses:

**Value hypothesis** : does the customer have the problem you’re trying to solve? Does the product actually deliver value to the customer?

**Growth hypothesis** : how will the company grow once people start using the product?

We’ll unpack each of these, and how to test them, in the following chapters.

### Principles of Lean Experimentation

As you learn how to design experiments and test hypotheses, here are important principles to remember throughout.

**The best way to understand human preferences is to track behavior of real people, not ask for opinions.** People often can’t verbalize what they actually want – cue the classic Henry Ford quote, “If you asked people what they wanted, they’d have said faster horses.” The better way to measure what people want is by their real behavior - what they click on, what they spend time looking at, what they choose to pay for. When someone behaves this way, you know they really want it.

**Think about the cheapest, fastest experiment you can run to validate the hypothesis.** Simplify the product to the core essentials needed to run the experiment. Resist the urge to build more than is absolutely necessary – as you’ll learn, sometimes you can fake it ‘til you make it without a real product.

**Launching early gives you customer information earlier.** The earlier you learn if customers actually want what you’re building, the more time you have to change your plan and run more experiments. You also discover customer concerns you couldn’t have predicted in a vacuum.

All these principles are in strict contrast to the usual market research/strategic planning process. Traditionally, you would try to research everything possible about your core user, then build your product to polished perfection, then release with a big launch party. This invites failure when you build something customers actually don’t even want.

We’re going to run through a few examples showing these principles at work. Notice how the same underlying principles apply to vastly different companies and scenarios.

> **Startup Example: Zappos**
> 
> During the dot-com boom, it seemed like the internet could be a new commerce platform for everything – books, groceries, even pet supplies. Companies like Webvan started business by building massive infrastructures and supply chains, even before they had proven customer demand.
> 
> Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn took the opposite approach. **His first action was to test the hypothesis that people actually wanted to buy shoes online.** He took perhaps the simplest approach possible – he went to local shoe stores, took pictures of shoes, and posted them online. If a customer actually bought a shoe, he’d buy the shoe and ship it himself.
> 
> Isn’t this brilliant? **With virtually zero start-up cost, Zappos tested customer demand.** If you asked someone how they’d start an online shoe company, a likely answer would be to buy the most popular shoes to sell. But Zappos skipped all that. They didn’t need to stock warehouses full of inventory and manage supply chain issues. This would have been a waste – they didn’t even know if people wanted to buy shoes.
> 
> Furthermore, they measured customer demand in the best way possible –getting people to pay real money. This is a much stronger indication of interest than voicing an opinion on a survey.
> 
> From this starting point, Zappos could easily run all sorts of deeper experiments – what types of shoes do people want? What policies matter most to them? By measuring what people actually do, Zappos can learn true customer preferences.

> **Startup Example: Village Laundry Service**
> 
> In India, washing machines are scarce. Laundry is primarily done at home or by paid cleaners who wash clothes in river water and hang to dry, often taking over a week to return clothes.
> 
> Village Laundry Services saw an opportunity to introduce laundry services with modern machines for people who couldn’t afford them. Their hypothesis? Customers would pay to have their laundry cleaned and returned within the same day.
> 
> To experiment, **they launched a simple prototype** – a truck with a washing machine mounted on the back. This was just a marketing gimmick – they really took the laundry somewhere offsite and cleaned it there. But it was just enough to test their hypothesis with real customers and find out what they really wanted.
> 
> For example, they learned that the truck was actually kind of sketchy looking – customers were afraid they’d drive away with their clothes, never to return. In response, they built a more substantial, reputable-looking kiosk. They also found that customers were willing to pay a premium for faster service and ironing.
> 
> Through all their learning, Village Laundry Services ended with their final version – a mobile kiosk with its own washer and dryer that could service clothes on site.

These two examples seem vastly different on the surface. One was leading the forefront of e-commerce during the dotcom boom. Another was introducing hygienic convenience to a developing region.

But the principles were the same:

  * They formed a hypothesis about the core customer need that would drive their business.
  * They started with the bare minimum product needed to test the hypothesis.
  * They studied real user behavior by observing their actions, not simply by asking questions.
  * From this baseline, they could experiment further.



No matter your situation or customer need, these principles will apply to you as well.
