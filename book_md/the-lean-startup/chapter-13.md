## Chapter 13: Epilogue

Eric Ries believes a tremendous amount of effort today is wasteful. Over the past century, our bandwidth for production is much larger than our ability to know the right things to build. This problem is compounded by the high rate of change of many industries.

Luckily, this is preventable. **The Lean Startup is a framework for figuring out the right things to build.** It answers the innovation question: how can we build a sustainable organization around a new product or service?

Lean Startup accomplishes this through the scientific method: forming testable hypotheses, testing them, and gathering data for important metrics. This is validated learning.

Lean Startup is NOT meant to be a rigid, codified set of practices. If you blindly follow the steps outlined here without care, you may find yourself obsessing about stepping through the motions, rather than isolating the core of what really matters to your startup. Eric does not want Lean Startup to be a checklist that people go through perfunctorily. You may not always want to launch a low-quality prototype, for example.

The important goal is validated learning, discovering the truth about the world in a rigorous way. Think about Lean Startup as a mental framework for how to think about building a sustainable business.

**What is your value hypothesis or growth hypothesis? What is the fastest, cheapest way you can validate this hypothesis?**
