## Exercise: Design Your MVP

Try to design the minimum product that will test your hypothesis.

* * *

What is the key hypothesis you want to test? Often, it’s centered around the question of whether your users will want what you’re building, or whether they have the problem you’re solving.

What is the Minimum Viable Product to test your hypothesis? Write a general description.

Now force yourself to simplify this – what can you throw out until you get to the _absolute_ essential minimal product needed? Consider testing it without even building the product.
