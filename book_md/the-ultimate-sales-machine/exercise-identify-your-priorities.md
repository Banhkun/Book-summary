## Exercise: Identify Your Priorities

Think about the most important things you need to accomplish each day—and what might be standing in your way.

* * *

Do you currently create a prioritized list of things you need to accomplish each day? If not, what do you think the benefits of doing so might be?

If you’re not currently making lists to help prioritize tasks and budget time, what’s stopping you from doing so?

Make a list of 3-5 items that you want to accomplish today, in order of importance. Do you feel like these tasks are more manageable now that you’ve sorted them this way? Explain why or why not.
