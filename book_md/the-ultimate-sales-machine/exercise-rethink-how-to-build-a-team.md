## Exercise: Rethink How to Build a Team

Consider what attributes you find the most important in recruiting members of your team.

* * *

Holmes writes that personality counts for more than experience in hiring decisions. Do you agree with this statement? If not, explain what you think is the most important thing to take into account with new hires.

Have you ever had a new hire at your company that didnâ€™t work out? Explain the situation.

How do you think this situation could have been avoided or handled differently? Was it a matter of inadequate training or simply a bad fit?
