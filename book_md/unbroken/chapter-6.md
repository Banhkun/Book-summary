## Chapter 6: The Real Battle Begins

Louie’s and Phil’s active duty ended when the _Green Hornet_ went down, but their trials as American soldiers were just beginning. Aboard the ship, the men were tied to the mast, bound at the hands, and taunted by the Japanese soldiers. When the captain saw what was happening, he ordered his men to untie them and give them water and a biscuit. It was the first thing either had eaten in over a week.

**Louie and Phil were taken to an island, where they received a full examination and treatment for their wounds.** Before their doomed flight, Louie and Phil each weighed between 150 and 160 pounds. When they were weighed on the island, they discovered they’d lost half their weight.

Along with the medical treatment, Louie and Phil were given plentiful food, alcohol, and cigarettes. They were taken to a room, in which they told their story of their survival to Japanese officials. They learned they’d drifted two thousand miles to the Marshall Islands. Their raft, splayed on a table in front of them, had forty-eight bullet holes in it.

Louie and Phil were given clean beds to sleep in, and it seemed that their nightmare was over. The Japanese continued to treat them with care and concern for two more days, then they were told they were being shipped to another atoll on another island. When Louie and Phil heard the name of the island, their stomachs dropped. **They were to be delivered to Kwajalein, known infamously throughout the American ranks as “Execution Island.”**

### Execution Island

On the journey to Kwajalein, the Japanese soldiers were convivial with the Americans. They were fed well and given separate quarters to sleep in. But as the freighter pulled within sight of the island, everything changed.

On July 16, they were blindfolded, fireman-carried off the freighter, and thrown in cells with just enough room for one man. Louie’s cell was infested with bugs, and only a small square window in the door ventilated the room. The air was heavy, hot, and rank from the latrine in the floor.

On one of the walls, Louie found an engraving—“Nine marines marooned on Makin Island, August 18, 1942,” the names of the men etched beneath it. Louie had heard of these marines before, as most American soldiers had. They’d been accidentally left behind after an attack and vanished. Louie was likely the first person to learn their whereabouts.

The fact that these men were nowhere in sight was ominous. Louie called out to Phil and heard a meek response from far away. They had just enough time to check on each other’s well-being before a guard came in. **Louie took in his surroundings, his emaciated body, and his circumstances and started to weep.** He covered his mouth to muffle his sobs.

### Wishing for Death

Louie and Phil would stay on Kwajalein for 42 days. The ordeal they experienced was worse than what they’d survived on the raft, and Louie found himself wishing for death on several occasions.

Each day, Louie was given a golf ball-sized dry biscuit and a swallow of hot brown water. The biscuit was thrown through the window and shattered on the ground, leaving Louie to scramble for crumbs like a rodent. **Louie soon learned that the marines had been executed, and from that day on, he waited to be pulled from his cell and beheaded.**

The guards at Kwajalein seemed to find pleasure in outdoing each other with cruelty. When Louie begged for water, they threw scalding water in his face. He was poked with long sticks through the window and made to dance while they threw stones at him. Almost daily, one of the guards sliced his hand across his throat while laughing.

On at least two occasions, a submarine docked near the island, and more than 80 men came ashore and took turns abusing Louie and Phil. They threw stones and sharp sticks at the crouching men and spit on them. Phil and Louie couldn’t communicate, but they made scuffing sounds on the floor to signal that they were still alive. Under these conditions, Louie was starting to feel a loss of dignity and, with it, a diminishing will to live.

Both Louie and Phil were pulled from their cells on several occasions. Believing they were headed for execution each time, they were surprised to be taken to an interrogation room. The men were questioned about the logistics of American bombers and base sites in Hawaii. Louie told as much of the truth as he could except when it came to the bases. He pointed out the fake base sites built on Hawaii to fool Japanese bombers.

On four other occasions, Louie and Phil were taken to the infirmary, where medical experiments were performed on them. They were injected with solutions that left them dizzy, wracked with pain, and covered in rashes. That both Phil and Louie survived these experiments was lucky. Thousands of other POWs who’d undergone similar experiments died.

**Finally, Louie and Phil were slated for transfer to an official POW camp in Japan.** Louie was hopeful, for prisoners were supposed to receive supplies from the Red Cross at these camps and be able to make contact with their families. Also, the transfer meant they wouldn’t be executed, which had seemed likely once their usefulness to the interrogators and doctors was done. The reason they were spared execution would be a mystery for a long time.

### Ofuna

After journeying for three weeks by ship, Louie and Phil were dropped off at Ofuna, a secret POW camp in Japan. When they arrived,**Louie was granted the first bath he’d had since leaving Hawaii, then led to a room where his USC buddy Jimmie Sasaki was seated.**

Louie was never privy to the suspicions and investigations surrounding Jimmie back home, so he was dumbfounded to see this man at a prison camp. They spoke for a long time, with Jimmie mostly reminiscing about their days at USC or bragging about his high-ranking position in the Japanese military. Louie thought Jimmie had been the one to authorize his stay of execution and expected something to happen after seeing him, but nothing did. Louie was taken out of the room and into the yard where he met 200 fellow prisoners.

Ofuna was not on the radar of the Red Cross because it was not registered as an official POW camp. **The guards and officials who ran the camp did not abide by the rules of the Geneva Convention regarding prisoners of war.** Instead, the camp operated under different sets of rules instituted to break and humiliate the captives.

Prisoners could not speak or make eye contact with each other; eyes had to be cast down at all times; prisoners had to learn Japanese in order to understand instructions; each morning started with tenko, or roll call; and every aspect of camp life had to be followed to the tee. Any deviation from these rules elicited harsh beatings.

Because no one outside Japan knew about the camp, the beatings could be as vicious as the guards wanted. Death was not off the table for anyone. The guards used clubs to beat the men, and any attempt a prisoner made to protect himself or help others led to increased violence. **The most feared guard of all was a man nicknamed “The Quack,” who was particularly cruel and sadistic.**

The men at Ofuna were emaciated and made to starve while guards pilfered the food shipments. Rations consisted of putrid broth and contaminated rice, neither of which had any nutritional value. Dysentery was rampant, and Louie grew so thin, he could barely stand. He thought Jimmie, who visited often, would help him, but all Jimmie ever did was talk about USC. If it wasn’t for the help of two kitchen aids, who slipped Louie extra balls of rice, he likely wouldn’t have survived.

### Tactical Measures

Most of the men imprisoned at Ofuna were American soldiers, either ranking officials or enlisted servicemen. Their shared training was put to use in a number of subversive ways to gain information and food.

The underground resistance movement was small and did nothing to change the men’s circumstances, but the ability to gain knowledge about the war and dupe their guards served to give each man a sense of purpose and dignity. What on the outside seemed like full compliance to the rules was actually a network of whispered communications.

Whenever guards were out of earshot, the prisoners would talk without moving their lips. Others passed information to each other by pretending to ask the guards questions in English, which they couldn’t understand. They used Morse code by tapping sticks or clicking their tongues. Others found ways to make journals out of rice paste and stole pencils to document the horrors of the camp. **Louie kept detailed accounts of his time at Ofuna and the names and addresses of other men in camp and hid his diary under floorboards in his cell.**

What the men wanted most of all was knowledge of the war’s progression. Whenever new POWs were brought to camp, the underground network found ways of mining them for information. Japanese newspapers appeared in camp every now and then, and the prisoners were quick to steal them and get them to American translators. One of these men was a twenty-five-year-old Marine officer named William Harris, who would become one of Louie’s closest friends and an important cog in the resistance wheel.

### A Man Among Men

William Harris’s skills would serve as both a salvation and curse for the men at Ofuna. He was part of a downed mission in Japanese territory and had managed to escape. He made a run for China, stalking through the woods and consuming ants to survive. He was close to the Chinese border when he was discovered by Japanese civilians and turned in to authorities.

William was a large man, standing at 6’3”, was an actual genius, spoke five languages, and had a photographic memory. He and Louie met one day during forced exercise and formed an instant bond. **Louie had not had a real comrade since Phil was taken to a different part of the camp on arrival.** The two set their minds to finding more ways to subvert their captors.

William created a Japanese-English dictionary on one of the rice paste journals to help men decipher the newspapers. Louie also stole newspapers when no one was looking and took them to William, who would look at a map, memorize it, and recreate it on a scrap of paper. Through these tactics, the prisoners learned that the allies were winning the war, which helped inspire them and give them hope for rescue. But that hope came with a weighty fear.

**All over Japan, thousands of POWs were falling victim to the “kill order,” or the Japanese military policy to never allow prisoners to be recaptured by the allies.** If an invasion was imminent, the guards were ordered to kill all the men. If the allies kept advancing, Louie and the others wondered if they’d survive long enough to see victory.

### A Time of Loss

In all facets of Louie’s life, loss was being felt. Louie first felt this loss in spring 1944 when Phil was transferred from Ofuna to another POW camp. The two men, who’d experienced so much together, only had a few moments to bid farewell. **Phil and Louie said goodbye and promised to reconnect in the future when all of their struggles were over.** Louie believed his friend was going to an official camp, but Phil was taken to another secret camp that sold the prisoners to local businesses for slave labor.

Across the pond, Louie’s family was also confronting loss. When word of Louie’s disappearance hit Torrance in June 1943, the townspeople began to mourn the loss of their local hero. But Louie’s family was different. Neither Louise nor Albert believed their son was dead. Even his siblings felt Louie’s presence in the world, and no matter what the official reports suggested, they were staunch in their beliefs that Louie was alive. Not even the arrival of his war trunk from Hawaii could shake their resolve.

In another part of the world, Joe Deasy was experiencing a feeling of grief over his friend Louie. The Americans had seized Kwajalein during an air attack, and transcripts of Japanese reports from the island were discovered. In them were the recorded interviews of Louie and Phil detailing their crash and survival by raft. The reports landed on Deasy’s desk, and he became consumed with guilt about overlooking them during the search and whatever fate had befallen them.

Because there was no information about what had happened to the men after their interrogation, neither family was told of the discovery. Phil’s family remained as steadfast in their belief that Phil was still alive as Louie’s. Phil’s fiancé, Cecy, even quit her job in Indiana and moved to Washington DC to be closer to information. **After thirteen months, Louie, Phil, and the rest of the _Green Hornet_ crew were officially declared dead.** This news changed nothing for either family.
