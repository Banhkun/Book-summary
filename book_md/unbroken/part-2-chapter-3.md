## Part 2 | Chapter 3: America Goes to War

Around the time that Louie started his training in Houston, the U.S. government, aided by the FBI, received word that Jimmie Sasaki was working as a spy for Japanese intelligence. His trips to Torrance had actually been visits to a large transmitter used to send information to the Japanese. Whether Jimmie was involved in the events that unfolded one morning in December is unclear, but it didn’t matter. The damage would be done regardless.

Before dawn on December 7, 1941, a Japanese pilot named Mitsuo Fuchida flew a small aircraft over Oahu scoping the strength of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. He spotted eight battleships off the coast and signaled to his comrades. Within minutes, **180 Japanese bombers came up behind him and began the assault on Oahu. This was the first wave of the attack on Pearl Harbor.**

Within the span of two hours, Japanese bombers attacked the base in Oahu, along with other bases in Thailand, China, the Philippines, Guam, Midway, and Wake. In total, more than 2,400 people would be killed during the Japanese attacks.

The attack on Wake was the most surprising. The atoll was far out in the Pacific ocean and manned by 500 American soldiers. They were successful in holding the Japanese takeover off for almost two weeks, finally succumbing on Christmas Eve. At the time of seizure, Japan had lost 1,153 men compared to only 52 American deaths. Others were captured and became some of the first Pacific POWs, as those held under Japanese rule would become known. Ninety-eight American servicemen were detained on Wake, but no one knew they were there.

The American government assumed invasion was imminent. Civilians prepared for the worst. There were air raids along the west coast, and trenches were dug and schools closed up and down California. Across the nation, law enforcement and the National Guard took up stations to protect bridges, waterways, and factories.

Louie was in Texas enjoying a weekend pass. He was watching a movie with other servicemen when an announcement blasted through the theater telling the men about the attack and to return to their bases. **Louie would always remember sitting in shock at the news that America, including himself, was now at war.**

### Tour of Duty

After America officially entered the war, Louie graduated from his training as a bombardier and became a second lieutenant. Pete had also joined the war effort and was a Navy chief petty officer in San Diego. Both Zamperini boys went to their family home in Torrance to say goodbye. On August 19, Louie’s entire family posed for a photograph on their front steps before he departed.

**The day Louie arrived at an airbase in Washington state, he met another second lieutenant named Russell Allen “Phil” Phillips, who would be the pilot of Louie’s plane.** Phil was 26 years old, from Indiana, and engaged to be married to his college sweetheart, Cecy. He was quiet and had an ability to cope with stress and adversity amicably and calmly.

Louie and Phil grew close on the base. Louie’s gregariousness was the perfect complement to Phil’s demureness and vice versa. They were introduced to the rest of their plane crew—the eighth of nine crews within the 372nd Bomb Squadron of the 307th Bomb Group, Seventh Airforce. They were given a new type of bomber, the B-24 Liberator, unaffectionately known as the “Flying Coffin.”

The B-24 was one of the heaviest planes ever made and was difficult to control because of a lack of steering in the wheelbase. It was a massive, clumsy plane known for many mechanical failures. Many of the model’s initial rides had ended by simply falling from the sky.

Louie’s crew trained for months in their B-24, with Louie stationed in a small glass enclosure in the plane’s nose. **The crew trained tirelessly and became known as one of the best crews in the squadron, with Phil earning distinction.** They completed hundreds of hours of training without incident, which was significant considering that during their first three months of training, B-24 accidents had killed an average of nine men per day. Because of this, Louie and his crew, as well as all the others, were extensively trained in crash procedures.

Eventually, Louie’s crew named their plane _Super Man_ , which was painted on the side with a cartoon of the superhero holding a bomb and gun. On a mid-October afternoon in 1942, the crew of _Super Man_ were told to pack their bags. They were finally heading off to fight.

Eleven months earlier, the Japanese had started America’s war. Now, Louie was headed into it over the Pacific Ocean. **The ocean would be the stage for the next years of his life.**

### Shock and Awe

Louie and his crew were sent to Kahuku, a base on the beach of the north shore of Oahu. They were eager to put their training to work, but what they found instead were endless days of waiting.

Dull moments on base were spent patrolling the surrounding waters for signs of the enemy. The men also passed the time pulling practical jokes on each other. Once, Louie replaced his chewing gum with laxative gum to teach Phil and copilot Charleton Hugh Cuppernell a lesson after they repeatedly stole his. When he wasn’t horsing around, Louie ran laps around the runways to stay in peak shape.

Months passed, and Louie’s crew had yet to see battle. Each time a plane came back to the base, they’d inspect it, marveling at bullet holes in the sides. Then, on December 22, 1942, Louie and his crew were told to pack supplies for a three-day excursion and report to _Super Man_. **They were heading to Midway, a Pacific island closer to the Wake Atoll, to attack the Japanese’s stronghold built on the remains of Wake.**

The mission involved dive-bombing the island and would last approximately sixteen hours, the longest air battle engaged thus far during the war. B-24s were not typically meant to fly that long, but the addition of auxiliary fuel tanks would help push them just to point of completion. _Super Man_ and other B-24s were gutted of every non-essential part to lighten their loads.

In the late afternoon of Christmas Eve, twenty-six B-24s took off from Midway, with _Super Man_ pulling up the rear. Seven hours later, the Wake Atoll came into view. An hour later, at midnight, the planes dropped their bombs on the sleeping base below, and the island exploded in fire. Streaks of light entered the sky when the Japanese fired back. What none of the American bombers knew was that the 98 American captives were still imprisoned on the island.

As _Super Man_ dove toward the atoll, Louie readied his bombs. On one of them, he’d written an inscription honoring his college friend Payton Jordan’s recent nuptials. **Louie dropped six bombs onto the airstrip below, hitting his targets** , then Phil turned _Super Man_ around and headed back to Midway. But the bomb bay doors were stuck open, causing a massive lag in momentum and burning excess fuel. There was nothing to do but hope they had enough fuel to make it back.

Phil finally located the small airway strip of Midway through a blanket of fog. At that precise moment, one of the engines died on _Super Man_. He was able to touch down right as a second engine died. The other two died as he pulled into the bunker. A few extra miles would have meant a crash landing in the Pacific for Louie and his crew.

The attack on Wake was a success. All American planes returned, and the damage to the atoll was significant. America had proven what their B-24s were capable of, and none of the prisoners had been harmed. Phil and the other pilots received Distinguished Flying Crosses, and the rest of the crew received Air Medals. America was pumped up after the attack and assumed the Japanese would surrender soon. However, things were only getting started.

### A Dangerous Mission

In early spring 1943, Louie’s crew was slated for another attack. This time, they’d be bombing a tiny island called Nauru, which sat 2,500 miles away from Hawaii. The island was home to immense stores of phosphate, which was an essential ingredient in munition creation. **The Japanese had seized the island the previous summer, and Louie’s crew was meant to destroy the phosphate plants.** The _Super Man_ would first fly to the island of Funafuti, from where they would set off.

On an April dawn, _Super Man_ and twenty-two other planes left Funafuti for Nauru. The travel time was six and a half hours, and all men on Louie’s plane were silent throughout the ride. _Super Man_ was in front, flanked by a bomber on each side. At first, the island seemed motionless, and Phil turned over control to the bombsight. Louie located his targets, but fire flared up in the sky around them. The two planes flanking _Super Man_ were shot down, leaving Louie’s plane exposed.

_Super Man_ took a hit, and a chunk of the plane’s right rudder flew off. Louie was finally able to reclaim control and dropped his bombs on three different targets. His final drop was over a fuel depot, and the explosion destroyed the supply.

Phil turned _Super Man_ around to head back, but Japanese aircraft surrounded them. Louie saw nine enemy planes from his location under the nose. Some of the planes passed by so close that Louie could see the faces of Japanese soldiers inside. The _Super Man_ took enemy fire from every direction. **Phil and Cuppernell pushed the plane back toward Funafuti, fighting the damaged plane and dodging enemy attacks the whole way.**

### Courage Under Fire

Holes opened up on all sides of _Super Man_ , sending shards of light streaking into the cabin. As the Japanese fighters continued to fire on _Super Man_ , more holes opened up, and some of the hits were so significant, they sent shrapnel into the gunners’ bodies. Louie heard signs of distress from his crewmen. He left his station and climbed into the back of the plane. The first thing he saw was one of his men dangling outside the open bomb bay. Louie pulled him in and settled him in a corner. The man’s uniform was riddled with bullets.

Louie then saw something equally upsetting. The hydraulic lines were severed, which meant Phil would have no access to landing gear or brakes. **Louie saw three more men slumped on the ground bleeding, and he and Cuppernell administered first aid to the wounded men.**

During all of this, _Super Man_ was being chased by two enemy planes. Louie felt something dripping on him from above and looked up to see Stanley Pillsbury, the top turret gunner, in his perch, his leg so badly wounded it was dangling below him. Louie tried to help Pillsbury, but the man didn’t notice his injuries. He was engaged in the fight for his life with the enemy planes.

Pillsbury saw a Japanese fighter rearing up in front of him. If it fired on _Super Man_ , the plane would crash into the Pacific Ocean. Once Pillsbury could see the face of the pilot, he held his breath, took aim, and fired. The shot hit home, sending the enemy plane spinning away and saving the men of _Super Man_.

With the threat of enemy fire thwarted, all hope now turned to trying to make it back to base. Louie continued to triage his crewmen in the back, and Phil continued to fight to keep _Super Man_ stable and airborne. The latter task was much more difficult. The plane pushed against the controls, trying to turn its nose up, causing the plane to flip upside down. Phil pushed as hard as he could on the throttle and played with the engines to shift power from one side to the other to keep the plane centered.

As they kept course toward Funafuti, the men’s injuries worsened. Louie was able to gain control over Pillsbury’s wounds, but the first man, who’d been hanging out of the plane, was fading quickly. **All men aboard knew the man was dying, and they also knew their own deaths were likely when they crash-landed on the runway without landing gear or breaks.** They stayed silent, never speaking their fears aloud.

The runway finally came into view, but there was nothing Phil could do to stop the speed with which they approached. One of the men opened the bomb bay doors to slow the momentum. The other men, including the injured, worked hand pumps to release the landing gear. Louie wrapped each of them in parachute ropes affixed to parts of the plane. Still, the plane was coming in too hot.

When _Super Man_ touched down on the Funafuti runway, Phil was able to make the landing so steady, no one in the back was disrupted. But the left tire of the landing gear was flat, which caused the plane to lurch at 110 miles per hour and careen toward two other planes. Cuppernell pounded the brake pedal despite the cut lines, finding just enough juice to engage the brakes. The plane spun then stopped before colliding with the other bombers.

After landing, a ground crewman counted the holes in the plane. **_Super Man_ had been hit 594 times, more than any other bomber on the mission.** Louie couldn’t help looking at the beat up plane, with one hole so big his head almost fit through it. He knew the plane had saved him and all but one of his men. The man from the bomb bay door, named Harold Brooks, had died shortly after their arrival. He was twenty-two years old.
