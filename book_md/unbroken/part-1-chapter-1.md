## Part 1 | Chapter 1: The Wayward Child

Long before Louis Silvie Zamperini was an Olympic athlete and soldier in WWII, he was a child criminal no one knew how to handle. Born to Italian immigrants in New York in January 1917, he was the second of what would become four children. His parents were Anthony, a coal miner and boxer, and Louise, who had Louie when she was 18. After Louie came down with pneumonia at the age of two, the family moved to Southern California to live in warmer weather.

The family moved to the town of Torrance just south of Los Angeles. In Torrance, **Louie’s antics earned him the reputation of being the town terror.** He once ran across a busy highway and was almost run over. At five, he started smoking cigarette butts found on the street. At family dinners, he climbed under the table and stole his parents’ glasses of wine. One night, he grew so inebriated, he fell into a rosebush in the yard. On another, he almost drowned in a refinery well after diving off the top of an oil rig. When they pulled him out, he was covered in oil.

Mostly, Louie was a thief. He learned how to pick locks with wire and broke into neighbors’ homes to steal their dinner off the tables. The sight of Louie sprinting down an alley carrying a whole cake was not infrequent. He stole a keg of beer from a local party and pies from the local bakery. **He was always on the run, with enraged community members trailing behind, two of which threatened to shoot him if he came by again.**

Louie also ran random money-making rackets. He jammed up pay phones and returned later to collect the lodged change. He stole copper from a scrap lot and returned to sell it back to the owner the next day. He staged fights with other kids so adults would pay them to stop. It seemed no behavior was off limits for Louie.

Although a terror, Louie was brazen, clever, capable, and fearless. These traits would serve him well as an adult in the war.

### The Downward Spiral

**Louie was an outcast, not only for his mischievous ways, but also for his looks.** He was scrawny and still struggled with his lungs because of the childhood pneumonia. He had big ears and unruly hair. Louie also spoke little English as a young boy because of the Italian spoken at home, and he stayed quiet through most of kindergarten and first grade. Thinking he was slow, the teachers held him back a grade.

Louie was often bullied, but he never reacted to anything that happened to him. Other boys would punch and kick him, and he’d be bruised and bloody. But he never ran away, cried, or complained. He’d simply cover his face and wait for the abuse to be over.

As he got older, Louie grew more broody and brutal. He started hanging out with a rough crowd, but although he acted tough, he was crippled by shyness inside. He asked his father to teach him how to box and started lifting weights. **He was able to fight his offenders now, but his rage was growing and turning toward everyone.** On separate occasions, he punched a girl, shoved a teacher, and threw tomatoes at police officers. He even broke one kid’s nose and beat another unconscious.

His parents didn’t know what to do with him. They were always required to make amends to the neighbors either through apologies or payment for damaged or stolen items. His father’s salary barely supported the family for the week, and the extra money was a burden. Anthony often punished Louie with spankings, but Louie never faltered. Like with the bullies, he took the beatings and continued his behavior.

Nothing anyone did worked. **Louie was untameable and becoming more destructive.** He was failing school and showed no skills other than mischief. If he continued to follow this path, there would be no real future for him.

### An Effort to Change

A turning point for Louie would cause him to change his ways. American scientists had started touting eugenics in the 1930s. **Eugenics was the idea of removing all undesirable people from the gene pool as a means to strengthen the race.** The list for who would be sterilized was long and included the mentally ill, women deemed promiscuous, slow learners, criminals, the sick, the disabled, and the homeless.

At the beginning of the decade, California was deep into eugenics. They would sterilize close to twenty thousand people.

A teenage boy at Louie’s school was considered mentally incompetent and sent away to a mental institution. The boy’s parents had to legally fight to save him from sterilization. Louie knew that who he had become was exactly the kind of person slated for the same kind of trouble. This realization snapped him out of his behavior, and he started trying to change.

**Louie started to engage more with others in a positive way.** He helped around the house, made biscuits for his community, and gave away the things he’d stolen. Still, he was restless, and he’d lie awake at night dreaming of traveling far away from home.

### The Guardian Angel

No one could have foreseen how Louie’s life would change because of a silly school prank. After discovering that his house key unlocked the school gym, Louie started letting kids into basketball games for free. When the principal found out, he banned Louie from all athletic teams and social events. Louie didn’t care, but his brother Pete did.

Pete was Louie’s older brother by less than two years and was everything Louie was not. Pete was good-looking, well-liked, well-mannered, and charismatic. He had such a good head on his shoulders, his parents often turned to him for advice when he was just a child. He once saved someone from drowning.

Pete was a protective older brother to Louie and their sisters, Sylvia and Virginia, and Louie worshipped him. Pete was the only person Louie would listen to.

Pete went to the principal and advocated for his brother. He explained that Louie only acted out for attention. **If Louie could be recognized for something good, it would change him, Pete was sure of it.** He said allowing him to participate in a sport could be that good thing. The principal eventually gave in, and Louie became eligible for sports in 1932.

Pete was a star athlete, earning ten varsity letters throughout high school. Four of those were in track, in which he had set the school record for the mile at 5:06. Pete had seen the speed with which Louie ran from trouble and thought he might have some running chops, as well. From that moment on, Pete took on the responsibility of training Louie to be a runner.

Louie’s first effort was dismal. He was humiliated in a crushing defeat during a foot race and was unmotivated to continue. But Pete forced Louie to train and monitored his training like a professional coach. Louie did better in another event, coming in third. As he crossed the finish line, he was enthralled by the cheering crowd. The prospect of more of that kind of attention was enough to make him keep training.

Pete rode behind Louie on his bicycle, whacking him with a stick. He made Louie pick himself up when he was tired and keep running. The training was grueling, but both boys started to see results. **Louie became the first student from Torrance to compete in the All City Finals, in which he got fifth.** But the constraints of his training regimen only exacerbated Louie’s restlessness. He missed the freedom of being wild, so the summer after the All City Finals, he left home.

### A Change of Heart

Louie’s adventure on the road was such a disaster, it would force him to take stock of his life. Louie and another friend jumped a train headed north and ended up trapped in a boxcar in the heat with no ventilation. Panicked, they escaped by climbing through a roof vent.

A railroad detective found the boys and forced them to jump off at gunpoint while the train was still moving. Days of loitering and thieving left them exiled from towns. They were destitute and stranded in a railyard. Louie saw a train with a fine-dining car go by, and **something about the refinement of the people inside made him realize he was wasting his life**. He started for home immediately and reconciled himself to let Pete train him.

All of the effort Louie had put into plotting and scheming now went into running. He no longer ran to escape trouble or an altercation. He ran because it was what started to feel the most natural.

With his world suddenly falling into a cathartic focus, Louie’s body and behavior worked to reach their potential. He quit boozing and smoking and worked on increasing his lung capacity by submerging himself in the local pool in Redondo Beach, sometimes for as long as three and a half minutes.

Louie also became interested in the career of a runner from the University of Kansas, Glenn Cunningham. Cunningham had survived a tragic accident and had to teach himself how to walk again, then run. He was quickly becoming a legend in the making for his prowess in the mile. Louie idolized him.

### Racing Toward Destiny

Pete joined the track team of a junior-college in Compton, but he didn’t release his self-imposed duty as Louie’s personal trainer. He came home on a regular basis and taught Louie about form and the psychology of running.

Pete also recognized a special physical component of Louie’s body. **Louie’s hips were configured in a way that allowed them to roll as he ran, which meant his next step was already forming as the first step was landing.** This trait gave him a massive stride, about seven feet long. This advantage was of most benefit in longer races. Pete wanted Louie to become a miler.

During his sophomore year in 1933, it was finally time to put all his hard work over the summer and fall to the test when track season started in early winter. In his first competition, Louie broke Pete’s school record for the 880-yard race by two seconds. A week later, he broke another of Pete’s records, this time clocking a mile time three seconds faster than his brother’s at 5:03. Over the season, he would whittle down his mile time to 4:42, setting a new state record.

Louie grew bored with racing against high school students. He decided to compete against Pete and thirteen runners from various colleges in a two-mile race, a distance he’d never competed in or trained for. Louie won the race easily, finishing 50 yards ahead of the pack. He also entered a two-mile cross country race at UCLA against a pack of collegiate runners from Southern California. He finished a quarter-mile ahead of the other racers and set a new course record at sixteen. With these finishes,**Louie started to believe he was something special.**

### Taking the World by Storm

Louie’s stature as a legend was cemented his junior year at the Southern California Track and Field Championship. He set a national high school mile record that day at 4:21.3, two seconds faster than the previous record held since WWI. One report said it was unlikely his record would be broken within the next twenty years. The reporter was only off by one year.

Louie’s success made the community of Torrance change their feelings about him. Where once he was the town terror, now he was a local hero. His life became an embarrassment of riches. People lined up for autographs, and he received so many wristwatches as prizes, he started giving them away to neighbors. Girls swarmed him, and the press took photos of him and his trophies in front of his house.

**Watching Louie train became a spectator sport at the track, and people started referring to him as “Iron Man” and the “Torrance Tornado.”** Newspapers from all over Southern California were pumping out stories about this budding superstar, including the _LA Times_ and _Examiner_.

For the boy whose only thought used to be what to steal next, Louie’s life now encompassed bigger dreams. He started to believe his legs could take him all the way to the world’s stage. He set his sights on the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

Louie’s Olympic dream required an adjustment in his training. There was no mile race, only the 1500, 100 meters shorter. Many of the Olympic runners would be older, around their mid-20s, including Louie’s hero, Glenn Cunningham, who would be twenty-seven by the 1936 games. In comparison, Louie would only be nineteen.

None of these factors deterred Louie, who’d already become the best high school miler ever in America. Over the two years that Louie had been competing, he’d shaved 42 seconds off his mile time. Louie was determined to make it to Berlin, and once he completed his undefeated senior season, the experts started to think he might just do it.

After graduating from high school in 1935, scholarship offers from a multitude of top schools came flooding in. Pete had transitioned to USC on a scholarship and was making his mark as one of the best milers in the country, as well. He urged Louie to accept their offer but defer until after the Olympic trials seven months away. Louie agreed and went to live with Pete so they could continue their training partnership.

Louie was a ferocious trainer, working with Pete every day to get in shape for the 1500. But his dream ended in the spring when he realized he wasn’t improving fast enough. **Louie was too young, and there was no way to make his body mature to the level of his competition. He was crushed.**
