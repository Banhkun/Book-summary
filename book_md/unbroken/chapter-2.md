## Chapter 2: A Young Man’s Resilience

Louie’s confidence and brashness in the face of obstacles as a child would come to be his saving grace after losing his dream of racing in the 1500 in Berlin. Louie saw an article about an upcoming meet at the Los Angeles Coliseum. A twenty-six-year-old schoolteacher, Norman Bright, was touted as one of the favorites in the 5,000 meters race. Bright had the second-best time behind a younger racer from Indiana named Don Lash.

Louie learned that three 5,000-meter runners would go to the Olympics. Pete pushed him to enter the race, despite its extended distance of just over three miles. If Louie could keep up with Bright, he’d have a shot at making the team. With only two weeks until the meet and having never run farther than a mile twice in high school, Louie knew it was a long shot. But Louie was nothing if not a fighter. He trained so intensely, he lost the skin off one of his toes.

Louie would learn just what he was made of during that race. In front of 10,000 fans, Bright and Louie ran neck and neck the whole way. Although Bright finished a heartbeat ahead of Louie, both their times were faster than the previous record of that year.

**With his Olympic dream suddenly a reality again, Louie strived for greatness at this new distance.** He succeeded at his second qualifier in June 1936, clocking the third-fastest time in the country. Louie was invited to the Olympic trials in New York.

### From Big Fish to Small Fish

The residents of Torrance felt Louie’s Olympic dream like it was their own, and they helped procure everything he needed to travel to the big city. They even had “Torrance Tornado” put on his new suitcase.

New York was having a record-breaking summer, and temperatures were excruciating. Three thousand people died across the country as a result of a three-day heat wave. In Manhattan, where the temperature reached up to 106 degrees, forty people died.

These were the conditions of the Olympic trials. There was no way to avoid the heat while Louie and the other runners trained day in and out. Overheated, dehydrated, and unable to rest or eat, many of the racers dropped significant amounts of weight, ten pounds or more, even Louie.

**Louie also struggled with the difference in his stature in New York.** The papers focused on Lash as the favorite. Louie was intimidated but positive he would at least be in the top three. He spent a sleepless night before the race, praying he wouldn’t disappoint everyone from home.

The conditions on the day of the race were dangerous. The temperature was at least 100 degrees. Racers were passing out and being taken to the hospital. There was no shade, and by the time Louie’s race was called, he’d been sitting in the scorching sun for hours.

Louie let Lash take the early lead and hung back in the middle biding his time. Racers were dropping on the track from the heat, and Louie’s feet were burning through his shoes. On the final lap, Louie kicked up his pace. Lash was still out front, and Louie pulled closer and closer down the backstretch to within yards of Lash. When they approached the final turn, he threw everything he had at the track and pulled up side by side with Lash. Exhausted and overheated, Louie and Lash flung their bodies over the line. It was a photo finish.

At home in Torrance, Louie’s house was filled with neighbors listening to the race on the radio.

Family and friends celebrated with shouts of joy, people rushing in, cars honking in the streets. Louise cried tears of joy, and Anthony passed out wine for toasts. Even though the judges had given the win to Lash, the community was overjoyed—Louie was going to the Olympics.

Louie’s placement on the Olympic team was historic. **He became the youngest runner to represent the United States at the Olympics in the nation’s history.**

> **A Journey Like No Other**
> 
> The journey for Louie and his fellow U.S. Olympians was anything but luxurious on the impressive steamer, the _Manhattan_. Although massive, there was no training space for the various athletes, and any spaces found were challenged by the constant rocking of the ship against the waves of the Atlantic.
> 
> The saving grace aboard ship were the elaborate meals served. There were pastries in the morning, steak and eggs for breakfast, coffee, tea, lunch in the afternoon, and great dinners in the evenings.
> 
> Many of the other athletes were from communities afflicted by the Depression, and they gorged happily. But there were consequences. By the time the ship reached Germany, many had gained weight, including a javelin thrower who gained eight pounds over the journey. Others no longer qualified in their events because of specific weight classes, and a few were too out of shape to compete.

### Making His Mark

The _Manhattan_ docked in Germany on July 24, and the athletes walked off into a country on the dawn of one of the worst tragedies in history. Of course, at the time, no one could have known what was waiting on the other side of the Olympics.

**Despite his confidence, Louie knew he was no real match for the strong competition in his event.** The 5,000-meter race had been dominated by the Finns in the last four Olympics. Louie was young, unseasoned, out of practice, and overweight. He barely made fifth in his heat, just barely squeaking through to the final. He would need to improve his condition during the three days until the main event.

On the day of the race, Louie gathered at the starting line filled with fear. There were one hundred thousand people in attendance. His nervous energy almost caused him to start out too strong, but he pulled back, like he had at the trials, and paced himself with the middle of the pack. Lash and the Finns separated themselves as the early leaders.

Louie’s race did not go as planned. He became nauseous during the race because of a strong stench coming from one of the racer’s hair in front of him. To get away from it, he slowed and slipped back, but he couldn’t find his juice, not even when he felt it was time to start moving up. He slid into twelfth place.

As the race neared the end, Louie remembered something Pete had told him: “A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.” Louie started to accelerate, digging deep into the track and himself. He took over many of the runners ahead of him and pushed himself over the line. He finished seventh but had run the race of his life.

Despite missing the podium, Louie’s race was considered an astonishment by everyone in attendance. He’d devoured 50 lost yards in the final 400 meters and shaved eight seconds off his previous personal best. **He’d run the fastest 5,000 of any American that year and was 12 seconds faster than the best time set by Lash the year before.**

Another astonishing aspect of Louie’s race was that his final lap was the fastest final lap in a distance race in the history of the Olympics. It was rare for someone to run a final lap in any distance race in less than a minute. Even in the mile, the three fastest recorded final laps were 61.2, 59.1, and 58.9 seconds. Louie’s final lap was 56 seconds.

Once Louie was cleaned up and in the stands, one of Hitler’s ministers informed Louie that Hitler wanted to meet him. From his seat, perched high above the stands, Hitler reached down to shake Louie’s hand and said, “Ah, you’re the boy with the fast finish.”

### The Party is Over

When Louie and the other athletes were brought through Berlin to the opening ceremonies, they saw for the first time the influence of the Nazis. Flags and banners were everywhere. Men and children lined up in uniform. Military units conducted drills in the streets.

There was a conspicuous absence of Jews and Gypsies, and all over the city, Jewish businesses sat destroyed. The Berlin games were crafted around German superiority, with Adolf Hitler at the helm. National anthems for all other countries were truncated. And whenever Hitler entered the stadium, he was greeted with uproarious applause and Nazi salutes.

A few days after Louie and his trackmates left the village on August 11, the Olympics ended and Hitler reaped the accolades. The end of the Olympics was the beginning of the Nazi’s master plan. **Within days of the closing ceremonies, Berlin was covered in anti-semitic propaganda and “No Jews Allowed” posters on public establishments.** Soon, the Olympic village was turned into military barracks. In a small town 20 miles away, the first group of Jews were being delivered to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

Before anyone overseas got wind of Hitler’s plan, Louie arrived back home. Four thousand people threw him a welcome home party in Torrance, and he was seated on a throne in the back of a truck and paraded through town. A marching band played, first-responder vehicles turned on their sirens, and factories blew their whistles.

Louie took all the attention in stride, but inside, he was disappointed in how slowly he’d run. Louie wasn’t home long before he and Pete were back to scheming. They believed he could win gold in the 1500 at the next Olympics. **Louie set his sights on the 1940 summer games in Tokyo.**

### A Mysterious Companion

Back from the Olympics, Louie began his career as a member of an elite track team at USC. One of his best friends was a sprinter named Payton Jordan, who also had his sights set on the 1940 Tokyo Olympics. Louie also befriended a Japanese student, Kunichi James “Jimmie” Sasaki, who hung around some of the track guys. Sasaki was older, quiet, observant, and amicable. He said he had degrees from several Ivy League schools.

**Jimmie and Louie shared similar tastes for music and athletics and became close.** They also shared a common interest in the town of Torrance. Jimmie said he visited Torrance often to lecture about Japanese heritage to the local Japanese residents. Louie thought it was weird, knowing there weren’t a lot of Japanese in Torrance, but he admired Jimmie’s efforts.

It would be years before Jimmie was outed as a fraud. He’d never attended any of the Ivy League schools he claimed to have graduated from, and he was actually closer to forty than thirty, the age he’d told Louie he was. Jimmie had a wife and children and wasn’t even a student at USC. He’d graduated a decade earlier with a degree in political science. Although Louie couldn’t have known it at the time, he’d encounter Jimmie later in life, under very different circumstances.

### Eye On the Prize

Louie pushed himself and trained like a champion at USC. He continued to dominate his events and set new records. **Two years later, in Spring 1938, Louie was running the mile at 4:13.7, not far off the world record of 4:06.4.**

Coaches, runners, and experts were noticing the trend and all expected Louie to break the world record. Even his idol, Glenn Cunningham, told reporters that Louie was the next mile champion. Many started to wonder whether it was possible to run a four-minute mile. Most said it wasn’t. Pete, on the other hand, believed that Louie could be the first to do it, and though Louie doubted Pete at first, that spring, he started to believe.

By summer, Louie was in the best shape of his life, and his body was becoming crafted in a way that propelled him past the pace and exertion he’d previously enjoyed. **Louie was slated to run the mile at the NCAA Championships in 1938, where he anticipated breaking the four-minute barrier.** A coach from Notre Dame heard other coaches instructing their runners to sharpen their spikes and impale Louie during the race. He shared this information with Louie, but Louie paid the warning no mind.

On race day, Louie found himself surrounded by a group of runners after two laps. They boxed him in, and one runner intentionally stomped on Louie’s foot, sending his spike straight into his toe. Another kicked back with his feet in a way that slashed Louie’s shins with his spikes. Another runner cracked Louie’s rib with the butt of his elbow. They kept him trapped for a lap and a half, but when they came to the final turn, Louie saw a hole in the men and surged through it. Bleeding, broken, and with a destroyed shoe, he blew past the leader and easily won.

Louie was resentful about the actions of the other runners and assumed they’d caused him to clock a slow time, around 4:20. Then, Louie heard a gasp in the audience as the times went up on the race board. **He’d run a 4:08.3 mile, a new NCAA record and the fifth-fastest time in history.** He was 1.9 seconds off the world record. His NCAA record lasted for fifteen years.

### A Dream Deferred by a World in Chaos

As the season wound down, Louie learned that Japan had withdrawn as host for the 1940 games, and they would now be held in Helsinki, Finland. He went undefeated during the 1939 season and performed well against the best runners in the country at indoor meets in the early part of 1940. Louie continued to improve, almost setting a new indoor mile world record twice. He was peaking, and the timing couldn’t have been better.

Across the globe, Japan and Germany had started their war campaigns. Japan had invaded China in 1937, and Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Then, in spring 1940, the Nazis stormed Europe, with the help of the Soviet Union, and started WWII. The bombing destroyed large swaths of Finland, including Helsinki. **The Olympic stadium suffered extensive damage, and one of Louie’s Finnish competitors in Berlin died during the attack. The Olympics were canceled.**

After this news, Louie began to unravel. He became susceptible to illness and physically diminished. He lost his power and started losing races. His senior season at USC ended with a thump, and he left, failing to graduate by a few credits, and took a job as a welder in a factory.

The war in Europe was raging the summer of 1940, with Germany and the Soviets gaining ground all the way to Great Britain. Concurrently, Japan was gaining more control over Asia. America responded by banning all trade with Japan, but that didn’t stop the Japanese forces. In fall 1940, the U.S. government started crafting a draft bill.

Young American men were told that if they voluntarily enlisted before the bill was enforced, they could choose which branch of the military they served in. Louie had become mesmerized by the planes he saw being made for American and British Air Forces at his factory. He decided to enlist in the Army Air Corps in early 1941. But Louie suffered from air sickness and wanted to correct his mistake. Desperate to be let out of service, he signed release papers without even reading them.

After leaving the air corps, Louie went to Hollywood to work as an extra. He was hired to work on _They Died with Their Boots On_ , a movie starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Shortly after the film started shooting, Louie got his draft letter in the mail.

As part of the release agreement he’d signed, Louie had unwittingly agreed to rejoin the Air Corps if brought back into service. **He was slated to become a bombardier and went to Houston for training in November.** His life and those of every American would change forever less than a month later.
