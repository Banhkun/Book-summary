## Chapter 8: Relief At Last

On the morning of November 24, the Americans arrived in Tokyo. The sirens went off, and everyone at Omori, including the guards, stopped what they were doing and marveled at a tremendous sight. One hundred and eleven B-29s were swarming Tokyo to bomb an aircraft factory on the city’s cusp. The prisoners shouted with glee and pride.

Sirens and B-29 sightings became daily events. **Each day of bombing made the Bird dwindle farther into madness.** He took away the minor luxuries from the prisoners, such as smoking and playing cards, and started forcing them to line up at attention regularly in the yard. He’d run up and down the line waving his sword above their heads.

The Bird’s aggression toward Louie also reached pivotal heights once the bombings started. The Bird ran through the camp in search of Louie, then charged at him with fists flying, pounding him until Louie was bleeding on the ground. Louie started dreaming of the Bird beating him with the buckle.

Louie wasn’t only suffering because of the incessant beatings. He was also starving to death. Twice, Red Cross shipments had come in, and twice, the camp officials pilfered what they wanted and stored the rest.**** In one shipment of 227 boxes of supplies, the Bird alone took 42, or 500 pounds of food. **If things didn’t change soon, Louie and the others would perish. Whether it was from abuse or starvation, the Bird would be responsible.**

### A Christmas Surprise

Inexplicably, the Bird stopped abusing the men after Christmas, including Louie. Over the last year, a dignitary had visited Omori and met with a POW named Lewis Bush, who told the prince about the Bird’s abuse. The prince was disturbed by Bush’s reports and spoke with the Japanese war office and the Red Cross. Because of the dignitary’s persistence, the Bird was reassigned to a new camp. The Bird threw himself a massive going away party, forcing many POW officers to join him. When Louie heard the news, he practically fainted.

**The morning after the party, the Bird walked across the bridge to Tokyo. The monster of Omori camp was gone.** Life was exponentially better at Omori after that. Private Kano took over, and POWs were once again allowed to write and receive letters. Louie wrote several to his parents and Pete, but most of them wouldn’t arrive until long after the war ended.

Another surprise occurred in mid-January. Several men from Ofuna crossed the bridge to the camp. Among them was the high-ranking Commander Fitzgerald and Louie’s friend William Harris. When Louie saw William, he shuddered. Harris had been continually beaten by the Quack and was stuck in a mental fog. The Omori doctor examined him and said he was dying.

With the Bird gone, Private Kano ordered the Red Cross boxes to be removed from storage and given to the prisoners. **When Louie received his rations, he gave them to William despite his grave hunger, and with the extra food, William started to come back to life.**

### Paradise Lost

The bombings over Tokyo continued, and the camp guards became increasingly anxious. The POWs were also anxious. Word had spread that 150 POWs had been executed as part of the kill order in the Philippines when an American invasion seemed imminent.

In February, the largest air battle yet over Japan took place above Omori, in which 1,500 American planes fought several hundred Japanese planes, sending bullets and plane parts flying through the sky. When it was over, Japan had lost 500 planes, but the United States had lost only 80. Seven days after the battle, B-29s lit up Tokyo like a roman candle.

Not long after, Louie and fourteen other officers, including Tinker and Commander Fitzgerald, were transferred to a new camp. This camp was called Naoetsu and was stationed above a coastal town in the mountains. Louie was sad to be leaving William again, and when the two said goodbye, it was the last time they ever saw each other.

Naoetsu was covered in four feet of snow. However, the biting weather wasn’t the worst thing about the camp. **When Louie and the others were delivered to the camp, Louie experienced the most bleak moment of his life to date.** Greeting the POWs like old friends who’d come to visit was the Bird. After two months of peace, Louie was back in hell.

Louie’s beatings began almost immediately. For the other Omori POWs, the beatings were nothing new. But for the almost 300 Australians who’d been imprisoned there since 1942, the raw violence against Louie was shocking. Considering what those prisoners had experienced at Naoetsu over the last three years, their response was notable.

Temperatures often plummeted to below zero atop the mountain, and the barracks, a two-story building on a cliff overlooking a frozen river, were so poorly built, it snowed indoors. Most of the men were forced to work at one of several industrial plants or coal mines, sometimes for 18 hours a day. During 1943 and 1944, 60 Australian POWs, or one in five men, died.

**Louie’s arrival at Naoetsu would mark the worst time during all of his war experiences.** At the precise time that Louie was lining up for roll call in the snow, Americans were celebrating him with the inaugural Louis Zamperini Invitational, a track event held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The winner of the mile was four seconds slower than Louie’s casual run that day long ago in Hawaii.

### Hell

Louie fell into a deep despair back in the clutches of the Bird. The beatings were daily, and the winter passed in much the same way it had at Omori. Once again, the Bird decided that officers would have to work. They were assigned field duty, and although the walk to the fields was six miles each way, the work of digging and planting was nothing compared to the labor the enlisted men had to endure. The supervisor was friendly and allowed them to drink all they wanted from a fresh-water well. **Even though the work violated the Geneva Convention, it got the men away from the Bird all day, which was a blessing.**

However, one day, the field supervisor innocently joked that the Bird’s prisoners were lazy. Although the comment was made in jest, the Bird went into a rage and ordered the officers to work hard labor in the coal mines with everyone else.

Louie and the other officers shoveled and hauled coal day in and day out, with one estimate suggesting that each man hauled around four tons of coal a day. The guards pushed them to move faster and faster, and often the whole day would go by without food or the ability to stand up straight.

One day, Louie was hauling coal up a railcar ramp when a guard elbowed him in the side. **Louie fell off the ramp and injured one ankle and knee so badly, he couldn’t put weight on that leg.** Louie was relegated to the camp, which meant he was alone all day with the Bird. Because he wasn’t working, he only received a half ration of food. He was injured and starving and spiked a fever of 104.

Louie begged the Bird for work to increase his rations. The Bird assigned Louie to clean out the pig sty, providing no tools. Louie spent his days picking up pig feces with his hands and shoveling as much feed into his mouth as he could to stave off death. **Out of everything he’d endured to date, this work was the thing that finally broke Louie.** The only thing that kept him alive was the faint hope of rescue.

### The Beginning of the End

On May 5, 1945, a B-29 circled above the village of Naoetsu and adjoining steel mill, where POWs were working. From inside, the workers heard a loud boom and felt a shower of dust from the rafters above. The Japanese ran to shelters, and the POWs huddled together. A bomb had missed the factory and landed in a nearby field.

News of the war’s progress was kept from the prisoners at Naoetsu, but the bombing by the B-29 told an inspiring story. If the Americans were taking time to bomb one factory on the far side of Japan, the other major cities and targets must already be gone. The Japanese were losing the war.

The POWs suspicions were confirmed days later when four hundred new arrivals from other camps wandered into the Naoetsu camp. **The new POWs spread some encouraging but sobering news—Germany had surrendered, but Japan was still fighting the war.**

The POWs knew from the guards that Japan would never surrender. It was against their cultural code to admit defeat. They would continue to fight, and if necessary, they would execute the kill order. In fact, all over Japan, camp officials had received orders to liquidate the prisoners on August 22.

### Dead Man Walking

By June, Louie could again put pressure on his leg and was sent back to the mines. The abuse from the Bird continued, and with the approaching allies, his sadistic tendencies took on great heights.

When several POWs were caught stealing food at the mines, The Bird called all the prisoners into the yard and lined them up. The thieves were brought forward, as were Louie, Tinker, and another officer, who were held responsible for the actions of the enlisted men. As punishment, each enlisted man was to punch the guilty parties in the face as hard as he could. Anyone who refused would join the culprits, and anyone who didn’t use maximum force would be clubbed.

**For more than two hours, Louie and the others endured 220 punches to the face while the Bird watched like a hawk.** When one man fell, he was hoisted back up, and the punching continued. Louie’s face was so swollen, he couldn’t open his mouth for days.

All over camp, things were deteriorating. The extra men had not created extra food, and the rations were smaller than ever. Louie was struggling. Dysentery wreaked dangerous havoc on his body, and the continued beatings made him weaker and weaker.

Fearing death, Louie went to seek help from the doctor without permission. When the Bird found out, he pushed Louie into the yard and told him to pick up a thick wooden beam six feet in length. Louie was to hold the beam above his head, and if he lowered his arms at all, a guard would hit Louie with his gun. The Bird climbed onto a roof and waited.

Louie set his gaze on the Bird and hoisted the beam in the air. Minutes passed, and as the Bird laughed at him, Louie’s arms began to falter. At one point, his arms dipped, and a guard rammed the butt of his gun into Louie’s stomach. Louie straightened up, but he was woozy and felt like he was going to pass out. **His arms were numb, and the earth tilted. Only one thought ran through his mind: “He cannot break me.”**

The longer Louie stood with the beam, the more angry the Bird grew. Finally, the Bird jumped down and rammed his fist into Louie’s gut. Louie lurched forward, dropping the beam on his head, which knocked him unconscious. Another officer had looked at the camp clock both when Louie lifted the beam and when he dropped it. Louie had held the beam for 37 minutes.

### Enough is Enough

On August 1, 836 B-29s swarmed the skies above Japan and dropped 5 million leaflets warning civilians about an upcoming massive attack. The leaflet urged them to evacuate, but the Japanese government forbade it. Anyone found in possession of the leaflet was arrested.

In the early hours of August 6, a B-29 carrying a nine-thousand-pound, twelve-foot-long bomb named “Little Boy” took off for Japan. The pilot, Paul Tibbets, flew for hours until the city of Hiroshima appeared before him. He told his crew to put on special goggles and drop the bomb. Tibbets turned the plane and flew at great speed to put as much distance between the plane and the coming blast.

As Tibbets flew at great speed away from the drop site, an immense white light swallowed them, followed by a tremendous noise and sonic reverberations. The fillings in Tibbet’s mouth began to tingle, and his co-pilot made a note in his diary: “My God.” Below them, a great cloud of swirling colors rose three miles into the air.

**At camp, Louie and the others heard rumors about one American bomb that destroyed a whole city.** They didn’t believe such a thing could happen, but someone found a newspaper describing an electronic bomb that had killed many people. Three days later, on August 9, Nagasaki was demolished in the same way.
