## Exercise: Strategize to Achieve Presence

Cuddy makes three main recommendations for increasing your presence: power posing before events that make you anxious, using open and friendly body language when you interact with others, and adjusting your posture through regular reminders or exercises that focus on breathing and stretching out. In this exercise, you’ll identify where presence could make the biggest impact in your life and make a plan to improve your presence.

Presence is especially crucial in situations where you lack confidence or get stuck in negative thought cycles. Think of a stressful situation or context where you’d like to confidently express yourself, then describe your ideal behaviors or qualities in that scenario. For example, you might want to increase your presence when you’re in class, so you’re comfortable raising your hand and speaking up in discussions.

Make a plan to power pose before the scenario in the previous question. For example, this could include power posing for a few minutes in your room or backstage before a performance.

Now visualize the body cues that will help you convey presence _during_ the stressful situation. Describe how you want your voice to sound, how you’ll move your hands and arms, and how you’ll display open, friendly, and confident body language.

To cultivate presence in the long term, describe a situation where you find yourself exhibiting closed-off posture regularly, and then write at least one activity that could counteract it. For example, if you work at a desk for long periods, you might add a visual note to check your posture, change your office setup, or add a daily stretching routine to your schedule.
