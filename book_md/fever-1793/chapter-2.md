## Chapter 2: A Pandemic in the Making—Aug 23-31, 1793

Within a week’s time, **64 more people had died. But no one knew whether it was from fever or something else.** Rumors of the fever by the docks sent the community flooding toward the center of the city. The fear was a boon for the coffeehouse, and they were busier than ever.

Matilda continued to take over Polly’s duties, leaving her no time to mourn her dead friend. She was so tired each night that she once fell asleep in the bathroom. Lucille continued to keep Matilda close and restricted her contact with customers. But their supplies were dwindling, and someone had to go to market. Matilda jumped at the chance.

Lucille dismissed the idea immediately, but Grandpa reasoned with her. She was exhausted and needed the break, he said. Lucille had to admit she felt unseasonably warm and tired. She finally agreed to let Matilda go as long as she came straight home and didn’t go past the lower-numbered streets by the river. This news was music to Matilda’s ears. She was tired of being cooped up in the house. **Lucille had even started talking about sending Matilda to live with family friends, the Ludingtons, in the country.** The only thing Matilda knew about the Ludingtons was that they had filthy pigs and mean dogs. She wanted to prove she was responsible enough to stay in the city.

At the market, Matilda wandered the stalls. West Indian women sold stew from pepper pots. Chickens and hens filled the air with squawks. People bartered with shopkeepers, and children played all around. At the egg stand, Mrs. Elpers, a German farm woman, said the fever was punishment from God for those who didn’t attend church. If you went to church, she said, you had nothing to fear.

Matilda finished her shopping and was about to leave when someone grabbed her basket from behind. When she turned to see who it was, she gasped. Nathaniel Benson stood before her, more manly and taller than she’d remembered. Her insides quivered, and she tried not to stare, but his chestnut hair was so beautiful.

Nathaniel and Matilda had known each other since they were babies. He worked as an apprentice for the famous painter Charles Peale. He also thought going to Paris sounded like a great idea. He often walked by the coffeehouse, and Matilda often walked by the Peale’s house. But they rarely spoke to each other. Lucille didn’t approve of Nathaniel. She thought he was a deadbeat or worse.

Nathaniel was going fishing and asked Matilda to join him. Despite her mother’s warnings, she was tempted. She hadn’t done anything recreational since Polly’s death. Plus, unlike with her mother, she could be herself with Nathaniel. She could even roll her shirt sleeves above her elbows. But when he smiled at her, Matilda figured she better leave her sleeves down. You had to be careful with boys and elbows. She decided she would fish like a proper lady.

Their conversation was cut short by the sound of church bells ringing. It was an odd sound because it wasn’t the top of the hour. A man nearby said **the bells rang every time another person died now—one gong for each year of life.** Matilda and Nathaniel listened. The bells rang twenty-one times. Matilda grew emotional, thinking about her dead friend. Nathaniel touched her shoulder to comfort her. After the bells, Matilda decided to return home. She said goodbye and walked away. She could still feel Nathaniel’s warm hand on her body.

### Life Goes On

Despite the rising number of deaths, things didn’t change much around the coffeehouse. Seven days later, Matilda and Grandpa were out in the backyard joking around like any other day. He relaxed in the shade while she pushed clean linens through the mangler in the scorching heat. They talked about the weather. Matilda longed for winter days and skating on the frozen river. Grandpa liked the heat; the cold made his bones ache.

At lunch time, the family sat around the table discussing what they should do with their new windfall. Grandpa and Matilda thought they should expand the coffeehouse. Matilda wanted to buy the lot next door, get another coffee urn, open up a dry goods store, and start selling proper dinners. If they had proper dinners, Thomas Jefferson and President Washington might decide to dine there.

Lucille had different ideas. She said the windfall was temporary. As soon as people stopped being afraid of the wharf, business would return to normal. She thought they should save the money for when they really needed it. She pushed more food on Matilda’s plate and told her to eat so she wouldn’t get sick.

Grandpa scoffed at the fever panic. August fevers were normal, he said. He blamed the refugees and suggested they be quarantined on an island until the fever passed. Lucille again brought up going to the Ludingtons’ until the fever blew over. Grandpa was about to argue, but he was interrupted when a note arrived at the door. Pernilla Ogilvie, the matriarch of a prominent family, was inviting Matilda and Lucille for tea that afternoon. The Ogilvies had five sons, and Lucille had her eye on the youngest, Edward, as Matilda’s future husband.

Matilda protested. She refused to go until Grandpa reminded her that her choices were either tea or chores. Lucille jumped into action to find them something to wear. They didn’t have tea-drinking clothes, and Matilda had grown out of the one nice dress she had. Lucille only had an outdated banquet dress from after the war. With such short notice, they had to make do with what they had. Eliza combed the knots from Matilda’s hair, a chunk of which was stuck together with jam.

When they were finished primping, Matilda looked like a doll. She was mortified. She said she would be polite, but she wasn’t going to talk to Edward. **She didn’t need a husband to run the coffeehouse. Her mother was proof of that.**

Lucille said she’d be lucky if an upstanding gentleman like Edward agreed to marry an ill-mannered girl like her. With four older brothers, Edward’s prospects were small enough that Matilda would barely be acceptable as the daughter of a successful business owner. She would get married and be happy. The last thing they all needed was another spinster in the house.

### Across the Class Divide

Matilda was stuffed into her bodice and petticoat so tightly, she could barely breathe. Lucille promised they wouldn’t stay long after knocking on the Ogilvies’ door. They had to get back before Grandpa gave the shop away. Then, she turned to Matilda, and with uncharacteristic gentleness, she said that Matilda was going to grow into a beautiful woman. She wanted the best life for Matilda that she could have. **Matilda was taken aback by Lucille’s intimacy and compassion.** But as quickly as it appeared, it vanished. The door opened, and they were let in.

The inside of the Ogilvie home was enormous and extravagant—crystal chandeliers, a large mahogany table, and Chippendale chairs. Pernilla Ogilvie waltzed out in a lavish gown and dusted hair. The two daughters, Colette and Jeannine, were summoned with a bell. They appeared dressed identically in pink and yellow gowns. Both Matilda and Lucille felt naked in their old clothes.

Colette, the oldest, was pale and had dark circles under her eyes. Jeannine, on the other hand, was a vision of health and mischief. It didn’t take long before her snobbery revealed itself during tea. She stuck her tongue out at Matilda behind a silk fan. She moved the plate of pastries out of Matilda’s reach.

Pernilla was no better. As soon as she was introduced to Matilda, she commented on how sad it was that Matilda’s handsome father had died. If he’d only been educated, he could have made something of himself. The Cook women bristled, but Lucille was determined not to spoil the conversation.

Pernilla lamented about the fever, too. She complained that all of her society friends had fled to the country. She was bored and distraught that her gala to celebrate Colette’s recent engagement was canceled. What an injustice, she said. The filthy refugees and river rats were always sick with something. And now they were interfering in her social life. She looked to Lucille for agreement, but Lucille changed the subject.

Lucille inquired about the Ogilvie boys. She asked whether any of them were engaged or had considered a career in business. Pernilla feigned ignorance about the motivation behind the question, but Jeannine was happy to jump in and explain. She said Mrs. Cook was trying to marry Matilda off to one of her brothers, and their dirty tavern was part of the deal.

Both Matilda and Lucille jumped to defend their respectable business. However, the conversation halted when Colette stood from the table shaking and sweating. She’d become weaker over the course of tea, spilling cakes on the floor and tea on her dress. The last thing she said before she collapsed was that she was burning. Lucille placed a hand to her forehead. Colette had the fever.

### Desperate Times

The events at the Ogilvie house seemed to mark the beginning of something serious in the city, and panic spread quickly. For two days following Colette’s collapse, the church bells didn’t stop ringing. Cannons were shot in the main square to cleanse the air of impurities. Flies, bees, and mosquitoes buzzed incessantly, adding to the frenzied cacophony and disturbance in the community. The heat was still intense. Not even a brief rainstorm brought much relief.

The Cooks didn’t know what had happened to Colette after the tea. The Ogilvies, like every other wealthy family in the city, fled the city shortly after. **The coffeehouse went from overflowing with customers to only a handful trickling in throughout the day.** Less business meant less work for Eliza, so Eliza started attending meetings of the Free African Society to discuss the fever. Matilda had less to do, as well, and started accompanying Grandpa to the newspaper office to get the latest reports.

At the printing shop, Matilda and Grandpa found Andrew Brown, the owner, and Mr. Carris discussing the latest decree from the mayor. The decree would soon be hot off the presses. The men seemed surprised that the Cook family hadn’t retreated to the country. **Grandpa said he hadn’t run from the British, and he wasn’t about to run from a little sickness.** What was wrong with people? They’ve suffered disease in the past without losing their heads, he said.

In response, Mr. Carris read the decree from the mayor aloud:

  * Avoid those who are infected.
  * The homes of the sick should be identified with markings.
  * The poor should be hospitalized.
  * The streets and dock areas should be cleaned.
  * People should avoid mental and physical distress and stay inside as much as possible.



Mr. Carris told them that a building uptown had been turned into a shelter for the poor. The workers carried bodies out daily. Matilda was shocked by this news. She had no idea so many people were dying on a daily basis. When she asked what the death toll was, Mr. Brown said it was believed to be in the several hundreds. But the doctors warned it could turn into thousands before it was all over.

Grandpa brushed this news aside. It was just hysterical exaggeration. But Mr. Carris said even the government was running to the country, including men who’d fought on the frontlines during the war. He was scared for the city and all the people. He was scared for himself. Everyone grew quiet.

Matilda and Grandpa walked silently back home. **She counted the number of days until the first frost, which would destroy the fever: 28 at the minimum.** Suddenly, going to the Ludington’s didn’t seem like such a bad idea.

A dirty man pushed a wheelbarrow past them on the sidewalk. A human arm dangled over the side. Grandpa was livid that this man was carting bodies in the good part of town during the day. But when the man stopped in front of the coffeehouse, Matilda felt her throat tighten. She ran toward the man, arriving just as he dumped a woman’s body on the sidewalk. It was Lucille.
