## Chapter 4: The Balance Between Heaven and Hell—Sep 10-27, 1793

Two days passed, and things for Matilda and Grandpa went from bad to worse. Grandpa was still alive, and his eyes weren’t yellow. But he was weak without food and water. The morning sun burned brighter each second. Soon, it would be scorching. Matilda took the canteen back to the stream.

On the way, her mind flip-flopped between strategies to help her grandfather and her mother. She wondered if Eliza and her mother would send help when Grandpa didn’t return from the country. **When she thought of her mother, she was filled with shame. She should have been stronger, like Eliza. Her mother was disgusted with her and had always been.**

Matilda shook the bad thoughts from her mind. She would focus on the positives. Her mother would heal at home. A carriage would find her and Grandpa and take them to the Ludingtons’ farm. A letter from her mother would be waiting for them that said Matilda could come home. Her mind strayed to the lost pantry and all the food Eliza had packed: cinnamon rolls, cheese, ham, and preserves. Her stomach rumbled.

At the stream, Matilda took off her petticoat and bathed in the cold water. She couldn’t help wondering what Nathaniel would say if he saw her bathing. Would he like it? The sound of fish jumping brought her back. She grabbed her petticoat and tried to use it as a net, but a bird scared the fish away. There was no time to try again. She had to get back to Grandpa.

### Out of Options

When Matilda returned, Grandpa could barely sit up to drink the water. He shivered and said he was cold, which was remarkable considering the sweltering heat. He handed her a pouch of coins and sent her to find food and blankets at a nearby farm. **Matilda didn’t want to leave him, but she feared he wouldn’t make it another night.** She set out in hopes of stumbling across some sign of life.

She came across a farmer working in his field. When he saw Matilda, he ran to the farmhouse and locked the door. He turned her away, saying he couldn’t help anyone with the fever. She wanted to keep going, but something told her to get back to Grandpa.

On the road back, she stepped on a piece of rotten fruit. She looked up and saw the source—a pear tree full of dangling fruit. She collected as many as she could in her skirt and headed back to the chestnut tree.

After a while, the tree came into view, but the pears grew incredibly heavy. The tree looked like it was getting farther away, rather than closer. The sun turned from a fireball into an iceball. Her teeth chattered and she grew disoriented. Where was she? Where was her mother? Eliza? Why was she carrying rocks? **The last thought she had was sleep, and then everything went dark.**

### Salvation in Philadelphia

Two days later, Matilda regained consciousness and found that everything had changed. **She was no longer on the side of the road but in a bed.** She heard a man’s voice ask if she was dead. She could make out carpentry sounds in the distance and moans closer by.

She drifted to sleep, and nightmares plagued her fever dreams. She choked on dirt and dust billowing from carriages in the road. There were too many of them, and their horses fought for space as people fled the city. A group of soldiers appeared and yelled at her in French. Grandpa was with them and ordered them to fire their guns at her. She woke with a jolt. The room was dark except for a streak of moonlight coming through a window.

**She was laying in a mess of wet sheets covered in blood and black goo, the same type of mess her mother had made.** There was only one explanation—yellow fever. To her left slept a young woman with braids. To her right was a corpse covered by a sheet. Her heart thumped. Was it her mother? Grandpa? She lifted the sheet and saw the smooth hand of a young woman.

The next time she woke up, the shutters were closed against the blazing sun. She could make out her surroundings better. It was a large room like the Ogilvie’s drawing room, but bigger and missing the adorned furniture. The ceilings were high, and a chandelier hung in the middle. A large woman appeared with a bowl of steaming broth. Her name was Bridget Flagg, and she was relieved to see that Matilda had made it through the night.

Bridget told Matilda that Grandpa was waiting to see her. He didn’t have yellow fever, just a cough and heatstroke. She also commented on how handsome and charming he was, not to mention brave and strong for carrying Matilda all the way there. Matilda relaxed. If Grandpa was flirting and telling tall tales, he was just fine.

Just then, Grandpa came into the room. He teased Matilda about being lazy in bed when there was work to be done. Then, he and Bridget started to flirt. Matilda had to interrupt to find out where they were and how they’d gotten there. **Her relief turned to panic when Bridget said she was at Bush Hill Mansion, a large property outside the city limits.**

The city of Philadelphia had turned Bush Hill into a hospital for those with fever when the disease first spread. Rumors of criminals preying on the sick and bodies piling up were heard all over the city. Bush Hill was a dangerous place, and Matilda wanted to get herself and Grandpa out of there. She tried to stand, but Bridget helped her back down.

Bush Hill had changed, Bridget said. A wealthy French businessman named Stephen Girard had purchased the place and cleared out the riff raff and disreputable employees. He fixed the place up and brought in a real team of French doctors, nurses, medicine, and food. It was a proper hospital now. Both Matilda and Grandpa knew of Mr. Girard from the coffeehouse, and Grandpa greatly admired him. He was an astute businessman, with a hand in many ventures around Philadelphia.

Bridget said they were lucky to be there. **The French doctors knew how to treat the fever, not like Dr. Rush, whose bloodletting strategy was believed to make people worse.** The mention of bloodletting reminded Matilda of Dr. Kerr’s treatment of her mother. She became agitated. What had happened to her mother?

Grandpa went to the house after arriving at Bush Hill, but it was boarded up. They’d been gone for five days, and he assumed Lucille had traveled to the country to meet them. He sent a letter to the Ludingtons and expected to hear back anytime now. At this news, Matilda relaxed and fell back to sleep. She would be at Bush Hill for eight more days.

### Recovery

Bush Hill was both a blessing and a curse for Matilda. She was hospitalized for 10 days before she made a turn for the better. Each day, stories of terror swirled around her. People spoke of a small child found clinging to his mother’s dead body; a dying man begging for water from his bedroom window; thieves who stole from the sick and dead; and angels who helped out of the goodness of their hearts. People spoke of patients losing their minds, and within her own ward, people screamed in agony.

Matilda tried to block it all out. **She listened just enough to hear news of her mother, Eliza, or Nathaniel, but that news never came.** Once recovered, Matilda was moved out of the ward and into the barn. The barn smelled like horses and manure, but it was pristine inside and cool from the stone walls. Matilda was grateful to be away from the sick and suffering.

Grandpa came to visit often. He was camping in the back yard and helping with the efforts however he could. He delivered food, burned mattresses, and raised money. The work made him feel useful and important, like he’d felt during the war.

Matilda was sleeping through the night again, but each morning she wondered about her mother, who still hadn’t written back. Matilda was sure that her recovery meant her mother had also recovered. But where was she? Matilda also wondered about Eliza, but she had no idea how to find her.

Each day brought more strength and questions about Matilda’s future. On Day 6 in the barn, a man came to answer that question. He was transferring her to the city orphanage. Matilda flipped at this news, and Bridget ran to get Grandpa.

The man seemed upset that Matilda had family. **He tried to talk Grandpa into sending Matilda to the orphanage, saying that she’d be safe there, but Grandpa wouldn’t budge.** He told the man to get out before he reported him to the president. After the man left, Grandpa fell into a coughing spell. Both Matilda and Bridget watched with horror, but he laughed it off. He said they couldn’t get rid of him that easily.

### Reality

Sixteen days after leaving for the farm, Matilda and Grandpa left for Philadelphia, a city they would no longer recognize. Bridget stood next to the carriage taking them and five sick children to the orphanage with tears in her eyes. She waved goodbye, and Grandpa waved back, saying he hoped they would meet again when times were better. The carriage moved on, and Bush Hill faded in the distance.

Matilda sat in the back of the carriage next to an older woman named Mrs. Bowles. She was kind and worked at the orphanage. She asked Matilda what her plan was to help, but Matilda didn’t know what there was for her to do. She was just a girl after all. As soon as she said these words, Matilda regretted them. Someone was finally treating her as an adult, and she acted like a baby.

**Mrs. Bowles said they needed a lot of help at the orphanage, and a young woman like Matilda could be of great service.** Another girl in the carriage, Susannah, was going to the orphanage to do just that. At the orphanage, Matilda would be fed, kept safe, and given a small stipend. But Matilda said no. Her grandpa wouldn’t hear of it and needed her help, too.

Mrs. Bowles understood but cautioned her to stay home once they arrived. The city was dangerous now, with the sick and dead everywhere and men and criminals lurking in the streets. Just then, the carriage rolled through the outskirts of the city. Ceased construction projects left skeletons of new houses and businesses littering the landscape.

When Grandpa learned that there was no food in the city, he suggested writing another letter to the farm to see if they could come stay. But the driver told him mail delivery was no longer in service. Again, Mrs. Bowels offered for Matilda to stay with them, which prompted Matilda to ask what would happen to her and Susannah once the fever was over. Susannah’s parents’ house would be sold, and the money would become her dowry. She would likely work as a scuttle maid or servant until a husband was found.

This was not the fate Matilda imagined for herself. She daydreamed about her mother returning to find the coffeehouse in top shape. She’d marvel at the amazing job Matilda did running it and at the new dry goods store Matilda and Grandpa would open next door. Matilda would accept her accolades wearing a French dress. All would be right again. She’d even hire Susannah to work for them.

Matilda was brought back to reality when they entered the city center. It was daytime, but everything was cast in gray. The stores were closed, and there were no pedestrians on the streets. Houses flew yellow flags to signify the sick inside or had barricaded doors to keep out intruders. A 17-year-old boy in a stained tailored suit lay dead on a stoop. His yellow eyes stared into nothing. His shoes still held their upper-class sheen.

**Everywhere she looked, Matilda saw her ravished city.** The wagon stopped for a line of men carrying dead bodies in wheelbarrows. **A trench was dug next to the central square, and mounds of dirt covered piles of bodies.**

When they finally reached the orphanage, Mrs. Bowels and the children exited the carriage. She reminded Matilda of her offer and wished her and Grandpa safety and good health in whatever they decided to do.

### Home Sweet Home

Although Grandpa had visited the coffeehouse a few days earlier, everything was different when they arrived. When the carriage pulled up, Matilda noticed the front door cracked. She jumped down and ran up the stairs, hoping to find her mother waiting. Instead, **she found the coffeehouse completely ransacked by robbers.** Chairs and tables were broken, cookware and crockery smashed on the floor, and the pantry stripped clean. Even the coffee and tea canisters were empty.

The thieves hadn’t gone upstairs, and their rooms were as they left them. At least the strongbox with their money was still hidden below a hollow stair. Grandpa couldn’t believe his eyes. His face grew red, and he held his left arm. Matilda turned on her captain’s voice and ordered him to bed at once. **She was also tired, still healing, and needed rest, but someone had to fetch water and find food.**

Matilda scoured the dry and brittle garden and managed to find a few beans, some squash, and a few cherries. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing. She thanked God for keeping them alive and prayed for her mother and Eliza. She also told God to punish those who’d ruined their home, but not too much. They were probably just hungry, too.
