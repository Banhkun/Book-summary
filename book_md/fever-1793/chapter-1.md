## Chapter 1: The Calm Before the Storm—Aug 16, 1793

Fourteen-year-old Matilda Cook and her mother, Lucille, shared a cramped bedroom in an apartment above their coffeehouse in Philadelphia. There were only two beds, a wash station, and a large wooden trunk. Across the hall lived Grandpa William, Matilda’s paternal grandfather.

It was a hot day in August, another in a series of long, hot days, and Matilda was dreading it. She wanted to slip down to the docks later, where she hoped to see Nathanial Benson, a young man who understood her desire to break free from the ties that bound her. Those ties belonged to her mother.

Matilda’s mother was the daughter of wealthy parents. She’d been a good child. She never complained, always did what she was told, and never spoke unless spoken to—the way she believed children should be. Despite her status, she was well-versed in working-class trades, like quilting, sewing, and spinning wool. Matilda was the antithesis of those qualities.

But the docks would have to wait. Their serving girl, Polly, was late, which meant Matilda had to help her mother open the coffeehouse. Matilda was annoyed. She assumed Polly was late because she was flirting with Matthew, the blacksmith’s son. This wasn’t unusual behavior, but Polly’s tardiness always sent Lucille into a tirade. She’d been screaming for Matilda to wake up for almost an hour.

Matilda’s father, a carpenter by trade, had built the building following the Revolutionary War. It was on the corner of Seventh and High Streets, two blocks from President Washington’s house. This location kept business busy with politicians, merchants, and gentlemen, who traded news and gossip over coffee and cakes.

**Matilda’s father never got to see the business take off. Two months after the coffeehouse opened, he fell off a ladder and died.** Lucille’s parents had disowned her after she married below her class and offered no support following her husband’s death. If it wasn’t for Grandpa William moving in and the culinary skills of Eliza, a free black woman who worked for the family, Matilda and her mother would be homeless.

### The First Sign of Danger

The sounds of city life—horses, carriages, dogs chasing pigs, and gossip from Mrs. Henning next door—filtered up while Matilda got ready. She skipped washing off in the basin. The water was filmy and putrid. Everything seemed to be filthy these days, the result of a six-week drought that left enough dust in the air to obscure the surrounding landscape.

Downstairs, Matilda found Eliza in the large kitchen preparing gingerbread for the day. Matilda loved Eliza for more than her cooking abilities. Eliza was kind and often slipped a sugar cube in the bottom of her bowl of oatmeal. Eliza was born into slavery in Virginia. When she married, her husband used his savings to buy her freedom. Eliza had been saving up to buy his, but he was killed by a wild horse. Eliza stopped speaking and went into a deep mourning, something Lucille knew well. **The two women became connected through their sorrow. After a few years, Eliza’s light finally turned back on inside, but Lucille’s never did.**

The kitchen was the smaller of the two downstairs rooms. The largest was the serving room for their customers. That morning, Grandpa was also nowhere to be found. Matilda offered to search for him and Polly, but her mother ordered her to tend to the dying garden.

Matilda hated taking orders. Now that she was getting older, Lucille treated her more like a servant than a daughter. Matilda couldn’t wait until she could leave home. She wanted to move to Paris and bring back French fineries, like cloth and jewelry, to sell to Philadelphia’s elite. She wanted to buy a city block and open a restaurant, a pharmacy, a school, or maybe a hatter’s shop. She had big dreams and believed she would reach them.

But for now, she was a daughter stuck in the house. She begrudgingly went to water the scorched garden, which is where her mother found her when she returned from searching for Polly. Lucille told Matilda that Polly fell ill the night before and collapsed. She was dead.

### Disbelief

Matilda couldn’t believe the news about Polly’s death. The two were close friends before Polly became their servant. They’d played with dolls and made up songs while churning butter. Matilda closed her eyes and tried to conjure the memory.

Matilda, Lucille, and Eliza sat at the kitchen table, letting the news sink in. Polly hadn’t suffered. She came down with a fever, and an hour later, she died. There’d been no time for a doctor. Eliza worried about the other seven children in the house and thought Matilda should take some food over to ease their suffering. But Lucille wouldn't hear of it. She forbade Matilda from going anywhere near the house or to the funeral.

Matilda was livid. She accused her mother of being cruel but immediately regretted it. Her mother had once been gentle and full of laughter and smiles. But **since her husband’s death, Lucille had become a worn captain in the battle for their lives. Matilda was merely a soldier required to obey.** She apologized at once.

### Notes from the Peanut Gallery

By mid-afternoon, word of other sick people had spread throughout the city. The coffeehouse was crammed full of men. Raucous laughter and arguing filled the air, and everyone had a theory about what was making people sick. Matilda passed out gingerbread, coffee, and tea to the patrons. She delivered some to Grandpa’s table, where he was joined by a lawyer, two government men, and a businessman named Mr. Carris.

Grandpa was once Captain William Farnsworth Cook, an army officer in the Pennsylvania Fifth Regiment who’d served under General Washington. He was well-liked and had the best stories and gossip. When Matilda delivered the gingerbread, she overheard part of his conversation.

Mr. Carris blamed the fever on the rotting pile of coffee beans by Ball’s wharf. He said they released toxins in the air. One of the government men said he heard the refugees living near the wharf were sick with fever. A doctor at the next table interjected, saying it wasn’t just the refugees who were sick. A reputable woman died yesterday after catching a fever. He said it’s possible the culprit is yellow fever. The lawyer balked at this, accusing the doctor of inciting hysterics to make more money. **Yellow fever vanished 30 years ago** , the lawyer reminded them all.

Grandpa didn’t want to hear any more cockamamie theories. People died of fever during the summer months all the time, especially people who lived by the filthy river. He turned the subject to politics, and the room picked up again with boisterous arguments.

After everyone was gone, Matilda helped Lucille with the accounts and cleaned up the serving room. When she asked her mother if she could help put the dishes away, Lucille said Polly would do it in the morning. Both fell silent. Lucille quickly recovered and said she would take care of the dishes herself. Matilda could hear the sound of Matthew’s hammer on anvil down the block. She wondered if he knew about Polly.
