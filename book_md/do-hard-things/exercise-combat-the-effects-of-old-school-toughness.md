## Exercise: Combat the Effects of Old-School Toughness

Examine how the ideas of “old-school” toughness have affected your life and how you could do things differently.

* * *

Think of a time when, in hindsight, you set unrealistic expectations for yourself. What were those expectations, and how were they unrealistic? Did these expectations make things easier or harder when things got difficult? How might things have gone differently if you’d been more realistic in your expectations?

Now think of a time recently when you were encouraged, either by yourself or another, to suppress an emotion or feeling. Maybe you told yourself not to be sad after an upsetting experience or not to feel angry after someone said something hurtful. Was suppressing your emotion effective? How might you have dealt with the experience differently if you had acknowledged your emotions?

Think of a recent time when you felt so overwhelmed by a task or situation that you felt the urge to give up. For example, maybe you had such a hard time with a work project that you thought about calling in sick to avoid finishing it. Did you try to ignore the urge to give up? If so, how did this work out? How might things have gone differently if you had acknowledged your urge to give up?
