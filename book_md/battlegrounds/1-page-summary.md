## 1-Page Summary

The United States has an attitude problem. It views the world through a self-centered lens, based on the assumption that US actions and policy decisions are the main driving force behind global events. This worldview comes in two flavors—unwarranted optimism about the US’s ability to solve other countries’ issues and self-recrimination that all the world’s problems are somehow the US’s fault for interfering. Because of this distorted worldview, Gen. H.R. McMaster contends the US and its democratic allies are losing influence on the global stage at a time when authoritarian aggression is on the rise and the balance of power in the world is realigning.

In _Battlegrounds_ , published in 2020, McMaster, who served as US national security adviser, says **the US needs a strong dose of empathy** —in particular, the ability to see the world through the eyes of its competitors and adversaries. The conceit of American policymakers is that the US is the fulcrum of the world. This blinds them to the goals and ambitions of rival powers such as Russia and China, while denying the historical and emotional motivations that underlie the actions of other countries’ leaders. Gaining a more realistic view of the nations and groups with which the US contends will better prepare the democracies of the world to defend against threats and compete in the modern global landscape.

H.R. McMaster is a retired US Army lieutenant general who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the White House from 2017 to 2018. As a professor of US military history, McMaster wrote a previous book, _Dereliction of Duty_ , which focused on the policy failures that led to the US’s involvement in Vietnam. _Battlegrounds_ derives from McMaster’s work to frame national defense strategies during the early years of the Trump administration.

(Shortform note: In _Dereliction of Duty_ , McMaster argued that while the US ostensibly supported the South Vietnamese government to prevent the spread of Communism in southeast Asia, President Lyndon Johnson adopted a military strategy that prolonged US engagement while bolstering his public image back home. From the commitment of US forces in 1964 to the fall of Saigon in 1975, millions of Vietnamese and nearly 60,000 Americans were killed. In the US, the Vietnam War’s lasting cultural legacy is an overriding reluctance to commit American forces into overseas conflicts without short-term, clear-cut objectives—a stance that can be self-defeating, as McMaster explains in _Battlegrounds_.)

In this guide, we’ll explore McMaster’s criticism of the faulty assumptions driving US foreign policy, his assessment of the threats America and its allies face across the world, and the steps he believes the US must take to stay competitive on the changing global stage. We’ll also contrast McMaster’s views with those of other experts on diplomacy and defense, while placing his assessments in their larger context and updating some of his book’s information based on events that have taken place since its initial publication.

### American Assumptions

McMaster describes how poor fundamental assumptions have clouded US foreign policy in ways that are detrimental to itself and other nations. First among these is the belief that democracy and capitalism are inevitable systems that all countries will naturally shift to over time. The second bad assumption is that after the Cold War and the Gulf War, no adversary would consider armed conflict with the US military to be viable. In this section, we’ll look at these flawed assumptions and how they’ve played out in multiple corners of the world.

#### Capitalist Democracy

McMaster explains that after the Cold War, the US was gripped by a euphoric sense of hope that the ideological battles of the 20th century were over. **Americans’ overriding assumption was that democratic governments and capitalist economies would flourish in the post-Soviet world,** without any great effort or support from the US itself. This attitude has led to policies of appeasement toward dictatorial regimes, such as those toward China and Iran, in the hope that they will eventually “soften,” as well as the removal of US support from nations in transition, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where democracy had the potential to flourish if protected from disruption by extremists.

> **The Post-Soviet Hope for Democracy**
> 
> If anything, McMaster understates the wave of optimism felt in the US as the Cold War came to an end. A 1989 Gallup poll conducted after the Berlin Wall fell showed that even before the Soviet Union’s collapse, over three-quarters of Americans believed that personal freedom and economic prosperity would shortly blossom throughout eastern Europe. The rapid dissolution of the Soviet Empire sent a surge of hope through the American government, which had always assumed that the USSR was a permanent fixture in the world’s political landscape.
> 
> However, there were some who warned against premature celebration. In _Out of Control_ , former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski argued that the transition of post-Communist countries to capitalism would not only be chaotic, but would also give rise to a fertile breeding ground for corruption, ethnic tensions, and fascism. In hindsight, what flourished in the post-Soviet ’90s weren’t democratic governments, but regimes that maintained the pretense of democracy as a means to solidify authoritarian rule.

Appeasement has often been the hallmark of American relations toward China’s regime, under the assumption that close-knit economic trade would cause the ruling Chinese Communist Party to relax its political stranglehold on Chinese culture. US President Richard Nixon famously courted the Chinese government in an effort to ally them against the Soviet Union, and President Jimmy Carter did much the same in the hopes that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s economic and social reforms would eventually Westernize Chinese society. McMaster writes that this was all wishful thinking, as evidenced by the Chinese government’s continued repression of political speech and persecution of minority groups within China’s borders.

(Shortform note: The Chinese reforms that McMaster alludes to were initiated in 1978 to move China away from a Soviet-style “planned economy” to a more Western model, opening the door to foreign investment and technological innovation. Over the next 40 years, China’s economy boomed, as evidenced by a 2,500% increase in Chinese income per capita. However, because economic reform was not coupled with political reform, a system of collusion arose between privileged Chinese businessmen and the government officials charged with managing the country’s resources. Because of the profitability of this system, there’s no incentive to relax authoritarian restrictions when the elite maintain their wealth via maintaining political control.)

American disengagement (a desire to avoid another long-term entanglement such as in Vietnam) has shown itself most vividly in the US’s ongoing interactions in the Middle East. In 2010, the series of uprisings collectively known as the Arab Spring rekindled hope in the West that with the overthrow of dictatorships, representative democracy would flourish in the region. McMaster claims that this was a chance for the US to support (not control) fledgling governments as they replaced authoritarian regimes. However, the US kept its distance, assuming that interference might preclude the “natural evolution” toward democratic ideals. Instead, the US’s absence allowed authoritarian Islamic groups to grab power.

> **Obama and the Arab Spring**
> 
> In his memoir _A Promised Land_ , former President Barack Obama provides a different perspective on the Arab Spring movement as it related to US foreign policy. While he personally empathized with the protestors’ desire to topple their corrupt and oppressive regimes, White House analysts were concerned that in countries such as Egypt, the necessary preconditions for a democratic government weren’t in place.
> 
> Because Obama had already inherited two ongoing wars from the Bush administration (those in Iraq and Afghanistan), he was hesitant to commit any further US forces to an already chaotic situation. The US’s limited intervention in Libya was carried out under the auspices of a UN coalition, but rather than being accused of doing too little (as McMaster suggests), Obama’s critics claimed that he’d employed _too much_ military force in the region.

#### Military Strength

The US’s self-serving assumption that America’s political and economic values are universal leads to another erroneous conclusion—that any threat to democracy can be stamped out by the simple application of overwhelming military force. McMaster criticizes the reductionist nature of this fantasy that incurs long-term consequences in pursuit of short-term goals.

Ever since Vietnam, the US has been averse to any protracted military engagement and has instead focused on achieving short-term victories without any corresponding long-term commitment. McMaster says this is an exercise in denial—**military action must always be tied to political policy goals to be effective.** The consequences of ignoring this fact can be seen in the US’s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. In both cases, the US achieved purely military victories—the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the routing of Al-Qaeda—without ample consideration of the political realities those countries would face in the aftermath of war.

(Shortform note: The disassociation that McMaster describes between US diplomacy and its military efforts can be seen in the 30-year decline of the US State Department, which underwent budget cuts in the 1990s and again during the Obama and Trump administrations. The result has been a lack of trained diplomats capable of advancing American interests through peaceful channels. The then-anonymous author of _A Warning_ , Miles Taylor, called out the chaotic state of US diplomacy under Trump even as McMaster was trying to bring it into focus. The Biden administration set rebuilding the State Department as one of its priorities, but while there has been progress, it still faces staffing shortages and budget difficulties.)

In its attempts to keep military goals focused and narrow, McMaster argues that the US creates the very long-term entanglements it wants to avoid. For instance, the Iraqi and Afghan people were imagined to be helpless groups just waiting for the US to save them. American leaders gave no thought to either region’s tribal and ethnic divisions, nor the political power of extreme Islamist groups that would complicate attempts to build representative governments. None of those issues were caused by the US, but America’s lack of political follow-through let chaos flourish when there could have been peace.

(Shortform note: In _Orientalism_ , Edward Said decries the tendency of Western thinkers to view Middle Eastern peoples as a homogenous group. His analysis backs up McMaster’s assertion that US and European policymakers see the Middle East through a self-serving lens that paints the West as more intellectually advanced. Historically, this view has been used to justify the West’s colonial domination of the region. In modern times, the orientalist view expresses itself when politicians and journalists reduce and oversimplify the region’s complex political realities in order to apply the blanket label of “terrorists” to entire socio-ethnic populations.)

### The Other Point of View

America’s self-centered worldview isn’t limited to its most recent military conflicts—it has defined the US foreign policy ever since the nation took on the “superpower” mantle. McMaster suggests that the solution is for the US to learn to see through the eyes of its allies and adversaries, to recognize them as independent agents with their own historical and emotional motivations, and to understand how those motivations drive their actions. In this section, we’ll examine five points of conflict between the US and other parts of the world through the lens of history, political motivations, and the different forms that conflict takes. The specific “hot spots” McMaster identifies are Russia, China, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and North Korea.

#### Russia

After the Cold War, the US expected that the new Russia would become one of its allies in the democratic world. However, under Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leadership fights to return to the glory days of the Soviet Union, with its new authoritarian regime fueled by wealthy oligarchs instead of Communists. McMaster explains Putin’s emotional motivations and the methods by which Russia is reasserting itself as a world power.

**Behind the shows of strength from Russia’s leadership lies a deep, lingering sense of humiliation from the collapse of the former Soviet Union.** In the aftermath, Russia’s attempt to develop a free market economy didn’t go as planned, and instead resulted in a kleptocracy where corrupt politicians and businessmen lined their pockets at the country’s expense. Putin and many of his cohort view the Soviet Union’s fall as a disaster, aid from the US as an insult, and the changes that were made to bring Russia’s economy in line with other capitalist nations as the reasons for the economy’s collapse.

(Shortform note: Russia’s path to democracy and capitalism was undermined from the start by the last vestiges of the Soviet regime. In the Cold War, the KGB had learned to funnel money through back-alley channels to its agents in the West, and when the USSR came apart, they used those same tactics to empty vast sums from the Soviet treasury into private bank accounts abroad. These funds fueled a growing class of wealthy Russian oligarchs—businessmen with strong political ties—and has led many to characterize modern Russia as a _kleptocracy_ in which political decisions primarily serve to enrich the powerful at the expense of the state.)

Driven by these factors, Putin’s goal is nothing less than to return Russia to the height of Soviet power. However, Russia can’t compete economically with either the US or China, so instead of building Russia up, Putin’s strategy is to tear other countries down. For example, Russia has become adept in the field of cyberwarfare, which it’s used to interfere with elections in the US, Britain, and other democratic countries. McMaster says the goal of these attacks isn’t to favor one particular outcome, but to undermine trust in the democratic process itself through an onslaught of misinformation. However, Russia’s aggression and bluster toward the West is a mask to hide significant economic weaknesses at home.

(Shortform note: Russia isn’t the sole source of online disinformation campaigns. Many countries make use of state-sponsored “troll farms” to inundate social media with divisive and inflammatory content. In the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential election, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center claimed that Russia, China, and Iran were all using online tactics to undermine the election. In 2022, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin openly admitted to interfering with US elections and stated that he would continue to do so.)

> **The War Against Ukraine**
> 
> In the updated 2021 edition of _Battlegrounds_ , McMaster mentions Russia’s armed buildup near Ukraine, which he describes as a show of force aimed at intimidating the West. However, in February 2022, that buildup turned into a full-scale military invasion, resulting in the largest armed confrontation in Europe since the end of World War II. Putin claims the invasion was necessary to protect Ukraine’s ethnic-Russian minority, as well as to prevent the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization).
> 
> After Russian forces failed to achieve a fast, overwhelming victory akin to the US’s invasion of Iraq, Putin was faced with a protracted conflict that has cost in excess of $80 billion, done $600 billion in damage to Ukraine’s economy, and caused the deaths of over 200,000 soldiers on both sides, as well as over 7,000 civilians. As of early 2023, the outcome of the war is still very much in doubt.

#### China

Whereas Russia hearkens back to the relatively recent age of Soviet supremacy, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are driven to return their nation to the era when China was the center of the world. CCP Chairman Xi Jinping is leading a primarily economic effort to shift global power back into China’s hands while promoting its authoritarian government model as an alternative to what Chinese leaders perceive as democracy’s weaknesses. McMaster describes China’s vision for the world and the three-pronged form of economic warfare it’s conducting to make that vision a reality.

While Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution did much to erase Chinese history, the CCP’s current leadership has gone to great lengths to embrace it—in particular, China’s imperial history in which neighboring countries were treated as subservient. In this interpretation, the period of domination by Europe and America is viewed as a historical hiccup that it’s China’s duty to correct. This message of natural Chinese superiority isn’t just directed at the outside world, but is sold to the Chinese people as well, reinforced by China’s booming economy and held in place by social surveillance, lack of free speech, and repressive crackdowns on minority groups.

(Shortform note: Historically, China has had many imperial “golden ages” stretching back to at least 1600 BCE. It was during the four centuries of Han dynasty rule that much of Chinese ideology was developed and trade was established along the Silk Road to the West. Chinese self-rule was disrupted by the Mongols from 1271-1368. The last ruling dynasty, the Qing, weren’t ethnic Chinese at all, but rather members of the minority Manchu people. The Qing dynasty was severely weakened by the British during the Opium Wars, which left them vulnerable to overthrow by revolutionaries seeking a more modern form of government.)

##### China’s Economic Warfare

In order to transform China into the world’s economic axis, McMaster asserts that **the CCP uses a combination of infrastructure spending, predatory lending, and industrial espionage** to reach its goals. The Chinese government implements the first two of these strategies with the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. OBOR funnels vast amounts of money into foreign infrastructure development, including improvements to ports and transportation by which imports and exports flow to and from China. These infrastructure projects come with many strings attached, such as high interest rates, political concessions, and bribes paid to high-ranking officials. McMaster argues that One Belt One Road becomes a form of economic colonialism that China then uses to elbow the US and its allies out of world markets.

(Shortform note: In order to compete with One Belt One Road, the US Congress passed the BUILD Act in 2018 and created the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). Under the BUILD Act’s mandate, the DFC facilitates private sector investment and technical assistance in developing countries around the world. In 2022, the DFC dedicated over $7 billion to projects such as renewable energy development in Asia, farming in Africa, and protecting businesses and infrastructure in eastern Europe that were impacted by the war in Ukraine.)

Another arm of China’s economic warfare is the Military-Civil Fusion project that enlists Chinese companies and citizens into the intelligence-gathering process. Through Military-Civil Fusion, the CCP appropriates foreign technology and intellectual property, which it uses to undercut foreign competitors and bolster China’s military capabilities. This process feeds into the Made in China 2025 program to establish tech monopolies inside the Chinese market.

(Shortform note: McMaster’s warnings on the topic of IP theft aren’t new. Every US president since Ronald Reagan has attempted to halt China’s technological espionage, to no avail. Now, more private corporations have become well aware of China’s aggressive pursuit of intellectual property. In 2019, 20% of US companies claimed their data was stolen by Chinese competitors. A cybercrime report in 2022 exposed a vast campaign of intellectual property theft by a state-sponsored group of Chinese nationals collectively known as APT 41.)

McMaster points out that China’s economy is now so large that outside companies, even those in the US, are financially coerced to not criticize the Chinese government—even in their home countries—in order to do business there.

(Shortform note: The American film industry serves as a case study for the CCP using its economic power to extend its censorship to the US. As China’s standard of living increased, its enormous film market became an essential source of income for many movie studios. In _Red Carpet_ , Erich Schwartzel claims that because of their dependence on Chinese audiences, American studios deliberately avoid producing films on issues that would displease the CCP, such as protests in Hong Kong or China’s treatment of religious minorities. However, beginning in 2022, US filmmakers began to push back against Chinese restrictions, producing high-profile films such as _Top Gun: Maverick_ that weren’t expected to get past Chinese censors.)

#### Afghanistan

Unlike Russia and China, which are pushing for dominance on the world stage, the people of war-torn Afghanistan face a daily struggle for survival. Nevertheless, Afghanistan poses a threat to world peace as a refuge and training ground for multinational terrorist organizations. McMaster describes Afghanistan as a tragic missed opportunity where the US had a chance to foster peace and failed due to inconsistent policies and its flawed understanding of the history and character of the Afghan people.

The Afghan nation has been traumatized by decades of war and internal strife. The struggle to end the Soviet occupation attracted legions of radicalized Islamist fighters to the cause from throughout the Middle East and southern Asia. However, after the Soviets withdrew, scores of criminal warlords took their place. The Taliban, a violent terrorist group, consolidated power by promising peace—which it established through brutal subjugation. The Taliban and other groups, such as Al-Qaeda, developed a closely linked, mutually supporting terrorist ecosystem through their shared, radical Islamist ideology and their ability to recruit young people to their cause of uniting the Muslim world under a fundamentalist theocracy.

(Shortform note: The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 when it feared that Afghanistan’s political instability would undermine its fledgling Communist ruling party. The Soviets’ 10-year occupation prompted the formation of mujahideen resistance groups which garnered support from many foreign nations, including the United States. When the Taliban came to power in 1994, it was composed of mujahideen rebels who believed that the leaders of the anti-Soviet resistance had betrayed their extremist interpretation of Islam. Critics of American foreign policy sometimes blame the US for the Taliban’s creation, but those in alignment with McMaster’s views argue that the US couldn’t have imposed its values any more than the Soviets could.)

McMaster says that the US’s mistake following its campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001 was not following through on the political front to help establish new, stable leadership. Instead, its support for the fledgling Afghan government was inconsistent due to assumptions that military triumph was enough and that Western-style democracy would naturally emerge as long as the terrorists were beaten. This belied the fact that the Afghan people aren’t one group but many, and building a stable multiethnic coalition requires a long-term commitment. Many people in Afghanistan worked hard for such a thing, but the US’s limited and uncertain presence gave the Taliban and its partner organizations the time and space they needed to regroup.

(Shortform note: In _Why Nations Fail_ , Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson state that open political institutions that represent all groups within a population are a prerequisite for national stability. Governments dominated by one ethnic or sectarian group become unsustainable when they empower a select minority over the larger population. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that struggling nations can turn around and become open societies if their internal factions make use of compromise instead of violence and if those compromises are fairly enforced. McMaster suggests that it’s precisely in this area—preventing violence and enforcing compromise—that the US had an opportunity to foster democracy and growth in Afghanistan.)

#### The Middle East

Similar problems exist in the Arab world, where the clash between secular and Islamist rule has made the region a hotbed of instability. While the Middle East’s sectarian violence is rooted in divisions that are centuries old, it is fueled today by agitating factors (such as radical Islamist groups and the Iranian government) with vested interests in maintaining the chaos. McMaster explains the Middle East’s tangled history, the motivations of Iran in particular to disrupt its Arab neighbors, and the US’s bungled approach to diplomacy and military action in the region.

> **The Crossroad of the World**
> 
> Though McMaster keeps his focus on the last hundred years, the Middle East has served as a global trade route for most of recorded history. In _The Silk Roads_ , Peter Frankopan explains the geopolitical importance of the region going back to the Persian Empire, the most advanced nation of its age. Throughout the Roman era and the Middle Ages, the Middle East was a vital corridor for the flow of goods and ideas between Europe, India, and China, enriching the Persian Empire on its eastern border and the Byzantine Empire to the west.
> 
> In between these two states, the tribes of Arabia proved fertile ground for the birth of Islam in the 7th century CE. The new religion united the Arabs into a force that conquered Persia, North Africa, and Iberia (present-day Portugal and Spain). The success of the Muslim conquest and the wealth that it brought gave birth to the idea of an Islamic caliphate. One such kingdom, centered in Baghdad, economically united parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe and preserved much ancient knowledge that was lost in the Post-Roman West.

Over the last century, Middle Eastern nations have witnessed the fall of every system of government, from colonialism to monarchies, dictatorships, and theocracies. McMaster says the Islamist movement developed as a response to corrupt secular institutions and dictators. However, the theocratic movement to power reignited ancient bitterness between Sunni and Shia practitioners of Islam. In countries such as Egypt and Iraq, dictators kept a lid on Sunni-Shia conflict while perpetrating abuses of their own. In non-Arab Iran, the Shah’s repression of religion led to the rise of a Shiite Islamist countermovement, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, which toppled the former government and set up the preeminent theocratic state.

> **The Rise of Islam in the Middle East**
> 
> Many people in the US and Europe equate the Middle East with Islam, but historically this wasn’t always the case. Though Muslim rulers achieved political dominance of the region in the 7th century CE, Islam did not become the majority religion until between the 12th and 14th centuries. In _Christian Martyrs Under Islam_ , Christian C. Sahner presents evidence that the transition was more gradual and peaceful than earlier historians believed.
> 
> McMaster’s focus on the past 100 years reflects the fact that Islam didn’t become politicized until the 20th century, as Middle Eastern countries shook off colonial European rule and their people became disenchanted with attempts to westernize their societies. The turning point for the Islamist movement was the Arab world’s shocking military defeat by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967. The war shook public confidence in the secular governments of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, and paved the way for the growth of Islamism as a rival political ideology.

##### The Modern Middle East

Today, the Middle East is still reeling from the effects of the war between Iran and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, a war that cost half a million lives and rekindled Sunni/Shia and ethnic divisions. McMaster argues that Iran’s conservative leaders harbor deep hatred for the whole Arab world and seek to sow discord throughout the Middle East. They do this by providing funding and support for terrorist groups, both Shia and Sunni. Iran’s leaders also make use of the false narrative that the Shah was a US puppet to direct the Iranian people’s attention outward and solidify the government’s grip on power internally.

(Shortform note: The Modern War Institute at the West Point Military Academy presents a different take on the Iranian government’s motivations. It contends that Iran sees itself as engaged in a primarily defensive war against the US, Israel, and other neighboring states. Iran’s leaders know that direct military engagement would be disastrous, so instead they sponsor cyberattacks and other forms of asymmetric warfare. Their end goal, according to some analysts, is to diminish American and Israeli power without crossing the threshold into conventional war.)

Meanwhile, the removal of secular dictatorships, such as in Iraq by the US invasion and in other countries during the Arab Spring movement, had the unintended side effect of uncorking the bottle of sectarian conflict. McMaster affirms that there are many Arab leaders working to end the cycle of violence, but that they face resistance on every side from radical groups motivated by revenge and fanaticism. In the Middle East, the US has squandered many chances to build coalitions and protect democratic governance, while instead focusing on military objectives as a way to limit its exposure in the region. By trying not to get involved in “another Vietnam,” the US eschewed long-term political commitments that may have been more beneficial in the long run.

McMaster insists that **the US’s interventions in the Middle East should have been part of a long-term plan to coordinate military, diplomatic, and humanitarian missions.** The US and its allies could have enabled economic development and encouraged new governments to include the voices of ethnic and religious minorities. Instead, after the realization that military action alone achieved little, the US resigned itself to withdraw forces from the region, believing that doing so would help bring an end to conflict. This view is also self-centered in that it assumes the US is the reason behind the region’s problems in the first place.

> **Paths Forward in the Middle East**
> 
> The Brookings Institution presents a starkly different analysis than McMaster’s of the US’s Middle Eastern prospects. They suggest that the dual economic shocks of Covid-19 and falling oil prices will further destabilize the region while rendering any US economic sanctions moot against nations such as Iran. Brookings argues that the US should diminish the scope of its military presence while increasing its diplomatic efforts to resolve regional conflicts.
> 
> The nonpartisan Middle East Institute suggests its own policy recommendations for the US in regard to the region’s crisis points. In particular, finding a way to pivot the US’s relationship with Iran is crucial. They point out that Iran’s leadership may soon go through a period of transition during which the US will have an opportunity to encourage reforms that will favor the Iranian people. In Iraq, the US should invest in education, assist the fight against corruption, and help strengthen the country's economy.

#### North Korea

Despite the chaotic tension of the Middle East, the true wild card among the US’s potential adversaries is North Korea. McMaster paints the North Korean government as the most oppressive regime in the world and possibly the most dangerous due to its leader Kim Jong-un’s desire to acquire nuclear weapons. McMaster explains how a history of conflicting diplomatic strategies has led to the current untenable situation, and how defusing the situation with North Korea will require coordination of the US’s allies in the region.

Korea’s modern woes go back to the end of World War II, when the north and south were occupied by the Soviet Union and the US, respectively. After the stalemate of the Korean War, South Korea’s economy boomed while the North languished under three generations of dictators. With the North Korean people living in abject poverty, the US and South Korea held out hope for decades that the northern regime would eventually collapse. It has not, and has only become more aggressive under Kim Jong-un, who has continually advanced his nuclear ambitions. The US has inconsistently used economic sanctions to apply pressure on the Kim regime, while South Korea has sought reconciliation by proffering economic aid to the North.

(Shortform note: Publicly, North Korea has long gone back and forth on its intentions to develop nuclear weapons, which began as early as the 1950s. However, in1985, North Korea signed the UN’s nonproliferation treaty, and in 1991, the US withdrew most of its own nuclear weapons from the region. President Bill Clinton’s conciliatory deal to halt North Korea’s arms program didn’t take the form of an actual treaty and was later criticized by President George W. Bush, who cut off the supply of oil to the country. This also proved ineffective, and North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October, 2006.)

McMaster says that neither hard nor soft economic strategies have worked. Kim Jong-un resents South Korea because of its economic strength, but he doesn’t dare open North Korea to the world lest he undermine his family’s grip on power. What’s needed to halt North Korea’s aggression is a coordinated effort toward economic and technological isolation of the country by the US, South Korea, Japan, and even China. Such an alliance will be difficult to achieve because of the region’s historic animosities—between Japan and South Korea, and between different generations within South Korea toward the US itself. Most important of all is making China understand that a nuclear North Korea would be a danger to them as well.

(Shortform note: For decades, North Korea has defied expectations about the sustainability of its dictatorial government. Some of its modern resilience is due to the North Korean government's efforts since 2018 to bolster its economy that, while not growing, maintains an internal status quo. Though McMaster touts sanctions as an effective tool against the Kim regime, they haven’t been successful at halting North Korea’s weapons development. In the shadow of North Korea’s nuclear threats, South Korea has declared its willingness to target its military capabilities at Kim Jong-un personally as a deterrent against North Korean aggression.)

### Necessary Pivots

As McMaster shows, there are plenty of global challenges facing the United States, and while none can be ignored, they can be met so long as the American people and their leaders set aside their simplistic, self-centered worldview and embrace long-term goals instead of short-term objectives. McMaster sets out strategies the US should adopt in order to help defend the free world and remain competitive as a leading world power. These include remaining vigilant against open aggression, using truthful information to counter the propaganda of oppressive regimes, turning American diversity into a strength, and reaffirming education as a fundamental bulwark of democracy.

#### Answer Aggression With Vigilance and Truth

First, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are authoritarian forces in the world that view democratic nations as a threat to their power. McMaster insists that the US must stand firm against these forces, whether they be governments or terrorist organizations. America and its allies must be prepared for conflict while improving their defense against cyberattacks and making use of information media to counter the narratives spread by oppressive regimes.

McMaster recommends that the US and NATO increase their military preparedness, specifically as a defense against Russian aggression. Diplomatic ties across the world should be bolstered against China’s divide-and-conquer economics. In the Middle East, the long-term goal should be ending the sectarian conflicts while partnering with law enforcement and allied intelligence networks to cut off funding and support for terror groups. Meanwhile, **America must engage with the community of nations to let aggressor states know that violent action is not a viable path to their goals.**

> To implement McMaster’s diplomatic strategies, the first step for the US is to reestablish its standing with its allies. Early in his presidency, Biden set repairing alliances as a top foreign policy priority. A Gallup poll confirms that global views of US leadership rebounded soon after Biden took office, even as Biden’s approval ratings within the US faltered.

> The war in Ukraine has served as a litmus test for Americans’ willingness to engage in global conflict. By the start of 2023, the US had provided $25 billion in military aid to Ukraine, $15 billion in financial support, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance. Polls in 2022 showed a shift from a belief among Americans that the US wasn’t providing enough support toward a general feeling that the country was taking the appropriate steps in the conflict. A majority of Americans have been following the conflict and remain in favor of providing assistance.

Beyond these traditional avenues of diplomatic and military intervention, the US must go on the offensive and regain ground in the world of cyberspace. This includes intercepting cyberattacks before they happen and countering attempts to subvert elections through social media. McMaster also points out that America must maintain control of its information infrastructure. In this, the private sector is just as important, if not more so, than the government. US companies and academic institutions must recognize the national security risks involved with breaches of their information security and be prepared to defend themselves accordingly.

(Shortform note: According to the International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cybersecurity Index, the US leads the world in terms of cyber threat prevention, laws to protect data, and readiness to defend against attacks in cyberspace. Nevertheless, perpetrators of cybercrime are growing more sophisticated, and while some forms of online attacks are in decline, the total harm done by internet criminals may soon grow beyond $10 trillion per year.)

However, while technological secrets must be protected,**** it’s been shown that **despotic regimes are vulnerable when their people have access to information outside of government channels.** Radical groups such as the Taliban also rely on an uneducated populace susceptible to propaganda. McMaster says the US should establish information paths into oppressed societies, both through online media and by befriending communities of expats. The latter can be accomplished through community outreach programs and by welcoming foreign students into academia. When America creates a positive impression on those who’ve fled from dictatorial rule, that impression often trickles back and undermines their leaders’ claims to power.

(Shortform note: The Internet would seem to be the easiest way to provide outside news to countries with no free press. However, the freedom of the Internet has been declining worldwide for years, with many governments finding ways to restrict access and block content. China uses its control of the Internet to spread propaganda and crack down on anti-Communist thought. There are ways to get around authoritarian controls, such as virtual private networks and anonymous browsers, though people take a risk when they access information their governments deem to be illegal.)

#### Harness the Power of Pluralism and Education

Autocratic governments often portray cultural, ethnic, and ideological diversity as a weakness of democratic societies.__ While America’s collage of differing ideas, cultures, and institutions can make it slow to react as a unified whole, McMaster argues that it also represents the country’s greatest potential.__ To make use of that potential may require removing the bureaucratic barriers to cooperation between government, academia, and industry, while renewing the country’s focus on education as a means to empower all levels of society.

Authoritarian nations such as China are able to mobilize government, military, and industrial strategies as one, because under such a system the boundaries between them are blurred. However, such systems also shackle the creative freedom that fuels innovation. The US would be ill-served to give up its creative edge, but McMaster suggests that **America could better utilize its strengths if there were easier ways to share ideas between the public and private sectors.** At present, there is a wall of red tape between government agencies, tech corporations, military branches, and academic research. If the US wants to stay on the leading edge of technological development, then it may be past time for that wall to come down.

(Shortform note: One area in which the US is technologically competing with China is in the development of microchips and the semiconductors on which they are based. Taiwan has led the world in semiconductor production for years, but its tensions with China create a vulnerability in the world’s supply chain for computer circuitry. The Biden administration has enacted measures to restrict the export of microchip technology to China and funnel billions of dollars into semiconductor research. However, there are concerns that the US’s high labor costs will keep it from being competitive unless American companies develop ways to cost-effectively automate microchip production.)

In addition to its intellectual diversity, America’s cultural diversity can be used to set an example to others that internal divisions of race, creed, and culture don’t necessarily lead to violence and oppression. McMaster says that America’s diplomatic missions abroad, especially in places like the Middle East, should promote recognition of equal rights for all groups, not just the ruling ethnic or religious majority. To drive the point home, the US should welcome more immigrants from abroad, especially those who’ve faced oppression in their home countries.

(Shortform note: In order to serve as a model for cultural tolerance, the US may have a lot of work to do at home to overcome its own history of racial violence. By various metrics and rankings, such as the Social Progress Index and the World Values Survey, the Netherlands, Canada, and the Nordic countries consistently score higher than the US in terms of racial and cultural equality. In _Caste_ , journalist Isabel Wilkerson says the US’s internal divisions break down even further along lines of religion, wealth, and labor, and have contributed greatly to the US’s current political polarization.)

However, for such a strategy to work, the American people have to be on board. To achieve this, McMaster insists that education should once again be made a national priority. In addition to the sciences and humanities, though, **emphasis must be given again to teaching civics in school and universities.** American people, young and old, need to relearn that democracy works, how to engage in civil discussion, and why the US needs to stay engaged with allies and competitors elsewhere in the world. Students shouldn't be taught a sugar-coated version of American history, but they should be made aware of its virtues so that they can understand American democracy as a continuing experiment on the world stage of which they are all a part.

(Shortform note: McMaster’s views on US civics education are backed up by research. A 2016 study revealed that less than a fifth of US states require high school social studies courses, and as a result, less than a quarter of US adults can even name the three branches of government. However, more voices are calling out for an increased emphasis on civics education and public involvement as essential to maintaining American democracy—in the wake of the January 6, 2021 attack on the US capitol, 34 state legislatures introduced bills to bolster civics teaching at all levels of public education, many of which passed with strong bipartisan support.)
