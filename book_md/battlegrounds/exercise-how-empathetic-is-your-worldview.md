## Exercise: How Empathetic Is Your Worldview?

McMaster contends that US foreign policy is distorted by its policymakers’ America-centric outlook, which includes a failure to view the world through the eyes of those who lead and live in other countries. As individuals, many people may fall into the same trap of not seeing the world from outside their cultural lens. Consider the attitudes you may have about people who don’t share your cultural and political outlook, whether they live in other countries or your own.

Think of a country whose policies are generally considered to be hostile to yours. What do you know about that country's government? What are its leaders’ fundamental motivations?

Think of a political group in your country whose ideas you oppose. Why do you believe its members hold the views that they do? What are some points of agreement between your views and theirs, and where do they diverge?

Consider where your information comes from about other countries or opposing political groups in your own. Do your sources of news and information generally confirm your established beliefs, or do they also represent the views of others? What other information sources might you access to provide you with a different perspective?
