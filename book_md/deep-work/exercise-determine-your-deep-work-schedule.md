## Exercise: Determine Your Deep Work Schedule

Deep work doesn’t just _happen_ —you need to make time for it in your schedule.

* * *

Think about your goals. To achieve them, how much of your day should be dedicated to deep work tasks? (For example, you may only be spending one hour per day in deep work, but _should_ be spending at least two hours.)

Which of Newport’s four proposed schedules—seclusion, periodic, daily, or ad hoc—do you think is both feasible _and_ aligned with your goals? (For example, if you work a 9-5 job in an office, you likely won’t be able to adopt a seclusion schedule.)

What steps can you take to lessen the time you spend on shallow tasks and make your dedicated deep work time more effective? (For example, if you’re a writer, you might tighten your deadlines by 15% and turn off your Internet every night from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. If you’re an office worker, you might have a conversation with your boss about your shallow work budget and commit to working without Internet for two hours each day after lunch.)
