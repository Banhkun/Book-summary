## Exercise: Reflect on Your Distractions

Try to align where you spend your time with your life’s most important goals.

* * *

What is one of your most important goals? It can be professional or personal. (Choose just one. You can redo this exercise for other goals.)

What are the most important activities you can do to progress toward this goal? List no more than three.

List the major ways you spend your time that are _supposedly_ in pursuit of this goal. These might include the Internet (websites, apps, tools) or activities offline. For each, answer: Does using this contribute meaningfully to my most important goal above?

If you think it’s a good idea, how can you shift time from the distractions to the most important activities?
