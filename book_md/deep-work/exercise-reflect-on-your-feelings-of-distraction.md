## Exercise: Reflect on Your Feelings of Distraction

A helpful practice in training your brain to focus is paying attention to what internal triggers are driving you to distraction.

* * *

What are the feelings that usually precede a distracted behavior? (For example, you experience feelings of anxiety, boredom, or anger.)

Describe a situation where you often find that you’re most easily driven to distraction—pay attention to both the activity and details such as time of day or who’s usually with you. (For example, you might feel most distracted in your home office right after lunch or when you’re trying to study in the library.)

Which of Newport’s suggestions could help you act in a more productive way in response to these feelings? (For example, you might practice allowing boredom so that it doesn’t trigger you to pull out your phone, or make a habit of taking a walk after lunch to think over your work.)
