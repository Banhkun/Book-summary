## Shortform Introduction

“Deep work”—totally focused, undistracted work—is the way to thrive in today’s information economy, explains professor Cal Newport in _Deep Work_. His method of blocking off chunks of time to focus intensely on a single task strengthens your ability to learn difficult things quickly and optimize your output—both of which are key skills for knowledge workers, or those who work with information. He explains why deep work is so valuable and then helps you design your life to allow more time for deep work.

### About the Author

Cal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. He’s published eight books. His first three books focus on advice for students: _How to Win at College_ , _How to Become a Straight-A Student_ , and _How to Be a High School Superstar_. In 2007, in tandem with his work on these books, he started his popular blog, _Study Hacks_. The blog aims to help students do focused, meaningful schoolwork while managing the ever-growing presence of distracting technology.

Newport then pivoted toward writing about business and has published four books on the subject: _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , _Deep Work,Digital Minimalism, _and _A World Without Email_. He’s also published _The Time-Block Planner_ , a companion to his books that helps readers apply his principles and mindfully plan their days.

Newport regularly writes about deep work, digital use, and distraction for publications including _The New Yorker _and _The New York Times_.****

Newport lives by his digital minimalism principles—he doesn’t appear on any social media, save for a single tweet that reiterates his dedication to deep work:

### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher:** Grand Central Publishing, Hachette Book Group

Published in 2016, _Deep Work_ is Newport’s fifth book. It’s since earned a spot as a _Wall Street Journal_ Business Bestseller.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

_Deep Work_ came out at a time when many other authors were writing on similar subjects—how to stand out, how to get focused, how to live in the present, how to get a handle on technology’s place in our lives—and people were seeking out such books for answers.

In the book’s publication year, 2016, New York Times bestseller lists (general and business) included books touching on related topics, such as _The Revenge of Analog, The Power of Habit, Originals,_ and _Outliers._ Business Insider’s bestsellers list included titles such as _Tools of Titans_ and _Smarter Faster Better_.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

**Reviews for _Deep Work_ are fairly evenly split between positive and negative. **

Positive reviewers, many of whom credit Newport’s ideas with helping them work through procrastination or focus issues, agree that his ideas are invaluable to learning how to climb to the top in our current information economy. They note that the book feels like much more than a collection of tired productivity hacks—rather, it reads as a guide to overhauling foundational aspects of your life, such as your schedule, to create far-reaching changes.

On the other hand, negative reviewers commonly bring up several points of criticism. First, they note that Newport seems unaware of the unique privileges that allow him to do deep work, such as the flexibility of his academic job and a deep work activity that’s relatively accessible—all you need is a laptop. Thus, while Newport may do a good job laying out the importance of deep work and describing ideal conditions for it, critics say he falls short of giving actionable advice for typical knowledge workers, who have less control over their work and schedules than a professor has.

Finally, many reviewers point out apparent sexism in Newport’s examples—almost all of his examples of people excelling in deep work are men, and he seems to reserve female-centered examples for explanations of what _not_ to do. (Note: Because we don’t use Newport’s examples, we don’t directly address this criticism in this guide. However, it comes up frequently enough in reviews of the book that it bears mention.)

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Numerous reviewers compare Newport’s writing to that of Malcolm Gladwell, author of popular psychology books like _Outliers_ and _Blink_. Like Gladwell, he brings the concepts he discusses to life with interesting case studies and entertaining anecdotes. This accessible style helps readers connect with tricky ideas around the value of focus, and it illustrates the powerful effect that undistracted work can have on a career—especially in a world where many consider multitasking a superpower.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

In the first part of his book, Newport explains the philosophy of deep work and why it’s an invaluable skill for knowledge workers. In the second part, he explains different “rules” that help readers optimize their days and carve out more time for deep work.

  * Numerous critical reviews note that the three first chapters are interesting but become somewhat repetitive. They also note that in later chapters, Newport’s “rules” tend to drag on or lack substance.



### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve extended Newport’s ideas to fill the gaps that reviewers’ two main criticisms highlight—that the book’s ideas don’t apply to the majority of knowledge workers and that the ideas aren’t actionable enough.

We draw heavily from _Indistractable_ by Nir Eyal to address both of these critiques. We chose this book as a complement to Newport’s work for several reasons.

  1. Eyal’s book, like _Deep Work_ , centers on methods to become more focused in a distracted world. 
  2. While Newport focuses his argument on _shutting out_ distractions and non-essentials, Eyal focuses his argument on _working alongside_ distractions and non-essentials—a more useful approach to the majority of knowledge workers who can’t ignore their email or physically step back from distracting environments.



Finally, we’ve condensed and reorganized the second part of the book to eliminate repetition and create a more logical flow through the process of setting up and engaging in deep work.
