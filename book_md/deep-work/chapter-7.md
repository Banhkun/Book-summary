## Chapter 7: Make the Most of Your Focused Time

Once you have the schedule and the environment, you must actually _do_ deep work. Newport offers several suggestions to make the most of your focused time and environment.

### The 4 Disciplines of Execution

Newport outlines four principles of deep work that come from the book _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_. During deep work sessions, use these principles to optimize your time and focus on the right things.

#### Principle 1: Focus On What’s Important

When choosing what to work on, figure out what things have the largest impact. Then, instead of trying to say no to trivial distractions, **simply say yes to the most important task or goal.** This process helps crowd out shallow tasks that don’t support your goals.

Newport recommends choosing only a small number of such goals so that you only have to focus on keeping trivial tasks out rather than maintaining a large list of things to accomplish.

(Shortform note: In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins outlines steps to creating “big, hairy, audacious goals,” or BHAGs—he urges you to create goals that are clear, push you outside your comfort zone, and are aligned closely with your core values.)

#### Principle 2: Use the Right Metrics

Metrics are useful to figure out how well you’re doing and how you can improve. The most useful metrics in deep work are _leading_ metrics, or metrics you can use in real-time to tweak what your result will be. (In contrast, _lagging metrics_ measure the long-term thing you’re ultimately trying to improve—in other words, the result. These metrics give you feedback at the end, instead of real-time feedback that helps you change your behavior.)

  * For example, Newport suggests leading metrics like the number of hours you’ve spent in deep work, the number of pages you’ve written, the number of new ideas you’ve generated, and so on. These are all examples of real-time feedback that help you see how effective you are at deep work. (A lagging metric would be how many papers you’ve published at the end of 2021—at that point, you can’t go back and change your behavior in order to publish more papers in the year.)



(Shortform note: The authors of _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ warn that leading metrics are more difficult to measure than lagging metrics (for example, it’s easier to measure how much you weigh—a lagging metric—than it is to measure how many calories you’re eating—a leading metric). You’ll have to make a habit of collecting data on your leading metrics.)

#### Principle 3: Keep Your Metrics Visible

Making your leading metrics visible will motivate you to keep up the habit and allow for more frequent celebration of successes. Newport suggests keeping a physical display in the workspace that shows your leading metric, like a small whiteboard where you mark off hours spent in deep work.

  * Furthermore, for each of these hours, you might mark off what you accomplished in that time. Newport says this will make clear what concrete goals you’ve achieved in deep work.
  * He also suggests sharing metrics across your team if you work with other people—he says this will allow friendly competition to increase the metric.



(Shortform note: Studies show that continuously celebrating small achievements and feeling a sense of progress is a fairly easy way to boost your overall happiness—this is important because the strongest indicator of productivity is the way you _feel._ Research reveals that when you feel positively toward your organization and motivated by your work, your productive performance naturally increases.)

#### Principle 4: Create Accountability Where Possible

Periodically analyzing your deep work will keep you honest about how well you lived up to your goals. Newport explains that this exercise will show you where you can improve. He suggests two practices:

  1. Set up a weekly review to see what you’ve achieved in the past week and make a plan for the coming week. 
  2. Reflect on whether each week was “good” or “bad” and what led to each outcome. Where possible, make changes to your schedule to cut out factors that led to negative outcomes. 



(Shortform note: If you struggle with making behavioral changes based on a review of your own behaviors, you might try adding a more social aspect to your accountability practices. In _Indistractable,_Nir Eyal recommends social precommitments, which make it harder for you to perform undesirable behaviors. For example, you might make a precommitment to have someone else review each week’s deep work report. You’re more likely to stay away from shallow work and focus on hitting your goals because of the added pressure of being “watched” by someone else.)

### Learn to Say No to Shallow Work

Newport warns that like most knowledge workers, you’ll face invitations to partake in various forms of shallow work, such as meetings, committees, and travel. He suggests saying no to this shallow work by **providing a vague enough response that the requester cannot find a loophole that they could use to get you to say yes.**

  * For example, you might say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it because of schedule conflicts,” or, “Thank you for inviting me, but I won’t be able to make it.” 



You might feel bad saying no, but avoid giving a consolation prize (for example, “I can’t join the committee, but I’m happy to look at requests as they come along”). Newport says that this just keeps the door open for more shallow work that you don’t want to do and may have to say no to.

(Shortform note: Critics point out that in many industries, it’s important for each team member to contribute back to the group—it’s unfair to expect others to take on shallow tasks while you refuse to do them. Newport’s role as a professor isn’t an exception to this expectation: Joining committees, networking, and doing other shallow tasks are becoming increasingly vital parts of finding employment in academia.)

### Give Your Mind Time Off

If you’re the type to want to be productive, it may be tempting to spend every waking hour working. Newport thinks this is a counterproductive mindset, and that you should instead deliberately shut off your work and let your brain relax. He gives a few reasons for this.

#### 1) Overworking Isn’t Deep Working

First, as mentioned before, even experts can only accomplish four hours of intense concentration each day. At the end of the day, your brain is exhausted and is usually at its least effective. If you try to push through and continue working, you’ll often waste your time doing shallow work slowly or doing tasks that don’t need to be done at all.

(Shortform note: In the long term, avoiding overexertion of your brain helps you do much more than avoid time-wasting tasks—studies show that people who get more sleep, take more naps, and use more vacation days perform better and avoid burnout more than those who don’t.)

#### 2) Your Brain Works Better When It Can Relax

Newport says that giving your brain time to relax is useful for solving difficult problems. His argument arises from two theories of thought:

##### Unconscious Thought Theory

The subconscious parts of the brain are constantly working in the background to solve problems, in ways you can’t perceive. This subconscious work is high bandwidth and sifts through lots of possible solutions. In a stressful environment, such as one where your brain is overworked and given no chance to relax, your subconscious is less effective at this.

(Shortform note: Researchers say this explains why some surprisingly good insights come at odd times, like while in the shower or driving a car—in these moments, your brain is relaxed and allowed to wander through problems.)

##### Attention Restoration Theory

Your ability to focus is limited and needs to be regularly recharged. Deliberately setting aside time to relax today improves your focus tomorrow.

(Shortform note: You may find it difficult to switch your brain over from work mode to relaxation mode. Researchers recommend low-key activities like walking, crafting, and gardening that keep you a bit busy but allow your mind to unwind.)

### Ritualize Your Workday Shutdown

**To fully get your mind off work and relax, Newport suggests creating a shutdown ritual.** He says this ritual should help you check your work for anything you forgot and plan your next day’s work.

Here’s an example ritual:

  * Check your emails for any last urgent items.
  * Update your to-do list of unresolved items.
  * Check that each unresolved item has a completion date. 
  * Look through your calendar to make sure there aren’t important deadlines you forgot.
  * Make a to-do list of tasks for the next day.
  * Say, “All done,” or a similar phrase to explicitly mark the end of work.



(Shortform note: You may want to add reflective time into your workday shutdown—research shows that employees who spend 15 minutes at the end of their workday reflecting on what they learned during the day perform about 23% better in their work than those who don’t take time for reflection.)

**Newport stresses that an important benefit of the end-of-day ritual is that it helps reassure you that things will be fine when you shut down.** You’ll never be able to finish all your important work in one day. When you create a shutdown ritual, instead of feeling anxious about unfinished tasks, you’ll feel confident that all the important tasks are accounted for, and that you’ll make meaningful progress the next day. This gives you more time to fully relax in your time off from work.

(Shortform note: This ritual also sets clear boundaries between work and not-work, which is especially important as more knowledge workers begin to work from home.)

> **How Employers Can Help Normalize Relaxation**
> 
> Even if your employees incorporate shutdown rituals into their workday, it may be difficult for them to relax completely unless you demonstrate that it’s okay—expected, even—that they truly leave their work out of their time outside the office. In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown suggests several ways to do this:
> 
>   * Apply boundaries to _yourself_ —if you don’t want employees sending emails on the weekend, you shouldn’t be sending emails on the weekend.
> 
>   * Don’t praise employees who brag about their exhaustion or how they gave up vacation or weekend time to catch up on work. Speak to these employees privately and reiterate your expectation that they take the proper time to rest. Publicly praise employees who go offline during vacation or tell you about the fun events they did over the weekend.
> 
>   * Never punish employees for not immediately responding to a work crisis that happens while they’re off the clock.
> 
>   * Ask employees to let you know of any times you _cannot_ reach them outside of work, and respect those times.
