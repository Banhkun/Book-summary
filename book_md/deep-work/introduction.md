## Introduction: What Is Deep Work?

**Cal Newport defines “deep work” as focused, uninterrupted,_undistracted_ work on a task that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit**.

In contrast, “shallow work” describes tasks that aren’t cognitively demanding—like answering emails, filling out paperwork, and attending unproductive meetings. These tasks don’t create much value and anyone can do them.

**Newport asserts that groundbreaking ideas and meaningful progress come from deep work, not shallow work.** Shallow work is incremental. Deep work can be transformational.

(Shortform note: Newport discusses an early iteration of deep work and its transformational effect in his book _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_. He says that many people, when looking for work, make the mistake of looking for a job they love. While this may feel good in the short term, it won’t pan out into a _career_ you love in the long term. He says that what _really_ sets you apart and guarantees success is developing scarce, prized skills—which he calls “career capital”—that let you choose among scarce, prized careers. In _Deep Work_ , he expands on this idea by giving readers the tools to engage in the type of deliberate practice that develops your skills and career capital.)

> **“Deep Work” vs. Reflective Work**
> 
> Some of Newport’s contemporaries refer to deep work and shallow work as reflective work and reactive work. However, with some tasks, the boundary between “reflective” and “reactive” can be confusing.
> 
>   * For example, you may think that because emails require you to _reflect_ on an adequate response, they count as _reflective_ work—though they’re shallow work, by Newport’s definition.
> 

> 
> Newport’s terms are a bit more intuitive—it’s relatively easy to understand that “shallow” relates to work that can be processed in the task-switching forefront of your mind and “deep” relates to the most mentally demanding work.

### The Rising Value of Deep Work

As our economy changes, deep work becomes more valuable. Over the past decades, the economy has moved away from brute force labor to analyzing and applying information.

(Shortform note: This idea isn’t new—Peter Drucker’s _The Effective Executive_ , published in 1966, discusses the rising “knowledge economy.” Drucker’s best practices for standing out in the knowledge economy align closely with several practices we’ll explore later in this guide, such as cutting out time-wasting activities, scheduling tasks into uninterrupted blocks of time, and focusing on one task at a time.)

The old economy—working in a manufacturing plant—didn’t require deep work for most workers. Newport explains that skills that succeed in the modern economy—like complex problem solving, data analysis, and computer programming—require deep work to learn and execute. **He argues that your ability to do deep work will determine how much you thrive in the information economy.**

Ironically, the **same technologies that _built_ the information economy are _depleting_ our ability to do deep work**. Phones, emails, and addictive apps pull us away every few minutes. Thus, at a time when deep work is most important, it’s also most difficult.

The ability to do deep work must be developed like a muscle. Building up your deep work muscle takes dedicated practice and focus because the constant distraction of technology is always working against you.

> **Is Deep Work _All_ We Need? **
> 
> Some may argue that Newport’s argument is a bit of an oversimplification—myriad skills besides deep work will become increasingly important in the future as more tasks are delegated to machines and AI. In _21 Lessons for the 21st Century_ , Yuval Noah Harari explores several skills that are crucial as we navigate the information economy, such as communication, collaboration, coping with change, critical thinking, and maintaining mental balance during uncertainty or instability.
> 
> However, the ability to do deep work inherently complements all these other skills, most especially managing change and instability—situations in which success looks like focusing only on what really matters to your goals and progress.

This guide is divided into two parts. First, we’ll cover foundational ideas of deep work and learn about its benefits. Then, we’ll explore practices that will help you create a supportive environment for engaging in deep work.
