## Part 2: Eat | Chapter 2: Roman Holiday

A few weeks after Gilbert’s divorce was finalized, she landed in Rome. She left everything behind—her job, her life, her on-again-off-again relationship with David, and the few possessions she had left. The divorce settlement and legal fees had cleaned her out. But when she pitched her travel idea to her publishers, they provided an advance that was just enough to cover a year abroad. **Ketut was right. She lost all her money and got it back right away.**

Gilbert rented a studio apartment in the posh district of Rome surrounding the Spanish Steps. Once in Rome, she wasted no time diving into the pleasures of Italy. Her first night, she ate spaghetti carbonara with spinach and garlic. She followed the handmade pasta with an artichoke, fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese, veal, plenty of bread, and tiramisu. A bottle of red topped everything off.

After this meal, she walked back to her new home. She entered her studio, turned off the light, and laid down. She thought she would spend the rest of the night the same way she’d spent each night for almost two years—crying. **Instead, she realized she was okay, even bordering on content.** Before she could question it, she fell asleep.

Gilbert was introduced to the grandness and beauty of Rome over the next few days. It was September 2003, and the weather was warm but pleasant. She marveled at the many fountains and the couples expressing love on the streets. She flushed at the many men who called her beautiful. She visited the same gelato shop three times in one day.

Gilbert thought that Rome was a magical place. She was surrounded by the language she loved and practiced it in several ways. She read one newspaper article a day, bought poetry books in Italian with English translations, and practiced with people on the street.

Wherever she looked, sweeping architecture dazzled. She found a library with a lush courtyard and fountain that reminded her of the foliage head of Ketut’s drawing. She sat near the fountain and read a poem by Louise Glück. **A great wave of relief washed over her when she came across the line,_Dal centro della mia vita venne una grande fontana_. “From the center of my life, there came a great fountain.”**

One of the first things Gilbert did in Rome was sign up for Italian school at the Leonardo da Vinci Academy of Language Studies. She would attend the beginner class for four hours a day, five days a week. The night before her first class, she was giddy like a first-grader before the first day of school.

### The Resurgence of Pain

Ten days after Gilbert arrived in Rome, she experienced a relapse of depression. She was walking home from school and stopped to admire the beautiful sunset over St. Peter’s Basilica. **One second she was content, and the next, depression and loneliness showed up like prison wardens.** They each took hold of one arm and led her back to solitary confinement.

Back at her studio, Gilbert’s mind raced with questions. What was she doing in Italy alone? Why had she ruined her marriage? Why couldn’t she make a relationship work? Why didn’t she have children? What would become of her if she kept living this way? She didn’t have the answers, so she curled up in bed with her clothes on and buried herself in the covers.

Gilbert was surprised to see these two oppressive emotions in this beautiful city. She’d been feeling happy and at peace in Rome, so much so that she’d stopped taking her antidepressants. This action wasn’t hard for her. She’d never wanted to be on medication in the first place. She had personal objections to psychosomatic drugs and was afraid of the side effects on her creativity and libido. But after two years of uncontrollable crying and suicidal thoughts, including a close call between a chopping knife and her wrist, she finally called a friend for help. The friend set her up with a therapist, and she agreed to be medicated.

This decision went against everything she was brought up to believe. The Gilberts didn’t believe in sickness as a principle and viewed poor physical health as a sign of weakness. This belief was why Gilbert saw her treatment as temporary and stopped the antidepressants in Rome. But the resurgence of depression and loneliness meant her healing was not over yet.

Gilbert had more pills with her, but she didn’t want to take them. Instead, she opened her journal and wrote one line—she asked for help. A moment later, she wrote another. This time, the line was a response from within her. The same voice from the night in the bathroom asked what she could do to help.

This notebook was where Gilbert had conversations with the voice. Since that night, the voice had returned during dire moments. It sounded like her voice, but she didn’t know where it came from. She didn’t know if it was her subconscious or something more divine, but whenever she was spiraling, the voice always answered back. Tonight was no different. **Through written communication, the voice assured Gilbert that she was loved and not alone.** Whether she took the medication or not, she was going to be protected.

The next morning, Gilbert woke up clutching the notebook. The whiff of depression lingered in the air, but it was gone. And her loneliness was gone as well.

### Finding Community

Gilbert wasn’t a great traveler like others she’d seen along her journeys. Those people knew how to blend in and emit a casual authority. Gilbert could do neither. She was tall, blonde, and pale, and when she was lost, she looked lost. But one thing she did well was make friends wherever she went.

Sometimes these friendships were happenstance—a train companion or a run-in at a restaurant. But often, **Gilbert orchestrated friendships by way of acquaintances of people she knew from home.** Before she left for Rome, she asked her friends for a few names of people she might look up.

Two of those people were a married couple named Maria and Giulio. Maria was American, and Giulio was from Southern Italy. The couple had Gilbert over for dinner several times, and the husband met with her separately to work on his English.

Another friend she met in this way was Luca Spaghetti. Luca and Gilbert became quick friends. He spoke English and enjoyed food as much as she did. He was a tax accountant, which she thought was a strange job for him considering his easy-going manner. Likewise, Luca didn’t understand her desire to study spirituality in India. He said it didn’t match her appetite for pleasure and Italian food.

Gilbert made other friends through different means, as well. **She grew close with her language partner, Giovanni. Their conversations centered mostly on politics and philosophy, and they knew little about each other’s personal lives.** But they enjoyed each other’s company.

Gilbert also made a close friend from her language course, a Swedish woman named Sofie. Sofie had also left her life behind for 4 months for the simple purpose of studying Italian in Rome.

### The Art of Doing Nothing

Although Gilbert went to Italy to immerse herself in a life of pleasure and beauty, she found the first difficult to attain. **Her working-class upbringing and American idealism made pleasure-seeking behaviors uncomfortable.** Like many Americans, she was unable to fully relax and enjoy doing nothing.

In America, we seek ways to stay entertained or busy. We work long hours and enjoy small moments of downtime in between. Italians, on the other hand, work to be able to experience pleasure. The Italian expression _bel far niente_ translates to “the beauty of doing nothing.” They see leisure time as their reward for hard work, not something to fill with activities until it’s time to be busy again.

This difference in perspective was hard for Gilbert to get past. For weeks, she questioned whether she’d earned the pleasure she sought. She wondered how to maximize her pleasure experiences and considered researching the best ways to achieve pleasure. Then, one day, she realized the only question she needed to ask was what pleasure meant to her.

Each day, she asked herself what would bring her the most pleasure. In a country full of art and history, the obvious choices were museums, musical performances, or exploring the landscape. But Gilbert wasn’t interested in those activities. To her surprise and delight, **she found she only desired to eat and speak the language. She focused on those pursuits and experienced a sense of freedom never felt before.**

Gilbert had many opportunities to enjoy the pleasure of speaking Italian. She learned almost 20 words a day and worked hard to converse properly. She wasn’t fluent like she wanted to be, but she was getting better and understanding more. Her friends were also great sources of information.

She and Giovanni had many conversations about idiomatic expressions in both languages. She taught him the American expression “I’ve been there” in response to emotional struggles. He was confused, wondering where “there” was. Gilbert explained that sadness is like a place you have to find your way out of. Giovanni offered the Italian version, which roughly translated to “I’ve experienced the same on my skin.” The phrase signified being scarred in a similar way.

Luca was also instrumental in teaching Gilbert new phrases. He took her to a soccer match and translated the curse words and expressions the fans shouted. **Learning Italian slang helped Gilbert feel more ingrained in the culture.** It also helped her converse more intelligibly with others. This skill helped her find more pleasure with the language. Still, the pleasure she got from food was hard to beat.

### Eating Her Way to Happiness

One of Gilbert’s happiest memories from Rome was finding a farm stand down the street from her studio. She purchased fresh asparagus and paired it with poached eggs, olives, goat cheese, and salmon for lunch. She took her plate to a sunny spot on the studio floor and ate every bit with her fingers. With her Italian paper and her beautiful lunch, she felt happiness oozing from every poor. **Her instinct to feel guilty about doing nothing kicked in. But she brushed it off. She’d finally learned _bel far niente_. **

Food was a constant source of pleasure for Gilbert in Rome. Another friend, an American food writer living in Italy, took her to all the best restaurants in Rome. Luca introduced her to an Italian delicacy—lamb intestines. And pastries, gelato, and cappuccino were daily favorites. However, one of the most memorable meals Gilbert had was pizza in Naples.

After meeting a young Australian woman backpacking through Europe, Gilbert found she was jealous of this woman’s adventures. True, she was on her own adventure, but the energy of visiting a new place and _living_ in a new place was different. Since she was in Rome for four months, she felt more like a resident than a traveler. **To feed her wandering spirit, she and her Swedish friend Sofie took the train to Naples, the birthplace of pizza and ice cream.**

Giovanni was from Naples and made Gilbert promise she’d go to the best pizzeria in town. To Gilbert, the best pizza in the city that invented pizza meant it would be the best in the world. She couldn’t wait.

Pizzeria de Michele did not disappoint. Both Sofie and Gilbert had other-worldly experiences eating this pizza. The crust was thin but soft. The cheese dripped off the sides, and the tomato sauce was tart, salty, and sweet. Each ate a whole pie themselves and ordered another.

At some point during the meal, Gilbert caught a reflection of herself in the window. She was heavier because of all the eating, but it wasn’t the weight she saw. Instead, **she saw a vibrant, healthy, and happy woman, someone she hadn’t seen in years**.

### No More Men

One pleasure Gilbert removed from contention was sex. **Before arriving, she’d made the decision to practice celibacy during her year-long journey.** The Italian men challenged this decision often. They were dark, handsome, and immaculately groomed and dressed. But she needed this time away from men and relationships. She’d never taken this kind of break before.

Since the age of fifteen, when Gilbert had her first boyfriend, she’d been jumping from one guy to another. Sometimes they’d overlap, and there was never more than a week’s break between partners. This scenario was made worse because of who she became in her relationships.

Gilbert didn’t have boundaries with men. When she was with someone, she was with them completely. She morphed into whoever they wanted her to be and gave every ounce of love, attention, and money to ensure their happiness—often at the expense of her own. She lost herself completely to the extent that a friend once told her she looked like her men, like a dog that resembles their owner.

Gilbert always felt lost and unsure of who she was due to this cycle of changing herself to suit her lovers. A year of celibacy would allow her to learn who she was without a man. She also saw it as a public service, likening her celibacy to the law taking away someone’s driver’s license after a string of accidents. Loneliness was sometimes a consequence of this decision. **But when she started to feel lonely, she’d tell herself to sit back and enjoy life without making someone else responsible for her happiness.**

There was another reason Gilbert wanted to be celibate. She was still in love with David and knew it would be unfair to start something with someone else with those feelings. Plus, she and David were still on-again-off-again before she left, and she wasn’t sure where they stood. Each had expressed a similar hope that one day they might figure out how to be together. Before she could be with anyone else, she had to understand where she stood with David.

### The Final Act

**On her way back to Rome from Naples, Gilbert was hit with the realization that she had to officially end things with David.** She knew they loved each other, but they made each other miserable. And it wasn’t realistic to hope that one of them would change and they’d find a way to live harmoniously.

Her happiness in Naples showed Gilbert that she might be able to live without David. Other happiness waited for her somewhere else. And even if it didn’t, she needed to cut the string tying them together before she could know for sure.

That night, she wrote David an email, the first communication they’d had since she left. She told him it was time to accept that their love was special but not sustainable. It was time for them to go their own ways. She also gave her blessing for him to find a new love. She hit send, knowing it was the right thing to do. But it still hurt.

The next day, Gilbert checked her email at the Internet cafe multiple times. Despite her conviction, there was still a part of her that hoped he would promise to change and ask her to stay. Late that evening, she received his response. He agreed that it was time for an official ending. He ended by saying he knew she would find another love that would make her happy.

Gilbert sat at the computer for a long time after reading the letter. **She knew she was better off without the pain their relationship caused, but she still grieved the loss of her love.** She met up with Giovanni later for their language lesson, but she was too upset. Instead of conversing, she and Giovanni shared their first interaction about their private lives. He sat patiently while she cried and told her he understood. He’d been there, too.
