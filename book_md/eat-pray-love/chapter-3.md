## Chapter 3: The New Elizabeth Gilbert

Gilbert’s older sister came to Rome shortly after the interaction with David. Whatever sadness remained vanished in the whirlwind of her sister, Catherine. Gilbert and her sister were very different. Where Gilbert was a loose planner, Catherine was precise. She brought 5 guidebooks, all of which she’d read and memorized before arriving. **Gilbert had embraced Rome from a wanderer’s perspective, but Catherine embraced it like an organized tour guide.**

As they toured the city, Catherine explained the history of the buildings and the different architectural periods. Gilbert saw all the churches and tourist sites she’d neglected and learned more about how this beautiful city came to be.

This visit was a bit of a milestone for the sisters. They’d grown up isolated on their parents’ tree farm, but they weren’t always close. Gilbert was always intimidated by her sister. In fact, the first time she ever stood up to Catherine was when she was 28 years old. There was also an undertone of resentment in their relationship. Gilbert had been everyone’s favorite, and except for relationships, life had been relatively easy for her. Catherine was smart, athletic, and fearless, but she’d had less luck in life than Gilbert and had worked hard for everything she had.

Gilbert and her sister had just reconnected and started building a relationship again when Gilbert separated from her husband. Catherine could have rubbed Gilbert’s nose in her failure. Catherine was married and a mother. But she didn’t. Instead, Catherine was there for every phone call and helped her through her depression. Before Gilbert left for Italy, they spoke on the phone daily. And when it was time for Catherine to go home, they made sure to tell each other how much they loved one another—a ritual they did before either got on a plane... just in case.

After Catherine’s visit, Gilbert was struck by the irony of how their lives had worked out. Gilbert was always the social one with relationships, and Catherine was independent and self-sufficient. But they’d ended up swapping lives. **Catherine’s visit also made Gilbert wonder about the role of children in her life.**

That night in the bathroom, Gilbert knew she didn’t want to have children yet. But how much of that had been not wanting to have children at all versus not wanting to have them with her husband? She wondered whether it wasn’t her responsibility as a woman to have children. And if she didn’t want them, what did that say about her?

Gilbert didn’t know if wanting your own life was selfish or not. But her desire to have one was a major issue in her marriage. Her husband made her feel selfish for wanting to work and travel. He often accused her in a way that suggested she was a bad mother of children that didn’t exist.

The guilt she took from those conversations was heightened one night when they attended an art opening of a friend who’d had a baby. Gilbert watched the woman try to balance hosting a party, speaking professionally about her work, and tending to a baby all at once. Where others may have seen a superwoman and envied her, Gilbert went into a panic. She knew this would be her life if she had a child. At that moment, she knew she didn’t want that life.

Gilbert wondered who she would be without children. The flake? The batty spinster aunt? How would her success as a human be measured if she didn’t leave generations of offspring behind? Her life was unstable and she had no plans beyond traveling for another 9 months. **She would eventually have to decide. But she found comfort in her writing and the fact that today was not that day.**

### Becoming Italian

For six weeks, Gilbert left Rome to explore more of the country. She traveled by train to Bologna, Florence, Venice, Sicily, Sardinia, and Calabria. Sometimes, she stayed for a week, and other times, she stayed for just a few days. Her ability to move freely and successfully from one place to another increased her confidence in herself.

She was living the type of life she enjoyed the most—fast-paced, whirlwind, spontaneous travel. She had no plan, no itinerary. **She dashed from one train station to the next and reveled in this lack of accountability and responsibility.** It was the most freeing time of her life. In fact, one night in a town along the Mediterranean, she woke herself up in the middle of the night laughing. She looked around for the source of the noise, and when she realized the laughter was hers, she laughed harder.

Gilbert also gained confidence in her speaking abilities. She’d dropped out of her language class because she didn’t want to be trapped in a classroom all day. She wanted to experience the language organically and through interactions with the wonderful people of Italy.

Her decision seemed to pay off on one train ride. A young Italian man sleeping in a train car awoke to find her in the opposite seat. He said something in Italian, believing she didn’t understand. He was surprised when she responded in Italian, and Gilbert was, too. For more than 20 minutes, she held a conversation with this man. And although her knowledge of grammar and syntax was small, she was speaking with ease. She realized she was no longer translating in her mind. **She was finally able to understand and speak the language freely.**

### A Woman on a Mission

Gilbert’s journeys were mostly alone and revolved around her favorite pastime—eating. She went through cities and towns famous for the food and wine created in the region. She traveled through Parma, Bologna, and Montepulciano. **She drank in the beauty of the landscape and architecture, but she continued to bypass tourist attractions for restaurants**.

In Lucca, a region known for its charcuterie, she dined on sausages and hams. She discovered that Puccini was born there, but she was more interested in the restaurant across the street from his home-turned-museum. A grocer had told her the best mushrooms in the city were served there. After one kind stranger led her to Puccini’s birthplace, she thanked him and quickly turned to cross to the restaurant.

In Bologna, Gilbert found some of the most exquisite food she’d ever eaten. The mushrooms were like steaks, the prosciutto was like thin lace, and the Bolognese sauce rivaled any ragu she’d ever tasted.

Gilbert had one visitor during this adventure. Her friend Linda from Seattle, whom she’d met at the yoga retreat in Indonesia, joined her in Venice. Linda was similar in age but had dreadlocks and piercings. She was a firecracker and had a rock-solid sense of self. She was exactly the companion Gilbert needed. Venice was a city for lovers, and Gilbert didn’t want to be there alone.

Together, they walked the streets of the old sinking city on the water. The gloomy and decaying atmosphere of the city was fairly depressing. But with Linda by her side, Gilbert didn’t take it in as a negative. **She was delighted to find she could separate the environment from her own emotional state, a difficult task in the past.** She knew it was a sign of growth and healing. And she knew it meant she was becoming a spiritually healthy person.

### Finding Her Word

Gilbert returned to Rome and was happy to be back among the eclectic and independent Romans after the dark conservative tone of Venice. But she also found she was eager to get to India. She thought Rome was a beautiful city, but she knew it wasn’t _her_ city.

Giulio, her American friend Maria’s husband, helped her realize why she didn’t truly feel connected to the city she’d called home for almost four months. He said each city had a word that described its essence and the essence of the people. In Rome, the word was “sex.” Gilbert argued that not all people were thinking about sex, but Giulio disagreed. Sex oozed through the atmosphere of the city—in the clothes, in the attitudes, in the nightlife, in the food. Whether people were seeking it, refusing it, or trying to ignore it, everything revolved around sex.

Gilbert now understood why Rome was not her city. **Her celibacy vow had turned the sex part of her off, so she could never connect with that heart of the culture.** She started to wonder what word described her essence. She believed New York’s word was “achieve,” which described her in her twenties. Her family word was somewhere between “frugal” and “irreverent,” but neither of those described her.

Gilbert started to seriously consider what her word was. She knew it wasn’t “marriage” or “family,” which explained why she was miserable in her nuclear community Upstate with her husband. It wasn’t the ambitious tone of “achieve” anymore, but it also wasn’t pure “pleasure.” **She realized her journey was likely more about finding her word than anything else.**

### Finding Gratitude

Gilbert came close to understanding her word at a dinner party on Thanksgiving. The American holiday that year fell on Luca Spaghetti’s birthday, and he wanted to celebrate his 33rd year around the sun with a Thanksgiving turkey. Gilbert decided to help him with his wish.

The party was held at a large home in the Roman countryside owned by Luca’s friends. The guests included several of Luca’s friends and two of Gilbert’s. Around the table that night, there were three languages represented: Italian, English, and Swedish. But to Gilbert’s surprise, the barriers didn’t hinder their ability to connect and feel like they belonged.

Late in the evening, after many bottles of wine, they decided to practice the American tradition of stating what they were thankful for. Each person took their turn, becoming emotional and weeping when they spoke openly about gratitude for their lives. When it was Gilbert’s turn, she didn’t know what to say.

What she did know was that she was grateful her word was no longer “depression.” Just a few months before, she was so entangled in the grips of despair, she wouldn’t have been able to enjoy a lovely evening like this. **She still couldn’t articulate what her word was yet, but she knew it had something to do with the way the people in her life were changing her.** She said how grateful she was for old friends and new friends, and how lucky she felt to know such wonderful people. It was the truth in that moment, and that was enough.

### Expansion of Life

After four months eating her way through Italy, Gilbert gained 23 pounds. Most of this weight was good weight. She’d become frail and thin during her divorce and depression. **The rest of the weight was merely a happy consequence of living a life of pleasure.** There was one problem. Her clothes from home stopped fitting a long time ago, and she’d grown out of the new clothes she’s bought to replace them.

She expected to lose most of the weight once in India, but she still needed something to wear during her last week of eating. She broke down and bought a pair of jeans with a waistband size she could barely believe.

Instead of spending her final days in Rome, Gilbert decided to travel to Sicily. Her reasoning was varied. After the decadence of Rome, Sicily was a more impoverished region. She may have subconsciously been preparing for the poverty she would encounter in India. But she also remembered what the great German writer Goethe said about his Italian travels—you cannot know Italy if you do not know Sicily.

After a long trip, including a train, a bus, a ferry, and a taxi, Gilbert finally landed in the town of Taormina. As always, the first question she asked was where the best food was in town. A policeman directed her to a small trattoria run by an old woman and her older mother. The woman was pleased when Gilbert asked her to bring the best food in the place. After a few minutes, Gilbert was feasting on the best meal she’d eaten thus far in Italy. There were crustaceans, pasta, seafood broth, vegetables, and stewed rabbit. She didn’t know if this meal could be beat, but she found it could the next day in the town of Syracuse.

Syracuse was a very old and historic part of the country. Gilbert described it as making Rome look like Dallas in comparison. Myths of Hercules staying there lived next to the known stories of Plato and other great artistic minds and scientists inhabiting the region. Historians believed that the concepts of rhetoric and plot were developed in Syracuse. Gilbert could feel the history beneath her feet, but she saw the hardship of life there in the faces of the people.

There was something different about how Gilbert thought about her pleasure-seeking behaviors in Sicily. The oppressive influence of the mafia left crumbling streets and buildings, and the political strife had dampened part of the spirit of the place. She wondered if what she was doing was just. **Was it right to have no greater purpose but to find the next best meal in a place with this many problems?**

She realized in that moment what Goethe meant. In a place filled with so much historical and current pain, sometimes you must experience beauty to feel alive. In Italian culture, the arts are heralded above anything else. There may be corruption or inadequacies within the political and business spheres, but the culture was held to a higher standard. Nowhere else was this dichotomy more evident than in Sicily. To devote time to creating and experiencing pleasures of the senses was to hold on to something real and human.

Gilbert knew she’d been doing the same thing. **She came to Italy a broken and torn down woman, but through the act of feeding her senses, she’d nourished her soul.** She’d grown physically and emotionally. She’d followed her own path of beauty and ended up finding something real in herself. She was ready to see what came next.
