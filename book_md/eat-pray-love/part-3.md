## Part 3: Pray | Chapter 4: Finding God in India

Gilbert landed in Mumbai at 1:30 am, and two hours later, she stood at the opening of the Ashram. Through the front gates, Gilbert could hear the morning prayer, the _arati_ , which began each day at 3:30 am. This Sanskrit hymn was her favorite, and she couldn’t wait to join it. She stashed her bag behind a tree and slipped into the temple to pray.

After the prayer, Gilbert followed the worshippers into a smaller temple, where Indians and Westerners were seated in meditation. She hadn’t meditated since before she went to Italy. She sat down, closed her eyes, and began saying the mantra. _Om. Na. Mah. Shi. Va. Ya. Om Namah Shivaya._

She started slowly, articulating each syllable. She repeated the mantra over and over, carefully unpacking each word. The next thing she knew, the sun was rising. **She opened her eyes, looked around, and felt as though she’d been at the Ashram forever.** Italy was suddenly a distant memory.

### A Brief Introduction to Yoga and the Ashram

For Gilbert and the other worshippers, the practice of Yoga was not about exercise—the Hatha Yoga that so many in the West practice. The practice was about finding union between mind and body and preparing the body for the long periods of meditation. Through meditation, a union between the individual and God could be formed.

True followers believe that each person has a supreme Self in which your true identity and divinity exist. **Through Yoga, the attention is focused on finding this divine Self and becoming content in the world.**

Finding this Self is an easier task than having the discipline to live as that Self for eternity. This is why people seek out Gurus. The word Guru is created through two Sanskrit syllables that translate to “darkness” and “light.” The Guru shows their worshippers the way out of the dark and into the light. They also pass their state of enlightenment to their students. You don’t have to actually be in the presence of a Guru to receive these teachings and grace. By visiting the Ashram and being disciplined in your practice, you can communicate through meditation.

There is also the belief that if you put the call out for a Guru in your life, the universe will conspire to bring you one. For Gilbert, she put the call out for a spiritual guide that night on the bathroom floor. A month later, she saw the picture of her Guru at David’s house and felt a connection. **Her Western mentality sometimes made her feel silly using a term like Guru, but she knew that she asked for guidance and it showed up.** This was enough for her to believe, regardless of what anyone else thought.

Residence at the Ashram was based on an application and strict rules governing who could come and when. The Ashram was closed to the public except for one temple. The property sat far in the country among small impoverished villages. The workers were mostly residents, and each resident was expected to contribute five hours of labor a day. Entry required evidence of previous disciplined study of Yoga, and students were required to stay at least a month. Gilbert would stay for six weeks and then travel.

Each student had to submit an essay, references, and statements regarding their mental, physical, and financial health. The Ashram was not a place for people to escape from their problems at home. The Guru wanted the students to be free of barriers to enlightenment, and any type of suffering or family disapproval could disrupt their practice and that of others.

Another caveat was that students were requested to postpone their visit if they’d experienced a serious emotional trauma within the previous 6 months. Gilbert was grateful for her time in Italy because it helped her heal from the grief of her divorce. **She knew if she had come straight here, she would’ve been an emotional burden on the community.**

The physical and emotional work at the Ashram was difficult. The rigorous way of life was meant to help the students learn who they really were inside.

### A New Beginning

**The day after Gilbert’s arrival was New Year’s Eve, an auspicious moment for a spiritual awakening.** The residents gathered in the courtyard and prepared for the ceremony. The Indian women were dressed in bright silk saris and jewelry. Everyone sat on the ground, and the chanting began. They would chant until midnight, when the new year began.

Gilbert struggled with the word “chanting,” again influenced by her New England discomfort with the metaphysical. But she loved the practice, and the chanting at the Ashram was more like singing. To chant was to meditate. You gave your attention to the song’s progression and blended your voice into one with the others.

The long days of traveling were hard on Gilbert, and she feared she was too jet-lagged to stay up until the new year. **But as the chanting began—a lullaby of gratitude and devotion—she found energy in holding the words passed from the leaders and mirroring them back.** Before she knew it, there were only 30 minutes left before midnight. The beat picked up, and people started to clap and dance. The rhythm of the drums increased, and Gilbert began to feel like they were collectively pulling the new year toward them.

The energy heightened, and suddenly the time passed from 2003 to 2004. Whatever the year contained was not known, but they were all underneath the power of it in that moment together. **Gilbert was without anyone she knew or loved that night, but she felt anything but alone.**

### A Rocky Start to Enlightenment

Gilbert was given the job of scrubbing the temple floors. For hours each day, she knelt on the marble floor with several Indian teenagers. The work was hard, but it was meant to be. The repetitive arduous work of cleaning the floor every day emulated the arduous task of attending to the purification of her soul. For Gilbert, the former effort was much easier than the latter.

**Gilbert did not take to meditation well. Even at home, it was not easy for her to shut down her mind.** Meditation and prayer are the two essential components of Yoga practice. Prayer is the act of talking to God, and meditation is the act of listening. She knew why prayer came so much more easily to her. She never had any problems lamenting her feelings to God. But the listening was a different story.

When she meditated, Gilbert had what is known as “monkey mind”—the endless swinging of thoughts down an endless row of branches. She became bored quickly, then angry that she was bored. This feeling was followed by depression because she couldn’t find stillness, and she would quickly dissolve into anxiety. This cycle of thoughts was not the main problem, however. The problem was the emotional response she attached to each thought.

When she became caught in the emotions of her thoughts, she wasn’t able to be _present_. **She was either in the past with her sadness and anger or in the future with her worries and fears.** The mantra was meant to create something tangible to focus your attention on to stay present, but Gilbert still struggled.

During her first days at the Ashram, Gilbert asked her roommate, Corella, a black Baptist meditation teacher from South Carolina, how she was able to find a transformative place with the mantra. Corella said she just chanted and felt transported. Gilbert tried to hammer down the details. How did she breathe? How did she divide the words between breaths? What was the trick? To demonstrate, Corella spoke the mantra. Gilbert listened as the words were spoken normally and without flourish or rhythmic intention. She became frustrated and interrupted Corella to ask if she wasn’t bored. Corella smiled and looked at her watch. Only 10 seconds had passed.

At the morning prayer the next day, Gilbert again struggled with her meditation practice. They were meant to meditate for an hour, but she felt each minute like a mile in her mind. After fourteen minutes of arguing with her mind, she opened her eyes and quit. She cried from the pressure and her failure. She stared at the others content in their practice. Their stillness and fortitude felt like an affront to her inability to find the same. **She wondered how she was ever going to quiet her mind enough to reach a truly enlightened place.**

### A Savior From Texas

Later that night, Gilbert sat alone at a table in the cafeteria eating dinner. She was focused on eating with intention. Digestive disruption can lead to meditative disruption, so eating slowly and taking small bites was encouraged. Considering how Gilbert spent the last four months and the buffet of delicious Indian food available, this task was harder than it seemed.

While trying not to shovel food into her mouth, Gilbert noticed a tall and foreboding-looking man searching for a table. She hadn’t seen him before but gestured for him to join her. The man walked over in a calm and confident way and sat down. When he spoke, it was with a southern drawl. **This was Richard from Texas, and Gilbert had just met her new best friend.**

Richard had lived a multifaceted life before arriving at the Ashram. Among his many jobs were truck driver, used-car salesman, Vietnam soldier, drug dealer, and home renovator. He was a recovering addict and alcoholic and had found the Guru by way of an ex-girlfriend. He called Gilbert “Groceries” because of her impressive ability to consume food.

After discovering the Guru, Richard started praying daily. Each prayer was the same—he asked God to open his heart. And he asked for a sign for when it happened. A few months later, Richard had open-heart surgery. He learned from that experience to be more careful about what he prayed for and to ask God to be gentle with him.

Gilbert saw how comfortable Richard was with his practice and asked for his advice about how to tackle her meditation problems. **Richard reminded her that meditation was simply the act of sitting down with intention. Whatever happened after that was out of her control.** But that wasn’t enough for Gilbert. She wanted to feel transcended. Richard told her that her intruding thoughts were her ego trying not to lose control of her mind. She just needed to recognize what was happening and let it go without judgment. That was how she could distract the ego with divine love.

### Carving Her Own Path to God

Gilbert’s conversation with Richard gave her a new perspective on her practice. **Before she started her mantra, she told her mind not to worry. She wasn’t trying to kill it, just open it to love.** She also decided to try a new mantra that felt less frustrating. This new mantra was a repetition of the words _Ham-sa_ , or “I am That.” In the Yogi traditions, this mantra is the most natural one given to all by God at birth. It simply means that God is within every breath. If you are breathing, you are one with God.

During her practice, whenever thoughts came into her mind, Gilbert politely asked them to go play somewhere else. After a while, she fell asleep. (Gilbert notes that “falling asleep” may not actually mean falling asleep. She isn’t sure what happens in those moments, whether it is true sleep or a different state of consciousness.)

**After some time, Gilbert “woke up” and felt a blue pulsing energy inside.** It was strong and overwhelming, but it was also wonderful. She acknowledged the power of the feeling and felt it magnify. She closed her eyes and tried to sit with it, but it grew with such force, she couldn’t handle it. She opened her eyes and said she wasn’t ready for that kind of power yet. The energy left within seconds.

This sort of energetic experience has different names in different religious and spiritual realms. For instance, in Christianity, it’s referred to as the _Holy Spirit_. In Yogic tradition, it’s called _kundalini shakti_ and is imagined as a snake coiled at the base of the spine that is released by your Guru. The snake transcends through the seven chakras until it opens the skull to receive God. It’s a dangerous force to play with on your own, which is why a Guru is suggested for deep practice.

For two nights following her experience with kundalini shakti, Gilbert dreamed of snakes. She woke up in a sweat, and her mind flew into a fit of anxiety. Her thoughts traveled back to her divorce and the pain experienced with David. And once again, she ached from her broken heart. She was angry to be experiencing this unraveling again.

After this dream one night, she fell back asleep and dreamed of a dog threatening to kill her. She woke with a start, shaking and crying. She was afraid of waking her roommates, so she hid in the bathroom. The irony didn’t escape her. **Once again, she was on a bathroom floor praying for help. When that didn’t work, she pulled out her notebook and asked for help.** Like before, the voice guided her hand to write a response. The voice reminded her that she was not alone and was loved. A long exhale of relief followed.

### The Gift of a Broken Heart

Despite the reassurance of the voice the night before, Gilbert struggled the next day. **She couldn’t stop the anguished thoughts about David. And she couldn’t get over her anger at having to relive those feelings again.** Meditating was nearly impossible. She was angsty and snippy with everyone who crossed her path.

Gilbert tried to avoid everyone that day, but Richard caught up to her at dinner. He could tell something was wrong. Gilbert tried to ignore his questions, but before she knew it, she was opening up. She confessed about the dreams, her nights in the bathroom, and her lingering and detrimental feelings for David. She’d been working to get over him for almost a year, and she thought she had. So why this relapse?

Richard suggested she give it six more months. And if that didn’t work, she should give it another six months and continue doing so until she was truly healed. She was in a beautiful place full of God and grace, and she wasn’t there by accident. He counseled her to try to let go and let her emotions work themselves out. One day, she would look back on this time and realize that she was lucky to be there during her time of mourning. And she would be able to understand how her life had changed.

Gilbert didn’t want to hear any of that. She kept insisting that David was her soul mate. That she really loved him. That she missed him. That she still wished they could be together. To this, Richard responded that David may have been her soul mate, but that didn’t mean what she thought. Soul mates were people who held your life up and helped you understand what you wanted and how to change. They came into your life for a reason. When that reason was fulfilled, it was time for them to go.

Richard told her that David was needed to help her leave her marriage. His purpose was to diminish her ego and break her heart wide open. And he was her pathway to her finding her Guru. **Without David, she wouldn’t have been desperate enough to seek help. She wouldn’t have recognized a need for transcendence. He did his job, and it was time for him to go.** Her need to cling to hope for reconciliation was fear of being alone and facing her truths. If she let the space David filled become empty, God would fill it with light and love.

Gilbert heard every word, but it didn’t help. She wanted an exact date for when her pain would end. She wanted to circle it on her calendar. Richard laughed and said she was a control freak. Gilbert raged against this categorization at first, but then she realized he was right. She just never realized it was so obvious to the outside world.

### Learning to Let Go

While reflecting on her conversation with Richard, Gilbert remembered a moment when she was 9 years old. She had a true existential crisis about turning 10. Something about transitioning from single digits to double digits exposed the reality of mortality to her young mind. She was taken by the realization that time moved too fast, and soon, she and everyone she knew would be dead.

Nothing had happened to spawn that realization. No one had died or said anything about death to her. **She just felt panicked and helpless about aging and what that meant for her life. She believed that moment was what caused her to seek adventure in life.** To try to have as many loves as possible. To visit as many places as possible. To eat as much pasta as possible. To take complete control over her life so that no moment was wasted.

If she could have lived eight lives at once, she would have so she could experience everything there was in the world. But trying to live eight lives as one person spun her life into a frenzy. The only way this pace of life could end was in destruction. For her, that destruction came in the form of crying out for help on a bathroom floor at 30 years old.

Gilbert realized she couldn’t take any of her past actions back. The only thing she could do now was try to find peace and contentment in life. That was why she’d come to the Ashram. She’d been chasing time her whole life and struggling because she could never catch it. Time was always a step ahead of her. **But she started to understand that the purpose of life was not to catch time. Her mission was to sit, be patient, and let life unfold as it would.** The only place she needed to put the energy used to micromanage life was in her pursuit of God.

The next morning, Gilbert sat in meditation and took in the usual thoughts. What she found alarmed her. The intruding thoughts she believed were so powerful and oppressive were really not that interesting. They ping-ponged between longing for love and remaining in control. These mundane thoughts held her back from finding God, so she asked for a different lens by which to see her thoughts. Rather than seeing them as failures, could she not see them as human?

At first, she tried not to judge her thoughts. But her mind wouldn’t relent. She kept thinking about all of her mistakes and how she was no good at meditating. Then, from some deep unknown place inside, a different voice arose. It roared like a lion in the jungle. It bared its teeth and stood tall, showing how much more powerful her love was than all the hate. **Gilbert’s mind settled, and she heard nothing but a powerful, grounding silence. For the first time since arriving, she felt she could talk to God.**
