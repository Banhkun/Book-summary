## Part 1: New York | Chapter 1: The Ending of a Life

Elizabeth Gilbert found herself on the bathroom floor of the home she shared with her husband four years before starting her spiritual journey. It was three o’clock in the morning. This was the 47th night in a row that she’d slipped out of bed and hid in the bathroom. **What thrust her out of bed was the realization that she didn’t want to be married anymore.**

Gilbert and her husband had dated for two years and been married for six. They lived along the Hudson Valley in Upstate New York and were working toward a Norman Rockwell existence. They wanted children, dinners around the table, and vegetable gardens in the yard. Gilbert had a wandering spirit, but she and her husband assumed that by 30 years old, she would be ready to settle into real life. She wasn’t.

Year after year, Gilbert waited for the proverbial “ticking clock” to kick in. She believed she should want a baby. That’s what people did—they got married, had kids, and lived happily ever after. But as time stretched on, she realized her idea of happily-ever-after looked very different.

Each time a pregnancy test came back negative, she was relieved. She had friends with new babies and saw the joy they felt. The last time she felt that kind of joy was when she was sent to New Zealand on a writing assignment. **She decided she couldn’t have a baby until she felt more joy about it than a free trip to New Zealand.**

But she wasn’t unhappy in her marriage simply because of an obligation to have a baby. There were several issues (none of which Gilbert discusses) that made her feel trapped. She and her husband had both noticed something changing in her over the past months. Their relationship had become emotionally volatile and exhausting. Still, she loved him and feared hurting him.

Each night, Gilbert hid in the bathroom because of her confusion, shame, and guilt about wanting to escape her marriage. But on this particular night, something happened that hadn’t before. Down on her knees, sobbing, Gilbert started to pray.

### A Voice From Beyond

Gilbert prayed to God that night, but not to the God of devout Christians. Gilbert was born Protestant and attended church as a child, but she never believed in one God for everyone. She thought there were many gods with many names and forms for different people. In her mind, God was an all-encompassing indescribable entity.

For Gilbert, **God represented a return to the core of existence—the heart. God embodied ultimate love in the universe.** She likened the way she thought about God to the way she thought about a rescue dog she had. The dog was a mutt and brown. When someone asked what type of dog it was, Gilbert said, “A brown dog.” Likewise, when someone asked what sort of God she believed in, she said, “a magnificent one.”

Gilbert didn’t know how to start praying that night on the floor, so she started the same way she started any new acquaintance. She introduced herself. Then, she asked God for an answer—guidance to tell her how to manage the despair she felt about her life.

Over and over, Gilbert asked God to tell her what to do. She cried and prayed for hours. Then, like someone turning off a faucet, she stopped crying. The bathroom became silent. She was afraid to breathe. And then she heard a voice. To her great surprise, the voice was hers. It was the kind of voice she might have if she were content and wise.

Gilbert didn’t know what to expect from this voice, but she didn’t expect the answer she received—“go to bed.” It was a simple message, but a divine one. Her life wasn’t going to get figured out that November night on the bathroom floor. There would be time for the hard decisions later. All she could do at that moment was go to bed and rest. She would need it for the emotional journey she was about to embark on.

Gilbert didn’t see this experience as a religious conversion. Rather, **this moment encapsulated the beginning of a long conversation with her spiritual heart that eventually brought her closer to God.**

### From Lovers to Enemies

Gilbert ended her marriage seven months after that night on the floor. She thought the worst part would be telling her husband the marriage was over, but that was shortsighted. The ensuing divorce proceedings and dissolving relationship were far worse. **She and her husband became different people after the separation, and each was equally shocked by the cruelty of the other.**

Gilbert wanted the divorce to be amicable and swift. She wanted to sell their house and split everything down the middle. When her husband refused this offer, she suggested he keep all the assets and she keep the blame. Still, he said no. He didn’t provide an alternative scenario. He simply moved to their Manhattan apartment and told her she was a horrible person.

Gilbert felt horrible. She felt so guilty that she didn’t think she deserved anything, not even her salary. She was experiencing an awakening and wanted things to be easy. She didn’t want to be engrossed in a contentious battle. For these reasons, Gilbert didn’t hire a lawyer right away. She put her life on hold that summer while she waited for her husband’s terms. But her life moved forward anyway. She found a new love.

David was an actor in New York City. Gilbert met him after he was cast in a play based on her short stories. In hindsight, Gilbert realized the folly of conflating the real person with the character she created. But at the time, she didn’t see it. **She fell hard and fast for David that summer and jumped straight from her marriage bed into David’s.**

More than just a lover, David became a safe harbor during Gilbert’s struggles with her divorce. She clung to him as one might a life preserver in choppy waters. She moved into his apartment quickly and lived a blissful, romantic-comedy existence for several months. They traveled, hiked, developed pet names, read together, cooked together, and loved like their lives depended on it. Unfortunately, only one of their lives depended on it. And when Gilbert took an emotional turn downward, David started to retreat.

Her emotional landslide happened for two reasons. First, Gilbert finally met up with her husband again after the long summer. The date was September 9, 2001. They were supposed to hammer out the details of their separation. Instead, her husband focused on Gilbert’s low character and how much he now hated her.

Then, 9/11 happened. Gilbert and her husband talked briefly to make sure the other was safe. But when the whole country was coming together for strength, neither she nor her husband reached out to each other for the same. It was a monumental statement that their marriage was officially over.

The destruction of Gilbert’s life and her city, as well as the loss of the illusion of safety in her country, was too much for her. **The happy, assured woman David fell in love with became needy and unhinged.** The more she floundered, the more David pulled away. A great divide opened between them, and he became unreachable.

Gilbert felt the only good thing in her life slipping away, so she held on tighter. She started to need David like an addict needs a fix. She experienced withdrawal symptoms, made worse by David’s apparent repulsion of her. All of the losses stacked up to an insurmountable wall of defeat, and Gilbert became suicidal.

### The Beginning of Something New

There were several saving graces during the period following her break-up with David. In early 2002, Gilbert moved into a one-bedroom apartment, her first single apartment of her life. The rent was a struggle because most of her money was tied up in the house and legal fees. But she found a way to make it work. She saw the apartment as vital to her recovery and made it her sanctuary.

**Living on her own opened Gilbert up to an independence she’d never known. She grew stronger, more intuitive to her own needs, and more confident.** These qualities made David come running back. They discussed how to move forward again with more knowledge about each other and the relationship. They shared days, sometimes weeks, of joy together again. But inevitably, Gilbert would cling too hard, and David would retreat. This cycle went round and round for months, and each ending took Gilbert back to the bottom of her despair.

In the moments in between the despair, Gilbert focused on who she wanted to become. She asked herself what she wanted to do with her life. She kept the answers small and her actions manageable. She took a yoga class, read more, and made small purchases to accommodate her life.

One idea that kept coming forward was learning Italian. She’d wanted to learn Italian for years but always thought it seemed frivolous. Now, she decided it was okay to be frivolous if it brought her joy. She signed up for an adult continuing education night course, which she affectionately referred to as “Night School for Divorced Ladies.”

Gilbert loved learning Italian. Speaking the language made her feel beautiful and sensual. In addition, her focus on Italian impeded the crushing sensation of heartache. An idea started to sprout. **If she felt this much joy simply speaking the language, what would happen if she immersed herself in the culture?** She’d never intended to go to Italy, but for the first time, she wondered “why not?”

### A Spiritual Awakening

The second event during this period of time was her introduction to an Indian Guru. Oddly, this introduction came by way of David. The first time she entered his apartment, she noticed a picture of a beautiful Indian woman. When she learned this woman was David’s spiritual teacher, something sparked inside. Without thinking, she said she wanted a spiritual teacher.

Her desire for a spiritual teacher was a surprise. She had never considered any sort of spiritual guidance before. But her metaphysical experience that night on the bathroom floor opened something up inside her. **She wanted to explore the spiritual realm more deeply.**

To Gilbert’s disappointment, tens of thousands of people felt the same way. Her fantasy of sitting intimately with this Indian Guru sipping tea was quickly dashed by the realization that many who followed her would never meet her. Still, Gilbert attended meditation gatherings with David. The first night she went, her soul rose from her body. She felt as light as a leaf caught in the wind.

She continued attending the gatherings and took to meditating and chanting the Sanskrit mantra at home in the mornings. When she discovered that the Guru had an Ashram in India, she felt an overwhelming need to go there.

Before Gilbert made any definitive travel plans to either Italy or India, she was sent to Indonesia to study yoga vacations in Bali on assignment for a magazine. With nothing at home but heartache and a contentious divorce, Gilbert jumped at the chance.

While in Indonesia, the residents of the retreat visited a ninth-generation medicine man named Ketut Liyer. He was a small, jolly, aging man with more gums than teeth. Each resident was allowed to ask one question. Gilbert’s head flooded with requests about easing the burden of her divorce and making David fall back in love for her. But she knew those requests were low and shameful. This was a real opportunity to gain some mystical guidance, and she didn’t want to waste it on boy trouble.

So when her turn came, she told Ketut she wanted to devote her life to God without losing the comforts and joys she’d grown accustomed to. Ketut drew her a picture of a figure standing on four legs in prayer. The figure was headless. A bouquet of wild plants and flowers sprouted from the neck. A smiley face replaced the heart.

Ketut said Gilbert must become that figure to find the balance between God and life. She must find grounded stability, as if she stood on four legs. **She must stop looking for God with her mind but feel Him with her heart.** After this, he read Gilbert’s palm.

He told her she was very lucky and would travel the world. She would meet many friends and have wonderful experiences. But she had to stop worrying so much. There was no reason for her to worry about anything. She was going to lose all her money soon, but she would get it all back. She would be successful in her creative endeavors and be married twice.

At that moment, Ketut looked deeply into her palm and paused. He then looked up and said she would be back in Bali soon. She would stay with him for a few months and teach him English. In return, he would teach her all he knew about Balinese meditation. When he was finished, he stood up, as though a deal had transpired, and said, “See you later, alligator.”

### A Plan for the Future

Gilbert had decided on a plan for her future by the time she returned home. She couldn’t ignore the premonition of the Balinese medicine man and needed to find a way to get to Indonesia again. The trouble was she also wanted to visit Italy and India. The other trouble was she wasn’t yet free to travel.

The first problem was simpler to figure out. The appeal of Italy was its cultural focus on beauty and pleasure. The appeal of India was spiritual guidance from her Guru. The conundrum was the same one she’d posed to Ketut. How can she balance her desire for earthly pleasures and that for internal awakening? She remembered the drawing of the headless figure and decided she didn’t have to choose. She would find a way to do both.

Gilbert decided to spend four months in each location. **She would write about her experiences succumbing to rapture in Italy, to spiritual devotion in India, and to the confluence of both in Indonesia.** The fact that each country started with “I” was mere coincidence, albeit an auspicious one.

The second problem was beyond the scope of her decision-making abilities. Her husband held the power in their divorce, and a year and a half later, he was still holding her hostage in their marriage. Gilbert finally hired a lawyer and applied legal pressure. They accused her husband of mental cruelty. Gilbert had already agreed to turn over all their joint assets, but her husband wanted more.

In spring 2003, Gilbert’s husband requested royalties from her book sales and future earnings, as well as part of her retirement fund. All of this was added to a cash settlement and ownership of both properties. Gilbert saw the line in the sand. **She could lose everything and be contractually attached to this man for the rest of her life or stand up for herself and fight.** She chose the latter.

Month after month passed with no agreement. If her husband didn’t agree to a reduced settlement, they’d fight it out in court. This would cost both dearly financially and emotionally. It would also mean Gilbert would be stuck in New York for another year.

Gilbert grew depressed and anxious. Around this time, she was sent on a tour for the release of a paperback edition of one of her books. A friend joined her on the cross-country road trip. It was exactly the escape she needed. Still, the divorce hung heavy over her head. On one of their long drives, her friend told her she should petition God for help.

**Gilbert wrote a petition asking God to help end her marriage and finalize the divorce.** She said it was a matter of health for the universe to allow two souls to finally be free from this dark battle. She and her friend imagined hundreds of people, including family, friends, the Clintons, and other celebrities, signing the petition. When she couldn’t think of any more names, she went to sleep. Hours later, she woke up to her phone ringing. Her husband had signed the papers. She was free.
