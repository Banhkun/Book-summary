## Part 4: Love | Chapter 6: Smooth Sailing in Indonesia

Soon after landing in Bali, Gilbert realized she was woefully unprepared for this portion of her trip. In all her years of traveling, **she’d never landed in a country with no plan whatsoever. But there she was in Indonesia because of a 10-minute conversation with a medicine man two years ago**. She had no knowledge about the customs, no friends waiting for her, and no idea of where she was heading. She also didn’t know about the one-month tourist time limit. She politely asked the customs officer if she could stay for four months. He politely replied no.

Now that she was there, Gilbert couldn’t fully recall what the medicine man had said to her. Did he say she _would_ come back or _should_ come back? And worse, she had no idea how to contact him or where he lived. She had his name and the name of a neighboring town—Ubud. It was as good a place as any to start.

One saving grace was that Bali was a popular tourist destination. It’s a small island, and the people speak English well. For a Westerner with money, Bali was easy to travel through. Gilbert took a taxi to Ubud and found a small hotel for $10 a night.

Gilbert likened Ubud to a Sante Fe-type community with monkeys walking around. The town was surrounded by temples and known for its artistic and cultural traditions. There were shops and restaurants and a myriad of local custom classes for tourists. **If she never found the medicine man, she could sign up for batik, cooking, drumming, or dance class. There was even a meditation center across the street from the hotel. Things could be worse.**

Gilbert unpacked and decided to go exploring. She assumed it would take a few days or weeks to find the medicine man, so she wanted to become comfortable in her new town. The front desk attendant was a young man named Mario. Mario wasn’t his real name, but since the Balinese are named one of four names depending on their order of birth, a nickname was often necessary.

Mario chose his name because of his love for Italian culture. When Gilbert told him she’d recently been in Italy, he stopped what he was doing and sat down to hear all about it. Gilbert decided to see whether Mario might know the medicine man. At first, he didn’t recognize the name. But after she wrote Ketut Liyer on a piece of paper, his face lit up. He was very familiar with Ketut and offered to take her to him. That was how Gilbert found herself on the back of a motorbike flying through the countryside on her first day in Bali.

### Old Friends Reunited

Ketut’s compound was traditional for Balinese families. Stone walls, a courtyard, a temple, and various small homes scattered about. As soon as Gilbert and Mario entered the compound, they saw Ketut sitting on his front porch. Mario introduced her as a “girl from America,” to which Ketut reached out his hand and said it was nice to meet her. Gilbert was crushed.

She knew that 2 years was a long time to remember someone you met once. But **Ketut had been so influential in her life, she felt they had an unforgettable connection. She was heartbroken that he had no idea who she was.**

Like the first time, Ketut gave her a palm reading. She was relieved to see her prophesied future was more or less the same as before. Still, she didn’t come to him for another palm reading. She came to learn the secrets of Balinese meditation. So she decided to jog Ketut’s memory.

Gilbert reminded him that they’d met before. She told him she’d asked to find a way to be closer to God. She described the picture he’d drawn her in detail. She mentioned the name of the Yoga instructor who’d brought her there. She even reminded him of his prophecy that she would return to study with him and teach him English. All Ketut did was smile. He still didn’t remember.

Gilbert was about to give up. But she’d come too far. She tried one more time. She told him she was the writer from New York. Suddenly, all of his confusion disappeared. His eyes brightened. He remembered her. In fact, Ketut remembered her so well he almost danced a jig that she’d returned. He screamed, “YOU came BACK!” Gilbert cried with relief.

**Ketut explained that he didn’t recognize her because she looked like a different person.** She was a sad, ugly person before. But now, she was happy and beautiful. He remembered that she was in a bad divorce and had too much worry and sorrow. She was old then. He was so happy to see her looking young again.

The English lesson started immediately. He pulled out a series of letters from art collectors around the world, people who were fans of his drawings and paintings. She read each one to him, feeling purposeful and validated. Ketut then told her that he’d remarried. He was happy, but he was also drained of his spiritual light. Shortly after Gilbert’s first visit, there was a terrorist bombing. Western tourists stopped visiting Bali as a result, which meant they stopped visiting Ketut.

Before Gilbert left, he told her to come every day for their lessons. He said 3 months should be enough time to teach her everything he knew about reaching God through meditation. He also predicted that she would get married in Bali soon. It was a passing thought, and Gilbert didn’t pay it much attention. She promised to come.

### The Final Journey Begins

The next day, Gilbert bought a bicycle so she’d be able to ride to the compound on her own. **She didn’t know what to expect from her visits with Ketut, but she didn’t care.** She was just happy to have found him.

Gilbert arrived at the compound to find Ketut in session with a Balinese family. Their baby was teething and crying uncontrollably. Those kinds of visits made up most of Ketut’s business. He helped heal the sick and blessed marital unions and newborn babies. On any given day, he could have 100 visitors. He did this work for a fee, but he also did it for free. It was his duty as a healer to help whoever needed it.

Gilbert watched as Ketut prescribed a solution to rub on the baby’s gums and another to dispel the demon tormenting the child. He said a prayer over a bowl of water, infusing it with his mystical powers, and gave some to the baby to drink. He gave the rest of the water to the parents before they left. For his service, he received the equivalent of a quarter.

Ketut and Gilbert sat on his porch talking after the family was gone. A few more visitors came and went. Then, they were finally alone and able to start the lessons. His first lesson in Balinese meditation was simple—sit silently and smile.

Gilbert thought the task sounded too easy, but **after the difficulty she’d encountered during her Yoga meditation, she was ready for easy**. Ketut said she needed to smile with her face and mind to clear out the bad energy and bring in the good. He said to let the smile reach deep inside her and to stay relaxed. Being too serious about this practice could make her sick.

### A Brief History of Ketut Liyer

Gilbert learned about Ketut and how he became a medicine man. **Ketut was the ninth generation of medicine men in his family.** But when he was a young man, he didn’t want to be one. He didn’t want to study that hard and had dreams of being a painter.

A wealthy American commissioned a large painting from Ketut. The pay would be enough to lift Ketut out of poverty. He worked day and night on the painting, often by oil lamp. During one night session, the oil lamp exploded and started a fire. Ketut burned his arm and developed an infection. The doctors wanted to amputate the arm to save his life. Before the procedure, Ketut went back home for a night.

That night, Ketut had a dream. His father and ancestors spoke to him through this dream and gave him the remedy for his arm. The remedy worked and healed his arm completely. That experience helped him realize the power of medicine men. He started his studies and became the man Gilbert knew. He still painted, but only in his spare time or as a remedy for his patients.

Gilbert doesn’t know how old Ketut is. Neither does Ketut. He thought he was maybe 65, but he wasn’t sure. He mentioned being an adult during WWII, and he said he burned his arm sometime around 1920. Gilbert reasoned he was somewhere between 65 and 105 years old.

Gilbert saw Ketut as an eccentric old king. He ate one modest meal and drank one cup of coffee with sugar a day. He exuded patience and calm, which seemed to linger throughout the compound. None of the people Gilbert witnessed waiting to see him showed any signs of despair regardless of how long they had to wait, not even the children.

Gilbert wasn’t sure how she fit into this man’s life. She wasn’t helping him with his English that much, and she felt guilty for taking up his time after a long day of healing people. But **she soon realized he liked having her around as company**. He’d never left Bali and rarely left his compound. Gilbert’s stories of her travels and the state of the world fascinated him.

### A Home Away From Home

**Gilbert’s time in Bali was one of complete freedom and leisure.** She practiced Yogic meditation in the mornings and Balinese meditation at night. In between, she rode her bike around town and into the hills and rice fields. She went to the library and read about the Balinese culture. She spent hours in the hotel garden soaking up the beauty around her.

On one of her bike rides, Gilbert found a sign advertising an artist’s retreat. **The retreat was a stand-alone home in the country owned by an Englishwoman, and Gilbert moved in after 3 days.** The cottage was peaceful and gorgeous. It had a bright red kitchen, a terrace, an outdoor shower, a garden, and fruit trees in the yard. It was her very own Eden.

The caretaker of the property was a 27-year-old Indonesian man named Yudhi (pronounced _You-Day_). He wasn’t Balinese. He was from Java and a Christian, not Muslim like most Indonesians. He was a talented musician and spoke perfect English. He’d lived in Brooklyn for almost a decade and thought New York City was a place of pure love.

Yudhi married a woman from Connecticut, and they lived happily with an eclectic group of friends. But after 9/11, the Patriot Act required all people from Muslim countries to register. He and his wife thought he’d be fine, since they were married. But when they went in for the interview, Yudhi was deported. He and his wife still communicated through email, but the marriage was suffering. There was no indication of whether he’d be able to return to America.

**Gilbert often invited Yudhi to her cottage, and they drank beer and discussed their favorite places in New York.** He played guitar, and she thought he was the most talented musician she’d ever heard. She wished there was a world in which he could be famous.

### A New Path Emerges

Ketut taught Gilbert that each person was born both a demon and god inside. Whether or not they turned toward the darkness or light was an individual decision, but all had the capacity for either. He said the purpose of meditation was to find a harmonious balance that led to happiness.

After a few weeks, Ketut taught her the Four Brothers Meditation. **The Balinese believed that everyone was born with four brothers who protected them throughout life.** The brothers symbolize strength, knowledge, friendship, and language. You could call upon these brothers at any time for assistance. They even protected you in your dreams.

Gilbert told Ketut about a recurring nightmare that often hindered sleep. In this nightmare, a man stood by her bed with a knife. Ketut explained that the man was probably the brother of strength. He was likely fighting off demons, which was why she became aware of him. He told her not to be afraid and to sleep in peace. He also said most people don’t ever see their brothers, so she was lucky.

Gilbert liked the idea of the four brothers. She also liked the name she was meant to use when she spoke to them. She was to introduce herself as _Lagoh Prano_ , which meant “Happy Body.”

Gilbert started talking to her brothers and asked for their protection. She was surprised, then, when she was hit by a bus on her bike. Her injuries were minor, and her bike was fairly unscathed. But she had a nasty cut on her knee that became infected.

Another surprise was Ketut’s reaction when she showed him her injury. Instead of offering to heal her, he suggested she see a doctor. She thought maybe he didn’t treat Westerners. But **in hindsight, she wondered if he and the brothers didn’t know what they were doing after all**. The doctor she found to help her changed her life in ways she never saw coming.

### Destiny Steps In

Wayan Nuriyasih was another Balinese healer. She worked out of a small shop in the center of Ubud that doubled as a restaurant. She was an attractive woman with long dark hair. Gilbert had passed the shop every day on her way to Ketut’s, but she never stopped until that day. She showed Wayan her knee, and the medicine woman went to work.

Wayan made Gilbert a tea of herbs and placed a green goo and leaves on her wound. Gilbert’s pain lessened instantly. Wayan spoke excellent English, and she and Gilbert struck up a conversation. **Gilbert was surprised to learn that Wayan was also divorced.** Divorce in Balinese culture was considered very distressing. The women found common ground, and Wayan told Gilbert her story.

Wayan had been married to an abusive alcoholic who beat her severely. If not for her healing powers, she likely would have suffered permanent physical damage. When she miscarried her second child after a beating, she left him. In Balinese customs, all generations of families live in compounds, like Ketut’s. If you divorce, you must leave the compound and are set adrift with no resources or connections. If you are a woman, you automatically lose custody of your children.

Wayan sold all her possessions and used her savings to hire a lawyer. After two years of fighting, she was granted custody of her small daughter, Tutti. The two moved often to search for new business, but they were happy to be together.

Gilbert fell in love with both Wayan and 8-year-old Tutti right away. **She felt a strong powerful sensation from Wayan that infected her own energy.** She changed her daily routine to now include visits with Wayan. Wayan was sassy and quick-witted, and she could tell Gilbert hadn’t had sex in a long time. She said she would go to the temple and pray for Gilbert to find a lover.

### Just Like Old Times

Gilbert had come to Indonesia to find balance in her life, which she had asked for two years ago. With her life now structured around meditation and connecting with wonderful and powerful people, she felt accomplished. She’d found balance and was no longer seeking anything. During that time, her prayers mostly expressed gratitude for the peace she’d found.

Her lessons in India taught her that happiness was not an accident. It was the result of diligence in seeking joy and harmony. You had to work every day to maintain happiness and pray while happy to cement it in your soul. **This understanding was likely what led Gilbert to open her life to further joy after meeting a woman named Armenia in Wayan’s shop.**

Armenia was a Brazilian expat, physically striking, and empirically sexy. After joining Gilbert and Wayan in conversation one day, Armenia invited Gilbert to a party at another Brazilian’s house. There would be expats from around the world in attendance. Gilbert jumped at the chance.

Gilbert hadn’t worn anything but jeans or Yoga attire in a long time. She dug out the one dress she’d packed, put on lipstick, and borrowed jewelry and perfume from Armenia. The ritual of dressing up felt strange and new. She felt like a real woman again.

The party was wonderful, with wonderful food made by Felipe, the Brazillian host. Gilbert got tipsy quickly after months of clean living. She was surprised to see that she could still flirt or even wanted to. She thought Felipe was handsome and interesting and flirted with him throughout the night. She was surprised by her forwardness, but it felt good, too.

After the party, everyone went dancing at a local nightclub. There was a reggae band and people of all ages from all over the world. Gilbert let loose on the dance floor. She realized she hadn’t danced since she was _happily_ married.

Gilbert stuck close to Felipe all night, but then she met Ian, and her focus shifted. Ian was Welsh, tall, attractive, and intelligent. They talked and laughed until almost 4 am. Gilbert knew she liked him in a way she hadn’t liked anyone since before David. But when it was time to leave, they didn’t exchange contact information. Ian said they would meet again when the gods saw fit to make it happen.

**Gilbert couldn’t believe she’d met a man she actually liked.** Even more, she couldn’t believe she was up at dawn for something other than meditation. She was still flying high when Felipe drove her home. He said he could tell she was going to have a wonderful time in Bali. Gilbert made a joke about owning only one dress, but Felipe laughed. She was young and beautiful, he said. Another dress wasn’t required.

Gilbert woke up the next day missing the clarity she usually had after morning meditation. She was too restless to meditate, figuratively and literally. Why was she feeling this way? She’d had fun. Met nice people. Flirted with a few men—she stopped on that word. That was it. The reintroduction of men to her life agitated her.

**She worried that opening her life to a man again might make her lose control.** She didn’t want her journey, life, or work to be disrupted. But she also thought about how nice it might be to experience romance again. And just like that, thoughts of her heartbreak over David flooded her. She wondered if she should call him and try to reconcile. Then came thoughts about her divorce, and down the rabbit hole she fell. She was only able to stop the mudslide of regret when she thought about what Felipe had said. She was young and should be having fun. But she no longer knew how.
