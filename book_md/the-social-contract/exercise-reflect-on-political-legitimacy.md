## Exercise: Reflect on Political Legitimacy

Reflect on how you agree or disagree with Rousseau’s views on the source of political legitimacy by considering your own state.

* * *

Do you think you have an ethical obligation to obey the laws of your state? Why or why not?

Do you think the state (country) you live in pursues the common good for its citizens? Why or why not?

Based on your answers to the above questions, where do you agree with Rousseau’s views on political legitimacy (that is, that political legitimacy comes from the will of the people)? Where do you disagree with Rousseau’s views? Explain your answer.
