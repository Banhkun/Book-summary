## 1-Page Summary

Stories are mysterious—like music, they have an emotional power over us that’s impossible to explain. However, screenwriter and storytelling expert Robert McKee argues that stories’ emotional power is not only explainable but also something you can learn to create. In _Story_ , McKee breaks down how stories function and uses this theory to explain how you can write a gripping story.

McKee began teaching story in a class at the University of California and has since become one of the most sought-after lecturers on the topic of story. McKee writes _Story_ as a guide for screenwriters, but his fundamental principles apply to any kind of storytelling.

In this guide, we’ll begin by defining what characterizes a “good” story and explaining how a theoretical understanding of storytelling helps you write better stories. Then, we’ll dive into story theory, detailing the ingredients needed to write a meaningful story and intensify its emotional impact. Next, we’ll explain story structure, describing the pattern that all well-written stories follow. Finally, we’ll outline the ideal writing process, explaining the specific way to write an excellent story.

In our commentary, we’ll provide background from earlier works that likely inspired _Story_ , such as Joseph Campbell’s _The Hero With a Thousand Faces_. We’ll also supplement McKee’s writing advice with tips from other popular books, such as Stephen King’s _On Writing_ and Blake Snyder’s _Save the Cat!_

### What Makes a Story “Good”?

Before explaining how to write a good story, let's define what makes a story “good.” Humans are drawn to stories, whether we hear them from our friends, movies, books, TV shows, plays, or any number of other mediums. But what makes a good story so compelling?

McKee argues that, contrary to popular belief, we don’t seek out stories primarily as a way to escape our boring or unpleasant reality. Rather, we’re obsessed with stories because they fill a core human need: **We need to find _meaning_ , truth about the world that influences how we live our lives. **When we encounter new meaning, it’s an intense, emotionally satisfying experience, and it’s a craving for this experience that motivates us to seek stories. The best stories are rich in meaning.

(Shortform note: In _Man’s Search for Meaning_ , psychiatrist Viktor Frankl takes this idea further, arguing that meaning is more than a core human need—it’s the strongest motivating force in life for everyone. People who feel like they’re doing something important in life are happier, are healthier, and can endure any amount of suffering, as long as they believe that pain is serving a greater purpose. Frankl explains that anything you find important can fill this need for meaning. With this in mind, we can see stories as tools that humans use to create meaningful lives. Truths told to us through stories help us identify what matters to us, making our subsequent actions feel more meaningful.)

Since stories are meant to fill the human need for meaning, McKee asserts that good stories are always _true to life_. This doesn’t mean that good stories have to be something that could realistically occur—rather, **every detail in a good story reflects life as it truly is.** For example, even though Pixar’s _Finding Nemo_ is about a talking clownfish, it’s true to life in the way it reflects how a father traumatized by the death of his wife would truly react if his son were kidnapped. If, instead, the clownfish Marlin were to flippantly laugh about losing his son (perhaps a screenwriter’s attempt at a joke) the story would no longer be true to life (and therefore wouldn't be a "good" story).

McKee explains that even stories that are totally detached from reality convey truth about life. For example, a surrealist film in which characters change form and random events occur may convey that life is fundamentally absurd and has no unifying meaning—yet this in itself is still a truth about life.

> **Nietzsche’s Argument for Subjective Truth in Art**
> 
> German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche disagrees with McKee’s assumptions here, arguing in multiple books that it’s impossible to accurately understand and express truth. Instead, art is valuable because it creates the illusion of expressing truth—the illusion that life is ordered and meaningful when in reality it’s neither of these things.
> 
> However, despite disagreeing with McKee’s assumptions, Nietzsche would agree with his conclusion—that we should _attempt_ to create art that expresses a universal truth about life. Nietzsche argues that as long as your art creates the comforting, subjective illusion of truth, it’s a worthwhile, meaningful pursuit. This is because the alternative—using pure rationality to discover meaning in life—is a depressing and ultimately fruitless endeavor.
> 
> Judging by this philosophy, it’s possible that, ironically, Nietzsche may have preferred _Finding Nemo_ to a surrealistic, nihilistic art house film. If the surrealist film represents (in Nietzsche’s view) a more rational yet pessimistic attitude toward life, it may have less existential utility than the more superficially meaningful Pixar film.

#### The Purpose of Story Theory

McKee argues that writers must learn _story theory_ : what elements of a story make it meaningful and why. These aren’t rules dictating what you can and can’t write—rather, **they’re an explanation of what elements in a story give the audience meaning and how they do so.**

According to McKee, an understanding of story theory helps you write good stories in two ways. First, it clarifies the ideal writing process (which we’ll cover at the end of this guide). When you have a process you can trust, you’re free to let your imagination run wild in the world of the story instead of constantly worrying about whether you’re “doing it right.” Second, story theory is necessary to understand how a story functions after you’ve written it. In this way, it helps you diagnose which parts of your story work and which you need to revise.

(Shortform note: These two benefits of story theory have one thing in common—they encourage you to write without judging what you’re writing as right or wrong. However, many writers try to use story theory to achieve the opposite: To determine what the “right” story events are while they’re writing. This often involves rigid story formulas and results in stories that feel mechanical and fail to reflect life as it is. For example, a writer might misuse story theory by thinking, “I need an Act One climax on page 30 of my script. What crazy thing could happen then?” Take care not to think in terms of abstract story principles while you’re writing—only while you’re revising.)

Now that we’ve established why it’s important to build a theoretical understanding of story, let’s dive into the theory itself.

### How Story Creates Emotion and Meaning

We’ve established that the purpose of story is to give the audience the satisfying feeling of discovering meaning about the world. But how exactly does a story accomplish this?

According to McKee, **to engage an audience’s sense of meaning, a story needs three things** :

  1. An active protagonist to empathize with
  2. Constant subversion of expectation
  3. Positive or negative change



Let’s inspect each of these components in turn.

#### Ingredient #1: An Active Protagonist to Empathize With

First, McKee asserts that **the audience needs at least one protagonist to identify with.** When you show the audience that your protagonist has the same universal human desires as they do, they’ll empathize with that character—that is, they’ll recognize themselves in that character and feel emotionally invested in that character’s fate. Additionally, this protagonist must constantly take action toward a goal, as this is necessary to engage the audience (as we’ll see next).

(Shortform note: It’s not just enjoyable to empathize with fictional characters—it’s good for us. Research has shown that stories can strengthen our ability to empathize with others in our lives. In particular, books that involve complex, multidimensional characters strengthen our ability to empathize, since they add depth to our flat, superficial understandings of the many strangers in our lives. While most of this research is focused on the empathy-strengthening effects of literary fiction, studies have shown that movies can promote empathetic behavior, too.)

#### Ingredient #2: Constant Subversion of Expectation

The second main ingredient in story is the _subversion of expectation_. This ingredient is extremely important—McKee maintains that it’s the source of all energy in a story.

We’ve established that stories need an active protagonist who constantly makes progress toward a goal. However, if events transpire exactly as the protagonist expects, they would simply achieve that goal, and you wouldn’t have a story. Therefore, **the most basic unit of storytelling is: The protagonist takes a single action toward a goal, and the world reacts in a way the protagonist doesn’t expect** , complicating the protagonist’s plan to achieve their goal. This pair of action and reaction is called a _beat_.

For example, here’s a beat from _Finding Nemo_ : As Marlin watches his son Nemo swim out into dangerous open waters, he yells, “You’re going to get stuck out there!” in an attempt to scare Nemo back to safety. Angered by his father implying that he’s weak, and determined to prove him wrong, Nemo swims farther out into more dangerous waters. Marlin’s _action_ provokes an unexpected _reaction_ from Nemo, introducing new complications between Marlin and his goal.

(Shortform note: The idea of story beats is common among screenwriters, although McKee uses this word in a more specific sense than most. Most screenwriters use beat as a general term to mean “something that happens in your story.” Arguably the most popular use of the word beat comes from Blake Snyder’s screenwriting guide _Save the Cat!_ , which contends that all successful stories follow the same 15 beats. Snyder recommends the use of a “beat sheet” to outline your screenplay, which specifies what events need to happen in your script and what page they should happen on.)

##### How Subversion of Expectation Impacts the Audience

McKee asserts that **beats of action and unexpected reaction need to occur constantly throughout your story** because they engage your audience on both an intellectual and emotional level.

**On an intellectual level, subversion of expectation piques the audience’s _curiosity_**. For the majority of beats, the audience and protagonist both have their expectations subverted at the same time, says McKee.**** Unless the writer has given the audience information that the protagonist doesn’t know (a technique called dramatic irony), each turn of events will surprise the audience just as much as the characters. Thus, since what the audience expected to happen didn’t happen, each beat draws them further into the story as they wonder what’s going to happen next.

McKee explains that **subversion of expectation also engages the audience intellectually by giving them _insight_** : They realize something about the protagonist’s world that they didn’t know before. To make sense of this surprising information, they think back to what the storyteller has already told them and integrate everything into one cohesive understanding of the world. This worldview revision satisfies the audience on an intellectual level—it feels like they’re solving the puzzle that the writer has laid for them.

For example, when Nemo swims farther out to sea, the audience immediately tries to make sense of it by reflecting on what they’ve already seen and thinking, “Oh, it makes sense that Nemo is rebelling. From what I’ve seen of him, it’s clear that he resents his father’s overprotectiveness.” Connecting these logical dots is satisfying.

**On an emotional level, a beat of action and unexpected reaction impacts the audience because of their empathy for the protagonist** , McKee explains. When something unexpected happens to the protagonist, they’ll have some kind of emotional reaction, and the audience will feel it just as they do.

> **When Surprising Beats Ruin Your Story**
> 
> Although surprising beats spark your audience’s curiosity, you shouldn’t try to make your story the _most_ unpredictable it can be at all times. Plot twists that invalidate the facts you gave the audience earlier in the story are by nature unpredictable, but they cheapen the meaning of the story so far and make the audience feel unfairly manipulated. For example, a movie that ends with the revelation that the entire story was a drug-induced hallucination could be disappointing to the audience.
> 
> Bad plot twists hurt even more if they spoil the emotional bond audiences have with characters. For example, often, writers try to surprise the audience by having characters reveal false identities or hidden motivations. If these new character traits contradict the character the audience has been bonding with for the entire story in an unrealistic way, the audience will be even more upset.
> 
> Furthermore, some degree of predictability in your story can be a good thing. Although all compelling stories involve the subversion of expectation, the surprise itself isn’t entirely what makes a story compelling. As we’ve established, surprise is also satisfying because it gives the audience insight, revealing information that makes the story’s “big picture” more complex and interesting.
> 
> Research validates this idea. One study shows that readers enjoy stories more when they already know what’s going to happen in them. Experiencing a story while knowing its twists doesn’t spoil anything because this foreknowledge helps you see the big picture and appreciate the story as a whole _while watching_ , which can be more enjoyable than piecing the story together through insight and reflection.
> 
> The fact that stories are compelling even if you know what’s going to happen enables writers to use dramatic irony. Writers intentionally reveal information that’s unknown to the characters to achieve a number of different effects—for example, when the climactic murder of Lester Burnham in _American Beauty_ is revealed at the beginning of the film, it makes the audience more likely to empathize with the character, who is initially very unsympathetic.

#### Ingredient #3: Positive or Negative Change

Finally, the third main ingredient in an engaging story is positive or negative _change_. It’s not enough for a beat to be surprising, it also has to be _meaningful._ That is, it must feel like it reveals truth about life. Mckee asserts that **you create meaning by injecting change—whether positive or negative—into the events of your story.** When a protagonist’s action causes their life to change, the writer is saying, “When someone does _this_ , it will cause _that_ to happen.” This is the story’s meaning.

With this in mind, McKee argues that every beat in your story must lead toward some kind of change—otherwise, the beat is meaningless. For example, if the aforementioned beat from _Finding Nemo_ resulted in Nemo returning safely, and the characters’ lives returned to normal, that beat would serve no purpose in the film. However, because Nemo is kidnapped, creating a devastating change in Marlin’s life, the story offers a meaningful truth: “When parents use fear to keep their children safe, they sometimes end up pushing them into more danger.”

McKee defines positive and negative change in terms of _universal human values_. These are states of being that you can gain or lose, such as love, safety, or social status. **Value changes control your audience’s emotional response** : Positive changes cause the audience to feel good for your protagonist, and negative changes cause them to feel bad for your protagonist. For example, a character whose romantic partner leaves them experiences a negative value change (the loss of love) and the audience feels bad. Anything you can imagine caring about reflects a universal human value of some kind.

Additionally, for a value change in your protagonist’s life to be meaningful, McKee explains that **the change must occur _because of your protagonist’s actions_.** A few random events that change your character’s life are fine to include in your story, but they don’t create meaning on their own. To communicate the kind of meaning that resonates with audiences on an intellectual and emotional level, writers must show the cause and effect of their protagonist’s choices.

> **The Hero’s Journey: Finding Meaning Through Transformation**
> 
> While formulating these ideas, McKee was likely inspired by Joseph Campbell, author of _The Hero With a Thousand Faces_ , whose ideas still circulate widely among screenwriters today. Campbell is most famous for popularizing the “Hero’s Journey,” a universal story structure that he asserts is consistent across ancient myths from cultures around the world.
> 
> In _The Hero With a Thousand Faces_ ,__ Campbell argues that myth-making is a universal phenomenon because myths give people meaning that helps us understand how to navigate life and are thus useful for every culture. **Like McKee, Campbell notes that _personally creating change_ is at the core of meaningful myths.** In the Hero’s Journey, a hero departs into unknown territory, overcomes obstacles to achieve personal transformation, then returns and shares that change with the world they came from.
> 
> Rather than discussing change in terms of multiple universal human values, as McKee does, Campbell frames the Hero’s Journey as a quest for a _single_ universal value: _enlightenment, or the “ultimate boon.”_ This is a spiritual condition in which the hero sees through the world’s illusions and becomes godlike, perfecting their moral character and gaining the power to achieve any goal.
> 
> Arguably, McKee’s universal human values serve as more tangible, relatable representations of this ultimate boon of enlightenment. You could call any positive value change a “step closer to enlightenment,” since enlightenment is a state of perfection. And since the audience directly encounters these specific positive values in their own lives, they’re more emotionally impactful than stories in which characters literally achieve enlightenment. In this way, modern stories are all more approachable versions of the same ancient myth.

##### Every Scene Ends With a Value Change

A series of beats in which a protagonist’s actions eventually cause one or more significant values to change is what McKee calls a _scene_. **The scene is the smallest unit of storytelling that feels like a complete story**. In _Finding Nemo_ , one scene would be the events in which Marlin finds Nemo on his class trip, accidentally goads Nemo into swimming out to sea, and fails to save Nemo from being captured by a scuba diver. The value change of Marlin losing his son marks the end of the scene.

> **Alternatively, Pair Scenes With Sequels**
> 
> As with beats, writers disagree on an exact definition of the word scene. One common and potentially useful definition comes from _Techniques of the Selling Writer_ by Dwight V. Swain. What Swain calls a scene is closer to what Mckee calls a beat—a protagonist has a goal, an obstacle arises, and something happens to prevent the protagonist from achieving their goal. However, Swain includes an idea that McKee doesn’t, arguing that every scene must be followed by a _sequel_ —the protagonist has an emotional reaction to their new obstacle, contemplates their new situation, then decides on their next action.
> 
> While McKee does acknowledge the importance of having your characters react to unexpected obstacles, he doesn’t frame these sequels as an equally important counterpart to scenes themselves, as Swain does. That said, thinking of your story in terms of sequels may help you remember to spend more time on your characters’ thoughts and emotions. If written well, sequels like this help your audience better empathize with your protagonist (the first story ingredient), increasing your story’s emotional impact.

### How to Intensify Your Story’s Meaning

We’ve defined the specific storytelling structure that gives any given event in your story meaning and emotion for your audience: A protagonist pursues a goal, encounters a series of unexpected obstacles, and causes their life to change. However, to increase the meaning and emotional impact of your story, McKee argues that you need to include two additional ingredients:

  1. Escalating risk
  2. Thematic coherence



Let’s discuss how to use each of these intensifiers to heighten your story’s meaning.

#### Intensifier #1: Escalating Risk

To heighten the meaningful impact of your story, McKee explains that **you must force your protagonist to _risk losing what they care about most_** in the pursuit of a valuable goal**.** Why? In life, we judge how valuable something is by how much we’re willing to risk or sacrifice for it. Thus, creating a protagonist who’s willing to risk everything they care about is the most direct way to make an audience feel like the protagonist’s actions are important and meaningful. In contrast, if your protagonist has nothing to lose, the story will feel boring and inconsequential.

(Shortform note: In _Skin in the Game_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb flips this idea, arguing that if you _aren’t_ willing to risk something important in the pursuit of something valuable, you don’t actually value it, no matter what you claim. Taleb uses this idea to criticize those who claim to care about others solely to profit from a “virtuous” public image, for instance, a politician who claims to support egalitarian ideals to gain more political support.)

Furthermore, the pacing at which you escalate risk in your story is important: **To make a story continuously interesting, you must incrementally heighten your protagonist’s risk over the course of the story,** explains McKee. If the protagonist undertakes the same kinds of actions they took earlier in the story, the audience knows to expect the same kinds of results, and they’ll get bored. Instead, if you force your protagonist to take progressively riskier and more extreme actions, the audience knows that these actions will have new, interesting consequences, and they’ll be captivated.

(Shortform note: One easy strategy to naturally escalate risk in your story is to establish a ticking clock—a time limit that threatens specific consequences if your protagonist can’t accomplish their goal quickly enough. Screenwriters often include ticking clocks; for example, in _The Matrix_ , Neo must rescue Morpheus in the simulation before Sentinels find and kill his body in the real world. With a ticking clock, your protagonist will believably take progressively riskier actions as they run out of time and become increasingly desperate.)

##### Story Beats Naturally Escalate Risk

McKee notes that the need for escalating risk is another reason why the beat is the basic unit of storytelling. **When a protagonist’s action meets an unexpected reaction, it can escalate the risk of the protagonist’s actions in a believable way.** It’s a fact of human nature that we want to claim our desires with as little risk or effort as possible. However, when the easiest, most obvious way for a protagonist to reach their goal doesn’t work, they must then try a more effortful, riskier action if they still want to reach it. After this happens enough times in a row, you’ll have believably built a story with high stakes.

For example, imagine a protagonist sees a child standing in the middle of a dangerous intersection. The protagonist yells at the child to get them to safety, but the child ignores them. This unexpected reaction forces the protagonist to take a riskier action—jump into the street and pull the child to safety.

> **Escalate Risk With a Character Arc**
> 
> If you’ve used beats to slowly escalate the stakes of your story, but it still doesn’t feel like your protagonist has enough at risk, it may be because _their goal isn’t important enough_ for them to believably risk everything to accomplish. If this is the case, you may need to switch your protagonist’s goal to something more important partway through the story.
> 
> This ties into the idea of a character arc—when the events of your story fundamentally change your protagonist. In many stories, the protagonist realizes that the goal they had at the beginning of the story is less important than they believed it to be, and they start pursuing a new goal that fulfills them more deeply. Then, they’re willing to sacrifice more to achieve this new goal, raising the story’s stakes. For example, in _Mad Max: Fury Road_ , Max initially just wants to escape from slavery, but by the end of the story, he’s willing to risk death to save the lives of those he’s been traveling with.
> 
> McKee would likely argue that story beats that subvert expectations are the way to accomplish this kind of character transformation. By default, no one wants to change. However, because unexpected story beats cause the protagonist to learn more about the world than they knew before, you can use them to show your protagonist the truths necessary to spark their character change.

#### Intensifier #2: Thematic Coherence

In addition to escalating risk, for a story to have the most meaningful impact possible on an audience, **it must feel like every part of the story is conveying the same meaning.** This meaning is your story’s _theme_ , which McKee calls a “controlling idea.” Although some may assume that constraining your story with a single theme limits its meaning, McKee insists that focusing on one central theme gives the audience a multitude of implications to consider. In contrast, trying to include multiple main ideas will muddle your story and hinder the audience in finding meaning.

(Shortform note: McKee advocates constructing your story around a theme to maximize the chance that the audience will find your story meaningful. However, your audience may interpret the theme differently than you intended. Many believe that a text’s inherent meaning overrides any intention on the author’s part, a theoretical framework known as anti-intentionalism. When you release a story into the world, you must accept the fact that it no longer fully belongs to you—audiences may use it to convey their own messages. That said, tightly structuring your story around a single idea as McKee suggests will arguably make it more difficult for audiences to misinterpret your intended theme.)

According to McKee, **a theme is always a specific, truthful statement about the world that expresses cause and effect.** This cause and effect will typically be the final value change of your story and the reason for that change. For example, the theme of _Finding Nemo_ could be expressed as “Children live fulfilling lives when parents allow them to take risks.”

(Shortform note: McKee’s definition of theme is arguably more useful to writers than more common, broader definitions of theme. Vague, one-word themes like “family” may cause you to write a story that _you think_ is thematically cohesive, but in reality isn’t saying anything concrete. For example, if you’re trying to write a story about “family,” you might write a scene about a family reunion and another about the birth of a child, but they don’t have anything to do with each other on a deeper level. In contrast, if your theme is “You achieve personal fulfillment when you make sacrifices for family,” you can immediately spot whether these two scenes are conveying the same cohesive meaning.)

##### All Value Changes Reflect Theme

How do you connect every scene in your story to a cohesive theme? Recall that to create meaning, every scene in your story ends with a value change of some kind. McKee explains that to create thematic coherence, **every scene’s climactic value change should either prove the truth of your theme, or the _opposite_ of your theme, **which we’ll call the anti-theme.

Furthermore, McKee claims that your story should alternate between the two, so it seems to prove one idea, then its opposite, over and over until the climax, in which the theme definitively triumphs over the anti-theme. This uncertain tension between two contradictory ideas reflects the complexity of life in a far more believable, meaningful way than if you were to make every scene in your story prove the same point. This allows your story to convey a specific message without ever explicitly telling it to the audience.

For example, if the theme of _Finding Nemo_ is “Children live fulfilling lives when parents allow them to take risks,” its anti-theme is equally present throughout the film: “Children irreversibly hurt themselves when parents are careless enough to put them in danger.” This is most obvious in the Act One climax, when Nemo is abducted, but it’s equally present every time obstacles arise between Marlin and Nemo. Scenes that make it seem like Marlin won’t be able to find Nemo serve as proof that Marlin should have been _more_ protective of his son in the first place.

> **McKee’s Thematic Structure Is Dialectic**
> 
> McKee’s concept of thematic storytelling is a form of _dialectic_ —a pattern of reasoning with roots in ancient Greek philosophy. Persuasive writing, a group discussion, or a constructive debate are all expressible in dialectic form.
> 
> To present an idea as dialectic, you first establish a _thesis_ —this is the popular opinion or basic assumption that most people have. Then, you challenge the thesis with an _antithesis—_ one or more facts that contradict the thesis. Finally, you conclude with a _synthesis_ —a new declaration of truth that takes the facts of both thesis and antithesis into account and resolves any contradictions. (In longer or more complex dialectic, you then challenge the synthesis with an additional antithesis and resolve that logic into a new synthesis until you’ve said everything you need to say.)
> 
> Because it’s a balanced, fair-minded dialogue, dialectic is a persuasive way to present any idea—which explains why McKee uses it as a powerful tool to express your story’s theme. However, this understanding of dialectic arguably contradicts one of McKee’s conclusions. If stories are dialectic, the theme revealed at your story’s climax will be a synthesis—rather than a theme triumphing over anti-theme, you’re left with a complex view of life arguing that both theme and anti-theme are true to a certain extent.

### How to Structure a Story

We’ve established how stories generate meaning as well as what devices heighten that meaning (escalating risk and coherent theme). McKee argues that because they must include all these ingredients, all the most impactful stories follow a consistent pattern, or _story structure_.

#### The Key Parts of a Story: Climax and Inciting Incident

McKee argues that **the most important scene in all stories is the _climax_ : the final, most extreme, and irreversible change in your story.** The climax of your story is the most meaningful scene and impacts the audience more intensely than any other scene because of the intensifiers we discussed in the previous section. The climax is where the protagonist risks the most and either succeeds or fails to achieve their goal. Additionally, the climax definitively “proves” your theme by revealing the ultimate consequences of all your protagonist’s actions.

To effectively create a meaningful climax, you also need to write a well-crafted _inciting incident_ : a scene early in the story that creates the first major change in your protagonist’s life. This major change throws the protagonist’s life into chaos and uncertainty, causing them to take action toward the goal they believe will give them a predictable, desirable, normal life. This is the goal the protagonist will be chasing for the entire story, until the climax.

In short, **your inciting incident raises the central question of your story, and the climax answers it.** These two events form the core of your story. The inciting incident of _Finding Nemo_ is when Nemo is kidnapped by a scuba diver, and the climax is when Marlin and Nemo are safely reunited.

> **Contrasting Western and Eastern Story Structures**
> 
> Although McKee frames this story structure as universal, some argue that this structure is primarily a Western one, with roots in ancient Greece. For instance, many stories in China, Korea, and Japan follow a four-act structure called Kishōtenketsu, and they don’t include an inciting incident or climax as we typically think of them. You may be familiar with Kishōtenketsu from the anime films of Studio Ghibli, such as _Spirited Away_ and _My Neighbor Totoro_ , which typically follow this structure.
> 
> The focus of Kishōtenketsu stories is _internal growth_ rather than external conflict. They often depict an ordinary time in their characters’ lives rather than a dramatic, life-changing turn of events. Thus, they don’t need an inciting incident that radically upsets the characters’ lives.
> 
> Similarly, there isn’t really a climax at the end of Kishōtenketsu stories. Although they sometimes end by resolving one of the characters’ main problems, this resolution is rarely intended to create a sense of closure or finality. Rather, it shows the audience the characters’ new normal—often the result of a subtle and incomplete character change—and hints at how their lives will continue from here on out.

#### Everything in Between: Scenes, Sequences, and Acts

McKee asserts that the parts of your story between the inciting incident and the climax follow a consistent pattern, too. This pattern builds on the means of creating meaning we’ve already discussed: In a scene, a protagonist pursues a goal, hits an obstacle that subverts their expectations, and causes something in their life to change. **To write a full story, repeat this pattern at a big-picture level.**

In other words, story is fractal: Just as beats build on one another to form a scene, McKee explains that scenes build on one another to form a _sequence_ , which ends with a more significant change in your protagonist’s life than any single scene. Likewise, a series of sequences that leads to an extreme change is what McKee calls an _act_ , and a very small handful of acts make up your whole _story_.

**This design ensures that every single beat is contributing toward several consequential value changes: the next scene climax, sequence climax, and act climax.** Therefore, every beat in every scene feels important, and your story’s beats feel progressively more important and meaningful as the sum of all your protagonist’s actions leads to bigger changes.

For example, Act Two of _Finding Nemo_ involves a scene in which Marlin befriends a fish named Dory, creating a positive value change (gaining an ally). This scene-level value change (among others) helps Marlin achieve a larger sequence-level value change where Dory helps Marlin learn the address of his son’s kidnapper (gaining direction). This sequence (among others) helps Marlin successfully reach the dentist’s office where Nemo is being kept—only for Marlin to discover that his son Nemo is dead (or so he thinks) in a negative Second Act climax. Every decision Marlin makes in Act Two has directly led to this climactic value change (losing family)—if Marlin hadn’t befriended Dory, he wouldn’t have arrived at the dentist’s office.

McKee asserts that **feature films need to have at least three acts to have the most meaningful impact on an audience** : three extreme changes that turn your protagonist’s world upside down. You can include more than three acts if you’d like, but including fewer than three acts makes a movie feel incomplete.

(Shortform note: Although McKee argues that your story can have as many acts as it needs, many argue that all effective stories are told in no more than three acts. This idea was popularized by Syd Field in his book _Screenplay_ , in which Field establishes the three acts of Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution. Aristotle also disagrees with McKee in _Poetics_ , in which he argues that stories should have just two acts—before and after a tragedy occurs.)

> **Shortcut: Remove Everything You Can**
> 
> McKee’s idea that every story beat should simultaneously contribute to several larger value changes may be more complex than it needs to be. There’s an easy way to tell if a story beat fails to fit into a larger structure—if you can remove a beat and the story still makes perfect sense, that beat doesn’t result in a change and thus isn’t contributing to the plot. This is because if a story beat causes a meaningful change, you’ll see that change later on in the story.
> 
> As long as you make sure your story has at least three significant, act-sized changes, and you’ve cut everything out of your story that doesn’t cause those changes, you’ll have a well-structured story. You can apply this same logic to scenes, sequences, and even entire acts, if necessary—remove anything that doesn’t contribute to a major change.

### How to Write a Story

Now that we’ve explained how stories function, let’s describe specifically how to write a story. McKee details what he believes to be the ideal writing process: Begin with an _outline_ , flesh it out into a _treatment_ , then polish it into a _final script_. McKee frames this as a process for screenwriters, but you could apply it to stories in any medium.

#### Step #1: Create an Outline

**McKee’s first step in writing a story is to create an outline:** a detailed description of every one of your story beats and value changes. This outline is solely a description of plot and intentionally lacks dialogue or screenplay-style description. Since you’re essentially writing your entire story in outline form, this step will take up the majority of your time.

McKee recommends outlining many more scenes than you end up using. The way to find the best ideas is to write as many of them as possible, then select the very best and throw the rest away.

(Shortform note: The reason that writing more scenes than you need gives you the best ideas is that judging your ideas as you write them inhibits the parts of your brain necessary for creativity. If you plan on only writing one scene, you’ll be constantly judging it to make sure it’s good. However, if you plan on writing more scenes than you need, you can focus on being creative and judge your ideas later.)

Keep writing compelling scenes, fleshing out the world of your story, until you find a climax that strikes you deeply on an emotional level. This climax will reveal to you what the theme of your story is: your story’s final change and the cause behind that change. Then, **you can start building your story backward.** Since every beat in your story should support the climax logically and thematically, the climax gives you the direction you need to start solidifying the scenes, sequences, and acts of your story.

Once you have a complete story, McKee recommends pitching it to a friend. Tell them the entire story, beat by beat. Keep fine-tuning your outline until you have a story that reliably delivers an emotional impact on your listeners. This way, you don’t waste time fleshing out a story that doesn’t work.

(Shortform note: In _On Writing_ , Stephen King recommends picking a single close friend or family member who will be the first to hear your story every time. According to King, when you imagine how this person will react to your story _while you’re writing_ , you’ll be more likely to write something that resonates with them.)

> **You May Want to Skip the Outline**
> 
> Contrary to McKee’s advice, many writers prefer to start the first draft of their stories without an outline. This is a process commonly known as “pantsing,” as in, “flying by the seat of your pants.” These writers find that they can discover better ideas by writing without knowing where the story is going. Moreover, they find that outlining their stories takes too much time up front and causes their stories to be more formulaic and predictable.
> 
> If “pantsing” feels more natural to you, or you’re having trouble establishing an outline, consider writing a full draft, then applying McKee’s story theory after the fact. Identify your existing story’s climax, theme, and act structure, then revise to ensure all these elements align in the next draft.

##### How to Write Compelling Scenes

We’ve covered what to do with scenes once you have them, but how do you come up with compelling scenes in the first place?

To create scenes that are true to life, you must create realistic beats. To do this, McKee recommends that you place your characters in a situation, then **dive deep into your imagination to discover what you believe each character would authentically be thinking and feeling in that situation.** Write down what action that character would honestly take.

Next, to make sure each beat advances your story, examine your scene objectively and **imagine what could realistically happen that is the _opposite of what your protagonist expects_.** Write this down, then return to the protagonist’s point of view and imagine their next move. Repeat until you reach a value change that marks the end of the scene. McKee asserts that this repeated oscillation between subjective and objective points of view is the key to writing compelling scenes.

> **McKee’s Process Fits the Way We Think**
> 
> McKee’s scene-writing process makes sense when you consider how our brains work. In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Barbara Oakley explains that throughout the day, your brain naturally switches between two modes of thinking: focused-mode thinking, when you concentrate on executing a logical task; and diffuse-mode thinking, when you relax and let your mind wander. Oakley claims that the most effective way to solve a problem is to alternate between these two modes, taking a break from an intense logical task whenever you feel like you’re getting stuck.
> 
> Arguably, McKee’s scene-writing process is effective in part because it forces you to constantly switch between these two modes of thought. It’s primarily a diffuse-mode activity—you imagine what it would feel like to be someone else and record whatever feels natural. Then, you switch to focused mode and determine what the next unexpected story beat could be. Because you’re constantly switching into diffuse mode, where it feels like there are no wrong answers, you’ll be less likely to feel stuck than if you were to constantly be racking your brain for the next logical plot event.

#### Step #2: Write a Treatment

McKee’s second step in writing a story is to turn your outline into a treatment: a more detailed description of each scene that takes care to outline both _text_ and _subtext_. That is, you not only write in extreme detail what happens in each scene but also what each character is thinking and feeling—what’s truly motivating them. **If you’re creating a story that’s true to life, this internal subtext will often contradict what the characters superficially appear to be doing.** To return to our example from _Finding Nemo_ , when Marlin shouts at Nemo, “You’re going to get stuck out there!” (text), he’s expressing, “I hope I can control Nemo by acting angry. I’m only doing this because I’m terrified something will happen to him” (subtext).

Because of this difference between text and subtext, you must write down both textual layers to ensure you fully understand what’s happening in your story in every scene. According to McKee, this is the purpose of a treatment.

(Shortform note: McKee recommends outlining your subtext as a diagnostic tool to ensure that everything in your scene is true to life. However, you can also intentionally inject subtext into a scene to make it more compelling, just by having your characters avoid saying what they really mean. Subtext makes a scene more compelling in two ways. First, it withholds information from the reader, generating curiosity. When the audience isn’t quite sure what your characters are really saying, it motivates them to look more deeply into your story. Second, subtext organically creates conflict. When characters avoid saying what they’re really feeling, it makes communication more difficult, which can escalate the tension in interpersonal relationships.)

#### Step #3: Finish Your Script

The last step in writing a story is to polish it into its final form, explains McKee. This is when you’ll add dialogue, scene description, and everything else that will end up in the final product. If you’ve extensively outlined your story’s plot and subtext in the previous two steps, writing dialogue will feel extremely easy and natural, since you deeply understand your characters as human beings.

(Shortform note: If dialogue still isn’t coming easily to you at this stage, there are many places you can look for inspiration. Pay closer attention to how the people you know in real life speak. Research specific dialects or technical jargon to give your characters a more authentic vocabulary. Study how the characters speak in your favorite stories.)

McKee notes that **any one of these three steps may require extensive revision.** You may fail to realize that your story doesn’t work until after you’re halfway through writing dialogue. In this case, McKee asserts that you must work up the courage to throw out anything that doesn’t work, no matter how much time you spent writing it. After you’ve done this, you’ll be left with a powerful, well-written story.

(Shortform note: This idea echoes the often-repeated writing advice to “kill your darlings”—in other words, revise any part of your story that doesn’t work for the audience, no matter how much you want to keep it in. If you’re struggling to work up the courage to cut a part of your story you’re in love with, try temporarily moving that passage aside (rather than cutting it). Knowing that you can always put the original passage back will often give you the peace of mind you need to write something new to replace it—which may be even better.)
