## Lesson 9: Inspire Others with Hope

Life is nothing without hope. In the face of life’s most difficult challenges, a little hope can go a long way in bringing people back from darkness. With hope, you can give even those suffering the most a reason to keep moving forward.

You and those around you will find yourselves stuck in the mud. You will feel exhausted and at the end of your rope. In these moments, sing loudly for all to hear. In other words, raise your voice during dark times to inspire those around you. **Be the one who makes a difference in someone else’s life by giving them hope for the future.** It only takes one person to show someone that tomorrow will come.

### The Backstory

Hell Week in SEALs training was the ultimate test of whether the trainees had what it took to be in the toughest branch of the military. For six days, cadets did not sleep, suffered constant harassment from the instructors, and moved through endless endurance activities. More cadets quit their training during this week than at any other moment. One of the most grueling activities of this week took place in the Tijuana mudflats.

After McRaven and his group arrived at the mudflats, they were ordered into the mud. They ran calisthenic drills and competed in races and other competitions. The mud was wet and cold, and moving through it was like running with anvils attached to your legs. After the drills, they had to sit in the mud until morning.

McRaven and the others were chest-deep in the mud their third night of Hell Week. The ocean breeze was cold and blowing hard. They were drenched, filthy, freezing, and bone tired. **With three more days of Hell Week left, many of the men started to lose their resolve.**

One of the instructors told the men they could come out of the mud and sit with the officers by a fire pit. They would be served coffee and chicken soup. They could relax for the night. The temptation was strong, but if you chose to quit, it meant quitting the SEALs.

A trainee next to McRaven started climbing out of the mud. McRaven tried to stop him, but the pull of warmth and rest was too strong. Then, out of nowhere, someone started singing. It was a common song, and soon each trainee joined in. The instructor tried to shut the singing down. He insulted the class leader for his conduct and threw out a slew of threats. But the men kept singing. The trainee who’d started to climb out resettled next to McRaven.

The instructor smiled and went back to the fire. The singing had brought the men together and given them hope. **If one of them could find the strength to sing during this horrendous moment, they could all find the same strength and survive the night.** And they did.

McRaven saw a similar effect at Dover Air Force Base years later. The worst day of casualties the American military suffered in the War on Terror took the lives of 38 SEALs and Army soldiers. All of the families were waiting for the arrival of the bodies, and the atmosphere was grim. McRaven had attended many fallen warrior ceremonies, but he still felt incompetent in assuaging the family members’ suffering.

On this day, he watched as one man, Marine Lieutenant General John Kelly, made his way from family to family. Whatever he said to them had a profound effect on the family members, and McRaven saw hope return to their faces.

Kelly had lost his own son in the war years before. He and his family struggled with their grief, but they were able to make it through. His words to the families that day were words of encouragement and strength. **He showed these families that surviving this tragedy was possible. He gave them hope for a better tomorrow.**
