## Lesson 4: A Setback Is Only Permanent if You Let It Be

When things don’t go your way or you suffer a setback, you may want to blame external sources. It’s easier to assume the world is against you than it is to admit that sometimes life just isn’t fair. You may even look back over your past and find fault with your upbringing, your lot in life, or your lack of opportunities as the culprits for your current disappointment. But at the end of the day, you are the only person responsible for determining your fate.

Many great historical figures overcame adversity to reach great heights, such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., and Stephen Hawking. Like these people, you must accept that sometimes, even if you try your best and have all the skill and talent in the world, you will face challenges. **You must face these challenges with the same determination you bring to your successes.** Don’t complain and fall back on misfortune as an excuse for why you can’t be happy. Take the hits and move forward in whatever way you can.

### The Backstory

SEAL Lieutenant Martin, known as Moki, was one of the instructors during McRaven’s SEAL training. Moki was a decorated and highly respected officer. He was skilled in combat and had survived Vietnam. He was a competitive triathlete and could out-perform any competitor.

McRaven remembered a morning when he and his fellow cadets were running sand dunes. They were dressed in full fatigues and had to jump into the ocean after their descent down the dune, combat boots and all. When McRaven emerged from the water, Moki gave him the signal to drop and roll in the sand. This action turned a person into what was called a “sugar cookie” because you were covered head to toe with sand.

The sugar cookie order was punishment for some infringement made during the course of training. Many soldiers had a hard time with the sugar cookie punishment because the order was often arbitrary. They felt insulted. They worked hard and were skilled and thought it unfair to have to live with the discomfort of sand in every crevice for the day.

When McRaven was fully covered with sand, including inside his pants and boots, Moki asked him if he knew what he’d done to deserve it. McRaven didn’t know. As an explanation, Moki said that **sometimes life isn’t fair. McRaven was going to learn this lesson sooner or later, and it may as well be today**.

At the time, McRaven believed this was just part of training and another cruel aspect of life as a cadet. But a year later, he realized the importance of that lesson and the strength required to live under its influence.

Lieutenant Moki collided with another bicyclist at 25 miles per hour one morning during a ride along the coast. He was paralyzed from the waist down and had limited use of his arms. For a man like Moki, this injury should have devastated him, for it essentially ended his life as he knew it.

**Instead of complaining and giving up, Moki took the life he still had and made something new for himself.** He became a painter, had a family, and organized a triathlon event for SEALs. He was able to push forward because he knew that sometimes life is just unfair. You can either accept it or spend the rest of your life resenting the world.
