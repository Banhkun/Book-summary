## Exercise: Stand Your Ground

There is no shame in opting for the easy way out sometimes. Everyone has done it at least once. The key is to finish what you’ve started more times than not.

* * *

Think of a time when you quit something when the going got rough? Describe the situation.

Why do you think the obstacles were too great to overcome?

Do you have a passion like McRaven does for the SEALs that feels daunting to achieve? What is it, and what obstacles stand between you and your dream?

How do McRaven’s experiences help you understand how to “never ring the bell” on your passion?
