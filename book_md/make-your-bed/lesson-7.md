## Lesson 7: Keep Courage Close

Courage is a powerful emotion. With courage, you can surmount any obstacle. With courage, you can stand up to any bully. Without it, you place yourself at the mercy of life and the actions of others. Just like a society rises up to defeat a nefarious dictator, **you must find the courage to rise up and defeat whatever stands in the way of your success**.

Every bully is the same. They feed on the fear of those they oppress to grow stronger. They are like sharks in the water, circling their prey and waiting for weakness. These sharks are everywhere in life, including work, society, and social circles. If you give in and cower, they will attack you. The consequences could be deadly either physically or spiritually. You have the courage inside of you to stand up to forces of oppression. If you want to accomplish your dreams, you must look inside and call up your courage.

### The Backstory

SEAL training swims often took place at night. Night swims were scary endeavors. There were several shark species that lived in waters off the coast of San Clemente Island near Coronado. But the most dangerous species was the great white shark, a notorious hunter with a particular taste for human flesh.

McRaven and his swim buddy set off from the Naval ship floating off the island’s coast and headed for shore. They were in the middle of the open ocean in the dark. The only thing they could see was each other. **They were scared of the sharks they might encounter, but their desire to be a SEAL was greater than their fear.** Their determination to achieve this goal gave them the courage to keep swimming and face whatever shark they had to along the way.

This courage in the face of a formidable enemy helped McRaven later when he was put in charge of supervising Saddam Hussein after he was captured. Even in captivity, McRaven saw the power Hussein held over the Iraqi leaders who came to admonish him. McRaven knew the only way to diffuse this bully’s power was to take it away. McRaven ordered his men to isolate Hussein and refrain from speaking to him. They were not to show fear or defer to him in any way.

Thirty days later, Hussein was a changed man. He had lost his arrogance and tyrant demeanor. **The courage of the American soldiers had stripped him of his power and neutralized his threat.** The Iraqi government found their courage to try Hussein, the man who’d ruled for decades under a reign of fear, and find him guilty of crimes against humanity.
