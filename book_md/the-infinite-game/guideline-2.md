## Guideline 2: Build Trusting Teams

Sinek’s second guideline for developing an infinite mindset is to build _trusting teams_. **A trusting team is a team made up of people who feel safe around each other—safe expressing their feelings, asking for help, talking about problems, and admitting to mistakes.**

On a trusting team, workers know that their bosses and colleagues will support them through errors and will offer help in a non-judgmental way when asked. Thus, they feel safe being honest. Conversely, on a non-trusting team, people do not feel comfortable showing vulnerabilities and often feel compelled to lie, hide mistakes, and fake expertise rather than ask for help. In such an environment, problems in an organization are ignored or hidden instead of fixed. After some time, these problems can build up and can be much harder to address.

> **The Importance of Trust**
> 
> The Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) published a report in 2017, prior to Sinek’s book, that advances many of the same philosophies on trusting teams. They define trust as “the bridge between the business need for results and the human need for connection.” Like Sinek, the report notes that trust is a key element in a properly functioning organization—when workers trust each other they unite towards a common goal, take risks with their thinking, and communicate openly. In the absence of trust, workers compete, hoard information, and don’t advance new ideas. Without trust, a corporate culture defaults to the lowest common denominator of behavior and is unable to achieve anything truly meaningful.
> 
> The CCL notes that when they first published research on trust in 1999, it was considered a “soft” subject and not taken seriously. However, more recently, people have grown aware of the importance of trust and of the fact that teams without it don’t perform well.
> 
> They recommend that leaders turn to trust-building programs if they sense certain problems in their team, such as a lack of enthusiasm, a reluctance to speak up, intra-team competition, or an attachment to the status quo. Each of these things may indicate a feeling of insecurity or a lack of connection between team members.

### Balance Performance With Trust

Sinek notes that infinite-minded leaders recognize that sometimes the best person for a job is not necessarily the highest-performing candidate. High performance is a reflection of _competence_ , but trustworthiness is a reflection of _character_ , and character can be a better indicator of a quality employee—one who contributes to the organization, elevates her colleagues, and helps to make everyone do their jobs better. A team full of high-skill but low-trust members may become a group of self-serving individuals who never pull together in a meaningful collaborative way but instead hoard information, take credit for others’ efforts, and avoid accountability.

Sinek points to the recruiting practices of the U.S. Navy SEALS to underscore these principles. Sinek explains that the SEALS measure candidates against both performance and trust. They will not accept a candidate with high performance markers but low trust markers, as these people tend to be narcissistic, self-serving, and negative towards the other members, which ultimately hurts the cohesion and performance of the team. They will sooner select people with medium, or even low, performance markers if they have high trust markers, rather than the reverse of high performance markers but low trust.

> **How to Balance Competence With Character**
> 
> Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, discusses how to balance character and performance in his book _Principles_ and comes to a slightly different conclusion than Sinek. He advises that great people have both excellent character and excellent skills, and if one of those elements is missing, your organization can suffer. A person with great skills but poor character won’t align with your company’s mission and will work to benefit their own goals, while a person with great character but low skills won’t advance the mission of the company effectively, even if they’re wonderful people to be around.
> 
> Dalio allows for less flexibility than Sinek does when it comes to balancing these qualities. He advises only hiring people with high markers of both character and skill. Sinek’s theories here might align more realistically with the needs of managers faced with hiring decisions in the absence of perfect candidates. Importantly, Sinek doesn't advise hiring people with _low_ capabilities—he’s advocating for considering people with _medium_ skills over people with _high_ skills, if the lesser-skilled person has significantly more character.

### Create a Safe Space

Sinek maintains that trust comes from the top down. Leaders must show their team members that they value and trust them and must work to establish a culture in which team members trust each other.

  * **Listen to their concerns** and take those concerns seriously: If there are ongoing issues with workplace safety or scheduling, address them. Employees must trust that you have their best interests at heart before they can trust your leadership or, by extension, your team. 
  * **Encourage communication:** Proactively establish communication protocols that allow people to voice concerns to you without repercussions. Eliminate any feelings of fear they may have about speaking up.
  * **Support inter-team communication:** Encourage your team members to listen respectfully to each other’s concerns. You might do this through training seminars or regular meetings. Encourage them to form friendships with each other and to open up on a personal level, which can in turn help them work together on a professional level more smoothly.
  * **Identify high-trust team members:** When hiring, it can be difficult to figure out a person’s character because it is less easily quantified than her performance is. However, on an existing team, it’s easy to identify the person everyone trusts. Make sure that person feels valued for her contributions. 
  * **Identify low-trust members:** It’s also easy to identify the low-trust team member—she’s the one everyone considers “the asshole.” Make sure this person doesn’t infect your team with toxicity. Coach her to develop better interpersonal skills. If she proves uncoachable by resisting feedback and being unwilling to change her attitude, the best course of action may be to remove her from the team.



> **Another View on How to Build Trusting Teams**
> 
> Many management experts agree with Sinek’s emphasis on the importance of trusting teams. For example, Kim Scott, CEO coach and New York Times bestselling author, discusses building trusting teams in her book _Radical Candor_ , which explores how to improve relationships with people you manage. Her recommendations include:
> 
>   * Granting your team members autonomy, allowing them to feel empowered to make decisions
> 
>   * Sharing details of your personal life with them, while being aware of what boundaries you shouldn’t cross
> 
>   * Being open to new perspectives by respecting differing opinions and values
> 
> 

> 
> While Sinek addresses each of these aspects of building trusting teams, Scott adds another element: self-care. She says that to **build a trusting team, you must start by making sure you’re bringing your best self to the situation** , because if you’re caught up in stress, either at home or at work, you won’t deal with challenges as efficiently as you would if you have a calm, clear mind.
> 
> To prevent stress from building up because of friction between your personal and professional lives, Scott advocates that you think of your personal and professional spheres not as two separate existences, but as integrated pieces of your life. This way, if you need to, for example, meditate at home, you’ll see that it contributes to your work life as well as your private life. Similarly, if you’re excited about a work project, you can share that enthusiasm with your family and it will enrich your home life.
> 
> She also advises that you schedule time for self-care so that it doesn’t get lost in the shuffle of your day—if you tend to skip your morning workout because you’re too busy, put it on your calendar as if it’s a meeting.

### Train High Trust Leaders

Sinek argues that ultimately, a leader’s job is not about achieving specific results; it’s about leading a group of people so that _they_ can achieve results. A good leader enables her team members to do the jobs they’ve been trained to by establishing an environment in which mistakes are embraced and solved together, information flows freely, and help can be asked for and offered without repercussions.

To illustrate this infinite-minded approach to leadership, Sinek discusses the way the U.S. Marine Corps selects its leaders. It puts candidates through a ten-week training program during which it evaluates their ability to deal with adversity, figure out problems, and delegate tasks while completing various challenges like crossing a body of water using only three planks of wood. Importantly, candidates are measured on their leadership abilities but _not_ on whether or not they successfully complete the challenges.

In prioritizing behavior over outcomes in this way, the Marines recognize that a good leader is not defined by some arbitrary achievement—sometimes good leaders fail in a task and sometimes bad leaders succeed in one. Interior qualities of leadership like integrity, perseverance, cooperation, and decisiveness have proven to be much more reliable indicators of a leader who will go on to develop strong teams.

(Shortform note: In his memoir _Hillbilly Elegy_ , JD Vance talks about his experience in the Marine Corps, where, he says, he first encountered leadership methods other than screaming and issuing threats—methods he’d grown up with. Instead, he says he learned that being a leader means earning the respect of those you lead. This is an important contrast to the leadership of finite-minded people: Leaders who lead through fear and threats don’t earn respect, and won’t have the lasting loyalty of their followers.)

> **Developing High-Trust Leadership**
> 
> Sinek’s emphasis on the importance of establishing leadership trust is echoed in other management books. In their landmark book _The Leadership Challenge_ , authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner note that trust is the most important element of relationships. Without trust, people won’t work together effectively. With trust, people make decisions efficiently and swiftly, innovate more, and produce more profits.
> 
> Like Sinek, Kouzes and Posner advise that trust has to start from the top. As a leader, you must show that you trust your team members’ abilities by sharing knowledge freely, training them properly, and then stepping back and letting them do their jobs. They argue that one of the most important things a leader can do to foster trust is to allow team members to make mistakes. If you can’t trust your team to perform properly, you become a micromanager, not a leader. Allowing your team to make mistakes, learn from them, and try again will build you a team of leaders, each of whom can effectively manage their own areas.

### Prevent Ethical Fading

Sinek points out that the trust that strong relationships are based on develops when a group of people consistently behaves ethically. Unfortunately, if a trust-based environment is not properly established in an organization, the people within that organization can start to suffer a gradual decline in their ethics, which can build on itself and eventually create a toxic work environment. This is called _ethical fading_.

**_Ethical fading_ is when people engage in increasingly unethical behavior while __ convincing themselves that they are acting fairly and properly. **Ethical fading happens little by little at a company. It starts with minor transgressions—cutting a few corners or taking credit for someone else’s idea. If employees committing those minor transgressions are rewarded with things like bonuses or promotions, other employees start committing small transgressions, which can increase and accumulate into larger transgressions.

A company that suffers from ethical fading often runs into legal trouble or is not prepared for competitive challenges in the marketplace because their employees have been trained to look inward, at their own minor goals, rather than outward, at the company’s larger place in the world.

Sinek points to several factors that frequently encourage unethical behavior:

  * Poorly-designed incentives
  * Rationalization
  * Reliance on rigid and impersonal structures in place of enlightened leadership



> **Ethical Fading Is a Drift to Low Performance**
> 
> Donella Meadows addresses a concept similar to ethical fading in her book _Thinking in Systems_. She discusses how people can gradually decrease their standards and drift into mediocre or unethical behavior if they set the bar for their performance at their previous performance—for example, if they are five minutes late to work one day, being six minutes late the next day doesn’t seem so bad, because it’s only one minute later than the day before. After a few months, an employee who continued down this path might end up coming in to work an hour late.
> 
> Similarly, if a company is filled with employees who are making small unethical decisions, they have set the bar low for their next decisions, which may then be even more unethical. The key here is the gradual decline in standards, which is how ethical fading develops. Employees are unlikely to suddenly make a decision that is largely out of line with their general behavior, but if they gradually decrease their standards, they might eventually make that large unethical decision and not feel it’s all that wrong.

#### Poorly-Designed Incentives Can Cause Ethical Fading

Sinek discusses how in an organization run with a finite mindset, employees can feel pressure to hit their targets by cutting corners, bending rules, and making unethical decisions. When employees who do this are then rewarded with bonuses and promotions, other employees get the message that the organization prioritizes _winning_ at all costs. Employees start to feel compelled to keep up with colleagues who are acting unethically in order to keep their jobs or stay competitive for promotions and raises. This can result in organizations filled with unethical actors and can lead to big problems.

> **Ethical Fading As Peer Pressure**
> 
> Poorly designed incentives that pressure employees to keep up with their coworkers can lead to a workplace in which everyone seems to be breaking the rules, and therefore breaking the rules doesn’t feel like such a big deal. This effect is similar to the well-known “broken windows theory,” which holds that small signs of criminality (like broken windows in a building or graffiti) encourage more criminality because they allow people to rationalize that a little more crime won’t be noticed. In a company falling to ethical fading, small, frequent acts of poor behavior encourage larger acts.
> 
> Malcolm Gladwell discusses this theory in his book _The Tipping Point_ and explains how people act differently in different circumstances and social settings—a theory that dovetails with Sinek’s ideas about the effect of an organization’s culture on the employees in that organization.
> 
> These influences are illustrated by the downfall of News International, the conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch that ran News of the World, among other British newspapers, where employees were pressured to meet arbitrary work goals and felt peer pressure to keep up with coworkers who were cutting corners to achieve those goals.
> 
> By 2009, News International had been involved in lawsuits for several years after their journalists were caught hacking the phones of the royal family and other celebrities to illegally gather information. Despite numerous convictions and repeated assurances from the company that it had ceased those practices, in a series of articles from 2009 through 2010, other news outlets revealed that their journalists hadn’t stopped hacking phones, and in fact, were regularly hacking the phones of ordinary citizens and government officials as well as celebrities. They were also found guilty of frequent bribery, often of police officers.
> 
> In 2011, after 168 years in operation, News of the World folded. Subsequent investigations revealed a culture that treated illegal hacking and bribery as industry standards and that pressured journalists to obtain information by any means. Even after Murdoch had publicly apologized and had settled with hundreds of victims, he was recorded excusing the scandal as “next to nothing,” justifying the company’s actions as “part of the culture of Fleet Street” (journalism headquarters), and expressing regret at having cooperated with the investigations.
> 
> The finite-minded attitude of company executives had infected the entire organization and brought it down by prioritizing short-term winning over long-term values.

#### Rationalization Can Justify Unethical Behavior

Sinek poses that unethical behavior is not merely caused by flawed incentive structures that reward unethical employees and punish ethical ones, but also**by self-deception, created when people rationalize their unethical choices.**

He outlines a few different ways we rationalize our own unethical behavior:

**#1: Using euphemisms to disguise the true nature of our actions:** When we use less-charged words to speak of unpleasant things, we distance ourselves from our actions and make them feel less wrong. For example, we don’t “fire” people, we “restructure,” and if something goes wrong, it’s “collateral damage.”

**#2: Blaming the system:** A leader who’s confronted with the consequences of her decisions often blames the “system,” arguing that the system is designed to encourage, and even necessitate, these sorts of unethical decisions.

**#3: Blaming the customer for enabling our behavior:** The legal defense of “caveat emptor” (“buyer beware”) is frequently used by companies to disassociate themselves from their unethical decisions; the argument is that the customer should have known what they were getting into, and if they didn’t want the consequences, they have only themselves to blame. Sinek cites the example of tobacco companies, which argue that negative health consequences are the fault of their customers, who knew the risks but willingly purchased cigarettes anyway. While buyer choice certainly plays a role in any exchange of goods, it does not insulate the company providing those goods from any responsibility regarding their effects.

> **Morally Disengaging Through Rationalization**
> 
> Professors Sean Martin and Jim Detert of the University of Virginia expand on Sinek’s discussion of how we rationalize unethical behavior. They outline eight common ways in which people morally disengage from their actions. The first three mirror Sinek’s points:
> 
>   * Using euphemisms to create emotional distance from bad behavior: “I’m only ‘borrowing’ this stapler. She won’t miss it.”
> 
>   * Shifting blame: “I’m just doing what my manager told me to do.”
> 
>   * Blaming the customer: “They should have known better.”
> 
>   * Telling yourself you’re helping the other person: “They don’t actually need these things; they wouldn’t know what to do with them.”
> 
>   * Pointing out a worse case: “At least I’m not doing what X is doing.”
> 
>   * Minimizing the impact: “Victimless crime.”
> 
>   * Dehumanizing the victims: “They’re animals.”
> 
>   * Diffusing responsibility: “We made this decision together, so I’m not responsible for the outcome.”
> 
> 

> 
> Martin and Detert note that when companies make their employees aware of how unethical behavior negatively affects customers and others, those employees are far less likely to engage in it. They advise companies to regularly remind their employees of the link between their actions and other peoples’ lives. They also, like Sinek, advise that organizations set realistic goals and fair incentives for their employees in order to dissuade unethical behavior.

#### Rigid Structures Can Promote Ethical Fading

Sinek notes that, at times, a leader will try to fix behavioral problems by implementing new rules and regulations instead of addressing the underlying reason behind the issues. For example, if a company starts getting an increased number of customer complaints, company executives may start requiring their customer service reps to watch a series of online training programs to improve their service skills. However, if the executives investigated _why_ their customers are increasingly unhappy, they might discover that their reps feel pressured to service more customers than they have proper time for, and consequently are making each customer feel rushed. If this was the case, adding additional training requirements would actually worsen the problem by taking more time out of the reps’ day.

**Such fixes focus on the _symptoms_ of a problem rather than the root cause**, and more often than not, create new incentives for ethical slipping. In the example above, reps may not see the benefit of or need for new training programs. When employees feel they’re being asked to do unnecessary things that divert their time away from more important tasks, they are more likely to cut corners. In this case, they might pretend to watch training sessions but actually just leave the program running in the background on mute on their computer while they do other tasks.

This is how ethical fading begins. Employees justify their behavior as “white lies”: small, unimportant dishonesties that don’t hurt anyone and simply help them get through the bureaucratic process, which they see as overly restrictive.

Sinek says that to counter ethical fading, you must view it as a _people_ problem, not a _process_ problem, and you must use infinite-minded solutions instead of finite-minded ones that focus on administrative fixes. This means reminding employees of their Just Cause, encouraging a Trusting Team, and giving people the opportunity to use their own inner morality to meet the goals of the organization.

> **The Ford Pinto: Unethical Leaders May Indicate Widespread Ethical Fading**
> 
> The development and demise of the Ford Pinto in the 1970s is an often-cited example of ethics losing out to amoral incentives. Today, the episode is generally remembered as a case where a few executives were aware that the car’s gas tank had a tendency to explode in low-impact collisions, but they decided it would cost more to recall the cars and fix them than it would to settle lawsuits with victims’ families, and so they buried their information and released the car for sale. After several explosive collisions followed by investigations, their prior knowledge came to light.
> 
> However, more recent studies of the situation reveal more nuance, indicating the problem wasn’t caused by just a few executives, but instead, the entire company suffered from ethical fading that led to the issue. Viewing this situation through the lens of Sinek’s theories, the Pinto’s problems were caused by:
> 
>   * **Poorly designed incentives** that pressured employees to achieve unrealistic goals
> 
>   * **Rigid structures** that encouraged employees to ignore problems
> 
>   * **Rationalization** that justified silence in the face of known problems because everyone else was doing the same
> 
> 

> 
> The company’s engineers and designers were under intense pressure from upper management (mostly from CEO Lee Iacocca) to produce a car quickly in order to compete with foreign models that were coming out. Consequently, the development of the car from conception to delivery was completed in record time for that era: 25 months, as opposed to the industry standard of 43 months.
> 
> Because of the accelerated schedule, different departments worked in tandem rather than one after the other—for example, the manufacturing tools were created at the same time that the design was finalized. This meant that no changes could be made to the design if any problems arose, and that employees who might have noticed problems were strongly incentivized to keep quiet, lest they knock the entire operation off track.
> 
> Communication between departments was intentionally limited to allow the engineers to proceed unencumbered and quickly—this meant that departments that were in contact with regulatory agencies shielded the engineers from potential objections.
> 
> Each individual department was working within the legal bounds of the day, and thus was able to blame the system (the then-current regulations) for their lack of standards.
> 
> This combination of factors caused workers at all levels of Ford to look the other way where standards were low. When the gas tank proved flammable in testing, employees hid behind the rigid structures of existing law to approve the design (the design didn’t _technically_ violate existing legal standards of the day), and the cost-benefit analysis they used was industry standard at the time. Raising an issue would have meant going against a corporate culture that rewarded speed over quality. Thus, all employees were pressured to ignore the problematic issues, leading to company-wide ethical fading that resulted in deaths on the road.
> 
> This analysis raises the possibility that whenever a company makes headlines for the misdeeds of its executives, it’s unlikely that the executives are isolated cases of unethical behavior in the company. Given that corporate culture typically originates from its leadership, **unethical leaders probably indicate an unethical culture in the whole company.**
> 
> **The Flip Side of Ethical Fading**
> 
> While unethical behavior can result from a negative culture that gets incrementally worse over time, fortunately, _ethical_ behavior can increase incrementally, too: Research has shown that people who are susceptible to negative messages from their peers or managers are also open to positive messages. In their book _Nudge_ , economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein discuss how small suggestions can prompt people to behave in better ways—managing their money more responsibly, eating better, and treating the environment better.
> 
> Sinek doesn’t explicitly address this idea, but his theories do overlap with it. When he encourages creating a culture of trust, he’s essentially advising that leaders create signs and nudges within their corporate culture that indicate to their team members that they can be honest and open with each other. The safe spaces he advocates for would function as a counter to a culture that promotes ethical fading.
