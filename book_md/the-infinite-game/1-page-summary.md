## 1-Page Summary

In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek explores the differences between _finite_ and _infinite_ games: Games where the players either play to win (finite), or to survive, thrive, and keep playing (infinite). He argues that **people who view business as an infinite game that is constantly evolving and never-ending are more successful,** while those who aim to “win” don’t end up as well-off. ****

### Two Games: Finite and Infinite

Sinek defines _finite games_ as those with known players, fixed rules, and an agreed-upon objective. A poker game, for example, has identifiable players, strict rules, and a pre-set ending point where one player is judged to have won and the players stop playing.

In contrast, _infinite games_ have both known and unknown players, changeable rules, and no clear ending point at which one person is declared the winner and everyone goes home.

When players leave a _finite_ game, the game ends. When players leave an _infinite_ game, the game continues on without them.

Sinek started thinking about these concepts after reading James Carse’s _Finite and Infinite Games_ , a philosophical treatise published in 1986, which first contrasted the idea of a finite game (played to win) with an infinite game (played to keep playing). Carse applies these theories to many aspects of life, both personal and professional. Sinek’s twist was to apply the concepts specifically to business.

#### Business Is an Infinite Game

In arguing that business is an infinite game, Sinek points out some characteristics that make it so:

  * There are many players, and even some you don’t recognize as players. 
  * There are no fixed rules—other than acting legally, there are infinite ways to conduct business.
  * There’s no agreed-upon objective. One person’s definition of success may not be another’s
  * There’s no end. When a player leaves the game, the game continues. 



> **Infinite Games Lay the Foundation for More Games**
> 
> Sinek wasn’t the first to examine how Carse’s theories of infinite games might play out in the real world. In 2011, Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired Magazine and bestselling author, explored finite and infinite games as part of his book _What Technology Wants_.
> 
> Kelly notes that finite games are dramatic (think military battles or football games) while infinite games can be boring—no one wants to read about a company that’s doing its job well or two countries at peace. However, the boring stories are the ones that lead to future stories. When people cooperate, they can create opportunities for others, whether that be new settlements where people can live and work, or new artistic collaborations that enhance the quality of peoples’ lives.
> 
> In other words, although people pay more attention to finite games and their dramatic storylines, it’s **infinite (boring) games that end up having greater consequences** , spawning more games both infinite and finite.

#### Developing an Infinite Mindset

Sinek contends that someone who sees their business as part of an infinite game will make decisions based on long-term strategies that develop long-term strength, while a leader who plays a finite game will aim for short-term wins that might weaken her organization in the long run. To develop a mindset that sees the larger game at play, Sinek recommends you adopt several attitudes:

  * **Play versus win:** Don’t set out to defeat others, but instead, aim to maintain a healthy position within a competitive field. 
  * **“Us” versus “Me”:** Consider the impact your company will have on your employees, your community, the economy, and the outside world. 
  * **Be proactive, not reactive:** Anticipate them and prepare for disruptions instead of merely reacting to them. 
  * **Think of long-term goals:** Work toward a longer-term view of success rather than worrying primarily about your near-term bottom line. 
  * **Focus on long-term threats:** Don’t center your corporate strategies around specific, definable threats posed by rivals. Instead, explore opportunities or develop innovations that might strengthen your organization. 
  * **Aim for resilience over stability:** Strive not just to weather storms but to be made stronger by them. 



> **Objections to Sinek’s Binary Thinking**
> 
> Some critics of Sinek have argued that he ignores the fact that, in the real world, businesses operate with both finite and infinite mindsets, depending on the particular challenge they’re working on—sometimes they need to use finite tactics in order to keep immediately afloat, and other times, they have the luxury of thinking infinitely.

#### How to Lead With an Infinite Mindset

Sinek outlines these five guidelines to help you develop an infinite mindset and build a strong, resilient company:

  1. Advance a just cause.
  2. Build trusting teams.
  3. Study your worthy rivals.
  4. Be ready to pivot on a fundamental level.
  5. Demonstrate the courage to lead.



We’ll explore each of these guidelines in depth in the following sections.

### Guideline 1: Advance a Just Cause

According to Sinek, an infinite mindset begins with a _Just Cause_. **A Just Cause is a big-picture vision that provides a framework for your corporate strategies.** A Just Cause provides a context for all the decisions you’ll make. It inspires people to work hard and make sacrifices because they believe in the cause.

Sinek defines a Just Cause as a _specific_ vision of an _ideal state_ of the future that inspires people. Your Just Cause must paint a clear picture that others can see: A promise to “improve the world” doesn’t provide enough substance or specificity to inspire people. A Just Cause has five elements:

  1. It stands _for_ something, not _against_ something: It’s optimistic and hopeful.
  2. It’s idealistic: It’s inspiring, bold, and ultimately unachievable.
  3. It’s inclusive: It invites and inspires others to join.
  4. It’s service-oriented: It’s aimed at the benefit of others.
  5. It’s resilient: It can endure technological, cultural, political, and industry changes.



> **Panasonic’s Infinite-Minded Just Cause**
> 
> Electronics company Panasonic is an example of a company with a corporate strategy that embodies each of the five elements of a Just Cause. In 1932, the company’s head, Kōnosuke Matsushita, laid out a 250-year vision based on the notion that the primary purpose of a business should be to increase human happiness. His strategy was to “overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods,” which would “banish poverty, bring happiness to people's lives and make this world into a paradise.”
> 
> This vision stood _for_ something, was _inclusive_ , was _service-oriented_ , was _resilient_ , and was _idealistic_. Today, the company’s vision has expanded and includes goals for helping the environment, helping communities, and being responsible. Its Just Cause has powered it for decades and positioned it strongly to face the future.
> 
> However, there is one aspect of Panasonic’s mission statement that doesn’t align with Sinek’s definition—it’s not specific, in that it doesn’t paint a particular picture of the future, but instead holds up a vague but lofty goal of “overcoming poverty.” Further, since Panasonic focuses on producing _electronic_ goods, their mission statement of “producing an abundant supply of goods” doesn’t exactly articulate their vision. A person reading the mission statement without knowing it was Panasonic’s would be unlikely to associate it with the company.
> 
> This analysis shows how, in the real world, a company might find success even if they don’t follow Sinek’s exact prescription. Regardless, the takeaway is that the company thought about the long term and considered the wider world beyond their particular company when crafting their vision. Sinek would likely argue that the infinite aspect of that thinking is what’s kept them successful.

### Guideline 2: Build Trusting Teams

Sinek’s second guideline for developing an infinite mindset is to build _trusting teams_. **A trusting team is a team made up of people who feel safe around each other—safe expressing their feelings, asking for help, talking about problems, and admitting to mistakes.** Without trust,**** employees are reluctant to bring attention to problems when they occur, which can lead problems to become much harder to address when they finally are dealt with.

To build a team where members value and trust each other, Sinek advises that leaders:

  * **Hire well:** Look for candidates who display markers of character as well as skill.
  * **Listen to team member concerns:** Employees must trust that you have their best interests at heart before they can trust your leadership. 
  * **Encourage communication:** Encourage people to voice concerns to you without repercussions. Eliminate any feelings of fear they may have about speaking up.
  * **Support inter-team communication:** Encourage your team members to listen respectfully to each other’s concerns. You might do this through training seminars or regular meetings. Encourage them to form friendships with each other and to open up on a personal level, which can in turn help them work together on a professional level more smoothly.



> **Trusting Teams Start With Trusting Leadership**
> 
> Sinek’s emphasis on establishing trust is echoed in other management books. In their landmark book _The Leadership Challenge_ , authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner note that trust is the most important element of relationships. Without trust, people won’t work together effectively. With trust, people make decisions efficiently and swiftly, innovate more, and produce more profits.
> 
> Like Sinek, Kouzes and Posner advise that trust has to start from the top. As a leader, you must show that you trust your team members’ abilities by sharing knowledge freely, training them properly, and then stepping back and letting them do their jobs. They argue that one of the most important things a leader can do to foster trust is to allow team members to make mistakes. If you can’t trust your team to perform properly, you become a micromanager, not a leader. Allowing your team to make mistakes, learn from them, and try again will build you a team of leaders, each of whom can effectively manage their own areas.

### Guideline 3: Study Your Worthy Rivals

Sinek’s third method of developing your infinite-minded leadership is to study your _worthy rivals_. **A worthy rival is a competitor who is better than you at certain things, and who can therefore reveal to you ways you can improve, enabling you to better survive in the infinite game.** A worthy rival may make a better product, provide a better service, or command stronger customer loyalty than you do: anything from which you can draw lessons.

#### A Rival Can Help You Improve

Sinek posits that viewing a competitor as a _worthy rival_ rather than simply a _rival_ can inspire you to _improve_ rather than just to _win_ , focusing your attention on _process_ rather than _outcome_. When you respect your rivals and acknowledge what they do well, you are able to better see how their strengths can guide your own shortcomings.

Conversely, if you view your rivals with disdain or see them solely as competitors to beat, you’re far more likely to dismiss their strengths and ignore your own weaknesses, because your mind will be focused on figuring out how you’re superior to them.

> **Worthy Rivals Turn Competition Into Cooperation**
> 
> Timothy Gallwey also discusses how competition can improve performance in his book _The Inner Game of Tennis_. He contends that to achieve whatever goal you’re aiming for, you must overcome small obstacles along the way, and because a competitor presents you with these obstacles, they are a necessary element in achieving that higher goal.
> 
> The benefits of competition are mutual between both players. Each player benefits from the other’s attempts to block them with obstacles, and consequently, _competition_ ends up functioning as _cooperation_ , allowing both parties to improve.
> 
> The rivalry between tennis players Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal exemplify both Sinek’s concept of Worthy Rivals and Gallwey’s theory of competition as cooperation. Both Federer and Nadal have achieved great success in part because their mutual respect for each other has helped them each become better athletes. Over the years, each player has publicly acknowledged the other’s strengths and the friendship they share. In 2020, when Nadal won his 20th Grand Slam title and tied Federer’s record, Federer responded by congratulating Nadal and calling him his “greatest rival over many years,” noting that their rivalry has “pushed each other to become better players.”

#### A Rival Can Help You See the Bigger Picture

Sinek notes that having a worthy rival can change your perspective on competition itself, so that you see competition as less of a win-lose dynamic and more of a cooperative effort. When you’re not exclusively focused on _beating_ your competition, you’ll better see how your competitors add value to the economic ecosystem.

> **Tesla’s Infinite Mindset**
> 
> This fits into the commonly known framework of _zero-sum_ thinking versus _positive-sum_ thinking. In a zero-sum game, there have to be losers if there are to be winners. In a positive-sum game, the success of some players contributes to the success of all players. People who see their interactions as positive-sum are generally more successful (and happier).
> 
> A more recent example of a company seeing the bigger picture and putting the good of its industry over its own personal good is Tesla, which, in 2014, made its patents freely available to any competitors who wanted to use them “in good faith” to develop electric vehicles (EV). CEO Elon Musk did this to “accelerate the advent of sustainable transport” (his Just Cause). He acknowledged that patents that limited other companies’ ability to innovate worked against that vision, and that all EV car companies, including Tesla, will benefit from accessible technology. **In doing so, he positioned his EV competitors not as rivals but as partners.**

### Guideline 4: Be Ready to Pivot

The fourth guideline for an infinite mindset is **being prepared to pivot on a fundamental, existential level.** An _existential pivot_ is a purposeful, dramatic change that a person willingly makes in order to stay true to her Just Cause.

Sinek emphasizes that an existential pivot is not a reactive move—a move that someone makes in order to stay alive in the face of difficult challenges. Instead, it’s a move made _in anticipation of_ a future changing climate because you know that at some point, your organization will need to be positioned differently to survive.

**An existential pivot allows a leader to seek out the potential benefits of disruptive change, rather than just avoiding the potential threats.** Infinite-minded leaders must be willing to make existential pivots and destroy their own company when faced with potential changes, because if they don’t, someone else will.

Sinek notes that when a company has found success through a certain business model, its leaders are often reluctant to abandon that model, sometimes mistaking the model itself for their Just Cause (as if their Just Cause is to sell a particular product). This can lead them to cling to an outdated business model that has stopped serving their Just Cause, which gives competitors a chance to step in and steal business away from them.

> **Types of Pivots**
> 
> Entrepreneur and start-up advisor Eric Ries writes about how a company can use a pivot to redirect its efforts to more profitable avenues in his book _The Lean Startup_. He notes that pivoting is especially important for start-up companies, as they usually have limited time and funds to find their footing. He also notes that even if your company isn’t outright failing but is instead just getting by, you may want to pivot in order to get on a track where you’re making more progress.
> 
> He outlines several different ways in which a company can pivot in order to better take advantage of opportunities:
> 
>   * Zoom in or out: Narrow or expand your product’s focus.
> 
>   * Target new customers or customer needs: Redirect to a different consumer segment or address a different specific problem they have.
> 
>   * Change your sales channel: If you sell through stores, consider selling directly to consumers, or vice versa.
> 
>   * Incorporate new technology: Your entire business model might change with innovative technology, like when Netflix started offering streaming services instead of mail-in DVD rentals.
> 
> 


### Guideline 5: Lead Courageously

The fifth and final guideline to follow in developing your infinite mindset is to _lead courageously_. **Leading courageously means working toward a better future and supporting your Just Cause, even if doing so puts your own career in jeopardy.**

Sinek argues that leading courageously can become more difficult after a company has achieved a certain level of success, because it can get distracted by the trappings of success. This can happen if a leader starts believing her own hype, thinking she’s solely responsible for the organization’s success, and pursuing fame or wealth while ignoring (or sometimes even opposing) the organization’s Just Cause. Then, when problems arise, that leader will often respond to them with a finite mindset, blaming other people, instituting rigid structures and rules, and setting the company on a finite-minded path.

> **Success Can Lead to Ego; Ego Leads to Finite Thinking**
> 
> Ryan Holiday discusses this phenomenon in more detail in his book _Ego Is the Enemy_. He notes that successful leaders become successful because of positive characteristics: They are constantly learning, are open to feedback and criticism, and aim to _do something_ _important_ rather than _be someone_ _important_. However, once in power, surrounded by people constantly telling them how amazing they are, they often abandon these qualities and instead resist learning new things (convinced of their own wisdom), close themselves off to feedback or criticism (insistent that they can do no wrong), and become more concerned with _being someone important_ rather than _doing something important_.
> 
> Holiday doesn’t use the same framework of an _infinite mindset_ as Sinek does, but the recommendations of the two authors align: Essentially, they both advise that a leader put her cause before her own ego.

### Conclusion: Changes Are Coming

Sinek notes that people are starting to question long-held assumptions about business existing only to serve an elite class of owners, and are starting to recognize that there are other important reasons that companies exist.

We can see a more infinite-minded view of corporate strategy growing in popularity as people rethink the role of shareholders in a company. For example, B Corporations that require companies to adhere to social and environmental priorities are becoming more common, and in 2019, a coalition of around 200 executives of leading American firms signed on to a statement saying the purpose of business is no longer primarily to serve shareholders, but instead to serve all Americans, including customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and the wider community.
