## Exercise: Find a Worthy Rival

When you have a worthy rival, that person or organization can keep you focused on what you stand for. When a worthy rival shows you both what to imitate and what to avoid doing, they can help you define your own Just Cause.

* * *

Name a competitor whom you admire in some wayâ€”someone (or some organization) who does at least one thing better than you do.

What can that competitor teach you? How can you apply the lessons you might learn from them to your own organization or career?

How might that competitor help you define your own Just Cause, by making the Cause slightly different from theirs?
