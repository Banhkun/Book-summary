## Shortform Introduction

In _The Infinite Game_ , motivational speaker and bestselling author Simon Sinek explores the differences between finite games (games with clear winners, losers, and end points) and infinite games (games that transcend the players themselves and have a higher purpose). He argues that people who see business as an infinite game will succeed at it, while those who focus on short-term concerns like beating the competition won’t. He explores how to develop an infinite mindset that will put you and your organization on a path for long-term success.

### About the Author

Simon Sinek burst into the public’s consciousness in 2009 with a viral Ted Talk called How Great Leaders Inspire Action, which has now been viewed over 54 million times on the Ted website and another 14 million times on YouTube. He followed up his talk with five books on leadership and inspiration, two of which, _Start With Why_ and _Leaders Eat Last_ , hit the New York Times Bestseller list.

He made a second Ted Talk in 2014 and a video with How to: Academy, both of which focus on leadership techniques and strategies. He is considered a leading voice in what constitutes good leadership in a corporate setting.

Some people love Sinek, while others feel his success is due more to self-promotion than original ideas. And some people feel a mix of the two; one 2018 article suggested that Sinek’s fame is due to his ability to spin hot air, but that in itself is a reason to admire him.

He does __ publicize his books widely, appearing in multiple interviews in Forbes (in 2019 and 2020) as well as in Inc., Morning Brew, Business Insider, Success Magazine, and NPR, and many other publications.

### The Book’s Publication

_The Infinite Game_ , published in 2018 by Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Random House, is Sinek’s fifth book. It follows up and continues exploring many of the concepts in the aforementioned _Leaders Eat Last_ and _Start With Why_. Throughout these three books, he explores different takes on the idea that what makes a leader or an organization exceptional is a commitment to a higher purpose.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

The book was inspired by and based on the concepts from James P. Carse’s 1986 book _Finite and Infinite Games_ , which laid out the foundational idea that Sinek builds on—namely, that every interaction we have with others is either part of a finite game, aimed at winning, or an infinite game, aimed at continuing the play. Carse was a theologian and philosopher, and saw infinite and finite games as part of every aspect of life, from religion to romance to geopolitical alliances.

Sinek’s twist applies these concepts to business strategy specifically. While Sinek was not the first to reflect on Carse’s philosophies, they remained somewhat on the fringe of cultural consciousness until Sinek linked them specifically to the world of business and launched them into the public eye again.

#### Intellectual Context

Sinek’s work fits neatly into a contemporary view of leadership and business strategy that encourages people to think of larger issues more than their own immediate needs, and to focus on long-term rather than short-term concerns in order to find lasting success. Other books that touch on similar concepts include _Ego Is the Enemy_ , _The Leadership Challenge_ , and _Built to Last_.

Sinek also emphasizes the importance of focusing your efforts on one major, overriding purpose that gives your organization meaning. Other management books that advocate for this include the ones mentioned above as well as Greg McKeown’s _Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_.

Sinek contrasts his theories with those of Milton Friedman, who was an early advocate of modern capitalism and the idea that self-interested incentives are the backbone of a healthy economy. Sinek argues that you can be successful by rejecting Friedman’s philosophies, and, in fact, that rejecting self-interest can lead to even more success than chasing it.

#### The Book’s Impact

The book sold well, hitting the number two spot on the New York Times bestseller list in November of 2019. It was his second book to make the list, after _Leaders Eat Last_.

The book frequently makes lists of recommended business books to read, and was even included on the 2021 U.S. Navy’s Professional Reading Program book list, a list of books that every ship is equipped with and that sailors are encouraged to read (the program’s motto is “Read Well to Lead Well”). (Sinek’s other book, _Leaders Eat Last_ , is also included.)

_The Infinite Game_ launched Sinek to a new level of popularity, paving the way for him to start his own publishing imprint, Optimism Press, in partnership with his longtime publisher Portfolio and under the umbrella of Penguin Random House.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers who appreciate the book feel its concepts are a new way of thinking about business and success, and they enjoy the way Sinek constructs a clear plan and concrete techniques for developing an infinite mind. Many reviewers say the book is for leaders who aim to be more than just business leaders, but also leaders of humanity. Some note that the concepts outlined in the book apply to peacekeeping missions and society in general, and they argue that if leaders followed its prescripts, the world would be better off.

Online reviewers who find fault with Sinek’s book often argue that the book’s insights aren’t very original, but instead might be found in any self-help business book. Many also say that Sinek cherry-picks examples to support his arguments, and that his concepts don’t work as well in real life as they do in theory. Additionally, some argue that it’s unrealistic to expect business leaders, who are concerned with keeping their organizations viable, to put their own needs aside and focus on the needs of the wider world. Finally, some reviewers find fault with how Sinek has interpreted Carse’s philosophies in the original _Finite and Infinite Games_ that inspired Sinek’s book—for example, critics argue that Sinek’s reliance on the Cold War as an example of an infinite game might not properly represent Carse’s ideas, since wartime activity is inherently a finite game.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The book does repackage ideas that can be found in many other management books, but Sinek never claims to be completely original—in fact, he credits Carse’s book as inspiration in the introduction. While his theories mirror those in many other books in the management genre (essentially repackaging effective leadership as different expressions of selflessness), his pairing of management techniques with the idea of an “infinite game” is original.

A more substantial critique is that his examples are occasionally only narrow illustrations of his theories. In practice, alternative examples that might demonstrate his ideas often come with caveats—companies that lived up to his ideas but haven’t succeeded as well as he might have predicted (like TOMS), or companies that succeeded very well and seem to fit with his theories but also benefited from other advantages that can also explain their success (like Apple, which benefited greatly from some luck along the way and whose founder Steve Jobs engaged in some finite, self-centered thinking, especially when Apple was young).

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The overall flow of Sinek’s book follows this path:

  * Sinek opens his book with an overview of finite and infinite games, discussing their definitions and how developing an infinite mindset will bring you more success. 
  * He introduces his analysis of the five guidelines for an infinite mind (a Just Cause, Trusting Teams, Worthy Rivals, Existential Flex, and Courage). 
  * He discusses the first element, a Just Cause. 
  * He departs from the five guidelines to discuss some background economics and a brief history of how finite thinking came to take over the corporate world. 
  * He includes a chapter discussing employee morale, which is outside the scope of any particular guideline.
  * He then discusses the last four guidelines in order. 



### Our Approach in This Guide

While our guide generally follows the book’s structure, we’ve grouped our discussion by Sinek’s five guidelines instead of by chapter. To do so, we’ve combined some of his chapters (for example, he discusses a Just Cause in chapters 2 through 4, but we’ve organized that information under one heading.

As noted above, Sinek breaks up the flow of the discussion of his guidelines after his Just Cause chapters with two chapters that examine peripheral concepts: the history of finite thinking in business, and employee morale. In our guide, we’ve opted to distribute the information contained in those two chapters to other areas in the guide where they fit better, so that we can keep our discussion of the five guidelines uninterrupted.

For example, we’ve included Sinek’s discussion of the history of business (chapter 5) in our introduction, as it gives the reader a better overall sense of the background to his concepts there, and we’ve tacked on a final section at the end of the guide discussing where corporate America is headed. We also included much of his discussion on employee morale (chapter 6) in our discussion of leading with courage, as he also touches on employee concerns in that section.

We opted to discuss his five guidelines in the order he introduced them, as they lead in progression to each other: The discussion of Just Cause lays the basis for all subsequent discussions, so it should be explored first, and building trusting teams is the second-highest priority so should be discussed second. The other concepts then follow logically off those two.

When exploring Sinek’s ideas, we’ve sought to connect them to ideas in other works that either add to them and give them even more depth, or contradict them in some way. We’ve also explored examples that not only demonstrate Sinek’s concepts but add texture and additional insight.

We’ve kept some of his phrasing (for example, “Just Cause”) where it is central to his book and has no better phrase, but we’ve replaced phrases that might be better understood with different wording (for example, instead of discussing an “Existential Flex,” we talk about a “Pivot”).
