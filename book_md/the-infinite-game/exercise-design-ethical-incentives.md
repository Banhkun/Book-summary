## Exercise: Design Ethical Incentives

In an organization run with a finite mindset where employees are judged exclusively on their performance with no consideration given to how they achieved that performance, employees can feel pressure to hit their targets by cutting corners, bending rules, and making unethical decisions.

* * *

Think back to a work situation in which you felt compelled to cut corners or otherwise behave unethically in order to keep up with the performance of colleagues. What actions did you feel compelled to engage in? What outcome were you expecting by engaging in them?

What were the specific pressures that pushed you to behave unethically? How could those pressures have been better managed? (For instance, how might management have structured your incentives better to discourage unethical behavior?)
