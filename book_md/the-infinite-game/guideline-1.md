## Guideline 1: Advance a Just Cause

According to Sinek, an infinite mindset begins with a _Just Cause_. **A Just Cause is a big-picture vision that provides a framework for your corporate strategies.** It provides a context for all the decisions you’ll make. It inspires people to work hard and make sacrifices because they believe in the cause.

> **Southwest’s Just Cause Led Its Success**
> 
> Prior to the publication of _The Infinite Game_ , in a speech Sinek named Southwest Airlines as an example of a company with a Just Cause, because its mission went beyond just being an airline—it aimed to allow average people to afford to fly instead of driving or taking a bus somewhere.
> 
> Other management thinkers have also discussed how Southwest’s core purpose allowed it to succeed in oftentimes challenging circumstances, through industry upheavals and economic downturns. Greg McKeown explains in his book _Essentialism_ , that to stay true to its cause, Southwest made trade-offs so as not to get distracted by alternative ways it could serve its customers. Instead, Southwest stayed focused on what made it unique. For example, the company decided not to offer meals or upgraded seating, and to serve only a limited selection of airports. In this way it stayed true to its Just Cause and was able to make effective business decisions.

### What Is a Just Cause?

Sinek defines a Just Cause as a _specific_ vision of an _ideal state_ of the future that inspires people. Your Just Cause must paint a clear picture that others can see: A promise to “improve the world” doesn’t provide enough substance or specificity to inspire people. A Just Cause has five elements:

  1. It stands _for_ something, not _against_ something: It’s optimistic and hopeful.
  2. It’s idealistic: It’s inspiring, bold, and ultimately unachievable.
  3. It’s inclusive: It invites and inspires others to join.
  4. It’s resilient: It can endure technological, cultural, political, and industry changes.
  5. It’s service-oriented: It’s aimed at the benefit of others.



> **Panasonic’s Infinite-Minded Just Cause**
> 
> Panasonic is an example of a company with a corporate strategy that embodies each of the five elements of a Just Cause. In 1932, the company’s head, Kōnosuke Matsushita, laid out a 250-year vision based on the notion that the primary purpose of a business should be to increase human happiness. His strategy was to “overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods,” which would “banish poverty, bring happiness to people's lives and make this world into a paradise.”
> 
> This vision stood _for_ something, was _inclusive_ , was _service-oriented_ , was _resilient_ , and was _idealistic_. Today, the company’s vision has expanded and includes goals for helping the environment, helping communities, and being responsible. Its Just Cause has powered it for decades and positioned it strongly to face the future.
> 
> There is one aspect of Panasonic’s mission statement that doesn’t align with Sinek’s definition, though—it doesn’t paint a clear, specific picture of the future, but instead holds up a somewhat vague but lofty goal of “overcoming poverty.” Further, since Panasonic focuses on producing _electronic_ goods, their mission statement of “producing an abundant supply of goods” doesn’t exactly articulate their vision. A person reading the mission statement without knowing it was Panasonic’s would be unlikely to associate it with the company.
> 
> This analysis shows the limits of Sinek’s theories, and how in the real world, a company might find success even if they don’t follow Sinek’s exact prescription. Regardless, the important thing to note in examining Panasonic’s strategy is that the company thought about the long term and considered the wider world beyond their particular company when crafting their vision. Sinek would likely argue that the infinite aspect of that thinking is what’s kept them successful.

#### 1\. A Just Cause Stands _For_ Something, Not _Against_ Something

A Just Cause does not name something we want to work _against_ , but rather, something we want to work _for_. When people work _against_ something, they are often filled with some combination of fear and anger. In contrast, when people work _for_ something, they are filled with hope and optimism.

Working _against_ something leads to finite thinking because we focus on specific, known solutions to defined problems. Working _for_ something focuses us on the future and opens our eyes to alternative solutions that might bring us to our ideal state in any number of ways.

For example, if you encourage your team to beat your competitors by coming up with a better mousetrap, you frame their efforts as a struggle to a specified endpoint. If, however, you encourage your team to think about how homeowners can control disease vectors in their houses, the struggle isn’t framed as “winnable,” but rather, as something to continually work toward.

#### 2\. A Just Cause Is Idealistic

A Just Cause must be a big and bold enough idea to inspire people with a vision of the world that they want to work towards. Sinek cites the Declaration of Independence as a great example of idealism. Though the interpretation of the Declaration has changed over the years, the words continue to inspire people to reach for an ideal state. Its statement of universal rights was originally intended to protect the rights of white, landowning, Protestant men, but was soon applied to other groups—even George Washington discouraged discrimination against Catholics and later, the Constitution was updated to protect the rights of many others, including African Americans and women.

The ever-changing nature of how America is reflected by its founding values illustrates **a key characteristic of a Just Cause: Its mission is never fully accomplished.** Victories along the way should be celebrated as a glimpse into the future vision of the ideal state the Just Cause espouses, and the Cause should continue to inspire people to work towards it in ever-changing ways.

#### 3\. A Just Cause Is Inclusive

A Just Cause makes others feel included in its mission. People like to feel included in a group, such as a church or a team. A Just Cause that inspires people to imagine a positive alternative future can start movements by attracting people to join in with other like-minded believers.

> **How to Attract Followers With a Feeling of Inclusiveness**
> 
> Sinek is not the only management expert to recommend attracting followers by emphasizing a strong and inclusive team culture. For example, in his book _Zero to One_ , entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter Thiel (founder of PayPal) advises you to highlight your unique mission over superficial perks. He points out that perks like game rooms and yoga lunches get a lot of press, but to recruit talent to your company over a competitor’s, you must offer something more meaningful: a sense of purpose and belonging.
> 
>   * Talk about why your mission is unique and compelling.
> 
>   * Make them feel they’d fit in and enjoy working with their teammates.
> 
>   * Emphasize a common identity, even if that means issuing t-shirts with the company logo.
> 
> 

> 
> In the extreme, your organization can benefit by feeling slightly cult-like, where the employees are intensely dedicated to serving a greater truth in order to improve the world.

#### 4\. A Just Cause Is Resilient

A Just Cause can endure changes in the business, political, and technological landscapes. If your company revolves around a specific product, then your organization’s existence depends on those products staying relevant. But if your organization revolves around a Just Cause, you can stay infinitely relevant no matter how the environment changes; you will be able to see how and when your products need to be adjusted in order to continue to serve that Cause.

For example, had the railroad companies in the early 1900s seen themselves as transportation providers, dedicated to moving people around efficiently, rather than as companies that sold train tickets, they might have evolved into car companies during the advent of the automotive industry. Likewise, if music producers had seen themselves as distributors of music rather than sellers of CDs, they might have adapted better to the competitive challenges of digital streaming.

> **Using Vision Statements to Increase Resilience**
> 
> Management expert and bestselling authors Jim Collins and Jerry Porras discuss the higher causes driving companies in their book _Built to Last_ , which has the same goal as _The Infinite Game_ : helping leaders develop and maintain companies that will stay relevant and overcome years of challenges.
> 
> Quite a few of their theories overlap with Sinek’s. In particular, their discussion of vision statements offers additional insight into Sinek’s thoughts on _resilience_.
> 
> Collins and Porras point out that lasting companies have two sides to their vision statements:
> 
>   * A _core principle_ that gives them an overall mission
> 
>   * A more _practical principle_ that directs their actions on a more specific level but can be changeable
> 
> 

> 
> For example, a company might set out to “help students learn,” which would be their overriding, larger mission (their “Just Cause,” in Sinek’s terms). On a more practical level, they might have a mission of “offering tutoring services.” As their business evolves, they may change that more practical mission to “offering online video tutorials” or even “making documentaries,” and as long as the new direction fits with their core principle, they’re being true to their vision. The stability of the core principle combined with the flexibility of the practical principle increases the company’s resilience.

#### 5\. A Just Cause Is Service-Oriented

Every company or effort involves both _givers_ and _receivers_ —people who contribute their money, effort, or time (company leaders, investors, and employees), and people who benefit from it (customers, other citizens, and the wider world).

When a Just Cause is service-oriented, the _primary benefits_ of an organization’s efforts go to people other than the contributors themselves—this might be the company’s customers or it might be a worthwhile cause, such as saving the environment or alleviating poverty.

The customers of a service-oriented company feel genuinely cared about or genuinely care about the cause, and as a result, are often willing to pay a premium for that company’s products or services. Thus, in the long run, a company benefits from serving others.

It’s important to note that service orientation is not the same as charity.

  * In a charity, the _vast majority_ of an organization’s benefits go to the people on the receiving end. 
  * In a business, the _first_ benefits go to the receivers, but there are plenty of benefits left over for the contributors—those who contribute their time, money, and efforts to creating a product or service have every right to be fairly compensated.



> **TOMS Inspires Debate About the Power of a Just Cause**
> 
> The trajectory of the shoe and apparel maker TOMS allows for debate about how applicable Sinek’s theories are to the real world. In short, TOMS found great success—at first—because of its admirable Just Cause, but it was unable to capitalize on it over the long run.
> 
> The company was founded in 2006 under the vision statement, “For every pair of TOMS shoes purchased online or at retail, the company will provide a pair to a child in need. One for One,” with the goal of reducing the poverty-inducing effects of going shoeless (children who don’t have access to or can’t afford shoes are vulnerable to a host of health problems like parasites or infections that prevent them from attending school or working).
> 
> TOMS’s Just Cause inspired a fiercely loyal customer base and propelled the company to huge popularity, much media buzz, and endorsements from Hollywood celebrities. By 2014, the company was valued at $650 million. However, by 2019, it was unable to honor its debts and was taken over by a group of creditors.
> 
> **Why Did TOMS’s Just Cause Fail?**
> 
> Critics of Sinek might say this is proof that his theories don’t work in practical terms. They might point out that the company ran into typical business problems that a Just Cause couldn’t protect against, no matter how strongly it was conceived: Their shoe design was easy to copy, as was their mission statement, and both were adopted by other firms. For example, Skechers released a look-alike product under the name BOBS and donated _two_ pairs of shoes to children for every pair sold.
> 
> However, defenders of Sinek’s theories might argue that **the Just Cause of TOMS didn’t adequately satisfy each of the elements of Sinek’s theory** , and therefore is a poor example to judge his theories by. Their Just Cause did meet four of the requirements: It stood _for_ something, it was _idealistic_ , it was _inclusive_ , and it was _service-oriented_. But it didn’t prove _resilient_.
> 
> Did it lack resilience because it was too specific and limited? Some observers note that TOMS became inextricably linked to its initial product—a simple canvas shoe—and was unable to successfully branch out into new products, despite its efforts (it launched many different styles of shoe, a line of sunglasses, and a line of coffee). This reflects an over-emphasis on their initial shoe-based mission that limited their ability to pivot.
> 
> **TOMS Lacked a Core Mission**
> 
> Looking at the company’s story through the lens of Collins and Porras’s _Built to Last_ , it seems that TOMS had a solid _practical_ mission but was missing a _core, overall mission_ that would have allowed their practical mission to evolve more easily. They ran into trouble because their original mission was too specific (donating shoe for shoe), rather than more general (helping children escape poverty).
> 
> Today, TOMS has an amended mission. Instead of donating shoes, it donates one-third of its profits to charities, which allows it more flexibility in how its efforts are directed. It’s possible that this pivot will make their cause more resilient and allow the company to continue playing the “game” indefinitely.
> 
> Regardless, the company has left its mark on the industry. It was the first for-profit firm to pioneer the “sell one, give one” business model, and it has inspired many socially-minded companies to follow. It therefore might be argued that it fulfilled its Just Cause by inspiring others to take it up.

### What _Isn’t_ a Just Cause?

Sinek points out that there are times when a leader intends to adopt a Just Cause but does so improperly. In these cases, a vision or strategy resembles a Just Cause but is actually a finite-minded goal.

There are a number of reasons a leader might think a finite goal is a Just Cause. False Just Causes include:

  * Lofty goals (a “moon shot”)
  * Beating the competition
  * Growth 
  * Corporate social responsibility 



While each of these points is something a leader can and should incorporate into her overall strategy, none of them is a true Just Cause. None will prepare a company for long-term success in an infinite game.

We’ll cover each of these elements further in the sections below.

#### A Lofty Goal Is Not a Just Cause

Sinek emphasizes that you shouldn’t confuse a Just Cause with a lofty goal. A lofty goal is a finite goal—a specific objective with a defined time frame and end. A Just Cause is infinite. As you’re working towards your Just Cause, you might incorporate a lofty goal, but you must recognize it as only a step towards your larger purpose, instead of as the cause itself.

Another word for a lofty goal is a “moon shot,” named after John F. Kennedy’s goal of putting a man on the moon in the 1960s. Moon shots often have many of the elements of a Just Cause—for example, Kennedy’s goal of a moon landing:

  * Was specific
  * Worked _for_ something, in an affirmative way
  * Was inclusive, engaging the imaginations of all Americans
  * Was service-oriented, benefiting scientific advancement and national unity
  * Inspired sacrifice, through the hard work and dedication of many professionals



However, Sinek points out that Kennedy’s goal was a finite one within a larger, infinite game. Kennedy alluded to this larger vision when he explained the reason behind his lofty goal: “There is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.”

(Shortform note: Critics have pointed out that Sinek’s categorization of the Cold War as an infinite game is flawed, as war or violence of any kind is inherently finite-minded. Further, the Cold War was clearly fought to a finite end—the breakup of the Soviet Union. Sinek argues that the Cold War was infinite because neither side truly envisioned the total destruction of the other, and therefore neither side expected the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, it might be said that both sides _were_ fighting for the total destruction of the other’s political and economic system, and that the Cold War was a finite game within a larger infinite game of the continued relations between the countries.)

> **An Opposing View on Moon Shots**
> 
> _Built to Last_ ’s Collins and Porras have a different view on lofty, “moon shot” goals. They call them “Big Hairy Audacious Goals,” or “BHAGS.” Unlike Sinek, they argue that BHAGs can and should be central to a company’s strategy. They contend that a finite goal like _crushing the competition_ or _securing the top spot in an industry_ is a perfectly good company purpose that can lead to lasting success. What matters, they suggest, is that your company _has_ an audacious goal that can motivate your workforce.
> 
> They point to the example of Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, to illustrate their theory. Welch’s mission was “To become #1 or #2 in every market” and “to have the speed and agility of a small enterprise.” Collins and Porras laud these goals as inspiring BHAGs that successfully motivated the workforce.
> 
> In contrast, Sinek argues that lofty goals are not enough to stand in for a company’s larger purpose. To illustrate his argument, Sinek also discusses Jack Welch, but he has a different takeaway. During Welch’s tenure, when some employees voiced concern that GE was overly focused on short-term priorities, Welch replied that “Long term is just a series of short terms.” Sinek argues that this attitude confuses a Just Cause with a series of moon shots, but that **a string of moon shots is not, in and of itself, a Just Cause.**
> 
> Further, although Sinek doesn’t specifically mention it, Welch’s BHAGs that Collins and Porras admire violate several elements of the definition of a Just Cause—they’re _against_ something (the competition) rather than _for_ something, they don’t paint a clear picture (what exactly does the speed and agility of a small enterprise look like?), and they focus on the _company’s_ success rather than benefits for the _customer_ (they don't create a vision of an improved future for _other_ people).
> 
> Of course, when judging Welch’s statements, Sinek had the advantage of hindsight. Collins and Porras published their book in 1994, at the height of GE’s success. After Welch stepped down from his role as CEO in 2001, the company started to run into trouble, and in 2018, it was delisted from the DOW Jones Industrial Average. It seems clear now that GE’s success in the 1990s was largely due to the specific, finite thinking of Welch himself, which didn’t set the company up for long-term success that would outlast Welch’s personal leadership.

#### Beating the Competition Is Not a Just Cause

Sinek also cautions that many leaders mistake becoming “the best” or offering “the best products” in their industry as a Just Cause. Unfortunately, this type of goal is too broad and too vague to offer useful guidance.

Further, it violates the first element of a Just Cause: to stand _for_ something, not _against_ something (it positions the company or their products as against the competition). It also violates the fifth element (being service-oriented), as it encourages an organization to focus on _itself_ instead of on its customers, who should be its primary beneficiaries.

**Additionally, a company aiming to be “the best” will often focus exclusively on the strength of its existing product line,** and will defend that product line as if the products themselves are their Just Cause. Unfortunately, without a higher purpose, your company becomes dependent on your product staying relevant, which leaves you unable to effectively adapt when changes come along (which they inevitably will).

> **Success Can Be a Trap**
> 
> Focusing on being “the best” can lead a company to fall into the “success trap,” where they grow complacent if they spend a lot of time as the industry leader. Polaroid is an example of a company that succumbed to its own success. For many years, it dominated the instant-film category, with little need to innovate. It didn’t anticipate how disruptive digital cameras would be for its business, and the company declared bankruptcy in 2001.

#### Growth Is Not a Just Cause

Many leaders aim to _grow_ their organizations, as if growth itself is a reason for existence. They fill their corporate “strategies” with benchmarks and milestones to measure that growth—hitting certain sales targets or profit margins—and mistakenly believe they’ve put together a worthy cause. But this is like deciding to build a huge building and establishing milestones for how many bricks you’ll lay per day without thinking about what the building will be used for.

Too much growth too quickly can weaken a company if it spreads its resources too thinly in order to meet arbitrary growth targets. For example, if you open 150 new locations but don’t have the resources to adequately train your new staff in each one, those locations are less likely to thrive.

Further, investors’ expectations of growth can be particularly unrealistic for mature companies. Young companies naturally experience higher growth rates as their products and services are adopted, but as a company matures and its products or services saturate a market, its growth naturally slows.

In the face of slower, more mature growth, executives often try to spur growth again through mergers and acquisitions. Unfortunately, more often than not, this growth strategy doesn’t lead to success.

> **Growth Should Be About Giving as Well as Taking**
> 
> To prove his point, Sinek quotes a report from Harvard Business Review that finds that 70 to 90 percent of all company mergers fail. The report attributes this to a simple insight: When companies focus on what they’ll _get_ from an acquisition, they‘re less likely to succeed than if they focus on what they’ll _give_ to it.
> 
> For example, when Microsoft bought Nokia’s handset business for $7.9 billion in 2014, only to write off 96% of the company the next year, it was hoping to profit off of the smartphone hardware business but had no expertise of its own to offer. It was looking for what it could _get_ , not what it could _give_.
> 
> Companies that merge successfully with another work because the acquiring company has something of value to offer the acquired company—it’s more _give_ than _get_. For example, when Google took over Android in 2005, it gave Android development expertise the smaller company didn’t have access to otherwise. Berkshire Hathaway is another example; it has a track record of improving the companies it acquires by enhancing its management systems.
> 
> These concepts are discussed in depth in Adam Grant’s book, _Give and Take_ , which argues that in both business and personal life, people who aim to _give_ to a relationship ironically end up benefiting more from it. This idea dovetails with Sinek’s view that business relationships thrive when the parties involved are looking out for more than their own immediate interests.

Sinek argues that investors and executives would be better off viewing growth as a result of a healthy organization, not a cause of such health. Additionally, they should recognize that growth must have a purpose—your goal shouldn’t be just “to get bigger” for the sake of getting bigger. Growth must serve a larger vision—some ideal that you need size to accomplish.

#### A Corporate Social Responsibility Program Is Not a Just Cause

Sometimes, leaders will have corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs that do things like fund food banks, support walkathons, and allow paid time off so employees can volunteer. They may believe that because CSR programs serve a higher purpose, they are themselves Just Causes. Sinek maintains that all of these initiatives are worthwhile and should be part of any company’s operations, but a true Just Cause _centers_ the company’s existence around a higher purpose—the higher purpose is not a secondary, tacked-on element, as CSR programs often are. Unless the Just Cause is central to a company’s reason for existing and focuses the direction of the CSR program, the company may have CSR programs but at the same time emphasize finite goals and selfish purposes in their main businesses.

Sinek points out that some leaders say they want to “make money to do good,” in other words, they want to be financially successful and then they’ll give back to the community. However, Sinek argues they should in fact try to “do good while making money”—in other words, reorder the thought to put the “good” first, so that you focus on doing good by treating people well and only secondarily, focus on building a financially strong company.

> **The Difficulty of Identifying Sincere CSR Programs**
> 
> One limitation of CSR programs that Sinek indirectly addresses is the fact that many such programs are little more than virtue signaling, aimed at customers and potential employees who increasingly value corporate responsibility and sustainability. It can be difficult to know, when companies are loudly advertising their CSR programs, which ones are central to a company’s mission and which are merely public relations.
> 
> The problem is compounded by the fact that companies are finding it increasingly beneficial to advertise their CSR. While older studies showed little to no correlation between CSR and profits, more recent studies show significant links between a company’s advertised CSR programs and its performance—for example, when a company advertises itself as a socially responsible firm, it attracts more productive, effective workers at lower wages. Recognizing this, more and more firms are declaring themselves do-gooders, and observers are cautioning that it can be difficult to tell which firms are sincere.

### A Just Cause Requires the Right Leader

Choosing who leads your organization can be the difference between long-term survival or failure. If your Chief Executive Officer (CEO) does not have an infinite mindset, she is not going to lead your company through its infinite game properly. Unfortunately, finding the right leader can be very difficult.

> A report from Harvard Business Review highlights the difficulty of finding the right leader. Research reveals that up to one-half of new CEOs fail within 18 months of taking on the job. This holds true whether or not the CEO was recruited from outside or from within the organization.

#### Look for a Chief Vision Officer

Sinek recommends looking for a “CVO” (Chief Vision Officer) rather than a CEO. Other executives—Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and so on—have the luxury of being finite-minded, since they are tasked with dealing with specific issues within their departments. But the CEO must focus on the company’s Just Cause and vision above all else.

The different visionary requirements of a CEO as compared to other executives can lead to problems when a CEO steps down and one of those other executives takes her place. Sometimes, a person who functioned excellently in a more finite role has difficulty adjusting to the infinite mindset needed for the top position, and they lose sight of their Just Cause.

> **A COO Who Couldn’t Transfer Skills to CEO**
> 
> The trajectory of Jill Barad, CEO of Mattel from 1997 to 2000, illustrates how difficult it is for finite-minded executives to become infinite-minded CEOs, even if those executives had been successful in their previous roles. Barad was promoted to CEO from the roles of President and Chief Operating Officer, and she had previously overseen the Barbie line to great success.
> 
> However, as CEO, she was unable to see the bigger picture. She remained intensely involved in minute details of the Barbie division (even overseeing designs of the dolls), and she proved overly attached to outdated strategies: When Mattel acquired The Learning Company (TLC), she insisted on using promotional techniques that had worked well for Barbie, ignoring the fact that educational software is distributed, marketed, and sold in very different ways than are dolls. The purchase of TLC cost Mattel millions of dollars in a single year. In 2000 she stepped down.
> 
> While Barad’s lack of vision certainly played a role in her failure as CEO, there may also have been other contributing factors. Many observers have reported that she was unwilling to tolerate dissenting opinions and many senior executives left because of the difficult atmosphere she fostered. Further, the birth of the internet posed an unexpected and industry-disrupting challenge to the success of TLC, which sold computer games on disk through big-box stores. This points to the limits of Sinek’s theories: There is often more than one factor contributing to failure—or to success, for that matter.
