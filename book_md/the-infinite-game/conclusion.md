## Conclusion: Changes Are Coming

Sinek notes that people are starting to question Friedman’s philosophies about business existing only to serve an elite class of owners, and are starting to recognize that there are other important reasons that companies exist.

Part of what’s driving this change is a rethink of the role of shareholders in a corporation. While economists and investors talk about shareholders as if they are owners of a company (because technically, they are), a more accurate analogy would be to think of shareholders as _renters_ , rather than _owners_. Watch any show advising people on stocks and it’s clear that the analysts are giving people advice on how to buy and flip a stock, rather than how to find a stock for long-term ownership.

To build resilient companies equipped for the infinite game, leaders need to stop thinking of shareholders as owners to whom the company owes everything, and instead start thinking of them as just one contributor among other contributors. Investors contribute funds, employees contribute time and energy, customers contribute sales that keep the company afloat, and suppliers and the larger economy contribute the infrastructure the company uses to operate. Companies need to make decisions with all of these various contributors in mind, not only shareholders, in order to create long-lasting, resilient organizations.

> **Changing Times**
> 
> The publication of Sinek’s book coincided with changing cultural attitudes towards capitalism and the purpose of corporations. In his book, Sinek points to the rise of organizations devoted to helping guide companies to more infinite-minded visions, like Conscious Capitalism and The B Team as proof of such a cultural shift. He says to successfully become more infinite-minded, corporations must replace Friedman’s narrow-minded focus on profits with a more inclusive three-pronged focus:
> 
>   * Purpose (a Just Cause)
> 
>   * People (employees, customers, and people living around us)
> 
>   * Profits (which are necessary to make possible the first two elements)
> 
> 

> 
> We can see this more infinite-minded view of corporate strategy growing in popularity. B Corporations that require companies to adhere to social and environmental priorities are becoming more common, and in 2019, a coalition of around 200 executives of leading American firms signed on to a statement saying the purpose of business is no longer primarily to serve shareholders, but instead to serve all Americans, including customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and the wider community.
> 
> Many of the participating leaders released statements noting how important it has become to consider the long-term and wider implications of business decisions. As we move deeper into the 21st century, Sinek’s theories continue to both reflect and influence a growing movement towards infinite thinking.
