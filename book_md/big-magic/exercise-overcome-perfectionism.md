## Exercise: Overcome Perfectionism

Learn to counter perfectionism and perfectionistic thoughts.

* * *

Describe a time in the past two weeks when you felt you were being perfectionistic or demanding more of yourself than realistically possible. (For example, did you agonize over a work presentation, trying to get it just right?)

Thinking back to that incident, describe the thoughts going through your head. What sorts of worries or convictions compelled you to try to achieve an unrealistic goal? What did your self-talk sound like? (Using the work presentation example, perhaps you worried that you would lose your job or that your boss would be angry with you if your presentation wasn’t perfect.)

Now, dig a little deeper into those thoughts. Try to see them as a reflection of your thoughts about _yourself_. Why did you hold yourself to an impossibly high standard at that moment? Why did you think you must be able to accomplish the impossible? (You may have believed that anything less than perfection meant you were a bad worker.)

Finally, if you could go back in time to this moment of perfectionistic behavior and assuage your fears, how would you do it? What are some words of kindness or reassurance you could offer yourself? (For example, you may tell your past self: “You’re no less competent than any other employee at this company.”)
