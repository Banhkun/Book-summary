## Exercise: Overcome Creative Obstacles

Identify and plan how to overcome your main external and internal creative obstacles.

* * *

Describe your creative work habits. What are your strengths, and, more importantly, your weaknesses as a creator? (For instance, you may habitually procrastinate, but have excellent focus when you do get to work.)

Now, think of some common _external_ obstacles you encounter when creating. What disturbances tend to get in your way of creating? (These can be as mundane as poor internet connection or as significant as having kids to tend to.) List as many as possible.

For each weakness and external obstacle on your list, describe an active way to overcome or circumvent it. (For example, if you procrastinate, you might consider setting up a support group that holds you accountable for meeting deadlines.)

Now, describe how you might be able to change your internal expectations of yourself to shrink the obstacle. (If you’re a serial procrastinator, maybe you need to make peace with that and just enjoy the time you’re avoiding working, rather than feeling bad about yourself.)
