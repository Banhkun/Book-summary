## Exercise: Find New Creative Time Slots

Create a sustainable creative schedule by finding new times to create.

* * *

Describe a time in the past month when you felt stressed or “pinched” around your creative work because you didn’t have enough time for it. Be specific about why you felt you didn’t have enough time—what was your obstacle?

Reflect on your daily, weekly, and monthly schedules, referring to your calendar, if possible. Which time slots do you often find yourself filling with mindless “busy work” (like social media scrolling or email-checking)? Note those time slots here and what you do during them.

Now, consider how you might fill these currently mindless timeslots with creative work. Create a list of action items that could help you to do this. (Would you, for example, need to bring along a pad and pen on your commute or set a timer while dinner cooks so you can leave the kitchen to work on a project?)
