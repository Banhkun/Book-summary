## Exercise: Understand and Acknowledge Your Creative Fears

Learn to create effectively with your fears in hand.

* * *

Describe some fears or anxieties you have around creating. (Are you, for instance, afraid of not executing an idea well?) Be as detailed as possible.

Now that you’ve listed some fears, acknowledge those fears by writing down why they may be valid. (Remember, Gilbert doesn’t recommend _eradicating_ fears. She instead advises that you acknowledge them as necessary parts of the creative process.) For instance, if you wrote down “I’m afraid of not executing an idea well,” your validation of that fear might be: “I care about this idea and want to do it justice.”

Next, write down how you can continue to create _in spite of_ that fear. What affirmation can you tell yourself that will allow you to circumvent the fear and keep creating? (Continuing with the example of a fear of not executing an idea well, you might write: “It’s the creative journey, not the destination, that counts. If I enjoy my time on an idea, I can consider that a success.”)
