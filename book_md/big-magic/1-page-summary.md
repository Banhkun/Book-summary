## 1-Page Summary

_Big Magic_ is author Elizabeth Gilbert’s guide to **leading a more fulfilled life by making creativity, in any guise that suits you, a part of your daily existence.** The book offers both spiritual wisdom on how to work with the magical forces of creativity, as well as suggestions on how to create effectively and productively. Gilbert draws on her successful career as a writer, best known for her 2006 memoir _Eat Pray Love,_ and her advice is aimed toward anyone who has a creative bent.

In the book, Gilbert outlines her unique definitions around creativity, including the concept of “Big Magic” (or, as we’ll call it for clarity, Creative Sorcery). She elaborates on how to work effectively with Creative Sorcery before describing how to embark on a creative journey and keep your creative momentum up over the long term.

### Defining Creativity, Creative Sorcery, and Ideas

Gilbert defines creativity as **the search for and excavation of universe-endowed gifts that are within us, hidden from our view.** Our gifts are the talents, interests, and desires that make us _us._ You can have a gift for anything—stargazing, website design, or mushroom hunting, for instance—not just a traditionally artistic pursuit, like painting, writing, or performing.

Notice that Gilbert does not define creativity as a professional pursuit or even as the main goal or mission of one’s life. It’s simply a commitment to exploring your depths and bringing to light the powers that exist within you.

> **Other Definitions of Creativity**
> 
> Gilbert’s conception of creativity for this book is unique, perhaps because seasoned creators develop idiosyncratic definitions of this concept. If Gilbert’s definition doesn’t fully resonate with you, fellow writer Amy Tan has her own definition, which she presented in a popular TED Talk. Tan feels her creativity is the product of her upbringing, the big questions that preoccupy and interest her, and her quest to derive meaning from the world.
> 
> Steve Jobs’s definition of creativity was different still: He said that creativity was just a matter of forming novel connections. For Jobs, magic and mysticism figured far less into creativity than for Tan and Gilbert. As a creator, you may wish to come up with a definition of creativity that most resonates in your life.

#### A Creative Life Gives You Access to Creative Sorcery

According to Gilbert, the central reason to develop your creativity is to come in touch with Creative Sorcery.**In Gilbert’s view, Creative Sorcery is a mystical or spiritual force of creativity.** This force is bigger than us and cannot be explained scientifically or proven empirically. It is an eternal cosmic entity that creatives must have faith in.

For Gilbert, coming into contact with Creative Sorcery is a transcendent experience. Touching Creative Sorcery lets you be moved by and interact with something greater than yourself. This communion with a higher creative energy constitutes the chief goal of Gilbert’s life.

> **Other Forms of Spiritual Enlightenment**
> 
> Gilbert’s vision of touching Creative Sorcery has a lot in common with the search for spiritual enlightenment which humans all around the world and in all faith traditions seek out, either to stimulate creativity or to experience more general spiritual relief. Sufi Muslims, for example, perform a whirling dance to escape the confines of their egos, commune with God, and become spiritually perfect.
> 
> Outside of faith, some use mind-altering drugs to come into contact with something bigger than themselves and even to enhance their creativity. Research has shown that psychoactive substances don’t activate creativity, but do make drug-takers more sensitive and open to stimuli, which can indirectly lead to greater creativity.

##### Creative Sorcery Communicates Through Ideas

Gilbert states that Creative Sorcery is trying at all times to contact humans to help them bring their creativity into the world. **One way Creative Sorcery communicates with humans is through ideas**. Gilbert envisions ideas as living entities, capable of self-sustained activity. Ideas move around space, seeking humans who will take them on and give them life.

According to Gilbert, humans do not give rise to ideas: Ideas exist independently of us. This means that ideas are free to come and go as they please. You may find yourself visited by an idea and then deserted by it.

> **The Neurological Explanation for Ideas**
> 
> Gilbert’s description of what ideas are and how they operate comes from a magical perspective. Science, meanwhile, has a different explanation.
> 
> According to researchers at the University of Haifa, creative ideas come into existence when two separate and possibly opposing brain networks are activated. These networks are the “associative” region and the “conservative” region. The associative region seems to be linked to originality, while the conservative region may be associated with adhering to social norms and rules. Thus, it seems that when both originality and an awareness of social regulations come together, the best ideas are produced.
> 
> This neurological explanation for ideation is at odds with Gilbert’s belief that humans don’t give rise to ideas and that they “visit” us; instead, it seems they’re formed, and stay, within us.

### Embarking on Your Creative Journey

Now that you understand what Gilbert’s visions of creativity, Creative Sorcery, and ideas are, you can start creating, she says. But before you jump into a project, there may be some mindset adjustments to make to ensure your process is as smooth and joyous as possible:

#### Accept Your Fear

One of the first things you must do as you begin your creative journey, says Gilbert,**** is**find a way to manage your fear.** She believes fear is omnipresent when we are trying to be creative. This is because fear’s main purpose is to protect us in situations of uncertainty, and, unfortunately, the creative process is full of uncertainty.

(Shortform note: There is a specific condition called “fear of the unknown,” or FOTU, which seems to be the type of fear Gilbert talks about here. The anxiety generated by fear of the unknown may be the scientific explanation for why we pull away from creative projects: When we’re burdened by worry about how a project might turn out, the easiest choice is often just to drop the project. FOTU may underpin all human anxiety and neuroticism—mental events that can make it impossible to simply function in daily life.)

To deal with your fear gracefully, Gilbert recommends **making space alongside your creativity for your fear** , so that they can comfortably coexist. Treat fear as a friend.

(Shortform note: Gilbert recommends making space for your fear, but doesn’t offer specific suggestions on how to do this. One option may be to **practice mindfulness**. Mindfulness allows you to accept what is going on in your mind and body rather than struggle with it. It’s a way to achieve a clarity of vision that allows you to accept your fears and let them be.)

#### Focus Only on the Journey

As you approach a project, Gilbert also stresses that **your enjoyment of the creative journey should be your only focus.** Let go of any goals or desired outcomes and prioritize the process.

According to Gilbert, if you create to receive external validation or to achieve something particular, you make your creativity contingent upon forces outside of your control. You’re much more likely to give up your pursuit, then, if you don’t achieve your goals.

> **Approaching All of Life as a Journey**
> 
> Gilbert’s notion that we should only enjoy the creative process and not hope for even some small form of external validation or achievement can seem unrealistic. Even the most high-minded creator surely longs for some praise or acknowledgment of their work, right?
> 
> Yet cultural commentators agree with Gilbert: **Focus on the journey of life, not on the attainment of external displays of success and value**. Columnist David Brooks argues that striving to accrue societally-endorsed markers of achievement—job titles, degrees from prestigious universities, accolades—only leaves you with a feeling of emptiness when they’ve all been obtained. Brooks instead suggests you embark on a lifelong quest for connection and meaning.

#### Don’t Be Creative to Earn Money

Gilbert also specifically advises against being creative to earn a living. Practically speaking, she says, creative work can rarely pay bills. Relying on your creative pursuits to keep you afloat may leave you in dire financial straits, which may force you to give up your creative work altogether.

(Shortform note: The (incorrect, according to Gilbert) belief that our creativity should support us financially has only come about relatively recently. For most of history, creators—especially artists—had jobs that had nothing to do with their creative work. Some held jobs that were entirely unrelated to their creative work (like repair jobs), some used creative skills for commercial purposes (a writer might have worked for an advertising agency), and others still worked in fields that they could mine for their creative work (like working for the NYC subway). There is thus a historical precedent for creators supporting themselves other than through their creative work.)

#### Cooperate With a New Idea

Finally, when your first idea visits you, work _with_ it, insists Gilbert. Don’t fret over the idea, fight with it, or put it off (which are all common responses). Think of your idea as a human creative partner, and treat it with dignity and respect.

Gilbert says that in practice, this might mean getting more rest, so you’re more alert, and setting aside uninterrupted time to work with the idea, so you’re more productive. It also might mean building a healthy mindset toward your process: appreciating the journey, rather than worrying about the outcome, and allowing yourself moments of satisfaction when something has turned out well.

> **Other Ways to Cooperate With Your Ideas**
> 
> Gilbert advises you to cooperate more effectively with your ideas by resting, increasing your productivity, and building a healthy mindset. But these suggestions may not be realistic for everyone. For instance, people with busy careers or children may not have the time to rest more or become more productive. Further, changing your mindset isn’t a quick fix; it can take time and hard work.
> 
> Daniel Pink’s _Drive_ offers alternative ways to effectively cooperate with ideas _._ Pink suggests that developing intrinsic motivation, the urge to do something because you want to, not because you might receive external validation, is the key to accomplishing high-quality creative work—in other words, cooperating with an idea.
> 
> Intrinsic motivation can form when you have autonomy over what you’re doing, the opportunity for mastery or improvement, and a solid purpose—a “why.” To cooperate with an idea, therefore, ensure that you control how you execute it, can learn and grow from the idea, and feel a strong sense of purpose in the pursuit of this idea.

### Dealing With Creative Challenges

Having embarked on a creative journey, you’re bound to encounter creative obstacles, asserts Gilbert. She describes ways you can cope with them gracefully:

#### Make Peace With Irritations

First, Gilbert claims that **no matter what creative pursuit you take on, there will always be attending annoyances**.**** A circus performer, for instance, must contend with physical danger. A bird watcher must deal with the reasonable chance of not seeing any birds. A world traveler must cope with jet lag.

Instead of railing against or trying to avoid pain points, view them as equally integral to your job as the high points, says Gilbert. Developing an ability to cope with irritants and unpleasantness is as much a part of your job as a creator as actually creating.

> **Meditation Can Help Cope With Difficulties**
> 
> Gilbert suggests viewing irritation as part of your job as a creator, but she doesn’t offer concrete suggestions on how to develop that perspective. This is where meditation may help: Some meditations help you see difficult thoughts and life experiences as waves in a broader sea of life. In meditation, you learn how to avoid clinging to these negative thoughts or feelings. Instead, you let them pass through your mind without staying there and becoming a mental burden.
> 
> Meditation also teaches you that you can’t stop negative thoughts or feelings from happening. You can’t prevent anger or irritation from arising when a creative project isn’t going your way, for instance. But you can change how you relate to those thoughts and whether or not you allow them to affect your attitude or your engagement with your work.

#### Don’t Fall for Perfectionism

According to Gilbert, one of the greatest mental obstacles to creativity is perfectionism. She believes that**no matter how hard you try, you will never be able to attain perfection** : There will always be a way someone can find your work lacking. It’s therefore pointless to strive for perfection and better just to create something imperfect and put it into the world.

To Gilbert, perfectionism is a nefarious psychological ailment because it appears to be a good thing: You seem to simply be holding yourself to a high standard. But in reality, perfectionism is a manifestation of the fear of not being worthy.**** You don’t believe that you deserve to exist as you are and therefore put the onus on your work to earn you that right by being perfect.

If you let it, says Gilbert, perfectionism can stop a project dead in its tracks or prevent you from even starting it for fear it won’t be perfect, and that is the worst possible way to honor an idea.

> **Brené Brown’s Take on Perfectionism**
> 
> Brené Brown discusses perfectionism at length in her book, _The Gifts of Imperfection,_ diving more deeply than Gilbert into the psychological underpinning of perfectionism _._
> 
> Brown states, like Gilbert, that perfectionism is founded on the belief that you aren’t inherently good enough. But Brown goes on to claim that perfectionism isn’t just a way to earn your right to exist, it’s also a way to control how others perceive you. Perfectionists don’t want to be seen as different or aberrant, so they work extra hard to project normalcy and perfection. This kicks off a vicious cycle: Because you will never succeed in appearing perfect all the time, you blame and shame yourself for not conforming. This shame leads you to try even harder to be perfect, which you, again, cannot succeed at. Perfectionism thus negatively impacts your life in every way.
> 
> Brown agrees with Gilbert that ultimately, striving for perfection is pointless, and she recommends that you be compassionate with yourself to fight perfectionism. Don’t try to hide your imperfections or punish yourself for having them. Instead, embrace them through, for instance, positive self-talk.

#### Don’t Let Others Define You

Gilbert writes that a final mental challenge many creators face is the input and feelings of others about their work. Others will inevitably form opinions of and try to categorize your work, **but you must not let those opinions or labels affect how or what you create**. The need to categorize and label is an inherent human trait. You cannot change that and you cannot fight off every label or opinion others try to assign to you, writes Gilbert. All you can do is to make what you want to make. Everything that comes after is out of your hands.

(Shortform note: The impulse to label and categorize people, concepts, and things is innate to humans, as Gilbert suggests. What’s more, when you’re assigned a trait, others will come to see you as having more of that trait than you did before the assignation. Similarly, you will become less associated with a different trait. For instance, if you’re categorized as “avant-garde,” you’ll be seen as more avant-garde than you were before, and also less, for example, “classical.” Gilbert is therefore right to caution against letting others’ labels define you. If you let labels determine how you see yourself, you cede your right to create what you want to those labels—labels which will only become more restrictive over time.)

### Maintaining Your Creative Momentum Over the Long Term

Now that you can create effectively and overcome barriers, Gilbert recommends setting up a fulfilling, ongoing creative practice. She describes several ways to do this:

#### Hunt for Your Creative Time

The first way to stay creative indefinitely is to **be willing to hunt for creative time** , says Gilbert**.** Throughout history, creators have never had enough time to be creative. To cope with this dearth of resources, Gilbert advises thinking outside the box about when you can squeeze in an hour or half-hour for your work. You can accomplish a lot in “between times:” during lunch, before bed, on your commute.

(Shortform note: Gilbert’s advice to hunt for snippets of creative time isn’t the only approach out there to effective time management. In _The 5 AM Club_ Robin Sharma proposes an alternative approach to maximizing your potential each day: Sharma suggests you firmly claim the hour between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. for yourself. This is what he calls the “Victory Hour,” a time before others have risen and when your responsibilities have not yet come crashing down on you. Sharma suggests specific activities to do in your Victory Hour (exercise, reflect, and grow), but you could seize the Victory Hour for your creative work.)

#### Be Inquisitive About Everything

To stay creative over months and years, Gilbert also advocates a **policy of gentle inquisitiveness about everything**. This lets you contact Creative Sorcery and reignite your creative flame at times when your inspiration inevitably falters.

As stated in Chapter 2, Creative Sorcery is at all times leaving clues to assist you in your creative work. Gilbert believes that when you adopt a policy of inquisitiveness, you’re more likely to notice and follow these clues. When followed, they can eventually lead you to a new creative pursuit.

> **How Inquisitiveness Fuels Creativity**
> 
> Gilbert argues that by being inquisitive, you notice more clues Creative Sorcery leaves you. But you could also view this phenomenon from a rational standpoint. If you’re inquisitive—in other words, pay attention to the world around you—you’re more likely to notice interesting things that can inspire you. Paying attention also leads to improved memory function, meaning you remember details that can come into play in your creative work. Furthermore, you build your capacity for patience when you pay attention, which in turn fosters contemplativeness, an attitude that’s helpful in creative work.
> 
> Therefore, Creative Sorcery doesn’t have to be seen as a _guide_ that _leads_ you to inspiration. Just by noticing, you can inspire yourself.

#### Frame Failure as “Interesting”

As a long-term creator, writes Gilbert, **learn how to reframe all your work, and in particular your creative misses, as “interesting.”** All creative output, no matter how beloved or reviled, can be seen through a certain lens as “interesting” and educative.

Gilbert notes that a mindset that frames everything as “interesting” encourages you to wonder what can be improved. A “good vs. bad” mindset, conversely, doesn’t encourage growth. It instead encourages giving up if you produce “bad” work.

> **Cult Films: The Ultimate “Interesting” Creative Work**
> 
> Gilbert stresses the importance of framing your work as “interesting,” rather than as “good” or “bad.” For examples of this reframing in our culture, we can look to cult films. Cult films often were not well received initially but garnered a following in subsequent years because there is something in them that piques audiences’ interest. _Plan 9 From Outer Space _and _The Rocky Horror Picture Show _are iconic examples of such films: _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ in particular piqued the interest of LGBT communities at a time when gay rights were becoming an important political and cultural topic.
> 
> Seeing all creative work as “interesting” rather than “good” or “bad” is thus not an impossibly high-minded perspective to take. It’s a view we as a society take all the time toward the creations of others.

#### Never View Anything as Sacred

Gilbert’s final recommendation for being creative in the long term is to**never view your creativity or your creative output as sacred.** Nothing you make is ever final or perfect or a “crowning achievement,” writes Gilbert. You may well create something far superior in the future, or you may never create anything quite as good ever again. It doesn’t matter either way, as long as you continue to enjoy the process.

(Shortform note: Avoiding seeing your work as sacred is a good habit that can trickle down into your practical creative decisions. The concept of “killing your darling” is an example of an everyday application of eschewing sacredness: When creating, we can feel that we have made a “darling,” a piece of a larger work that we feel is particularly clever. However, there may come a time when you have to eliminate, or kill, that darling in service of the greater work. For instance, when writing a novel, you may write a scene that you particularly love, but that ultimately doesn’t serve the wider plot. If you, as Gilbert suggests, refrain from seeing that piece as “sacred,” it will be much easier to cut it.)
