## Chapter 6: Learning to Survive

A year later, Jeannette was alone in the house when a knock came at the door. She cracked it open and saw an official-looking man on the porch with a folder under one arm. **He said he was from child welfare, and they’d received a complaint from someone about child neglect in the home.** He said it was his department’s job to investigate.

Jeannette was furious at whoever had called child welfare. If they deemed their family unfit, she and her siblings would be separated into different foster homes. She pulled the door almost shut so he couldn’t see inside. She told him that Rex worked all the time and was an entrepreneur developing a system for burning low-grade coal. She said Rose Mary was an artist and teacher and that everything was fine. The man gave her a business card and left.

When Rose Mary came home, Jeannette turned her anger toward her. **Because neither of her parents would get jobs or accept charity, the government was going to split up the family.** Rose Mary sat at her easel and began to paint. When she was finished, she said she’d get a job. The picture she painted was of a woman drowning in a lake.

### An A for Effort

**The child welfare man never came back, but his visit was enough to force Rose Mary back into teaching.** She was hired immediately in an elementary school in Davey, a few miles north of Welch. She had to carpool with another teacher, an unpleasant woman named Lucy. Whenever Rose Mary got out of the car, Lucy sprayed Lysol on the passenger seat.

Rose Mary’s teaching performance was the same in Davey as it had been in Battle Mountain. She was lax about grading and discipline, and she had to be coerced to even go to school. Some mornings, she would hide in bed refusing to go like a child. The kids would drag her out and get her ready before Lucy became impatient and left her behind.

Despite her antics, Rose Mary was making money, and her paycheck was a blessing to the household. On payday, they’d cash the check and pay off the monthly bills. Rose Mary put space heaters and a refrigerator on layaway and paid a little each month. They’d stock up on groceries and have enough money left over to survive the rest of the month.

But soon the food was gone, and so was the money. Jeannette could never get a straight answer from Rose Mary about where the money went. She knew Rose Mary had to buy little gifts for herself, things she said made you feel rich, like crystal vases. But even accounting for those splurges, there should have been money left over. **Jeannette and Lori came up with a budget and tried to persuade Rose Mary to let them handle the finances, but she refused. By the end of each month, Jeannette was back to digging in garbage cans for lunch.**

### Personal Improvements

Life changed for Jeannette when she entered Welch High School as a seventh grader. She wanted to belong to a club where people would accept her. She thought about track, but Rose Mary wouldn’t pay for the uniform, so she started working for the school newspaper, _The Maroon Wave_.

The faculty advisor was Jeannette’s namesake, Miss Jeanette Bivens. She was so old, she’d been Rex’s English teacher, as well. Miss Bivens was the first person to push Rex in a positive direction. She believed in his talents as a writer and convinced him to enter a poem into a competition. The poem won first prize. When Rex suggested naming their second child after her, Rose Mary added the extra “n” to make it more French.

Jeannette started as a proofreader. She spent her nights going over copy at the _Welch Daily News_ offices, where the school paper was printed, which were always warm and buzzing with activity. The training she’d had grading her mother’s papers paid off, and she was good at the work.

Even though Jeannette was surrounded by adults, she was still bullied. **One woman complained that she was dirty and smelly. She feared Jeannette would infect everyone with head lice.** Miss Bivens went to bat for Jeannette and said she could stay in the workroom if she kept herself clean. Jeannette started going back to her grandpa’s apartment to bathe, steering clear of Stanley.

The fast pace of the newsroom appealed to Jeannette, especially the life of a reporter. She saw how they ran out whenever something came over the police scanner and came back with a story. She’d see it in the next day’s paper, and it seemed like freedom and connection.

The reporters were in touch with what was happening in the real world. They formed life into bits of information that expanded the minds of readers. Her only outlet for information about the world was the biased ravings of her parents about politics and society. Until Jeannette worked at the paper, she’d never been privy to current events or the lives of others elsewhere.

Reading the wire service was like discovering reality for the first time. **The world suddenly made sense, and she wanted to be someone who knew what was going on and made sense of it for others.**

### The Loosening of the Family Bond

**Maureen had a hard time finding a place in her family.** She was spending so much time with her friends and their families, Jeannette felt like she was becoming removed from her real family. Unlike her siblings, Maureen loved it in Welch. Her friends’ families thought she needed protecting and did their best to save her. They were religious families, and Maureen was frequently baptized. She was even attending pentecostal meetings with snake-handlers.

To keep Maureen included in the Walls family, Jeannette and her siblings tried to show her special attention. They bought her a child’s kitchen set for her seventh birthday with money they’d saved up from paper routes and lawn work. They told her stories about life in California when she was a baby. They tried to talk to Rose Mary about her increasing religious zealousness, but Rose Mary said everyone was free to find their own way to heaven.

Jeannette was growing impatient with Rose Mary’s indifference to everything. She still had manic mood swings and frequently preferred to hunker down in bed instead of going to work. Toward the end of the school year, Rose Mary revealed that the program she’d been hired to teach was shutting down because she hadn’t completed the assessment work. She sobbed in bed and complained about hating her life.

Jeannette was disgusted with her mother, but Lori defended her. Lori understood how hard it must be to be married to a man like Rex. **Jeannette said their mother could handle their father just fine if she were a stronger woman. She was sure all Rose Mary had to do was put her foot down** , but Jeannette would learn that those words were easier said than done.

### Daddy’s Little Girl

Rose Mary left home for eight weeks during the summer break to update her teaching certificate in Charleston. Lori was also gone at a summer camp for gifted students she’d been accepted into. **At thirteen, Jeannette was in charge at home. Rose Mary had given her two hundred dollars for bills and supplies, and Jeannette put together a budget.** She added whatever she could make babysitting to their stipend. If she was frugal, she could make it work.

The first time Rex asked for money was a week after Rose Mary left. He said he needed five dollars for beer and cigarettes. Five dollars could buy food for her, Brian, and Maureen for two days. She wanted to say no, but she couldn’t. She was angry at herself for caving, but she was livid at her father for taking advantage of their special bond.

Rex asked for another five dollars a few days later, and again Jeannette caved. When he asked for twenty dollars after another few days, she finally protested. She had bills to pay and kids to feed. Rex said he didn’t need to explain himself to his teenage daughter. He said he’d pay her back and asked if he’d ever let her down. For the first time, she wanted to say yes, but she couldn’t. She gave him the money.

**Rex showed up a few days later and said he needed Jeannette’s help to get the money he owed her. He picked out a dress for her and drove her to a bar in a nearby town.** Rex ordered Jeannette a beer and went to play pool. A man sat down next to her and asked her to dance. He assumed she was seventeen, and Jeannette didn’t correct him.

Jeannette didn’t feel comfortable with the man’s arms around her, but she couldn’t help but enjoy the attention. The last person to like her was Billy Deel. She figured this man was after the same thing Billy was, but her father was there and didn’t seem to mind. In fact, he offered to play the man in a game of pool.

For the next few hours, Rex hustled the man in pool. Between each game, the man danced with Jeannette, becoming more handsy the more he drank. **After the man lost a sizable sum to Rex, he turned to Jeannette and said they should go upstairs, as though he was owed something.** Jeannette didn’t want to go, but when Rex told the man it was OK, she figured it was safe. Her father wouldn’t let anything bad happen to her. When they reached the apartment, there were two other men watching TV. They leered at Jeannette.

The man put on a record and started dancing aggressively with Jeannette. When she resisted, he pushed her to the bed and kissed her, the men on the couch egging him on. He pinned her hands above her head. She thought about screaming for help, but her anger at Rex kept her from calling to him. To deter his advances, Jeannette opened the front of her dress and showed the man the mottled scars across her chest. The man hesitated, and she ran out.

On the drive home, Rex handed Jeannette the forty dollars he owed her. He said they made a great team, but Jeannette felt more like one of his marks. She told Rex what the man tried to do, but **Rex said he knew she could manage a little groping. It was the same lesson as that day at the spring. Sink or swim. She always found a way to swim.**

### Stepping In to Adult Shoes

Over the summer, Jeannette got a full taste of what Rose Mary was up against. Rex tried to get Jeannette to go to another bar with him, but she refused. He got mad and said if she didn’t want to help him, she had to give him money.

The summer stipend was running out fast, so Jeannette decided to take the advice she’d been giving her mother for years. She put on a pair of Rose Mary’s heels and make-up and walked down to main street. **She pretended to be seventeen and was hired to work as a jewelry store clerk for forty dollars a week.**

The owner of the jewelry store was Mr. Becker, a large man who sometimes rubbed up against Jeannette while they worked. Mr. Becker didn’t trust Jeannette. Whenever he left the store, he took the key to the diamond ring display. If he ever forgot the key, he conspicuously counted each ring in front of her.

Jeannette was annoyed with these not-so-subtle clues about his feelings regarding her character. It hadn’t even crossed her mind to steal anything until he made a big show of not trusting her. She wanted to get back at him, and after finding out he was cheating her out of commissions, she decided to steal a watch.

**Mr. Becker never counted any other items but the rings, so when he left the store one day, Jeannette slipped a watch into her purse.** At first, the watch made her excited. But she couldn’t wear it, not without raising suspicion. The more she thought about the consequences of being found out, such as reform school or juvenile detention, the more anxious she felt. When Mr. Becker went out a week later, she slipped the watch back in the case, her hands shaking.

### A Desire for More

Lori and Rose Mary returned home late that summer. Lori was like a new person. At camp, she was just like all the other kids—fed, showered, artistic, and full of youth. **It was the first time Lori had felt normal, and she realized that if she left Welch, she could live a normal life.**

Rose Mary was also caught up in a dizzy glee. She’d loved her time away and said she was done living her life for other people. It was time she started living for herself. She was quitting her teaching job to paint full time.

Jeannette argued that they needed her salary to survive, but Rose Mary said she was tired of always being the one who had to work. The kids could work if they wanted money. She had more important things to do. Still, Jeannette thought she was bluffing, but when school started, Rose Mary refused to get out of bed. She pouted and said she didn’t feel well. Jeannette was furious. She told her mother to get over it and act like a mother. Rose Mary’s whining turned to anger. Jeannette was being disrespectful, and Rex would teach her a lesson when he got home.

After what had happened that summer, Jeannette knew Rex owed her and wasn’t worried about being punished. But **when she got home from school, Rex yelled that she better show her mother some respect. Jeannette yelled that neither of them deserved her respect**. Rex threatened to beat her if she didn’t apologize, but she stood her ground. She expected Rex to back down. He’d never risk their relationship by beating her. But Rex took off his belt and smacked the back of her thighs six times.

Jeannette ran from the house and wandered the woods for hours. She made two decisions that day. The first was that no one would ever lay a hand on her again, and the second was that she was going to leave Welch, like Lori wanted to. She decided she would save up all her money between now and the end of high school, then leave and never come back.
