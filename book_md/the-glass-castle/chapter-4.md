## Chapter 4: A New Beginning in Phoenix

Jeannette was excited to go to Phoenix and see her maternal grandmother. But her excitement turned to disappointment when Rose Mary casually told her that her grandma had died. Rose Mary said she hadn’t told the children because she simply hadn’t seen the point.

Part of Rose Mary’s inheritance was an option between two houses in Phoenix: a big white house in the Phoenix suburbs or a smaller adobe near the business district downtown. Rose Mary chose the adobe so she could start an art studio. **Her art career could really flourish in a place like Phoenix. She quit teaching and used the inheritance money to buy all the art supplies she wanted.**

### Moving Up in the World

The adobe home was massive, with fourteen rooms total, all full of antiques and family heirlooms. There was a front yard and backyard, where trees stood tall, including orange trees. Although once an upscale neighborhood, most of the houses on their street had been converted to apartments.

Rose Mary turned two rooms downstairs into a studio and gallery and placed a sign in the front yard. She also purchased several typewriters and spent a lot of time working on her writing. Rex was hired as an electrician after joining the labor union, which brought in a steady income. With his first paycheck, he bought each of the children a new bicycle, something none of them had ever had before.

**Despite the addition of certain luxuries, such as a working telephone and electric washing machine, there were still problems in the house.** An army of cockroaches multiplied thanks to the unkempt conditions inside. Rose Mary didn’t believe in using pesticides to kill living things, so they held massacres in the evenings. They’d sneak into the kitchen, flip on the light, and swat at the walls, floors, and surfaces with shoes or magazines.

There was also a termite infestation. Rex discovered the extent of the problem after Lori’s foot pushed through the floorboards one night. But the problem was too large to fix, so they ignored the pests and crashed through multiple points in the floor. Whenever a new hole opened up, Rex would hammer an empty beer can over it as a patch.

### An Eye-Opening Discovery

Jeannette, Brian, and Lori enrolled in Emerson Public School, a nice school in a nice neighborhood with lush grass and banana trees. All three children were placed in gifted reading groups upon entry. The school also had a nurse, and **the Walls children were given vision and hearing exams for the first time. This was how they found out Lori was nearsighted.**

Rose Mary wouldn’t hear of getting glasses for Lori. She thought glasses only made poor eyesight worse and that Lori needed to strengthen her eyes through use. But the school said Lori couldn’t attend without them.

When Lori received her glasses, she looked at the world outside with wonder. She’d never seen leaves on trees, words on billboards, or birds in the distance. She was seeing the world for the first time, and she cried with joy.

**Lori became obsessed with her newfound vision. She started painting and drawing everything she saw and decided she wanted to be an artist, too.**

### Standing Up to Fear

Because there was no air-conditioning in the house, Rex and Rose Mary left the doors and windows open all night. Every now and then, **the family would wake up to a homeless person or drunk off the street sleeping in the living room**. Rose Mary said the men were harmless.

Four-year-old Maureen started having nightmares about people coming to get her in the night. Then, one night, ten-year-old Jeannette woke up to a man fondling her. She screamed, and Brian ran to her room carrying a hatchet. The two chased the man out of the house. They followed him into the night and searched through the dark streets. Rex was away, and Rose Mary was fast asleep.

The kids wanted to lock up the house at night after that, but their parents refused. They needed air circulation, and they wouldn’t give in to fear.

**Not living in fear was a driving force in Rex’s personality, and he continually tried to impart that feeling in his children.** For instance, on another occasion, Rex heard that the city had killed a mountain lion that had wandered into a suburb. He was livid about the dead mountain lion and wanted to prove to his children that wild animals were nothing to be afraid of. He piled the family in the car and drove to the zoo.

Rex took the kids to the cheetah’s cage, where one cheetah stalked back and forth. To prove his point, Rex climbed the fence separating the cheetah’s cage from the observation area. He knelt down next to the cage, and the cheetah walked up and sat on the other side. Rex stuck his hand through the cage and caressed the cheetah’s neck. The animal purred and nuzzled against his hand. He called for the children to join him over the fence, and he placed Jeannette’s hand through the bars and onto the cheetah’s nose. The animal licked her hand in one sloppy motion.

A crowd had formed, and a woman tried to pull Jeannette back over the fence. To avoid any mayhem, Rex and the kids climbed back over, but a security guard was already on his way. Rose Mary was able to talk Rex out of fighting the guard, and **the family left the zoo as people pointed and whispered. Jeannette didn’t mind. None of them had ever touched a cheetah**.

### A Reversal of Fortunes

Rex was kicked out of the electrician’s union after getting fired from not one, but three jobs. The money from the inheritance was long gone, and once again, the family had nothing. Jeannette and her siblings were able to at least get one meal a day at school, and sometimes that’s all they ate.

Around this time, Rose Mary decided that Maureen needed to go to preschool. She was too young to play with her older siblings, and there were no kids her age in their neighborhood. **Rose Mary said she didn’t want her youngest wearing worn second-hand clothes, so she made the other three children help her shoplift.**

The plan was for Jeannette, Lori, and Brian to create a diversion at the front of the store while Rose Mary shoved dresses under her coat. They stole a handful of dresses for Maureen before a saleswoman became suspicious and they had to stop.

Rex was also coming up with schemes to get money. Whenever they had a little money, he’d put it in the bank. The next day, he’d withdraw all the money from the account inside the bank while Rose Mary withdrew the same amount from the drive-up teller. The technology didn’t update fast enough to register the first withdrawal before the second. Rose Mary said it wasn’t stealing. It was a loan without all the paperwork.

### An Old Friend Rears Its Ugly Head

**Rex was convinced the mob was behind the electrician’s union. He said he couldn’t get a job until he got rid of organized corruption.** To do so, he needed to conduct research, and the best places for research on the mob were mob-owned bars.

His drinking began again in earnest. He started coming home late, drunk, and angry. Rose Mary would hide while the kids tried to get Rex to relax. He’d bust up the house in a fit of rage, then apologize and pass out. Jeannette would clean up the mess, but Rose Mary told her it was Rex’s job to clean it up. But the next morning, he’d wake up and pretend like nothing happened.

**On their first Christmas in Phoenix, Rose Mary decided they would celebrate on the actual day instead of a week after, as was their custom.** She took the children to the thrift-store, giving them each a dollar for presents. They bought an almost-dead tree and decorated it with Grandma Smith’s antique ornaments.

Rex cracked his first beer Christmas morning and didn’t stop. By the time they were ready for midnight mass, he was fall-down drunk. Rex disrupted the sermon, calling the Virgin Mary a sweet Jewish girl who got pregnant. He said Jesus was the world’s most popular bastard. They were quickly escorted out.

At home, Rex was still belligerent. He opened a gift from Rose Mary: an antique lighter. Swaying drunkenly in front of the tree, Rex said he wanted to really light things up. He held the flame to the tree, which caught immediately. The family grabbed blankets and water. **They knocked the tree down and stomped out the fire, breaking many of the ornaments and destroying the presents in the process. Rex laughed through the whole thing.**

#### A Daughter’s Wish

For Jeannette’s birthday, Rex asked what he could do to make the last years of her childhood special. **Jeannette looked into his eyes and told him that her birthday wish was for him to stop drinking.**

The next morning, Rex locked himself in the upstairs bedroom and told Jeannette to stay away. Things seemed fine the first day, but by the second, Jeannette heard anguished moans coming from the room. She went inside and saw Rex strapped to the bed with belts and rope. He was writhing under the restraints.

Jeannette filled a jug with water and sat vigil next to the door in case he needed some. She continued this vigil for days, starting after school and ending at bedtime. After a week, the thrashing stopped.

**Rex recovered from his detox and spent the next months regaining his strength.** He was more relaxed, even reticent with the children. By fall, Rex was back to full strength. He told the family to pack some gear. They were going on a camping trip to the Grand Canyon to celebrate.

The family packed everything they’d need for an extended trip. They didn’t know how long they’d be gone. If all went well, Rex said, they might find a cave and live in it full time.

On the drive out, Rex asked Jeannette how fast she thought he could go. He showed her how fast by pushing their station wagon past one hundred miles per hour. The car shook and sputtered, but Rex didn’t slow down. Finally, the car gave out, and they were stranded.

**Rex said if the family walked for eight hours a day, they could cover the eighty-mile hike back to Phoenix in three days.** They would have to leave everything behind and come back later. After walking for hours, a blue truck pulled over and picked them up. The driver was an older woman whose daughter had driven by the family earlier and called her mother to help. She brought sodas and sandwiches for everyone, but Rex was too disappointed that the adventure was over to accept his.

When the woman dropped them off in Phoenix, Rex took off. Jeannette stayed up for his return, but he never showed up.

#### Up to Old Tricks

**It was three more days before Jeannette and Lori saw Rex stumbling into the house one afternoon.** He screamed for Rose Mary, and when she wouldn’t come, he threw the cabinet housing Grandma Smith’s fine china to the ground, shattering everything inside. He dumped a drawer of silver and started throwing utensils around the room.

The kids tried to calm him down, but he shoved them away. He found Rose Mary hiding in the bathtub. They fought physically, and at one point, each grabbed a knife. Rex threw Rose Mary to the ground and got on top of her. After he had her pinned, they both started cracking up. They kissed and made up like nothing had happened.

**Now that Rex was back on the bottle, Rose Mary thought it was time to move out east to live near his parents in Welch, West Virginia.** She hoped maybe they could get him to stop. Rose Mary said West Virginia would be another grand adventure, but first she needed a car. They’d never retrieved the stranded wagon or any of their stuff from the side of the road.

Along with the house and money, Rose Mary had inherited rights to family land in Texas. A drilling company sent her checks for leasing the land. She used the money to buy a used car.

Rose Mary packed up what little they had left and prepared to leave a day after buying the car. Once again, each child was allowed to bring one thing, and it couldn’t be their bikes. There was no time to inform the school or get the children’s records. She said they didn’t need records. Their reading abilities would prove how smart they were.

She also didn’t make any arrangements for the house. **Rose Mary didn’t want people living in the house, and it felt good to own something, so she wasn’t going to sell it.** She hung laundry on the line as a decoy in case anyone noticed the house was empty.

On the morning of their departure, Rex sulked in the house. He was going to wander the desert and would not be making the trip with them. But when the children begged him to come, he climbed into the driver’s seat.
