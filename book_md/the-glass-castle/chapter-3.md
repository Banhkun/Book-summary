## Chapter 3: A Small Reprieve in Battle Mountain

Jeannette was around six years old when they arrived in Battle Mountain. The town didn’t seem like a mecca for gold. The community was pocket-sized, one street with a handful of buildings dwarfed by the expansive desert sky.

The Walls family moved into an old train depot in a part of town near the outskirts known as the Tracks. There was an old office upstairs that served as the parents’ room, and the kids slept in the old waiting area downstairs, benches still attached to the walls. Discarded items found in the desert were used as furniture. Old wooden cable spools became tables, crates became chairs, and cardboard boxes became beds. Rex and Rose Mary discussed trying to find beds for the kids, but they protested. Sleeping in the box was an adventure, the children said.

### Making a Go of It

**Rex found a job as a mine electrician, which regulated his time in a more positive way.** He was up early, and when he came home in the afternoon, he played with the children. When he wasn’t around, Jeannette and Brian would go exploring in the desert. Jeannette became a collector of treasured rocks, such as turquoise and geodes.

With Rex working, they could afford to go out to eat Sunday nights. They went to the Owl Club, one of two casinos in town. They’d gorge on burgers and milkshakes and leave stuffed. There was also plenty of food at home. The mine included a commissary, and a monthly stipend for groceries and the rent amount were automatically deducted from Rex’s salary.

Rose Mary thought cooking was a waste of time. She could paint a picture that would last forever in the time it took to make a meal that would be gone in moments. So at the beginning of each week, they’d pick up their groceries, and whatever wasn’t ready-to-serve would get put in a pot. They’d eat each meal from the pot over the rest of the week, even if the food started to spoil.

**The problem was the Walls’ inability to budget. Their habit of gorging themselves when food was available led to larger bills at the commissary.** Rex’s salary would run out before the month was up, and sometimes he owed money.

However, one place money wasn’t going to was the bars. Rex had curbed his drinking, choosing instead to stay home with his family spread around the room reading. A large dictionary was opened in the middle of the room for the kids to look up unfamiliar words. If Jeannette didn’t agree with a definition, she and Rex would write letters to the publishers in protest.

### A Normal Childhood

Jeannette and her siblings were enrolled in the elementary school in Battle Mountain. She entered the second grade, and although she was light years ahead of her class in reading and math, she kept quiet. She’d learned what being the class pet could lead to in Blythe.

The other kids were mostly sons and daughters of miners and gamblers, and they also lived in the Tracks. The Walls children finally had other kids to play with. Rex would often play with them, and the neighborhood children sometimes asked for Rex instead of his kids.

**Rose Mary didn’t set limits for her children. She believed children learned best from their own mistakes, so she gave them the freedom to make them.** When Jeannette gashed her thigh on a rusty nail, Rose Mary dismissed it as a flesh wound. She said people made a fuss over the smallest things, which made them weak. She sent Jeannette back out to play.

Brian and Jeannette loved exploring. Along with the desert, they explored the town dump. One day, they stumbled onto toxic chemicals in large bins. They took glass jars and filled them with the chemicals, then took them to an abandoned shack. They mixed potions together, but when nothing happened, they decided to see if they could catch on fire.

The next day, they dropped a match into a mixture of different chemicals, and a fire bomb shot up into the air. **The shack caught on fire and spread so fast, they became trapped inside.** Jeannette kicked a board out and escaped, but Brian was still inside. She ran for help and happened to run into Rex walking back from work. Rex ran to the shack and pulled Brian out. As Rex watched the shack burn, he marveled at the luck of him walking by right at that moment. Then, he explained the physical reaction that made the top of the flames shimmer like a mirage.

### Sink or Swim

Deeper in the desert outside of town was a natural hot spring called the Hot Pot. The water was warm on the edges and hot in the middle. Unlike Brian and Lori, **Jeannette didn’t know how to swim. Bodies of water scared her.** At first, she waded in just enough to get her bottom half wet. Rex said it was time for her to learn to swim, so he secured her arms around his neck and swam her across to the other side.

The second time he went across, he pulled her arms free and shoved her to the center. Without anything to hold onto, Jeannette sunk below the surface. Her arms flailed and she took in mouthfuls of hot sulfuric water. Rex grabbed her and moved her to the shallow end.

After she had calmed down and was breathing normally again, he tossed her back in the middle. Again, she sank below the surface and choked on the water. Rex continued this pattern over and over—saving her, then tossing her back. Once she realized what was going on, she used her arms to maneuver away from him. She made it to the side and stumbled out.

Rex shouted, “You did it,” and hurried to her side, but she was fuming. Brian and Lori tried to congratulate her, but she wouldn’t have it. She was even mad at her mother, who’d bathed on her back as though nothing had happened. **Rex said that at some point, you had to either sink or swim. You couldn’t cling to the sides forever.** That was the lesson he was trying to teach her. Why else would he have done it? When Jeannette calmed down, she decided to believe him. She couldn’t come up with any other answer.

### Just Like Old Times

The comfortable life the Walls family had enjoyed for the past six months ended after Rex lost his job. It was the longest he’d ever held a steady position. Jeannette assumed they’d be moving again, but they didn’t. **Rex said he intentionally got fired so he could have more time to find gold.**

The family no longer had credit at the commissary, and there were no savings. When their food ran out, they couldn’t buy more. Every now and then, an odd job or gambling spoils would give them enough to eat for a few days. Sometimes, Rex left and returned an hour later with an armload of vegetables and made a stew. Mostly, they went hungry.

Rex’s time at the house dwindled. He stayed out more and more in the evenings. **He was gone so much, Maureen’s first words were practically, “Where’s Daddy?”**

Rose Mary wasn’t much help. The children mostly kept their empty stomachs to themselves, not wanting to upset her. When they did complain, she merely shrugged. What was she supposed to do about it?

Food became an obsession for Jeannette, Brian, and Lori. They were always plotting about how they could find something to eat. Jeannette started stealing small items of food from other kid’s lunches at school. When she played at a friend’s house, she’d slip into the kitchen and rummage for something to eat. She’d inhale the food in the bathroom, then go back out to play.

### Desperate Times

One day, **after two months of starving, Rex walked in with a bag of groceries**. There was canned corn, bread, milk, sugar, margarine, and two containers of deviled ham. The family stuffed themselves on deviled ham sandwiches and milk. After one night, the only thing left was the stick of margarine.

The next day, Jeannette found Lori eating the butter with a spoon after school. She’d mixed it with sugar, and the two girls ate every bite. When Rose Mary came home, she fumed about the missing stick of margarine. She said she was saving it to spread on bread.

When the girls pointed out there was no more bread, Rose Mary countered that she was going to borrow flour to bake some. When the girls pointed out the gas had been turned off, Rose Mary said they could have used the margarine whenever the gas got turned back on. She said thanks to the girls’ gluttony, there would be no margarine if they ever had bread again.

Jeannette had reached her limit. She screamed that she and Lori were hungry and had nothing to eat. Rose Mary stared stunned. **The unspoken rule in the Walls family was to ignore their troubles, and Jeannette was bringing a big one to light.**

When Rex came home, Rose Mary screamed that she was sick of taking the blame for everything that went wrong. She said it wasn’t her responsibility to feed the kids and it was up to Rex to make money. But Rex was developing a system to pull gold from the center of rocks and needed seed money to perfect it. He suggested they ask Grandma Smith for money, but Rose Mary refused. The fight lasted all night.

Fights between Rex and Rose Mary were not infrequent, but they always made up within a day. This fight was different. Jeannette and her siblings didn’t know what to do when her parents picked up where they left off the next morning.

Rose Mary told Rex to find another job, and Rex countered she should get a job if she wanted a paycheck around the house. She screamed that she was an artist, and Rex screamed that she never sold any art. **The screaming could be heard down the street, and soon neighbors came outside to watch. The kids took Maureen outside to play, hoping their frivolity would make the neighbors think everything was fine.**

Suddenly, one of Rose Mary’s paintings was tossed from the upstairs window, followed by her easel, followed by Rose Mary. She swung from the window, her body dangling and thrashing. Rex held her arms to keep her from falling. Rose Mary yelled that Rex was trying to kill her, but she fought him whenever he tried to pull her back in.

The children ran inside and up to the bedroom. They held onto Rex so he wouldn’t get pulled out. When Rex finally got Rose Mary back inside, Lori tended to her. Brian watched his parents with disgust. But **Jeannette stood somewhere in the middle, saying everything was fine, repeating it like a mantra**.

### Time to Take Responsibility

The truth was, **Rose Mary had a teaching certificate and could easily get a job at the Battle Mountain middle school** , since they were always short on teachers. The day after the fight, she awoke with the kids and applied for a job. She was hired immediately to teach Lori’s middle school class.

Rose Mary was a hit with the students. She gave them as wide a berth to be free and reckless as she did her children. She was loving toward her students, hugging them and constantly giving them words of encouragement. Some of the troubled kids actually started performing well, but her popularity ended with the kids.

The other teachers thought Rose Mary’s no-rules philosophy was irresponsible. The principal, Miss Beatty, was aghast when she observed the class one day. Kids ran wild while Rose Mary did nothing or contributed to the wildness. Miss Beatty ordered Rose Mary to submit weekly progress reports and lesson plans.

**Rose Mary was either unable or unwilling to follow the rules, so the Walls children started helping her with her job.** Jeannette cleaned her classroom, Lori helped write her lesson plans, and all three of them helped grade homework.

Lori had been proofreading Rose Mary’s writing since she was seven, and the work she did was exceptional. Rose Mary thought Lori was brilliant, and the two grew closer. When they weren’t working on assignments, they would draw or work on other art projects together.

### Nothing Changes

With Rose Mary working, life started to improve a little, but not to the level Jeanette had hoped. They’d been able to stay in the depot and pay rent to the mine owner, but the children still wore old, dingy clothes. Food was around more often, but it ran out quickly, and they’d be hungry again until the next paycheck.

Another issue that kept them from prospering was Rex’s ego. **Rex liked that Rose Mary was working, but he was the man of the house and still wanted to control the money.** He said he needed to use part of her salary to finish his invention, but Rose Mary knew the money went to the bars in town. Still, she could never say no. When she tried, he’d beg, pout, annoy, and bully her until she gave in.

For a while, she hid her checks or pretended she lost the money, but then Rex started showing up on payday to collect the check himself. He’d drive her to the bank and take the money. One day, when Rex couldn’t find parking, Rose Mary went into the bank and came out holding one of her socks, which she’d hidden money in. She told Jeannette to hide the sock in a safe place because socks were hard to come by. All of this, including a gratuitous wink, was done in front of Rex. No one was fooled.

After collecting what was left of the money, **Rex took the family to the Owl Club for steaks to celebrate payday. They spent a week’s worth of groceries gorging themselves.** After dinner, Rex asked Jeannette if he could see the sock Mom had given her. Jeannette looked for an ally around the table, but all eyes were turned away. She handed over the sock, and Rex left a ten dollar tip.

### Collateral Damage

Jeannette and Rex had always had a special bond. They were close, and she thought he could do no wrong. **Rex told Jeannette she was his favorite because she was the only one who had faith in him.** So when Lori and Brian started to criticize their father’s behavior, she defended him and his inventions. Jeannette was angry that her siblings thought Rex was a worthless drunk, but she also noticed that Brian seemed put out by something more than Rex’s drinking. She noticed it first one day when they passed the Green Lantern.

The Green Lantern was a brothel run out of a large green house near the highway. The women hung around the porch in short dresses or swimsuits waving to each car that passed. Jeannette and Brian didn’t know what went on inside, but they liked to spy on the house from bushes. One day, Jeannette dared Brian to go talk to one of the women. She was seven, and he was six. Brian talked to the women for a long time, and when he came back, he said that men go inside, and women are nice to them. After that, Brian always waved to the women on the porch.

But on this particular day, Brian didn’t wave back when a woman called out to him. Jeannette questioned how the woman knew his name, and Brian told her the story.

For Brian’s birthday that year, Rex had taken him to the store to pick out a comic book. Afterward, Rex took him to the Nevada Hotel, the other casino in town. They ate dinner with a woman named Ginger, the same woman who waved from the porch. Following dinner, the three went to a suite in the hotel. **Rex and Ginger disappeared into the bedroom, and Brian was left in the main room to read his book.**

By the time Rex and Ginger came out, Brian had read and reread the comic at least twice. Ginger sat down and made a fuss over the comic, and Rex made him give it to her.

Jeannette knew the way Brian was acting wasn’t just about the comic book, but she didn’t know what else could have happened. **She still didn’t know what happened at the Green Lantern, and Brian wouldn’t say anymore about it.**

### Unwanted Attention

When Jeannette was eight years old, a boy named Billy Deel moved to town with his father. He was three years older and one side of his head was dented in. Billy had a reputation as a delinquent, and neighbors started accusing him of torturing and killing their pets. **Jeannette thought the worst thing about Billy was the way he looked at her.**

Billy told the other kids that Jeannette was his girlfriend. Although she denied it and didn’t like Billy, she couldn’t help but enjoy the attention a little. Jeannette told Billy she would be his friend but not his girlfriend. Billy said if she became his girlfriend, he would protect her and buy her gifts. He said if she wouldn’t, she’d regret it. Jeannette wasn’t afraid of Billy. She said they could be friends or nothing.

A week later, Billy gave Jeannette a turquoise and silver ring that belonged to his mother. She didn’t want to take the ring and give Billy the wrong impression, but she hadn’t received a present for a long time, certainly never jewelry. She decided to keep it but not wear it.

A few weeks later, Jeannette was playing hide and seek with some kids from the Track. She hid in an old secluded tool shed she thought no one would find. But Billy found her and climbed in to hide even though he hadn’t been part of the game.

The shed was small, barely big enough for one person, and Jeannette told him to find another spot. **They were sitting so close their legs touched and his breath warmed her face. For the first time, Jeannette was scared.**

Billy started talking about the Green Lantern. He told her what happened inside and that sometimes the men stabbed the women if they struggled. He pressed his mouth against hers and kissed her hard. Jeannette struggled, but that only made him push harder.

Billy made fast work of unbuttoning his pants. He started to tug on Jeannette’s shorts. She wanted to knee him, like her father had showed her, but he was between her legs. Instead, she bit his ear with all her might. Billy screamed and punched her in the face. **The other kids heard the scream and ran to the shed. When they opened the door, Jeannette crawled out with her pants down and blood spurting from her nose.**

The day after the shed, Jeannette marched over to Billy’s house and tossed the ring at him. She said they weren’t friends anymore. As she started to walk away, Billy shouted that he’d raped her. Jeannette didn’t know what the word meant, so she said it was no big deal. But when she got home, she looked it up in the dictionary. **She still wasn’t clear what “rape” meant, but this time she didn’t ask her dad to explain. She had a feeling that would lead to trouble.**

Rex and Rose Mary were out at the bar the next night. The kids were playing cards at home when they heard Billy shouting at Jeannette from outside. Lori went to tell Billy to get lost, but she came back a second later. Billy had a gun.

Billy broke out the first-floor window and pointed the gun at them. Brian could tell it was only a BB gun, but it didn’t matter. At that range, even BBs could do damage. Billy opened fire, and the kids flipped over the spool table as a barricade.

Lori ran upstairs and grabbed Rex’s loaded handgun. She pointed it at Billy and pulled the trigger. Silence followed. They ran outside, but Billy had ducked before the shot. He jumped up and ran to the train tracks, stopping every few feet to unload another round of BBs in their direction.

Jeannette grabbed the gun and shot it. The bullet landed in the dirt by Billy’s feet, and he sprinted away. Jeannette and her siblings laughed, but it soon faded. Jeannette was shaking.

#### The End of the Road

When Rex and Rose Mary came back to the depot, it was in a police cruiser. Neighbors had called in the gun fight, and the cops had found them at the bar. **Jeannette said it was self-defense and tried to explain the situation, but the police weren’t interested.**

The cop told Rex the family would have to go in front of a judge the next day to straighten the matter out. After the cop left, Rex and Rose Mary went upstairs to talk. When they finally came down, faces drawn, they announced they were moving to Phoenix. Everyone was allowed to bring one thing. Jeannette brought her favorite geode.

The family piled into their car that night, and **Jeannette watched through the back window as they pulled away from the longest home she’d ever had**.
