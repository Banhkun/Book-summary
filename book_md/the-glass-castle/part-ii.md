## Part II: The Other Side of the World ︱Chapter 5: Welch, West Virginia

It took the Walls family a month to make it across the country when Jeannette was around eleven years old. The used car Rose Mary bought broke down frequently and wouldn’t go faster than twenty miles per hour. Finally, they rolled into the Appalachian Mountains.

The landscape was vastly different than anything Jeannette had ever seen. Instead of deserts and dry hills, they drove through rolling hills of thick forests. **They pulled up to Rex’s childhood home and were greeted by their other grandma for the first time.**

### There’s No Place Like Home

Grandma Erma was an obese woman who smoked and drank almost as much as Rex. She greeted her son warmly, but she was rude to Rose Mary and short with the children. She told them to call her Erma, not grandma. In contrast, Grandpa Ted was old and wiry. He didn’t mind being called grandpa. Another man stepped forward and introduced himself as Uncle Stanley. He was missing teeth and was overly affectionate with Jeannette.

That night, everyone gathered around the coal stove for warmth and ate green beans and biscuits for dinner. The beans were mushy and so salty, Jeannette held her nose as she ate, as Rose Mary had taught her to do when eating food that was slightly spoiled. Erma smacked her hand away and told her beggars couldn’t be choosers.

The family wasn’t planning on staying with Rex’s parents for long. But **until they could afford their own place, they all slept in the basement—Rex and Rose Mary on a pullout sofa and the children sharing Stanley’s bed**. The children giggled at being crammed in so tightly together, eliciting a stern warning from Erma that laughing got on her nerves.

The next day, Rex took Rose Mary and the kids on a tour of Welch. Welch was a coal-mining town that sat in a valley between two mountain ranges. A river ran through town, but it was polluted from the town’s toilet waste because there was no sewer system. There was one main road, and everything seemed to be covered in coal dust.

As they drove through town, Jeannette tried to make friendly gestures to people she saw on the street, but none of them smiled back. Rose Mary seemed giddy. She reckoned there were no other artists in Welch. Her career could really take off there.

### The Outsiders

Rose Mary walked Brian and Jeannette to the local elementary school the next morning. She explained to the principal that they’d forgotten their records but assured him they were both bright students. When the principal asked Jeannette what eight times seven was, she couldn’t understand his hillbilly accent. Rose Mary translated, and Jeannette shouted the answer. Similarly, the principal didn’t understand her accent. **He said the children seemed slow and had speech problems, so he placed them in classes for kids with learning disabilities.**

The school was a far cry from Emerson in Phoenix. There was no playground equipment or free bananas. The winter winds were already whirling through. Rose Mary had purchased used winter coats, but Jeannette’s didn’t have any buttons. As they waited outside for the morning bell, she wrapped her arms around her front to keep the coat closed.

On Jeannette’s first day of fifth grade, her English teacher placed a target on her back. She loudly announced to the class that Jeannette thought she was better than everyone because she had enrolled in school without records. **The teacher led the class in mocking Jeannette and laughing at her, and a tall black girl stabbed her in the back with a sharp pencil.**

All Erma had given Jeannette for lunch was two slices of bread with a smear of lard in the middle. She ate it by herself slowly so she wouldn’t have to go outside and play. Finally, after all the other kids were gone, the janitor told her she had to leave.

Once outside, the black girl from class and a few others taunted Jeannette and made fun of her buttonless coat. They punched and kicked her until it was time to go inside.

### An Olive Branch

**Every day for weeks, the black girl, Dinitia, and her friends bullied Jeannette. They called her poor, dirty, and ugly and beat her up at recess.** Jeannette only had three dresses, and Erma only let the children bathe once a week from a bucket of warm water they all had to use.

One day, Jeannette was walking through a park when she came upon a wild dog cornering a young black boy. She shouted at the child, no more than six years old, not to run, but he did anyway. The dog chased him and knocked him down. Jeannette saw that the dog wasn’t really wild or a threat, just mangy and abused.

She picked up a stick and threatened the dog until he ran away. Then, she gave the boy a piggyback ride to his house. When she reached his home, she dropped the boy off and saw Dinitia watching her from across the street.

The next day at school, Dinitia didn’t bother Jeannette at lunch. Without her leadership, the other girls left Jeannette alone, too. A few days later, Dinitia asked if Jeannette would help her with their English assignment. She thanked her for bringing the boy home but never said a word about beating her up. Still, Jeannette was pleased with the turn of events.

The girls made a plan to meet at Dinitia’s house that weekend to study, since Erma was extremely racist.**** That night, Erma was cooking beans in the kitchen when Jeannette got home. She asked how her day was with the _n-words_. Jeannette was used to Erma using that word, but she also knew it was wrong. Rex and Rose Mary had taught her that much. Jeannette usually ignored Erma’s racist remarks, but it bothered her today. **When she yelled at Erma and told her not to use that word, Erma banished her to the basement without supper.**

### Evils of the Past

On a cold winter’s morning, Rex and Rose Mary drove away from Erma’s house and headed back to Phoenix. They wanted to pick up the rest of their stuff and get the children’s school records. Jeannette could tell both her parents were excited to be leaving.

Jeannette wondered if her parents would come back. Now that the children were older, she feared they’d become too big a burden. A week past and her parents were still gone. Erma was more critical and mean without Rex around and hit the kids with a wooden spoon. One day, she called Brian into her room to mend his pants. She’d been drinking all morning from a bottle she kept in her housecoat. After a minute, **Jeannette heard Brian squirming and whining. She ran to the room and saw Brian crying and Erma on her knees molesting his privates**.

Jeannette screamed for her to stop, and Lori came running in. Erma scolded Jeannette and reached back to slap her, but Lori stopped her arm and tried to calm things down. After Erma slapped Lori, the two got into a fist fight, and Lori punched Erma in the face.

After that, the children weren’t allowed to come out of the basement. They weren’t allowed to use the bathroom upstairs, so they had to go at school or outside. When a snowstorm hit, Erma wouldn’t give them coal for the basement stove. Whenever they weren’t at school, all four kids piled under the covers in their clothes and coats to stay warm.

When Rex and Rose Mary returned, Erma told them what had happened. Rex stomped down the stairs and went into a tirade about disrespecting their grandmother. He said Brian should stop being such a sissy. **The children wondered if Erma had ever done something like that to Rex. None of them wanted to think about it, but they all agreed it would explain a lot**.

### A Fresh Start

**Jeannette thought things would get better with her parents back, but Erma wouldn’t forgive the kids. She kicked all of them out.** With no jobs, no money, and no car (it had broken down on the drive back from Phoenix), Rex set out to find something cheap in town. What they ended up finding was a ramshackle wooden house on the side of a steep hill. The front of the house sat on cinder blocks, and there was no indoor plumbing.

There was an old black coal stove in one of the three rooms that vented through a window instead of a chimney. The ventilation was poor, and part of the ceiling was stained from the thick smoke. The kitchen had exposed and shoddy wiring around the appliances, and when they were able to pay the electric bill, at least one of them was shocked if they touched some wet or metallic. They wore rags or socks over their hands to avoid it. There was also a leak in the ceiling that grew so much during a rainstorm, part of the ceiling came down. No one fixed it.

Jeannette longed for their house in Phoenix, as well as the dry, sunny weather. She asked Rex if they were ever going home, to which he responded they were home. **Rex loved the house, not for the current dwelling, but because of the included land, on which he planned to build the Glass Castle.**

### Home Is Where the Trash Is

Rex had roped off the parcel of land on which the Glass Castle would be built. He wanted to break ground and get started right away, but he was never home. So **every day for a month, Jeannette and Brian dug the hole for the Glass Castle**. They dug a big enough hole for Rex to smooth out and pour the foundation into.

Rex couldn’t afford to pay for trash pickup, so the family started throwing their trash in the hole. Rex said it was temporary, that he would borrow a truck to haul the trash heap to the dump. But the garbage was never removed.

The pile of garbage attracted numerous rodents. One day, Jeannette found a giant rat rolling around in a punch bowl filled with sugar—Rose Mary had a severe sweet tooth. Jeannette and Brian tried to get rid of the rat, but their efforts failed. A few nights later, Maureen woke up to the rat sitting inches from her face. The children tried to kill it, but it was their dog—a stray who’d followed Brian home—who caught it and killed it on their bedroom floor.

Rose Mary and Rex didn’t think much of the rat incident. When the garbage pit got too full, they told the kids to make it bigger.

### The Long Drop Off the Wagon

**Rex’s drinking had continued since his short stint of sobriety in Phoenix, but the longer the family was in Welch, the worse his behavior became.** One night, Jeannette found Rex in the living room cut and bleeding. There was a gash on his head that went to the bone. Jeannette cleaned the wound but couldn’t dress it because of his hair.

There was an equally severe cut on his arm, and Rex told Jeannette to grab the sewing box. He produced a needle and some cotton thread and told her to stitch up the wound. After her protests were ignored, Jeannette tried to make the first stitch, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Rex took her hand and guided the needle through his arm twice. After two stitches, he told her she’d done a wonderful job.

When Jeannette came home from school the next day, Rex was already gone. Being gone had become the standard for Rex. He’d leave and not come home for days. Jeannette always wanted to believe his excuses about investigating the miners union or researching his latest get-rich-quick scheme. He’d abandoned the idea of finding gold, but he was working on a system to burn low-grade coal more efficiently.

**Jeannette listened with hope as Rex explained why he was too busy or too proud to take the jobs people offered.** But each time he came home after days of disappearing, she found it harder to believe in him. At least he brought groceries when he came back, and eventually she stopped asking where he’d been.

### Hunger

**The only time there was food in the house was when Rex managed to make it home and Rose Mary received a check from the Texas land.** The money she received was enough to stock the pantry for days to weeks at a time.

The family ate pinto beans day after day until they ran out. Sometimes they’d have popcorn for dinner if that was all the food left. When the checks were big enough, Rose Mary would buy a large canned ham, and they’d feast on thick slices. Because there was no refrigerator, the ham would spoil on the counter. One day, Jeannette went to cut a slice and found it infested with maggots. Rose Mary was eating a slice. She told Jeannette she shouldn’t be so picky and to just cut around the maggots.

When the money ran out, they’d go without food for lengthy periods. Jeannette and Brian foraged whatever they could find, like fruit from trees, but it wasn’t enough. The children were so thin, the kids at school made fun of them. Jeannette hid in the bathroom at lunch and waited for girls to throw their lunch bags away. **She rifled through the garbage, amazed at how much food other kids wasted, and took her spoils into the stall to eat.** She was sure Brian was subsisting in the same way, but they never spoke of it.

On the contrary, Maureen was well fed. She had made a number of neighborhood friends and often wandered to their house for dinner. Somehow, Rose Mary seemed to be gaining weight.

One night, Rose Mary and the children were in the main room trying not to think about how hungry they were. Rose Mary was on the sofa bed and kept dipping below the blankets. When Brian caught her chewing, she said she was just moving her jaw around because her teeth hurt. Brian pulled back the blankets to find a family-sized chocolate bar half-eaten.

Rose Mary pleaded for forgiveness. **She said she was addicted to sugar like Rex was addicted to alcohol. They always forgave Rex, so they should forgive her.** Brian separated the remaining chocolate into equal pieces for the four kids, and they ate it in front of Rose Mary.

### Chilled to the Bone

Winter was harsh the year Jeannette was in sixth grade. She still only had the coat without buttons and was constantly cold, even in the house. Rose Mary said they didn’t have money to buy coal for the stove, so Jeannette and Brian walked the streets collecting pieces of coal and wood.

Most of the heat was rising through the holes in the roof, and icicles hung from the kitchen ceiling. Rose Mary said they were lucky to at least have each other, but the kids didn’t feel lucky. They fought over the dogs, who could keep them warm in bed. Brian had a pet iguana that he slept with on his chest to keep it warm. But he woke up one morning to a frozen lizard. **The only time the children were warm was when they went to school.**

When the snow thawed on warmer days, the wood became soggy and useless. The kids squirted the fuel from the kerosene lamps to cajole the wood to light. Rex thought it was cheating to use fuel, but he didn’t provide any alternatives. The kerosene worked for a while until, one night, the fire exploded while Lori stoked it. The flames burned the front of her hair and body. Jeannette and Brian packed snow on her legs, but she still had burn blisters for weeks.

### The Downward Spiral Continues

**At the end of their second winter in Welch, Erma died of cirrhosis. Rex slipped into a deeper state of despair and stayed out even longer than before.** After four or so days, Rose Mary would send Jeannette to find him.

Jeannette went from one bar to the next until she found him. One time, Rex was in the seediest bar in town and too drunk to function. The other patrons helped throw in him the back of some man’s truck, and he drove Jeannette and Rex back home.

Shortly after Erma’s death, Uncle Stanley burned their house down after falling asleep with a cigarette. He and his father moved to a small apartment in town. The apartment had indoor plumbing, and the children would bathe there on weekends.

Jeannette was waiting for her turn in the bath one afternoon while watching television with Stanley. His hand started to move up her thigh, and she saw that he was masturbating. Rose Mary was in the other room. **When Jeannette ran to tell her what was happening, Rose Mary said it was sad how lonely Stanley was, and besides, sexual assault is all about perception.** “If you don’t think you’re hurt, then you aren’t,” she said. Jeannette stopped going to the apartment to bathe.

### Mother of the Year

Rose Mary never seemed concerned about the condition of the house or the children. When spring rains flooded the outdoor toilet, her solution was to put a plastic bucket in a corner to use as a restroom. The house was so damp, mold and mushrooms grew in corners, and the porch started to fall apart.

One day, Brian and Jeannette found a two-carat diamond ring (likely belonging to the senile old woman who’d lived there) in the bottom of an old piece of wood. They wanted to sell it to pay off the mortgage and buy food. **Rose Mary wanted to keep the ring to replace the one Rex had pawned and improve her self-esteem, which was more important than food**.

Jeannette knew her mother’s mood needed lifting. Rose Mary spent days in bed, crying and lamenting that the children had squashed her art career. Then, a week later, she’d be up again, painting like everything was wonderful. But things weren’t wonderful, and Jeannette, now twelve, decided to start taking measures into her own hands. She researched how other families in the area got by and discovered a solution.

One day, she told Rose Mary that things needed to change. They hadn’t had anything but popcorn for the last few days. Rose Mary told Jeannette she was always so critical and negative. She complained that Jeannette never blamed Rex for anything, but Jeannette was ready for this line of defense. She told Rose Mary that she had to leave Rex.

Jeannette still wanted to believe in Rex and support him, but she could see the destruction he was bringing to his life and, by proxy, theirs. If Rose Mary left Rex, she’d become eligible for government assistance. **Without a man around, the family could get food stamps and clothing certificates. The government would pay for coal and hot school lunches.**

It was well known that Rex and Rose Mary didn’t believe in welfare. They’d even given back a bag of clothes from the local church because they didn’t accept charity. Rose Mary’s stance on this day was no different. She said welfare would create a shame they would never be able to shake. It would ruin their lives forever.

Jeannette said if she wouldn’t accept charity, she needed to get a job. She could teach and bring in enough of a salary to move them to a nicer place. **Rose Mary thought about it, then said she was fine where she was. She was an excitement junkie, after all.**
