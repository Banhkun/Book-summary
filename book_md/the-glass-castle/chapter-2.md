## Chapter 2: In Search of a Home

**Rex had decided the fastest way to accumulate the money needed for the Prospector was to go to Las Vegas and win big.** Jeannette was four years old.

On the way, they’d driven past a bar along a Nevada roadside. Rex and Rose Mary left the kids in the afternoon heat and went inside. The children tried to count the number of times they’d moved to a new home, differentiating between the places where’d they’d only stayed a week or shorter. They counted eleven before they lost count.

After a few hours, they were all on the road again. Rex was drinking a beer and smoking while driving, and he took a turn too sharply and hit some railroad tracks. **The back door flew open, and Jeannette tumbled out of the car.** The only one who noticed was Brian.

Jeannette rolled down an embankment and came to a stop bruised and bloody. She watched as the car vanished down the road. It was a hot and dusty day in the desert. **When the car didn’t return, Jeannette started to wonder if she was somehow expendable.** She cried and tried to decide what to do.

After a long time, the car finally came back into view. Rex got out to comfort Jeannette, but she pulled away. He explained that they didn’t know what had happened because Brian was crying too hard to tell them. He cleaned her wounds and said her snot locker was really banged up. She started to laugh, and back in the car, everyone had a good laugh with her.

### Las Vegas

**A Las Vegas motel room served as Jeannette’s family home for a month before they did the skedaddle.** The kids went to the casinos with Rex, playing tag or hunting for abandoned quarters in slot machines. Rex played blackjack, bragging that he had a system that was unstoppable. For a while, the system worked.

Rex took his winnings and bought everyone cowboy hats and vests with fringe. One night, after a particularly successful day at the tables, Rex took them to a restaurant. They each ate steaks and ordered a flaming ice cream cake for dessert. Rex said they were living the high-roller life they deserved.

A couple of nights after the flaming cake, Jeannette’s parents came back from the casino in a hurry. They said it was time to skedaddle again. **The casino was on to Rex’s system, and they had to put as much distance as they could between them and the mafia hot on his trail.** Her mother wanted to live near the ocean, so they headed for California.

### San Francisco

**Jeannette’s fascination with fire was the catalyst for another Walls family skedaddle shortly after arriving in San Francisco.** Rose Mary didn’t want to stay in what she called “tourist traps” near the wharf, so the family found an affordable hotel in the Tenderloin District, where many of the residents were prostitutes.

The children were often left alone in the hotel while their parents went in search of investment capital for the Prospector. Jeannette found a box of wooden matches and took them to the bathroom. She built a mound of toilet paper in the toilet, set it on fire, and flushed only when the flames were lapping high out of the basin.

A few nights later, **Jeannette woke up to a fire in their room.** The curtains were flaming a few steps from her bed. Her parents weren’t there, and she couldn’t rouse Brian and Lori. The fire continued to grow, but suddenly the door burst open. Rex led them out of the room and across the street to a bar. Jeannette watched the fire through the bar windows wondering if all the fires in the world were connected. Was the fire that burned her connected to this fire? Was the fire still after her? **She took on a new perspective about life. At any moment, your world could go up in a blaze.** That truth never left her.

### The Mojave Desert

After San Francisco, the family picked up and headed back into the desert. They stumbled across a small community called Midland and rented a two-room house surrounded by sand.

One night, Jeannette heard what sounded like a snake under her bed. She woke her father up. But Rex told her it was probably just a demon, the same one he’d been hunting for years. He made a game out of searching for the demon. They called it demon hunting. Rex told Jeannette all you had to do to get rid of a demon was to look it in the eye. Demon hunting became a frequent pastime from then on.

There were no trees or vegetation in Midland, and water had to be brought in for the residents. **Not long after they’d arrived, Rosy Mary announced she was pregnant.** She busied herself with her art while waiting for the baby to arrive. She painted, sketched, made sculptures, and worked on novels, plays, and a children’s book.

Rex, on the other hand, got a job digging rocks in a gypsum mine. He said as soon as the baby was born, they would move to the larger town of Blythe, California twenty miles away.

#### Christmas at the Walls’ House

Christmas for Jeannette’s family was different than it was for other families. **Rex and Rose Mary opted to celebrate a week after Christmas to take advantage of the post-holiday sales.** They’d pick up used trees from the roadside and wrap small toys and trinkets in wrapping paper discarded by other families. The presents were never from Santa Clause. Rose Mary said she wouldn’t lie to her children, like other parents did, or brainwash them into believing silly myths about elves making toys.

When Christmas rolled around that first year in the Midland, Rex didn’t have enough money even for their meager celebration. He’d been fired from the mine after arguing with his supervisor. On Christmas Eve, Rex took each child out into the desert and told them to pick out a star in the sky as their present. He said they would always be able to find their stars, which made them luckier than kids who would grow out of their presents in a year. Jeannette chose Venus even though it wasn’t a star.

#### Marital Bliss

As soon as Rose Mary was close to giving birth, Rex moved his family to Blythe. **On the short drive over, Rex and Rose Mary got into an argument about how far along the pregnancy was.** Rose Mary was adamant she was at ten months, and Rex, toasty from the tequila he’d bought earlier with money from fixing a car, said she had lost count. The fight continued until Rose Mary jumped out of the car and ran off into the desert night.

Rex turned the car and headed in the direction she’d run. He chased her down, yelling obscenities out the window and threatening her if she didn’t get into the car. Rose Mary kept running, diving in and out of bushes. At one point, Rex slammed on the gas and drove straight at her. Rose Mary jumped out of the way, and he turned the car around and charged her again.

**Jeannette and her siblings cried and yelled for Rex to stop the car, but he didn’t.** He kept chasing her until he had her up against a boulder. He jumped out of the car, grabbed her, and dragged her back while she fought and screamed. The next day, Rex and Rose Mary were back to normal as if nothing had happened.

### Blythe, California

Blythe was a large town, with two movie theaters and as many prisons. The town offered more civilization than the Walls family was used to, but Rex and Rose Mary hated it. They thought desert towns should be small and dusty, not sprawling and teeming with people.

**The larger town meant different rules for Jeannette and her siblings. For the first time, they were required to wear shoes outdoors.** **They also had to go to school.** Their assimilation was bumpy at first. Jeannette and her siblings could read ahead of their grade levels because of their lessons at home, and Jeannette quickly became a teacher’s pet. The other students took an immediate disliking to her.

One day, four Latina girls waited for Jeannette in the alley near their apartment and beat her up. When Rex saw her bruised and bloody, he acted proud, but Brian was livid. When the same girls waited for Jeannette the next day, Brian jumped out from behind a bush and swung a large tree branch to keep the girls away. The branch broke, and the girls surrounded Brian and beat him to the ground until Jeannette smacked one of them in the head with a rock.

#### Some Things Never Change

Two months after the move, Lilly Ruth Maureen Walls was born. Two days later, Rex checked Rose Mary and the baby out of the hospital Rex Walls style. **Jeannette held the baby on the drive home and promised her new sister she would always look after her.**

The addition of Maureen to the family did nothing to change the Walls’ way of life. She was only a few months old when it was time to skedaddle again. Rex had been driving through Blythe with the whole family when a police car pulled up behind them. Their car wasn’t registered or insured, and Rex had stolen the license plates off another vehicle. He said if the police pulled them over, the whole family would be arrested, then led the police on a chase through town.

He made a few quick moves, then turned down an alley and hid in a vacant garage. They ditched the car and walked home. The next morning, **Rex announced they were moving to Battle Mountain, Nevada, where an unearthed supply of gold was located.** Battle Mountain was their ticket to riches.

#### Traveling in Style

The drive to Battle Mountain was one of the longest and more harrowing of Jeannette’s childhood. **With no car, her parents rented a U-Haul truck. Rose Mary told the kids they’d have to ride in the back with the furniture** , but it would be like an amazing adventure. The trip would take fourteen hours if they drove straight through, but she thought they might take some scenic routes. The only rule was no talking. Someone might hear them.

As soon as the truck started moving, Maureen started crying. Her wails echoed in the small confined truck, but nothing Jeannette or Lori did quieted her down. Whenever the truck hit a bump, the children were thrown around in the dark. It grew cold in the truck, and after several hours, they all had to use the restroom.

Suddenly, the truck hit a pothole, and the back doors flew open. Wind whipped through, threatening to suck the children out. The doors clanged against the sides, but Rex didn’t stop. **The kids couldn’t reach the wall behind the cabin because of the furniture, so they screamed and banged on the sides** , but the engine drowned them out.

Brian tried to catch one of the swinging doors and almost got sucked out. They hunkered down and waited for their parents to notice. After a while, a pair of headlights appeared behind them. The driver saw the children and honked to get Rex’s attention.

When Rex ran to the back, he was furious, but Jeannette thought he also looked scared. He told the kids they were lucky that car wasn’t the police because they’d all be in jail if it was. He closed the doors again, double-checking the latch this time, and restarted the journey.
