## Exercise: Create a Vision

Every tribe begins with a leader’s vision, usually because that leader sees a problem and wants to solve it. Therefore, to create a tribe, you should first create a vision.

* * *

What’s something that bothers you? This could be a problem as serious and complex as global warming, or as trivial as not having people to discuss your favorite TV show with.

What would the world look like if you could solve that problem right this instant? That image of the world is your _vision._

What’s something you could do _today_ to start finding people who will share in your vision? (Tip: Your social media platform of choice could provide an excellent starting point for this.)
