## Exercise: Nurture Your Sensitivity

Aron explains how to understand and manage your high sensitivity. Use this information to better accommodate your sensitive self.

* * *

Consider Aron’s explanation of treating your body like an infant. What are some distress signals your body sends you when it needs your attention? For example, do you often feel dizzy or nauseated, or do you get frequent headaches?

Now identify what stimuli trigger those distress signals from your body. Do you feel nauseated when you’re around strong smells? Or maybe you get headaches when you’re around people for too long?

Finally, what three things can you do to tend to your body’s unique needs in response to these distress signals? Do you need to avoid certain businesses or industrial areas that produce strong odors? Do you need to establish a code with a friend to let them know when you need to leave a party or social gathering?
