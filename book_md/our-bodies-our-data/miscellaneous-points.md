## Miscellaneous Points

Here is a collection of notes about the healthcare industry that frame strategy.

  * Physicians generally resist trends that threaten their dominance.
    * They resisted computerized patient data, since this would weaken the exclusive control they had over patient data.
  * The fragmentation of healthcare across providers and EMRs makes it hard for any single party to force cross compatibility.
    * This gives rise to the problem where if you get emergency treatment in a different state, the hospital may not have access to your home patient record.
  * Doctors are easily swayed by their base needs, like any other human.
    * Said one doctor: “Many reps are so friendly, so much fun to flirt with that it’s impossible to demonize them. How can you demonize someone who brings you lunch and touches your arm and remembers your birthday?”
  * HIPAA allows any provider to view the whole EMR of a patient.
    * This has caused some consternation about being totally truthful with doctor.
  * De-anonymization basically does a cryptographic hash of personal information, such as name, birth date, age, and location.
  * It’s not illegal to re-identify anonymized data, though it may be a breach of contract.
