## Sources of Medical Data

**Every vendor you interact with to get medical service is able to sell medical data.** Reselling data is a high-margin business, and thus tantalizing for managers to add to their bottom line. _Our Bodies, Our Data_ describes the following data sources:

  * Pharmacies
    * At the beginning, pharmacies were provided free software by McKesson (a drug wholesaler) in exchange for bulk sales data.
    * In the 1980s, IMS paid $50 per month for the pharmacy to load its prescription files onto a floppy disk.
    * Now pharmacies receive $0.01 per script.
  * Clearinghouses and Pharmacy Benefit Managers
    * Their normal function is to route claims from pharmacy or doctor to the payer (usually an insurance company).
  * Drug Wholesalers
    * Their normal function is to provide pharmacies with services to maximize reimbursements.
  * Medical Providers
    * In the 1960s, IMS asked doctors to complete surveys on prescriptions for different illnesses.
    * PDS sent surveys to doctors, paying $2-$10, on preferred medications and prescriptions per week.
    * Electronic medical records now make data transfer easier.
    * Large hospital networks like the Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger currently provide data for research, pharma, consultants.
  * American Medical Association
    * Sells the Physician Masterfile to data companies
  * Insurers and Insurance Claims
    * Provide diagnoses, procedures performed, and medications to data companies
    * Optum, HealthCore, BlueHealth Intelligence sell to data miners such as IMS Health
  * Diagnostic Labs
    * All test results can be sold.
    * For marketers, these are useful for getting a patient’s diagnosis and rushing a salesperson to the doctor before the patient even knows about her diagnosis.
  * Employers
    * Can sell insurance claims to data miners
  * Electronic Medical Records
    * Allscripts provides data to IMS Health, receiving $30 million a year in sales
    * GE Healthcare sells data from its Centricity EMR.
  * Data Brokers
    * LexisNexis sells medical claims from many payers, covering 250 million patients.
    * Non-medical data brokers like Experian, Epsilon, and Acxiom sell to medical data miners. These brokers aren’t subject to HIPAA and can cell non-anonymized records.
  * Public Data on the Internet. Sources include:
    * Social media: miners monitor Facebook and Twitter for mentions of medication, ailments, and keywords like “diagnosed with.”
    * Review sites: for doctors, offices
    * Location and exercise data from devices
    * Real estate transactions
    * Forum discussions
  * Proprietary Data—while these haven’t been confirmed to be currently under sale, be aware that in the future they could be.
    * Any trackable activity online, including Google searches, Youtube videos watched, ads clicked
    * Profiles and surveys, like on medical websites such as webMD
    * Data collected by medical devices, such as Apple HealthKit
