## Notable Players in Medical Data

The book describes the following major players in the medical data industry.

**IMS Health (now known as IQVIA)**

  * Founded by a German man, L.W. Frohlich.
    * He had a medical advertising agency, LW Frohlich & Co.
    * He then partnered with Arthur Sackler, at another ad agency, to split the business between competing pharma companies.
    * Frohlich developed new marketing practices for pharma, like sending telegrams to wholesalers to announce the new drug terramycin. He also developed direct mail to doctors.
    * As an advertiser, it was difficult to prove the effect of marketing on their clients’ bottom line, so Frohlich created Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS) with David Dubow to research market share, then use this to inform ad clients.
    * Frohlich died in 1971. Sackler’s brothers inherit the majority of IMS through a tontine. Some suspect Arthur Sackler was the originator of IMS and put Frohlich as its figurehead.
  * IMS Health has the popular Drug Distribution Data service.
  * Was acquired for $1.7 billion in 1988, under the same umbrella as AC Nielsen.
  * In 1993, it started providing doctor profiles with its Xponent service
  * It went public with an IPO in 2014.
  * In 2015, the company had $2.9 billion in revenue. Half of the revenue came from information, and half from services. It made the logical step of providing consulting to its clients once they had the data.
  * In 2016, IMS merged with competitor Quintiles, and the joint company was renamed IQVIA in 2017.
  * The firm is said to have 90% of global market share.



**PDS (Pharmaceutical Data Services), Source International**

  * Started by McKesson in 1978
    * Began with doctor surveys, then started buying prescription data from pharmacies
    * Funded by pharma like Merck, Pfizer
  * Was purchased in 1988 by IMS execs Evans and Dennis Turner
    * Afterward, pushed into **doctor-identified information** , getting accurate data on prescriptions and sales per doctor
    * Renames as Source International
  * Was acquired by Symphony in 2012



**Verispan**

  * Was created by McKesson and Quintiles in 2002
  * Got annual revenue of $100 million, with its biggest customer paying $6 million per year
  * Was acquired by SDI, then acquired by IMS



**ArcLight**

  * Started by Krieger from Cardinal Health. It challenged IMS with a few benefits:
    * It provided data reports more quickly
    * It gave large pharmacies equity in ArcLight to avoid upfront fees
    * Walmart stopped working with IMS because competitors could figure out individual store revenue numbers from IMS reports
  * ArcLight went out of business in the 2000s a few years after trying to create anonymized patient dossiers. It had difficulty matching joining anonymized data.
