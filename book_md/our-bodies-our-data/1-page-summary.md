## 1-Page Summary

Take a look at what the leading data broker, IQVIA (with a market cap of $20 billion), boasts to have:

  * 530 million non-identified patient records
  * 85% of global pharma sales tracked
  * 400,000 sources of social media
  * 15 million healthcare professionals



It's no exaggeration to assume that all your health providers are reselling all your medical data to brokers like IQVIA.

**Nearly all information is sold** —your disease diagnoses, what drugs you take for which conditions, what your most recent lab tests say, who your doctors are and when you saw them. **Every vendor you interact with to get medical service is able to sell medical data.** Reselling data is a high-margin business, and thus tantalizing for managers to add to their bottom line. Companies you interact with that sell your data include pharmacies, medical providers, and insurers.

The only restriction they have by HIPAA law is to remove identifying information like your name, address, and Social Security Number, instead creating a **unique personal code for you**.

The removal of your name from your record is little barrier. With so much data and this unique code, the data broker compiles data streams into a new patient record. Any new data the broker receives is associated with your personal record, making it more and more identifiable.

**Simply picture your entire medical record owned by multiple third parties, just with your name and SSN replaced by a unique ID—this reflects reality.**

The broker then resells your health record, along with those of hundreds of millions of other patients, for marketing, industry analysis, and research purposes. Note that in large part, the data buyers (eg pharma companies) are interested not in you as an individual but how you fit into general trends—what drugs you're taking or switching to, what drugs your doctors are prescribing compared to other doctors, how disease prevalence varies by location.

But there is always a risk of a data leak.**And given how much information your patient record has, it can likely quickly be matched back to you** , especially if you have a rare condition or see a unique combination of doctors, or have any other public health-related information (for example, a Twitter post about seeing your doctor on a particular day, or public exercise data from health devices).

In some sense, it’s already too late to opt out or take back your data. Data brokers say your records can’t be traced back to you, so even if you wanted to opt out, it claims to have no way to tell which data to delete. But at a minimum, you _should_ be aware of the extent to which your data is shared and be sensitive to future opportunities to opt out, should you so choose.
