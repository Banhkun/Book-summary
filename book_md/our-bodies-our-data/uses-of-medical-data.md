## Uses of Medical Data

What is enabled by having hundreds of millions of patient records?

Many pharma business decisions can be empowered by granular data on which patients take which drugs in which locations. Research studies are also empowered by large datasets.

The risk is that more unsavory, discriminatory uses can arise.

Here’s an array of how different types of firms can use medical data for their own purposes.

  * Pharma Companies
    * Empower their salesforce to market drugs to more susceptible doctors
      * They can get fast feedback within weeks on whether their efforts on greasing doctors are working.
      * Large pharma companies pay $10-40 million per year for IMS Health data, consulting, and services.
    * Understand their competition and breakdown of market share
    * Understand patient behaviors:
      * Persistency (how long they keep a drug)
      * Compliance (how often they fill a prescription)
      * Switching behavior and what specific drugs they switch to
      * Concomitance (other drugs patient takes)
    * Predict which drugs will be sellers, market needs for different illnesses
    * Market medication to patients
      * Combine demographic data from anonymized sources that are enriched for your ailment or treatment, then use named sources to target named users who are more likely to buy. For example, a marketer might find that people who use a particular drug are in their 50s in rural Tennessee; they can then target people with that specific profile for their drug.
    * Market medication to providers
      * They can both market in response to what the provider tends to prescribe, and also customized to what the doctor’s patients have recently been diagnosed with
  * Financial Traders
    * Use medical data as info to trade with—for instance, which drugs are popular and not can influence what stocks will rise and fall
  * Researchers
    * Study long-term outcomes of different treatments
    * Study the effect of regulation on health outcomes
    * Public health studies, such as epidemics, drug use, health trends
  * Employers
    * Study patient and spend data to figure out how to reduce costs
    * Benchmark their costs against other employers
  * Healthcare Providers
    * Compare cost and quality with competition
    * Improve care internally
    * Market to recruit new patients
  * Payers
    * Find billing fraud
  * Insurers, Underwriters
    * Get patient consent for insurer to access named data on prescriptions, tests
    * Insurers can share info with each other through Medical Information Bureau
  * Attorneys
    * Contact patients for class action lawsuits
  * Advertising Platforms
    * Sell data to Google or Facebook to allow more precise ad targeting of their users
  * More controversial or illegal uses—not currently done publicly, but are notable risks in an environment with such granular and plentiful data.
    * Employers can discriminate against people with higher healthcare costs
    * Lenders may charge higher interest to people with specific conditions
    * Insurers may charge higher life insurance premiums to those of a particular profile
    * Blackmailers may use health data to exploit people.
    * Traders may use health data of CEOs.
