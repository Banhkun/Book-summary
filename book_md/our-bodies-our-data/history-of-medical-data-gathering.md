## History of Medical Data Gathering

_Our Bodies, Our Data_ contains a useful history of how resold medical data became increasingly personal and detailed.

The overall trend over the past decades is toward 1) more granular data consisting of more detail about a patient’s history, 2) data linked to distinct providers and patients, and 3) piecing together large datasets longitudinally across time. A few examples:

  * Wholesalers and pharmacies started by selling bulk sales data. This allowed study of pharmaceutical company market share, overall and by territory.
  * Prescription data with doctor identification allowed data companies to create profiles on the prescribing habits of individual doctors.
  * Anonymized patient data from wide sources were linked together to get patient dossiers.



### Brief History

1930s: Nielsen pays pharmacies to share wholesale invoices every 2 months to project overall US sales. Staffers also count products on shelves to monitor sales rates. This data helps firms target advertising and sales to regions and seasons.

Pharma research firm Davee, Koehnlein and Keating uses receipts from US pharmacies and manufacturers to estimate pharma market sizes by category.

1947: Graduate student Gosselin asks drugstores for permission to copy their prescription records. Pharma companies get interested in this service to get precise sales and compare their presence vs. the competition. He starts a company in 1952 to send bimonthly nationwide pharmacy surveys. He eventually asks physicians to share their prescription writing to correlate physician attributes with specific drug sales.

  * Note that understanding drug sales (what leaves the door) is distinct from drug prescriptions, since sales are what actually gets pharma revenue.



1957: IMS acquires purchase data from wholesale pharmacies to estimate market sizes in Germany.

1960s: IMS begins asking doctors to share what they prescribe for different diagnoses.

  * Generally it tries to get data for free, arguing the data will help science. Otherwise they give $50 a month for this data.



IMS starts the Drug Distribution Data service which merges data from drug wholesalers and pharma to determine total sales by salesperson territories.

  * Weakness: misses traveling prescriptions (script written in one territory and filled in another) and doesn’t have per-doctor granularity



1978: McKesson starts Pharmaceutical Data Services, which sends surveys to 100k’s of doctors.

  * In the early 1980s, PDS starts buying doctor-identified prescriptions from pharmacies.
  * PDS generates physician profiles by matching doctor prescribing data with prescription _filling_ data, to get real sales, not just prescriptions.



Patient dossiers start to be compiled about distinct patients.

  * Anonymized dossiers compile data from multiple data sources.
  * IMS Health (now called IQVIA) and Symphony Health are major players.
