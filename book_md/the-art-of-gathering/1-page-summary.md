## 1-Page Summary

Have you ever attended a conference and spent the entire time waiting for it to end? Have you ever gone to a wedding and felt there was something missing?

Experiences like these inspired Priya Parker, an expert on gatherings, to write _The Art of Gathering_. Parker contends that pre-planned gatherings of all types—both business and personal— _could_ be meaningful experiences, but too many gatherings miss the opportunity to become so. In her book, Parker presents a step-by-step guide to transforming your gathering into a meaningful event that people will be talking about for years to come.

In our guide, we’ll first discuss what you need to do _before_ the gathering to set the stage for a meaningful, potentially transformative experience. Then, we’ll talk about how to begin the gathering and dispel several misconceptions that result in boring (or downright unpleasant) gatherings. Finally, we’ll share how to end the gathering in a more meaningful way. Along the way, we’ll discuss what other experts say about gathering well and share practical ways to apply Parker’s tips to virtual or hybrid gatherings.

### What to Do Before the Gathering

Parker argues that what you do _before_ the gathering is just as important as what you do during the gathering itself. She shares five essential tips: Identify the reason, curate your guest list, select a venue, create directives, and set expectations.

#### Identify the Reason

According to Parker, the first thing you should do when planning your gathering is to **identify the reason** , or “purpose,” for which you’re gathering. You should have one clear, distinct, and specific reason for gathering that’s _not_ defined by the type of gathering you’re having. For example, a bachelorette party is not a reason; “give my bridesmaids a chance to bond with each other before the wedding” is.

Why do you need a reason? Parker explains that **without one, you might gather in unhelpful ways**. This may result in a missed opportunity to do something meaningful. Alternatively, you might gather in ways that are antithetical to your values; this can happen when you follow traditional customs because you find the custom _itself_ significant but not the original _reason_ the custom was developed.

> **How to Identify the Reason for Your Business Meeting**
> 
> Like Parker, business experts recommend that you identify the reason you’re gathering whenever you have a meeting. Without one, your meeting may be unhelpful—not just because you miss the opportunity to do something meaningful or because the meeting doesn’t meet your values, but because it wastes your attendees’ time and stresses them out because they _could_ be doing something useful and productive instead of attending a purposeless meeting.
> 
> Unlike Parker, business experts suggest that you can have multiple reasons for meeting. To determine whether your meeting’s reason is clear, evaluate it using the S.M.A.R.T. metric. Your meeting should have a Specific, Measurable goal: You should be able to easily measure whether you met that goal during the meeting. This goal should also be something that you can Attain Realistically within the allotted Time for the meeting.

Additionally, Parker argues that when you have _one_ specific reason for gathering**,** you can**use this reason as a guideline by which to evaluate _all_ the decisions **you make at the gathering. A specific reason makes decision-making easier because it presents a clear path to follow, whereas a general reason can be ambiguous and open up too many options when you're trying to decide on something.

For example, in many Western weddings, the bride’s father walks the bride down the aisle. A modern couple might wish _not_ to do this custom since the ritual stems from back when a wedding signified that the bride was now the responsibility of her new husband rather than her father. But if the couple’s parents find meaning in the custom itself, what should the couple do?

If the couple has one clear, specific reason, such as “to celebrate our union as individuals” (as opposed to, say “to celebrate the joining of our families”) then they know what to do: The custom is not about the individual couple but their families, so they won’t do it. But if their reason is something like “celebrate love” and thus doesn’t specify who the focus of the ceremony is, the reason won’t help them make that decision.

(Shortform note: Having a specific guideline by which to evaluate all your other decisions may also help preserve your cognitive energy when planning a gathering. Having to decide between too many options—as you might when planning a gathering—overwhelms your brain and exhausts you. But if you have a clear guideline to evaluate these decisions, you can trim down your options quickly and not expend as much cognitive energy deciding between them.)

To discover your reason, Parker recommends that you repeatedly**ask yourself _why_ you’re gathering **until you discover an underlying conviction. For example, if you want to have a bachelorette party, ask yourself why that matters.

(Shortform note: If you have a weekly gathering (like a team meeting), keep in mind that your reason for gathering may evolve as the needs of your group or the format changes. In particular, Parker points out in a separate guide to virtual gatherings that taking your gathering online may change _why_ you’re having it—so you need to identify that reason and adjust accordingly. For example, a weekly team meeting in person may have been a quick way to update the team on the office goings-on; a weekly team meeting online may also provide more opportunities for the team to connect since they now rarely see each other, so you may want to allot a few extra minutes for team members to catch up.)

#### Curate Your Guest List

Once you’ve decided on a reason for gathering, the next step is to **curate your guest list**. In other words, decide who helps you fulfill your reason—then invite only those people.

Parker explains that despite how it may seem at first glance, **limiting your guest list is a compassionate act**. If you invite people who don’t support your reason, they may actively sabotage it. But even if they don’t, they’ll _still_ undermine your reason because they’ll inevitably distract you (as the host) with their presence. As a result, you won’t give your full attention to the guests for whom the gathering is designed. In this way, _not_ inviting people who don’t actively support your reason is an act of compassion toward the guests you _do_ invite.

For example, you might travel with your bridesmaids to New Orleans for a bachelorette party so that your bridesmaids, who don’t know each other well, can bond before the wedding. If one bridesmaid has a friend who lives in New Orleans, she may ask if this friend can come to an event you have planned. This friend might sabotage your gathering by dragging your bridesmaid away from the group and having a long conversation with just her. But even if she doesn’t, you’ll be distracted by this friend’s presence; instead of focusing on making sure that your bridesmaids are connecting with each other, you’ll be focused on making sure this friend is having a good time.

(Shortform note: Despite Parker’s contention that limiting your guest list is a compassionate act, some people may grow upset if you either don’t invite them or don’t permit them to bring a guest. So how can you mitigate potential damage? If there’s a risk that a friend will find out that you’ve had an event without them, experts recommend informing them why they’re not invited before that can happen. And if you’re worried that someone might want to bring a plus one, consider creating a written invitation that clearly states that only the recipient is invited.)

When limiting the size of your gathering, Parker recommends that you keep in mind both _who_ and _how many people_ support the purpose. If you want a small, intimate group, limit your gathering to six to 12 people. If you want to foster intimacy while still allowing for diverse perspectives, you can have up to 15 people. For a more animated, party-like vibe, invite 30 people. And if you want a big gathering, a group of 150 people feels large but still connected.

(Shortform note: Keep in mind that the bigger your gathering, the bigger the budget you’ll need for it. So even if you want a livelier vibe, you may be unable to provide one due to financial constraints. This is particularly true if you’re serving food or drinks, as this cost is directly proportional to the number of attendees. Experts suggest that a corporate event that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner should budget about $150 per person—which would amount to $900 for a small gathering of six but nearly $20,000 for a group of 150.)

#### Select an Appropriate Venue

Once you know how many people are coming to your gathering, **select an appropriate venue**. Parker explains that an appropriate venue has three important qualities. First, it will immerse your guests in the reason for the gathering and thus enhance their experience. Second, it will encourage the conduct you desire (and discourage conduct you don’t want), as people are primed to behave differently depending on the environment. Third, it will encourage unexpected behavior in your guests—in this case, a slightly unexpected venue will help.

For example, if you work at a foundation that supports marine life, try holding an important meeting not in a conference room but in an aquarium exhibit. By surrounding your participants with marine life, you’ll enhance their experience. You’ll also encourage them to make (perhaps unexpected) decisions that help sea life and discourage the more business-oriented decisions that they’re used to making in the conference room.

> **Changing Your Environment Helps You Change Your Habits**
> 
> Changing your environment can also encourage positive behavior in your own life, such as when you’re trying to change your habits. The authors of _Influencer_ explain that your environment has a deceptively strong impact on your life—affecting not just your behavior but also your mental and physical health. However, the environment is so much a part of our daily lives that it's often hard to see how it shapes our everyday behaviors.
> 
> To _notice_ your environment—and gain the motivation to change undesirable behavior—adjust the environment you’ve grown accustomed to in a slightly unexpected way that encourages your desired behavior. For example, if you snack mindlessly during the day, keep the wrappers from all your consumed snacks in a clear container on your desk. This small change will draw attention to a previously unconscious, undesirable behavior and thus encourage you to change it.

#### Create Directives

The fourth pre-gathering step, according to Parker, is to **create directives** , which she calls “pop-up rules.” In other words, give specific instructions about how you’d like your guests to behave during the event—such as that they should all bring a particular type of dish—and clearly communicate them to your guests.

Parker recommends creating directives for two reasons. First, **clear directives make diverse gatherings more comfortable**. Many hosts expect their guests to behave according to certain defined protocols. However, this expectation often backfires in an increasingly multicultural world. If your guest list is diverse, they will have different (and potentially clashing) cultural expectations of what is appropriate; for example, a Japanese person will expect guests to help them clean up after a house party, while an American might find this practice insulting. Clear directives remove a lot of potential friction and pave the way for a smoother gathering.

(Shortform note: While clear directives may _help_ make a diverse gathering more comfortable, they may not be enough. Another way to make diverse gatherings more comfortable is to use inclusive language, such as by introducing your guests to each other with their pronouns or by avoiding gendered terms like “boys and girls.” Modeling the behavior you want your guests to engage in is also another way in which you can make clear what you’d like your guests to do and so avoid the potential cultural clashes regarding correct behavior that Parker warns against.)

Second, Parker argues that **clear directives encourage engagement**. For example, people are often glued to their cell phones—even in situations when checking their phone is generally considered rude. But if you _temporarily_ ban cell phones during your gathering, the short-term nature of this directive will make it seem more like a rule of a game. As a result, your guests will find pleasure in ignoring their cell phones rather than feeling restricted—and thus be more engaged within your gathering.

(Shortform note: While some directives may encourage engagement, not everybody agrees that a cell phone ban is an effective rule. One study found that people who had a fear of missing out experienced increased stress when they muted their phone notifications. So it’s possible that some guests, rather than viewing the cell phone ban as a game, will be so distracted by what they might be missing that they’ll be _less_ engaged with your event. Additionally, certain events may benefit from cell phone usage. For example, you could encourage engagement at a big conference by asking people to Tweet questions to the speakers from their phones.)

Parker advises keeping two things in mind when creating directives. First, **your directives should be one-time-only**. This doesn’t mean that you can’t use the same directive (like no cell phones) for multiple events; rather, it means that the fact that _one_ gathering is a certain way doesn’t mean that all subsequent gatherings will be that way. By making these directives one-time-only, you can experiment with different kinds of directives and create very specific moods at specific gatherings.

> **When to Repeat Directives**
> 
> If you have a recurring gathering, you may wish to skip having one-time-only directives and instead repeat the same directives for each event while being open to changing them if necessary. Otherwise, guests may grow confused and frustrated at having to follow different directives at each gathering. It could also make it difficult for organizers to maintain control over the event if attendees feel that the directives are constantly changing.
> 
> For example, some companies have “core norms” (behavioral guidelines that apply to participants at nearly all meetings) and “specialty norms” (behavioral guidelines that apply to participants at _specific types_ of meetings). For example, you might have “if you think something is a bad idea, say so” as a core norm, but temporarily suspend that during a brainstorming meeting where the specialty norm is “name as many ideas as you can.”

Second, while it’s better to explicitly communicate your directives to guests in advance, **your directives can be spur-of-the-moment** if necessary. For example, Parker once held a retreat for a Thai company. The retreat was designed to foster the consultants’ relationship with each other; however, the cultural expectation that the consultants were available to their clients at all times caused several consultants to repeatedly arrive late to several sessions. Parker created a spur-of-the-moment directive that any late consultant had to do push-ups; this directive encouraged people to arrive on time.

(Shortform note: Keep in mind that it’s difficult to create inclusive spur-of-the-moment directives—especially if you’re not familiar with your guests. Guests with physical or health limitations may feel uncomfortable with directives that involve physical exertion, like push-ups. Additionally, in a culturally diverse gathering, you may inadvertently offend certain guests if you don’t carefully consider their cultural expectations when creating spur-of-the-moment directives. You may be able to get around these risks by encouraging guests to share if they’re uncomfortable with the directives—but remember that this may not work in all cultures. For example, subordinates in some cultures often won’t speak unless explicitly called upon.)

#### Set Expectations

The fifth pre-gathering step, according to Parker, is to **set expectations**. While most hosts assume that the gathering begins when everybody arrives, Parker argues that in reality, the start of your gathering is whenever you tell a guest about it. So during the lead-up to your gathering, you should set expectations with your guests so that they have a clear idea of what will happen.

Parker contends that setting clear expectations during the lead-up to your guests’ arrival is essential for two reasons. First, **setting expectations will help your guests get into the right mood**. As a result, they’ll arrive at the gathering feeling more open to fully participating in the experience. Second, **setting expectations prevents guests from feeling cheated**. It reduces the possibility that your guests will feel disappointed because their own (incorrect) expectations for the gathering were unfulfilled.

Parker recommends two strategies for setting clear expectations. First, **name your gathering**. The right name will communicate to your guests both what they should be doing _during_ the gathering and how the gathering relates to their roles. For example, is your business gathering a workshop or a seminar? A workshop implies that your guests will need to be active and possibly brainstorm ideas during the gathering, while a seminar suggests that your guests will be more passive and perhaps take notes while listening to a lecture.

(Shortform note: Setting clear expectations is _also_ important in other social situations—notably when dating. When asking someone out, experts recommend that you explicitly name the occasion: Say that you’d like to take them on a “date” instead of merely suggesting that you hang out. By doing so, you establish the right mood pre-date, give them sufficient time to prepare, and communicate what behavior is and isn’t appropriate during the occasion. You also prevent any awkwardness or disappointment that may arise from unfulfilled expectations if your date mistakenly believes that you’re just hanging out as friends.)

Second, **ask people to do things that encourage them to arrive at the gathering** in the right mindset. For example, if you want to hold a year-end business meeting to reflect on your accomplishments, you might ask people to think of someone they want to celebrate (if the mood is celebratory) or ask them to name some challenges (if the mood is more reflective).

(Shortform note: When setting clear expectations with others, don’t forget to manage your _own_ expectations, too! Be realistic when asking your guests to do pre-gathering tasks: Asking people to _think_ of someone they want to celebrate is reasonable; asking them to write a report with two days’ notice is probably not. Keeping your expectations in check reduces the likelihood that you’ll be disappointed at the gathering’s outcome and ensures that you don’t damage your relationships with your guests by making unreasonable demands.)

### How to Begin the Gathering

After you’ve completed all the pre-gathering steps, the day of your gathering will come and your guests will start to arrive. But, Parker argues, if you don’t handle these moments right, all that pre-gathering work will have been wasted. For the best possible gathering, Parker suggests that you pay attention to two key moments: the arrival and the opening.

#### Manage Your Guests’ Arrival

Parker suggests that **you manage your guests’ arrival** by introducing a clear physical or metaphorical transition into your gathering. When your guests arrive, they will be mentally wrapped up in whatever else is going on in their lives—like the fight they just had with their sister. By providing them with an appropriate transition, you encourage them to forget about everything else and refocus their attention on your gathering so they can be fully engaged.

(Shortform note: If you (as a guest) are preoccupied with an unrelated event before entering a gathering, it’s arguably your responsibility (not the host’s) to manage your worries so that they don’t distract you from participating fully in the gathering. Try meditating or journaling before the gathering so that you can clear your mind slightly and enter the gathering as a blank slate.)

**The simplest and most literal transition, Parker points out, is a doorway**. What you do at the door can help shape your guest’s experience; for example, greeting your guests at the door as if you’re at a wedding will help set a more personal tone for your event. You can go one step further and decorate a hallway in keeping with your event—just as Disneyland designs the hallway into their rides with thematically related items. Alternatively, **create a psychological transition**. Parker describes how one comedian, prior to starting his set at a charity event, captured the attention of his audience by asking the loudest member of several conversational groups to introduce themselves and then asking everybody to clap.

> **How to Create Meaningful Transitions**
> 
> In _The Power of Moments_ , Dan and Chip Heath agree that transitions have the potential to become memorable and meaningful when you engineer a clear moment that carries you from one stage to the next. To engineer meaning, they recommend that you deliberately incorporate one of the following four elements: elevation (above everyday experience), insight (an opportunity to discover something new), pride (a sense of validation), or connection. You can creatively incorporate these both into physical and psychological transitions. For example, the comedian Parker describes created a sense of pride for those being applauded and a sense of connection between them and the rest of the audience. And greeting your guests at the door provides a sense of connection.

#### Open Right

After properly transitioning into your gathering, turn your attention to the opening. Parker explains that you must **open in a way that sets the tone for the gathering**.

Parker argues that opening right matters: Studies suggest that most people tend to remember beginnings—so how you open will linger most in people’s memory. However, most hosts at gatherings open with organizational matters, such as by thanking sponsors. At best, opening with organizational matters misses an opportunity to harness the pre-gathering momentum you’ve created into a powerful moment. At worst, it may undermine the reason for gathering. For example, if you frame a conference as game-changing and disruptive but start with a boring list of rules, you send the message that you’re following old rules.

> **Why Beginnings Matter**
> 
> In _When_ , Daniel Pink elaborates on the power of beginnings. He explains that people feel more optimistic and capable at the start of something, partly due to a psychological phenomenon known as the “fresh start effect”: Beginnings give people the opportunity to mentally distance themselves from their past mistakes and envision a different (improved) version of themselves.
> 
> This may explain why a powerful opening is so beneficial—and why a boring opening is so damaging. A powerful opening doesn’t just linger in your guests’ memory; it also provides a clear psychological distinction between the person they were _pre-_ gathering and the person they’ll be _post_ -gathering. But a gathering that opens with logistics doesn’t provide that clear distinction—so the experience won’t ever impact your guests as powerfully as it otherwise might have.

To open right, Parker recommends that you first **make your guests feel accepted and grateful to be at the gathering**. This will make them feel like they’re part of something special. Parker describes how one professor memorized every student’s name and then greeted each by name on the first day of a 70-person class: This made the students feel special and demonstrated the professor’s impressive ability.

(Shortform note: In _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ , Dale Carnegie explains why remembering your guest’s name makes them feel accepted and grateful. A person’s name is their favorite word so saying it is a subtle and welcome compliment. However, in _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Carnegie warns against _expecting_ gratitude from your guests for your opening—no matter how well-thought-out. Ingratitude is human nature, so expecting gratitude from others will only lead to resentment on your part. Instead of risking being disappointed that your guests don’t feel grateful, consider focusing on the joy of giving them an impressive opening—without expecting anything in return.)

Second, Parker suggests that you **create a collective among your guests**. As a host, it is your job to make the guests feel like they are part of a group. One simple way to do this is to get your guests to acknowledge each other’s presence and learn something about each other. For example, you might ask your conference attendees to introduce themselves to each other at the table.

(Shortform note: In her guide to virtual gatherings, Parker suggests that providing breakout rooms in which your guests can chat will help them feel like more of a collective. Having unstructured time in which they can briefly get to know each other will help them connect in a way that’s often difficult to do online.)

### How to Behave During the Gathering

Just as important as how you behave _before_ your gathering is how you behave _during_ the gathering. In this section, we’ll dispel the three misconceptions that Parker believes harm your gathering—and share her recommendations on how to behave instead.

#### Misconception #1: The Host Should Relax

The first harmful misconception, according to Parker, is the idea that **the host should relax** , or “chill.” Hosts who think they should relax leave guests to their own devices—such as by letting guests roam around the venue unrestricted. These hosts see their refusal to direct the gathering as an act of kindness that will result in a laid-back, undirected affair. But in reality, if a host doesn’t direct his own affair, someone else will—usually in a manner that ruins the gathering for everybody else.

Instead, Parker recommends that you shift your mindset and **deliberately direct the gathering**. In other words, you must use your power as a host to make your guests _do_ things they might not choose themselves. If this seems too stuffy, remind yourself that deliberate direction is kinder than relaxing—as long as it’s motivated by a desire to provide your _guests_ with a maximally fulfilling experience. If you’re motivated by anything else (like a desire to seem more important), you’ll detract from, rather than enhance, your guests’ experience.

> **Why Women Don’t Want to Deliberately Direct**
> 
> Female hosts may be particularly reluctant to deliberately direct their gathering due to cultural expectations that women need to be low-maintenance to be attractive. This is personified by the “cool girl” trope often perpetuated in movies. The “cool girl” is always effortlessly beautiful and carefree, and she makes few demands on those around her. And she’s often contrasted with a more high-maintenance woman who _does_ make demands on the people around her and is presented as inherently less desirable.
> 
> But just as deliberately directing your gathering can be kinder to your _guests_ , doing so can be kinder to yourself. If you clearly tell your guests what you want them to do, they’ll likely do it—and you’ll grow happier because the gathering is going well in the way that you prefer.

Parker explains that deliberately directing your gathering involves doing three things. First, **defend your guests against actions that harm the good of the gathering** —even if doing so is unpleasant. For example, one movie theater expels guests who use their cell phones during the show. This policy upsets the expelled guests but enhances the other guests’ moviegoing experience.

(Shortform note: As a guest, you can prevent _yourself_ from harming the good of the gathering by not attending if you don’t agree with the event’s purpose. For example, if you love texting during movies, you could avoid the movie theater Parker mentions. In a separate blog post, Parker recommends that if you’re invited to a gathering, ask yourself whether and why you want to attend. If you’re unable to come up with a compelling reason, don’t feel obligated to go.)

Second, **level the playing field** : Identify and temporarily destroy any relevant inequalities. This allows guests to relate to each other as equals, rather than deferring to each other out of societal norms. For example, if you’re hosting a party among people of vastly different career levels, select a restaurant that everybody can afford.

(Shortform note: In some cases, leveling the playing field may mean letting go as a host. For example, The Dinner Party gathers people in their 20s-40s at dinner parties specifically to discuss grief. Previously, the organizers deliberately created tables of equals by matching each participant to a table that met their specific needs—such as one composed of guests who’d experienced suicide loss. But in 2021, the organizers let go and started letting participants choose their own tables. In this way, the participants were able to find tables in which _they_ felt most comfortable (and equal)—which wasn’t necessarily what the _organizers_ thought would make them feel most equal. In this way, letting go improved the guests’ experiences.)

Third, **facilitate links between your guests** and do things to help them get to know each other despite any discomfort they (or you) might feel. For example, Parker once asked people to switch tables regularly during a conference; despite the guests’ original reluctance, they were ultimately grateful for the number of connections they made.

(Shortform note: How can you connect better with a fellow guest once your host introduces you? Try repeating their name. In _The Fine Art of Small Talk_ , Debra Fine argues that everyone has the right to be called by their name. Moreover, repeating someone’s name increases the chances that you’ll remember it—which is particularly important if you switch tables regularly and meet many people. Additionally, Fine recommends asking open-ended questions that demand more than a one-word answer. You’ll encourage the other person to talk more about themselves—and the more they give you, the more you’ll have to talk about.)

#### Misconception #2: Be Positive

The second harmful misconception, according to Parker, is the idea that **everybody should be positive**. When we gather—whether at a party or conference—most of us put on a show: We present ourselves as strong and confident, and we hide our vulnerabilities. Parker argues that this is a missed opportunity to connect with others. If your guests tell stories that reveal their vulnerability, other guests will feel more empathetic toward them. As a result, they’ll all feel more authentically connected to each other. At the very least, this authentic connection will make for a more memorable gathering; at its best, a deeper connection can allow for greater cooperation.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Vulnerability_ , Brené Brown elaborates on why vulnerability _isn’t_ a sign of weakness and why being vulnerable increases the probability of authentic connection. Brown explains that although vulnerability requires sharing shame and emotion, it’s a sign of strength: It requires bravery to share something intimate with someone when you don’t know how they’ll perceive you. Brown adds that vulnerability enhances your connection with others because it builds trust: It’s nearly impossible to trust someone if you don’t know their motives, personality, or feelings—so to develop trust (and an authentic connection) with someone, you must be willing to be vulnerable.)

Parker shares several techniques for encouraging your guests to open up and be vulnerable when the gathering calls for vulnerability. Pre-gathering, **consider inviting people who don’t know each other**. People often feel more comfortable sharing intimate details with people in whom they’re not invested, as they don’t feel pressured to maintain a particular image.

(Shortform note: People may feel more comfortable divulging intimate details to strangers if you present it as an experiment, as psychologist Arthur Aron famously did. He asked strangers to ask each other 36 questions that demanded gradually increasing levels of vulnerability. Two of his subjects married each other, and several other couples who’ve asked each other those questions have also fallen in love.)

Parker recommends that you **set the stage** during the gathering. Begin the gathering by clearly explaining to your guests why you’re asking them to be vulnerable. Then, **ask for stories**. Specify that you want to hear not about their accomplishments but about something more authentic, such as life-defining experiences. If your guests know each other, request stories that nobody else in the room knows. Once people start sharing, **share your story early** , and make sure it’s slightly more intimate than those you want your guests to share. Your guests will cue off your example and share stories that are slightly less intimate than yours.

> **How to Encourage Vulnerability at Work**
> 
> In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown presents an alternate method for encouraging vulnerability when leading a business gathering. Set the stage by acknowledging the uncertainty or risk of the situation. Speak openly about your emotions, but don’t overshare personal information in an effort to draw sympathy—this is manipulative and may backfire rather than provide the outcome you want. Then, instead of asking for stories, provide a space for your team members to discuss the situation. This space for discussion is essential: If you ask for your team’s input _without_ letting them discuss the situation—such as by shooting down ideas you don’t agree with—they won’t trust you and so won’t express their concerns for fear of being criticized.

Finally, **don’t pressure your guests too much**. As a host, you should encourage (but not demand) your guests to share; at one gathering, Parker created a rule that whoever shared last had to sing. However, some people won’t feel comfortable being extremely vulnerable in a group no matter what you do—and that’s OK. So choose a theme that invites interpretation; this will allow such people to be vulnerable within boundaries they’re comfortable with.

> **How to Better Engage With Vulnerability**
> 
> No matter how open to interpretation the theme is, you (as a guest) may _still_ be uncomfortable engaging with vulnerability. If so, _Daring Greatly_ author Brené Brown suggests that you notice the defense mechanism you use to avoid vulnerability, and see if you can work through it.

> Brown recommends three possible solutions. If you notice that you experience happiness during the gathering but then immediately feel fear, express gratitude for that happiness—doing so will remind you that there is enough happiness to go around and you don’t need to be scared of losing it. If you think your story needs to be perfect before you share it, permit yourself to have it be bad. And if you try to _avoid_ sharing—such as by deliberately deciding to go last, despite your fear of potential punishment (like the singing at Parker’s gathering)—practice mindfulness and strive to be present so that you can engage with both your own and your guests’ vulnerability.

#### Misconception #3: Be Peaceful

The third harmful misconception, according to Parker, is the idea that **all gatherings must be peaceful**. Parker argues that in the modern world, most of us act as if we should avoid heated disagreements. Even universities—ostensibly institutions designed to encourage argument—shy away from anything _too_ controversial, such as by rescinding invitations to speakers who draw student protests.

However, Parker warns that prioritizing peace above all else can sometimes backfire and undermine your reason for gathering. Certain gatherings require that long-simmering tensions be brought out into the open and worked through—whether that’s because the gathering is _about_ a controversial topic or because the group’s work outside the gathering is being _hampered_ by these tensions. For example, you might hold a debate about gun control, or you might have educators who need to create a curriculum but are debating what kind of ideas they want to teach their students. If you avoid this requirement, you won’t effectively discuss or work through any of these issues—and they’ll continue to sow disharmony.

> **How Peace Harms Universities**
> 
> Several university students and professors agree with Parker that prioritizing peace undermines their reason for gathering at the university. Universities are designed to encourage the free exchange of ideas. However, in classes about controversial topics, students sometimes refuse to share their opinions because they fear that doing so will result in a lower grade. Outside the classroom, students and professors self-censor due to fear of backlash on social media and in real life: One professor who expressed an unpopular viewpoint had his office door vandalized.
> 
> While some argue that students and professors could simply get over these fears and share anyway, some argue that universities should implement policies that encourage greater sharing—such as by refusing to cancel controversial speakers. These recommendations support Parker’s contention that sometimes, prioritizing peace _isn’t_ the way to go.

If you’re intrigued by the idea of encouraging disagreement at your gathering, you’ll first need to **decide** **whether doing so will be helpful**. Pre-gathering, identify potential areas of disagreement by asking probing questions of the participants (including yourself). As a group, what are you afraid to talk about? What do people get defensive about, and why? Then, weigh the potential pros and cons of addressing these issues—and only proceed if you feel that the potential pros outweigh the cons.

(Shortform note: When deciding whether to encourage disagreement, you may wish to consider the age of the people at your gathering. In _The Coddling of the American Mind_ , Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt argue that college-age students are particularly avoidant of disagreement: They grew up in environments (like schools) that sheltered them from opinions they didn’t agree with, so they’re uncomfortable with adversity to the point that they sometimes conflate emotional discomfort with trauma. So even if both a younger and an older person are defensive or afraid to talk about the same issue, the younger person may be more likely to deem the conversation traumatic—amplifying the potential cons of disagreement.)

If you choose to proceed, **create a safe space** : Try to make participants as comfortable as possible dealing with an uncomfortable topic. Parker suggests that you ask the participants to create guidelines for the discussion by asking them, “How can we help you feel comfortable taking a chance during our discussion today?” Jointly creating guidelines in this manner has three benefits. First, it signals to participants that you’d like them to put themselves out there during the discussion. Second, it prompts the participants to ban undesirable behaviors they’ve resorted to in the past. Third, it encourages compliance—participants are more likely to follow guidelines that they had a hand in creating.

> **Promote Listening in a Safe Space**
> 
> When helping participants create discussion guidelines, encourage ones that promote listening. The authors of _Difficult Conversations_ explain that listening is a vital skill for working through tough talks: If someone doesn’t feel heard, they’ll stop listening—so making sure that they _do_ feel heard will encourage them to continue participating in the conversation. Consider encouraging participants to listen better by suggesting that they paraphrase each other’s responses. This helps confirm that they’ve heard each other and decreases the potential for misunderstanding.
> 
> Since the _Difficult Conversations_ authors prioritize making people feel as safe as possible, they would likely warn against _demanding_ that your participants paraphrase. Making demands could decrease their willingness to be vulnerable (because you’re not open to their ideas), lead to less compliance with the rule (because they didn’t create it), and even encourage participants to ignore each other (because you’re setting an example that bad behavior is OK).

### How to Close the Gathering

Eventually, your gathering will have to end—and treating this ending with the respect it deserves will cement the experience in your guests’ minds. In this section, we’ll first explain why deliberately closing your gathering matters. Then, we’ll share Parker’s advice on closing the gathering in a way that honors the rest of your work.

Parker explains that **deliberately closing your gathering is essential** because it provides your guests with a transition. As Parker notes, endings are inherently sad, so many people deliberately avoid officially closing their gathering. For example, the party host lets the guests trickle out rather than signaling that they should go home.

(Shortform note: Cultural differences in how hosts close their gatherings may convince a guest that a host _hasn’t_ deliberately closed their gathering when in fact they have. For example, in the Midwestern United States, a “welp” from the host signals that the gathering is now over—but someone not familiar with Midwestern English wouldn’t interpret that as an official close.)

However, Parker argues that _not_ deliberately closing your gathering does your guests a disservice. If you’ve hosted well, you’ve created a transformative experience—and, just as you helped your guests transition from their regular lives to the experience of your gathering at its beginning, it’s _also_ your duty to help them accept the end of this experience and transition back into their normal lives.

(Shortform note: No matter how well you close your gathering, your guests may still struggle to transition back to their normal lives. For example, the K-pop band BTS has an elaborate and deliberate close to their concerts that takes up nearly a third of the concert. But BTS fans still often experience sadness and separation anxiety post-concert, despite being eased back into their normal lives.)

So _how_ do you help them transition? The first step, according to Parker, is to **signal the end** to your guests. Figure out a way to let them know that things are drawing to a close and so they should behave accordingly. If you’re not sure _when_ to signal this (like if you’re hosting a party with no set endpoint), do it when you feel that the gathering has fulfilled its reason but is still somewhat lively; if you wait too long, your gathering will lose momentum and end on a less memorable note.

(Shortform note: Even if your gathering hasn’t yet fulfilled its reason, you may be forced to signal the end to your guests due to external circumstances—such as the closing of your gathering venue. If so, you may wish to _continue_ the gathering in a separate place. For best results, consider whether you should have some type of afterparty _before_ the end draws near—keeping in mind both the venue and the guest list. For example, if you’re having a wedding, you should consider planning for an afterparty if your guests are on the younger side and likely to want to keep the party going after your reception venue closes.)

Second, **handle organizational matters** —such as by telling guests where to return their ID badges. Just as you don’t want to _open_ with organizational matters, you also don’t want to _end_ your guests’ experience with them. If you need to thank someone, do this now.

Third, **bring the community together.** Do something that allows your guests to remember both what they did at the gathering and how they connected with each other. For example, BTS’s members give short speeches near the end of each concert discussing their experience of that night.

(Shortform note: Other experts give some practical tips for handling organizational matters and bringing the community together in a workplace meeting—although they don’t specify the order in which you should do them. At the end of your meeting, clarify _who_ is going to take _what_ action steps. If someone’s contribution was particularly important during the meeting, acknowledge their efforts. Finally, review what you’ve learned in the meeting: This reinforces both the importance of meetings and your company culture of professional development.)

Fourth, **prepare your guests for the final transition.** This act should allow guests to understand how to relate to other guests they see _outside_ of the gathering and how this gathering will inform their actions in their daily lives. The right party favor can communicate this idea; for example, a bumper sticker reading “hope” might remind people daily to hope more in their lives.

(Shortform note: Many large conferences provide gifts to their attendees not to continue the message of the gathering but for other reasons; they may wish to provide branded swag to increase brand awareness or to advertise to new customers. In that case, a well-thought-out (branded) party favor—like a high-end water bottle—will likely have a bigger impact than cheaper swag (like a plastic pen). Alternatively, consider donating on behalf of your conference participants. One company found that when people were asked to choose between swag and a donation to a cause of their choosing, 40-60% of people chose the latter option.)

Finally, **give them a physical or metaphorical exit** to signal the final moments of the gathering. Whether you lead them outside a doorway or tell them it’s the end, the very last moment of your gathering matters. It should communicate to your guests that the gathering has come to a conclusion, let you celebrate what happened, and allow them to return to the outside world.

(Shortform note: Although Parker assumes that the gathering ends when people leave, other experts suggest that you should follow through _after_ the official conclusion of the gathering by sending a thank-you email. Doing so keeps you in your recipients’ thoughts, improves your reputation, and potentially can build excitement for your next event.)
