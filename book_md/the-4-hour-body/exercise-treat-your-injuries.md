## Exercise: Treat Your Injuries

There are several options for treating injuries.

* * *

Whatâ€™s one of your slow-healing or persistent injuries? What treatments have you tried for it so far, if anything?

Which treatment outlined in the previous chapter do you think would be the most effective next step, and why?

How will you pursue this treatment? (For example, you might buy some flat shoes or research ART practitioners in your region.)
