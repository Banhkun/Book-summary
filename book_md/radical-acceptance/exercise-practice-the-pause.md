## Exercise: Practice the Pause

While you’re pursuing some goal-oriented activity like working, cleaning, or eating, try taking a moment to pause. Stop what you’re doing, close your eyes, and take a few deep, slow breaths. Try to be aware of what you’re experiencing without any thoughts of what you’re going to do about it.

* * *

What physical sensations are you aware of during this pause? Are you tense, nervous, or restless?

What thoughts are you experiencing? Are you still thinking about your task, is there something else occupying your thoughts, or is your mind truly still?

What emotions are you experiencing? Do you feel like you’re being pulled back to your task? What’s it like to simply sit with your experience, rather than trying to do something about it?
