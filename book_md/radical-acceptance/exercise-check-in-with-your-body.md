## Exercise: Check In With Your Body

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Starting with the top of your head, do a slow and thorough examination of your entire body. Don’t look with your eyes; instead, simply allow your consciousness to inhabit each part of your body fully and consider what it’s telling you, without trying to judge or change any part of it.

* * *

What in particular stood out to you as you did your check in?

What do you think those sensations might be trying to tell you?
