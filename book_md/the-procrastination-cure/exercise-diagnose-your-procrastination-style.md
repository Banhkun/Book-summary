## Exercise: Diagnose Your Procrastination Style

Zahariades recommends you identify which situations and circumstances lead you to procrastinate and reflect on the mental and emotional factors that might be driving that behavior.

* * *

Write down one of the root causes of procrastination that resonates most with you: fear of failure; fear of success; perfectionism; negative self-talk; issues around motivation, rewards, or consequences.

Considering this root cause, what steps can you take to address the issue? For instance, if you procrastinate when you get bored, what games or reward system can you create for yourself? If you get overwhelmed, how will you break down large tasks into smaller steps? If your main issue is perfectionism, how will you change your mindset?

What are your top two distraction activities when youâ€™re procrastinating (such as TV, social media, shopping, etc)? In as much detail as possible, what have you noticed about where, when, and how you tend to start doing these activities? For example, is it a certain time of day, in a certain location, or is it attached to another activity?

What specific changes could you make to your environment or routine that would make it more difficult for each of these activities to distract you?

What is one way you can involve another person in holding you accountable as you strive to break your procrastination habit? For instance, you might ask a friend to be your accountability buddy, start a writing group, or hire a personal trainer.
