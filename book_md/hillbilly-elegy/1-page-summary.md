## 1-Page Summary

_Hillbilly Elegy_ sets out to explore the struggles of the rural white working class in 21st-century America through the personal story of its author, JD Vance. Part autobiography, part sociological text, and part political manifesto, **the book tells a story of dysfunctional families; substance abuse; the material, spiritual, and moral decline of Appalachia; and the struggles to achieve true economic and social mobility in the United States**. Ultimately, JD overcomes the odds and achieves a life of success and respectability outside of the hillbilly culture from which he came—but at a heavy personal cost, and with many struggles along the way.

### A Troubled Home Life

JD was born in 1987 in Middletown, Ohio, to a family of transplanted Kentucky hillbillies. **His mother, Bev, would struggle with substance abuse issues for most of his childhood** and adolescence, inflicting severe emotional trauma on him and his older sister, Lindsay. On one occasion, she pulled over the car while she was driving him and threatened to severely beat him—until he escaped to a nearby house and had her arrested. On another occasion, her drug addiction spiraled so far out of control that she forced her teenage son to provide a clean urine sample so she could pass a drug test.

**She also cycled through five marriages during this period of JD’s life** , sometimes with men she’d only known for a few weeks. The instability was a major source of pain for him as he was growing up—he never had a true father figure and had a conflicted-at-best relationship with his biological dad. Bev would often force him to move in with her new men, taking him to new towns away from his friends and family, only for these people to be suddenly and unceremoniously removed from his life with their relationship with Bev ended.

### Saved By His Grandparents

JD’s maternal grandparents—Mamaw and Papaw, as he called them—saved JD from falling into the same dysfunctional pattern of life as his mother and so many other people in his community.**They taught him that he was capable of anything if he worked hard enough and to never buy into the idea that the deck was stacked against him** just because of the circumstances into which he’d been born.

JD recalls his Papaw staying up late with him to help him master advanced math concepts. Later in life, when he permanently moved out of his mother’s house as a teenager, his Mamaw (then a widow) **provided him the safety, security, stability, and unconditional love that had been so sorely lacking from his biological parents**. She made sure he did his homework, kept his room clean, and gave him the structure and the drive for success that would ultimately spur him on to bigger and better things. In one memorable story, his Mamaw saved up and purchased him an expensive, state-of-the-art graphing calculator, just so he could succeed in his advanced placement math class.

This personal investment in his future showed JD that there were people who loved him and would be willing to help him realize his potential. As JD himself puts it, **his grandparents were “the best thing that ever happened to him.”**

### Achieving Upward Mobility

JD enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating from high school. Enduring **the emotional and physical toll of basic training taught him the virtues of self-reliance** and showed him that he was capable of achieving far more than he had given himself credit for. He discovered that **he had spent his whole life underestimating himself** —thanks to his tumultuous upbringing in which he felt unloved and unwanted, and the hillbilly culture, which encouraged a deep pessimism and fatalism about one’s prospects in life.

After being discharged, JD went on to Ohio State and then to Yale Law School, where he discovered just how different his hillbilly upbringing had been from those of the upper-middle-class and wealthy people he was now surrounded with. At Yale, **JD discovered the value of social capital—the networks of relationships that enable individuals to function and succeed**. Having social capital meant access to people, institutions, and opportunities. JD realized how sorely lacking he’d been in this vital asset for all his life. But through determination, he learned how to hold his own in the elite circles of which he was now a part and built a life outside of the rough-and-tumble Appalachian world from which he’d come.

### Key Themes

Beyond just being the story of JD Vance’s life, **_Hillbilly Elegy_ is a broader social commentary and a critique of hillbilly culture.** Vance argues that hillbilly culture, as lived and practiced in post-industrial towns across Appalachia like where he grew up, has come to celebrate self-destructive and antisocial behavior. He contends that this behavior and a certain set of attitudes are severe **hindrances that prevent white working class people from acknowledging the problems in their families and their communities** and make it difficult for people to succeed _outside_ of that culture.

#### Aversion to Work

Growing up, JD saw that many people in his community viewed work with disdain and struggled to hold down a steady job. His community was plagued by **high levels of unemployment, indebtedness, welfare dependency, and poor work habits**. JD recalls one young man with whom he worked at a summer job. The man would consistently take hour-long bathroom breaks, call out sick at least once a week, and was chronically late. Eventually, he was fired. Yet when this happened, the man blamed his _employer_ for the situation, claiming he’d been treated unfairly—there was **no sense of personal responsibility** , no willingness to account for how his own actions had led him to this point.

#### Blame-Shifting

JD makes the case that **hillbilly culture has become resentful and insular, all too willing to blame the rest of the world for its problems** instead of taking an introspective look at itself. Rather than taking responsibility, JD saw that many of his drug-addicted and impoverished friends and neighbors chose to blame the government (and often President Barack Obama specifically). One friend quit his job because he refused to wake up late, then took to social media to bemoan the sluggishness of the “Obama economy” for his unemployment.

In examining his own political affiliations later in life, JD saw that movement conservatism— while ideologically and rhetorically rooted in the ethic of personal responsibility—too often just provided its adherents with targets to blame, instead of solutions for self-improvement. Popular religion reinforced the same themes. JD saw how fundamentalist Protestantism, for example, gave people no concrete answers for life’s most pressing issues. It instead gave them a convenient list of bogeymen to fear and oppose—usually LGBT people, liberal college professors, the federal government, abortionists, and feminists. **As long as you had disdain for the “right” people, you were a good person.**

#### Culture of Honor

Too many in JD’s community, particularly males, lived by **an outmoded “code of honor” that demanded violent retribution be meted out to anyone who offered the slightest insult** or sign of disrespect. Growing up, he heard stories about how close relatives had beaten and shot people in the course of disputes. This was _celebrated_ as a noble cultural characteristic, and JD became an ardent practitioner. When a boy broke up with his sister, he saw it as his duty to violently attack the young man. When someone insulted his grandmother on the schoolyard, his sense of family loyalty and honor compelled him to start a fight. Looking back, JD now sees this behavior as self-destructive:**the rest of the world does not resolve mild disputes or disagreements through violence**. Growing up in this world stops young people from knowing how to resolve conflicts in a healthy way and renders them unable to function outside of it.

#### Poor Education

Today, as an Ivy League-educated white collar professional, JD is able to look back soberly at just how much of an exception he is: **how little emphasis his** **community and his culture placed on education**. A college education was a distant and remote pipe-dream, certainly not something parents prepared their children for or treated as an expected life experience. No one JD knew had gone to a four-year college; and 20 percent of the town’s high school freshman cohort wouldn’t go on to graduate in four years. With hindsight, JD attributes this poor record of educational attainment to **a culture of low expectations**. Children saw poverty, high unemployment, and drug addiction all around them growing up, often in their own immediate families. With such poor models of adult behavior, they never came to expect much from themselves.

#### Pessimism

Throughout his childhood and teenage years, JD saw how **his community was infected by a gloomy pessimism and fatalism that encouraged people to abandon any hope** that their material condition could ever improve. This attitude only encouraged indifference and apathy, as well as poor work ethic: if things will never get better, there’s no point in working hard to try to improve your lot in life. Indeed, surveys show that **working-class whites are the most pessimistic demographic group in America today**. This speaks to a deep spiritual and cultural decline in the community.

#### Economic Mobility, Social Stagnation

When he went to Ohio State and then to Yale Law School, JD learned to be a keen observer of how successful people thought and behaved versus how people in _his_ community looked at the world. Having now lived in both worlds, he saw that **true mobility in America was defined by more than wealth:_social_ mobility mattered more than _economic_ mobility**. Even during periods where his family was earning good money and living in relative material comfort, they maintained all the same destructive social attitudes and dysfunctional modes of conflict resolution that were the inheritance of their hillbilly culture. From high divorce rates to domestic discord,**they never made the transition to true middle-class standards of respectability**.

#### Social Capital

Later on, in the white-collar professional world, JD discovered how much he truly had lacked in social capital—the networks of relationships that enable individuals to function and succeed. This **lack of social capital put him and his community at a severe disadvantage** and still represents a major barrier to social mobility in America.
