## Exercise: Examine Your Identity

Think about how your background and culture influences your view of the world.

* * *

Think about your familyâ€™s history. Is there anything in it that you believe has shaped your worldview and values?

Have you ever been in a place where you felt that your views and patterns of behavior were different from those around you? In a few sentences, describe the situation and how it made you feel.
