## Part Two: A Childhood of Dysfunction

JD’s mother had once been a promising student and seemed on track to rise up from the poverty and abuse that had surrounded her as a child. Unfortunately, she fell into the same cycle of dysfunctional that she had learned from her parents. She married her high school boyfriend and quickly **found her life beset by the drama, fighting, and violence that had so defined her parents’ marriage.**

At nineteen, she gave birth to a child (JD’s older sister Lindsay), filed for divorce, and began life anew as a single mom. After remarrying in 1983, she gave birth to JD in 1984, in Middletown.

### The War At Home

JD’s father was a man named Don Bowman, his mother’s second husband. JD remembers little from his early childhood before the age of six, but he does recall one particularly vivid memory from this period.

One day, his mother picked him up from kindergarten and **told him, quite matter-of-factly, that he would never see his biological father again.** Bev’s explanation was that his father “didn’t want him anymore” and wanted instead to give him up for adoption. This would be the first in**a long series of father-figures who would come and go from JD’s life** , a product of his mother’s inability to form stable relationships and her extreme willingness to jump into living arrangements with men she barely knew—a pattern of tumult and instability that would become a constant source of pain and anxiety for JD and Lindsay.

### Marital Discord

JD was legally adopted by his mother’s next romantic partner, a man named Bob Hamel. While he treated the children kindly, Bob embodied so much of the hillbilly culture that Mamaw and Papaw had desperately wanted their children and grandchildren to steer clear of.

Bob had children from a previous marriage (with whom he had a minimal relationship), suffered from poor dental hygiene, lacked even a high school education, and made his living driving a truck. Looking back on Bob, JD describes him as “a walking hillbilly stereotype.”

JD had an **early childhood exposure to his mother’s pattern of unstable and unhappy relationships with men**. JD was forced to witness frequent screaming matches between his mother and adopted father; physical violence between the couple (with the one stipulation being that Bob couldn’t hit first); and brutal verbal abuse.

There was also a reckless financial profligacy and **a total lack of regard for saving and thrift** , behavior that JD would come to see as a consistent feature of hillbilly culture. This was despite the fact that the household income exceeded $100,000: hardly a small sum in rural Ohio. Bev and Bob racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt, spending lavishly on items that they didn’t need, like new cars, new trucks and even a swimming pool. The deteriorating financial situation hastened the demise of this fragile marriage. Bob and Bev separated and another father figure in JD’s life (his _legal_ father in this case) was gone.

Needless to say, all of this began to take a toll on JD. His grades at school declined and he began to put on weight, while suffering from severe stomach aches. He also had trouble sleeping, out of fear of being awoken by the stomping, yelling, and smashing of furniture that had defined so much of his young life up to this point.

#### Normalizing Dysfunction

As an adult, JD doesn’t point to the domestic abuse _itself_ as the most harrowing aspect of living with his mother and Bob. Instead, it was the _uncertainty_ that was the most unnerving. He could never be sure what might trigger a knock-down, drag-out brawl. Even **seemingly innocuous events—a wrong word here, a mild childhood transgression there—could provoke a plate being smashed or a door being kicked in.**

As JD sadly reminisces, however, his domestic situation was hardly exceptional. These behaviors were quite normal and widespread in his community. After a while, seeing families hurl barbed insults at one another and engage in acts of physical violence ceased to be shocking: it was simply a part of life for JD, his sister, and their friends. **He came to believe that this was just the way that adults treated one another.**

### Social Vs. Economic Mobility

What Bev’s marriage to Bob embodied, to Mamaw and Papaw’s dismay, was a lack of generational progress. While Mamaw and Papaw themselves lacked formal education and had experienced teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and domestic violence, **they always expected that the _next_ generation would do better.**

This was core to their belief in the American Dream: that those who worked hard could achieve anything. Mamaw and Papaw, for all their flaws, worked tirelessly to give their children and grandchildren access to opportunities that they themselves never had. Mamaw always encouraged self-reliance: she cautioned JD to **never be like the “fucking losers” who thought that their fate was beyond their control**.

Bev’s marriage to a hillbilly stereotype like Bob showed Mamaw and Papaw that on some level, they had failed their daughter and grandchildren. What this illustrates is the **distinction between economic mobility and social mobility**. The Vance clan had certainly achieved the former: they were earning money well above and beyond what they could have in Kentucky. Even Bob made a comfortable living driving a truck.

But this newfound (relative) wealth never translated into true social mobility. Bev carried forward all the destructive social attitudes and dysfunctional modes of conflict resolution that she had learned from her childhood and that her parents had brought with them from _their_ hillbilly culture in Kentucky. They may have been living a life of comparative _material_ comfort, but **the family was still saddled with the same harmful social values and norms.**

### Hillbilly Justice

This is illustrated quite vividly by **JD’s early education in the concept of “hillbilly justice.”** During visits with his grandparents back to Jackson, Kentucky (where they still maintained close ties of kin and community), JD would be regaled with stories of the legendary and lawless exploits of his extended family and the world they came from.

  * One uncle had assaulted a truck driver with an electric saw because the driver had called him a “son of a bitch.” The man nearly bled to death.
  * A man in Jackson who had been accused of sexually assaulting a young girl was once found face-down in a lake, shot to death with sixteen bullets in his back. 
  * Even Mamaw herself had, at the age of 12, shot an attempted cattle rustler in the leg.



These **tales of violent vigilante justice were presented to JD as _positive_ examples of his community’s values. **Mamaw and the family were proud of these stories and believed they reflected the very best of their culture. As an adult, JD now sees how truly impressionable he was: his young mind internalized these values and **he came to see violence as a legitimate and even honorable means of resolving disputes.** This message would be reinforced by the people around him throughout his childhood and adolescence.

#### Learning to Brawl

This social context encouraged—in fact, _demanded_ —that a young man like JD enforce and uphold hillbilly justice himself. **Loyalty to family, upholding one’s honor, and demonstrating toughness were the core values of this “justice” system.**

Accordingly, casual insults to one’s family (especially its female members) demanded a violent response: when a schoolyard bully directed some slander at JD’s grandmother, JD earned a bloody nose defending his family’s honor on the schoolyard.

The social expectation was that young men should resort to violence to avenge _any_ insult towards the family, whether the insult was intended or not. When his older sister Lindsay was dumped by her boyfriend, custom demanded that JD brawl with her ex to maintain the family’s dignity. Even though he proceeded to lose the fight (badly), he was _rewarded_ for his display of violence by Mamaw, who told him that he had done the correct and honorable thing.

Later, Mamaw would teach JD fighting tactics designed to inflict maximum damage on his opponents. While she encouraged him to only fight to defend himself, she generally approved of the use of violence to solve disputes, telling JD, **“Sometimes, honey, you have to fight, even when you’re not defending yourself**. Sometimes it’s just the right thing to do.”

### A Community In Decline

This tumultuous period in young JD’s life occurred against the backdrop of the **broader social, moral, and spiritual decay of the hillbilly culture** that had defined his family’s experience.

When JD was born in 1984, Middletown was still a respectable, prosperous industrial town. It had a vibrant shopping center downtown, long-established businesses that had been going strong since World War II, and most importantly, a major employer in the Armco steel mill.

Over the course of JD’s upbringing, the town changed dramatically for the worse. The once-bustling downtown became blighted by abandoned shops and pockmarked by broken windows; respectable family businesses were replaced by cash-for-gold stores and pawn shops; and Main Street degenerated into a haunt for drug addicts and dealers.

In a potent symbol of the town’s rise and fall, an opulent Victorian mansion that was once home to the wealthiest family in the county was purchased for a mere $225,000: less than what a one- or two-bedroom apartment would cost In Washington, D.C. or Manhattan. Where the once-prominent mansions weren’t been sold for pennies on the dollar, they became chopped up into small apartments by absentee landlords.

What transformed this blue-collar, seemingly prosperous community into a bleak post-industrial wasteland?

#### The Death of American Manufacturing

Towns like JD’s all over Appalachia are**struggling with a new economic order.** The Armco steel mill that had drawn countless Appalachian migrants like Mamaw and Papaw to the town was suffering from the same manufacturing decline that plagued Rust Belt towns all across the country.

In an era of globalization, where cheap inputs and labor could now be sourced from all over the world, **domestic manufacturing concerns were at a heavy disadvantage.** Companies could now easily offshore jobs to low-wage countries, leaving American blue-collar workers high and dry.

The only way they _could_ survive was through mergers and the downsizing of their workforces. Armco merged with Kawasaki in 1989 and began drastically reducing its investment in Middletown.

Seemingly overnight, this pillar of the regional economy had become a shadow of its former self. **Armco hadn’t just been an employer: it was the lifeblood of the community** , funding parks, libraries, schools, and other public facilities through tax revenue and private contributions.

Moreover, the company and its products were an immense source of pride for Middletonians. JD recalls his grandparents boasting about how Armco steel was used in countless products and used to build some of the most iconic structures across the United States. The decline of the firm didn’t just signal an economic downturn in the town’s fortunes: it was **a _cultural_ and _spiritual_ downward spiral that left the community reeling**.

#### Residential Segregation

Middletown was a mainly (though by no means exclusively) white, blue-collar town. As the manufacturing jobs left, however, the remaining **residents became crowded into suburban ghettos.**

The numbers tell the story: in 1970, 25 percent of white children lived in poor neighborhoods. By 2000, that figure was 40 percent, and growing rapidly. In popular imagination, this kind of poverty and economic segregation is associated with racial minorities in inner-city communities. But**by 2011, residents of poor neighborhoods were more likely to be _white_.**

As Vance observes, bad neighborhoods are no longer an exclusively urban problem. Increasingly, many of America’s suburbs and rural areas have become marked by unemployment, poverty, high foreclosure rates, welfare dependency, crime, high divorce rates, and drug and alcohol addiction.

#### Deemphasizing Education

Looking back, JD sees how little his **community and culture emphasized education**.

Growing up in Middletown, a college education was a distant and remote pipe-dream, certainly not something parents prepared their children for or treated as an expected life experience.

What JD _now_ knows is that all across other regions of the country, parents _were_ setting their children up to attend college and start white-collar careers. Tutors, SAT prep courses, guidance counselors, and all the other tools of the college-acceptance game were simply unknown to the children of his community. **They weren’t _losing_ this competition—they just weren’t playing the game at all. _No one_** that JD knew at this time, for example, had gone to a four-year college.

Once again, the statistics paint a damning picture: 20 percent of the town’s high school freshman cohort won’t graduate in four years. Of those that _do_ graduate, most won’t go on to college, and those that manage to make it to college almost certainly won’t go out-of-state.

As an adult, JD attributes this poor record of educational attainment to **a culture of low expectations**. Children see poverty, high unemployment, and drug addiction all around them growing up, often in their own immediate families. They have poor models of adult behavior, so they don’t come to expect much from themselves. He certainly saw this in his own life: even when he got poor grades, **there was never any sense that there would be negative consequences for failing to achieve academically**.

#### “Hard Working” Welfare Cheats

Beyond the raw economic misfortunes of the town, JD began to notice that **hard work and initiative were almost entirely absent** in many of the adults around him. Despite this, people made a point of playing lip-service to these ideals, even when they seldom lived up to them in practice.

He recalls one woman who was always hounding Mamaw, either to borrow her car or sell her food stamps to Mamaw for cash. Despite this woman’s lifestyle of welfare dependency, her eagerness to defraud the social safety net, and the fact that she’d never worked a day in her life, she viewed herself as a model of industriousness. Indeed, **she saw herself as a _worthy_ recipient of government help, while it was those “other” lazy moochers who were gaming the system** and making it hard for decent, honest people to get by.

There was simply an absence of work and **an acceptance of unemployment or underemployment as a way of life.** 30 percent of young men in Middletown work under 20 hours per week.

#### Cognitive Dissonance

JD now sees the lies and blame-shifting as ways of coping with massive cognitive dissonance: **the gap between the community’s _professed_ values and the _actual_ lived reality of their lives.** There _must_ be some oppressive, outside force at work if so many self-described hardworking and industrious people are mired in poverty and social dysfunction. Believing in a nefarious conspiracy that’s keeping you down is far more comforting than confronting the true scale of the devastation in your life. There’s massive power in delusion.

#### Destructive Values

The **deindustrialization of Appalachia has led to a serious lack of opportunity** for people entering their prime working years. People can’t work when there are no jobs to be had: the Armcos of the world aren’t going to provide employment for all the young men to support a family the way they could have a generation ago.

But based on his own experiences, JD now believes that today’s hillbillies have responded to the economic crisis in their communities the wrong way: by **building a set of values that justifies and even celebrates the avoidance of work,** while blaming nefarious outside forces for their problems.
