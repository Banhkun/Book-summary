## Part Three: Growing Up

These larger social, cultural, and economic trends were dramatically illustrated by the **increasingly chaotic and disturbing events of JD’s personal life**. When JD was eleven, his mother had to be hospitalized following a suicide attempt.

This was one of his first exposures to just how deeply damaged his mother was—and how much her struggles would come to define his formative years. Ultimately, through the love and guidance of his grandparents (especially Mamaw), JD would eventually come out on the other side of these traumatic experiences a better and stronger person. But his history with his mother still haunts him and he realizes that not everyone in those circumstances is as lucky to have two tough-as-nails hillbillies as his grandparents in their corner.

### Mom’s Situation Accelerates

Although her marriage with Bob was loveless and marked by verbal and physical abuse, its deterioration clearly took a powerful emotional toll on her already-fragile and unstable psyche.

**Bev began to turn to drugs and alcohol** , and started having numerous affairs with strange men who would suddenly appear and then disappear from JD’s life. As a result, JD and his sister grew having no idea of how a man ought to treat his family and without any true father figure at all.

Things came to a head when **she tried to kill herself by crashing her car into a telephone pole**. When she was released from the hospital, things only deteriorated further. The kids got a full view of the extent of their mother’s dysfunction, as she would stay out all night with new friends that JD and Lindsay had never met before. She would also subject them to **extreme emotional outbursts and episodes of physical violence**.

Things lingered in this state for a few months, until an event took place between JD and his mother that forever altered their relationship and showed JD just how toxic his mother had become.

#### A Watershed Moment

After one of his mother’s characteristic outbursts, she decided to make it up to her son by taking him out to buy some football cards. During the ride to the mall, JD said something to her (he doesn’t recall now what exactly it was that he said) that set off his mom’s trigger-hair temper.

She reacted with a level of fury and violence that even JD, for all he’d seen, could hardly fathom. She accelerated the car and threatened to kill the both of them, then **pulled the vehicle over and attempted to savagely beat her son.**

JD managed to escape the car and run to a nearby house, where the woman at home called the police. Before the police arrived, Bev had managed to kick down the woman’s door and drag JD, who was screaming for help, onto the front lawn. Bev was ultimately arrested, violently resisting as the cops put her in the squad car.

In the aftermath, JD’s mother would retain nominal custody of the children, but with the tacit agreement that JD could live with Mamaw whenever he wished.

### Class Differences

As an adult, JD notes his mother’s trial as his first exposure to America’s class differences.

Even as a child, he observed that the **social workers, judges, and lawyers all spoke in what he dubbed a “TV accent.”** This was the neutral, flat, non-regional accent in which national news anchors speak. It was a jarring contrast from the Appalachian twang that so many of JD’s family and friends spoke with.

Looking back, he sees this as an inflection point: the beginning of his understanding that **there was a big difference between the people who wrote and enforced the laws, and those who were subjected to them** —and he and his community were firmly in the latter camp.

Another shock to the system happened when JD visited his Uncle Jimmy in California. This wasn’t his first time travelling away from home. JD had visited relatives in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas, but all of those trips bore something in common: they were all journeys to places that were firmly entrenched in hillbilly culture. The family he saw there lived the same way people did in Middletown: eating the same foods, practicing the same religion, and sharing the same outlook on life—with all the good and bad that that outlook entailed.

But California was different, filled with people who came from different backgrounds and didn’t carry the same baggage of hillbilly culture. JD visited wineries, met LGBT people in San Francisco’s Castro district, and had other experiences that he couldn’t have had in a place like Middletown. It showed him that **there was a wider world outside of the culture from which he’d come.**

### Reconnecting with Dad

California was a brief interlude at this time in JD’s life, and perhaps a glimpse of what might be in his future. But for now, he was back the hillbilly world, where he reconnected with an unlikely figure—Don Bowman, his biological father.

In the time since Don had separated from Bev, **he had remarried and become a born-again Christian.** JD was struck by the relative serenity of Don’s house during the summer he spent there. There was no violence, no verbal abuse, and certainly no drugs or alcohol. Even the corporal punishment that Don doled out to the children from his second marriage was businesslike and perfunctory—a far cry from the rage-inflected beatings that were so familiar to JD.

Don credited his newfound peace with his embrace of faith. The social science appears to bear this out: studies show **churchgoing people generally are more content than secular people.** They also tend to commit fewer crimes, have higher incomes, and better educational outcomes.

With the contrast between his father’s home life and his mother’s as his only source of evidence, JD was quick to credit the difference to active religious commitment.

Perhaps surprisingly, given the stereotypes about the region, JD’s upbringing had little in the way of organized religion. While his hillbilly family was certainly of conservative Protestant stock, they weren’t frequent attendees at church. Appalachia, in fact, has lower church attendance than vast swathes of the Midwest and the Mountain West.

#### Closing of the Mind

At the very least, his father’s brand of **evangelical Protestantism offered JD the structure and order that had clearly been lacking in his life**. It also offered tangible assistance for struggling members of the economically-ravaged community in the form of shelter, charity, job training programs, and drug-treatment services.

During this period, JD committed himself to evangelicalism, seeing the clear positive benefits that he believed it had brought to his dad’s life. He notes that he also took on all of the ideological baggage of the movement.

  * He came to view the Big Bang Theory and evolution with mistrust.
  * He started to see LGBT people as figures to fear and loathe.
  * He absorbed wholesale the propaganda about the “War on Christmas” and bought into myths about Christians being a persecuted minority in America.
  * He got outraged by all of the social ills that evangelicals do (homosexuality, abortion, “deviant” art, and sexuality in pop culture).



For all of the new structure, however, JD also began to see the downside. He saw that **the evangelical movement was closing his mind to new experiences.** He couldn’t listen to the music he liked, for example, because it allegedly had satanic, anti-Christian messages.

#### Faith Without Good Works

With hindsight, JD now sees this brand of fire-and-brimstone Christianity as a contributing factor in the social decay of hillbilly communities. He recalls that **evangelicalism had little to say about how one ought to lead a good, productive life in the real world**. There wasn’t much talk about what sort of _character_ traits an individual ought to have.

Instead, he reflects, it was all about negativity.**If you hated the gays, abortionists, liberal college professors, and feminists, then you were a good person**. Looking back, what strikes him most of all is how _easy_ it was to be an evangelical: it required so little of him.

This, he professes, provides an easy escape hatch for people in Middletown and communities like it. It was ok if you were unemployed, drug-addicted, and abusive to your family—as long as you prayed the right way and had the right enemies, you were blameless. **The faith demanded no effort at self-improvement.**
