## Conclusion

So what's to take away from JD’s story? Clearly, his example shows that **bright, motivated people can still achieve upward mobility in America** , even if they come from circumstances of material and cultural poverty.

Growing up, JD witnessed painful traumas:

  * The drug addictions of his mother.
  * An unstable home life defined by the absence of a permanent father figure and his mother’s parade of romantic partners. This uprooted his sense of belonging and left him in a position of never knowing where he was going to live or who he would be with.
  * Episodes of shocking verbal and physical abuse, the most traumatic being when his mother literally threatened to murder him while they were driving.



But he also had the love and support of his maternal grandparents, who shielded him from as much of the chaos as they could, and exemplified the best of hillbilly culture. They were fiercely loyal and committed to family and **refused to let JD sink into apathy or defeatism.** They always told him that hard work mattered more than the circumstances of his birth.

In the end, the good outweighed the bad—through Mamaw and Papaw’s guidance, JD made something of himself.

  * He learned self-reliance and discipline during his stint in the U.S. Marine Corps.
  * He took those skills to Ohio State University, where he excelled academically.
  * He then matriculated at Yale Law, where he learned how to make use of social capital and forge the critical connections that would fuel his personal and professional success.



With the benefit of hindsight, JD now sees that he came from **a culture where hard work, personal responsibility, and thrift were devalued** —no matter how much lip service might have been paid to these ideals. He argues that his hillbilly past has been replicated millions of times over by other children of the white working class.

Hillbillies must wake up, reform the parts of their culture that lead to self-destructive behavior and make them unable to succeed in broader society, and **start taking responsibility for the state of their communities and their families.**

In JD’s interpretation, public policy may help around the margins, but fundamentally, this is _not_ a crisis the government can solve. There is no tax incentive that can be created to fight spiritual poverty; bureaucrats can’t devise a program to force family members to treat one another with respect. The problems arose from the deep roots of hillbilly culture; they will only be solved by people _within_ that culture.
