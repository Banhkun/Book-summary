## Exercise: Studying Social Capital

Explore the struggles and opportunities of upward mobility.

* * *

Think about JD’s experiences with discovering social capital. How have connections and relationships in your life opened doors to you that would have otherwise been closed?

How do you think society can help knock down the barriers to upward mobility? Specifically, what are the ways in which we can transfer social capital to those who currently lack it?

Why do you think so many people in JD’s community were drawn to conspiracy theories? More broadly, what do you think is the attraction that these ideas have for so many people?
