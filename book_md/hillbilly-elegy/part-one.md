## Part One: A Hillbilly History

> **Shortform note:** As the title of the book would suggest, the term “hillbilly” is used frequently. Broadly speaking, it refers to poorer white people of Scots-Irish origins living in Appalachia, a large region east of the Mississippi River that spans the Appalachian Mountains, running from Georgia and Alabama in the south to New York in the north.
> 
> “Hillbilly” is often a slur, particularly when used by people from _outside_ the culture. Vance, however, makes it clear that he considers the label to be a badge of honor that he wears proudly. We’ve followed his lead on this for the purposes of this summary and do not shy away from using the term to describe the culture and the people.

To fully tell his story, JD has to begin by telling his family’s story. Mamaw and Papaw were raised in Jackson, Kentucky, which they left in the 1940s when Papaw found work in the Armco steelworks in Middletown, Ohio.

Right from the outset, however, **his family history was tinged with the loss, despair, and social dysfunction that would come to define so much of his own experience.** Mamaw and Papaw left Jackson after Mamaw became pregnant as a teenager and gave birth to an infant who tragically passed away just a few days later. This tragedy, along with the burgeoning economic opportunities in southwest Ohio, compelled the young couple to uproot themselves and make their way out of Kentucky.

### The Hillbilly Highway

Mamaw and Papaw were hardly alone in leaving the largely rural and undeveloped economy of that part of Kentucky during this time. Indeed, they were part of a**mass exodus of young Appalachian families seeking opportunities in the fast-growing and rapidly industrializing Midwest.**

Companies like Armco, where Papaw found employment, actively recruited workers from the eastern Kentucky coal country where Vance’s family had its roots. These companies often encouraged and paid for men to bring their whole families with them, effectively transplanting entire communities.

The wave of migration was so common that stretches of U.S. Route 23 and Interstate 75 became colloquially known as the “Hillbilly Highway.” The numbers of people on the move were immense: by the 1950s, 13 percent of Kentucky residents had left the state.

#### Culture Clash

As with any wave of migration, the hillbilly migrants brought their own culture and set of traditions to their new homes in the industrialized Midwest. Appalachian transplants established their own communities in these industrial towns and cities, often to the alarm of the more established middle class Ohioans.

The migrants from Kentucky seemed to be people from an entirely different world. For the more _bourgeois_ Midwesterners, **the hillbillies were alien and destructive to community values:**

They had too many children; they brought their extended families into their homes for visits that lasted too long, upsetting the peace, quiet, and normalcy of the community; and they were coarse, profane, and prone to violence.

#### The Toy Store Brawl

In one illustrative example, Vance recounts a story that subsequently became family legend. His grandparents were in a department store in Middletown with their son when the boy started to play with one of the toys on display.

When the clerk asked the boy to put the toy down and leave the store, Papaw and Mamaw went berserk: smashing the merchandise and physically threatening the clerk, saying “If you say another word to my son, I will break your fucking neck.”

This display of **violent anger and utter disregard for social norms was shocking to the Ohioans who witnessed the scene, but it was a matter of basic pride for Vance’s family.** The parents were merely defending his son against a stranger who had slighted the family’s honor by telling him where he could and couldn’t go. This was just what _any_ self-respecting hillbilly would do when an outsider messed with their child.

> **Shortform note:** This scene of violence and anger in response to a relatively mild slight may have its roots in what historians and sociologists have called the “Southern culture of honor.” It’s characterized by an extreme unwillingness to tolerate personal insults of any kind and a high propensity, particularly on the part of males, to defend one’s reputation with violence.
> 
> Honor cultures are common in places where the rule of law and the control of centralized authorities have been historically weak: like the remote parts of the British Isles from which the hillbillies’ Scots-Irish ancestors came. These values were easily transplanted to the remote, rugged world of Appalachia. In turn, the hillbillies brought these values with them when they migrated to other regions of the United States.

#### “You Can’t Take Kentucky Out Of The Boy”

Interestingly, Vance observes that the Ohioans seemed to view the transplanted hillbilly community as being almost _racially_ different, despite the migrants being just as white as their neighbors.

To the Ohioans, **the hillbillies shared many behavioral and cultural characteristics with the black migrants who came up from the South** to settle in Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and other industrial Midwestern cities during the great black migrations of the postwar era.

This experience shows that culture is not stationary: your values and upbringing will follow you wherever you go. This was certainly true for the transplanted Kentuckians: they didn’t leave their way of life behind when they left their native communities, they simply brought them to a new location.

Mamaw summed it up pithily by saying, **“you can take the boy out of Kentucky, but you can’t take Kentucky out of the boy.”**

### Planting Roots

Despite the clash of cultures, the hostility, and the discrimination the hillbillies faced, their migration story was initially a largely successful one. Within two generations, the hillbillies had achieved a high degree of economic integration: their **income levels and poverty levels were now on par with those of the native Midwestern population**.

Mamaw and Papaw were no exception. They had three children: Jimmy, Bev (Vance’s mother), and Lori. They lived in a comfortable suburban home and were **ardent believers in the worthiness and efficacy of hard work**. They instilled in their children (and later, their grandchildren) the uselessness of thinking that the deck was stacked against you because of where you came from.

They were strong believers in the American Dream and believed that **hard work and ingenuity could take you anywhere you wanted to go** : a far cry from the blame-shifting and despair that JD would later come to see as such a defining trait of hillbilly culture.

To all outward appearances then, the story of Vance’s grandparents was a happy one. Papaw made a living in Ohio that would have been unthinkable in Kentucky; the children were enrolled in good public schools; and the family lived in a four-bedroom home with modern plumbing. Their situation was certainly prosperous by the standards of the world Mamaw and Papaw had come from.

On the surface, it looked as though the family had truly achieved the American Dream. Unfortunately, however, **a dark undercurrent of dysfunction infused the family.** It wouldn’t be long before the painful and destructive aspects of hillbilly culture would come back to haunt Mamaw and Papaw—and their children.

### A History of Violence

As JD would learn from the recounted stories of his aunt, uncle, and mother, **Papaw was an alcoholic** , and the family soon became victims of his frightening, drunken outbursts.

Vance recalls hearing about how his mother and aunt would know if they father was coming home drunk or sober based on how he parked his car: if he parked it normally, they knew that there would be a relatively peaceful night at home. But if he parked it erratically or hit a telephone pole as he was pulling in, they knew he was inebriated. _This_ would be their signal to run home to warn their mother about the state their father was in and to flee to neighbors’ house for safety.

Papaw inflicted severe trauma on the family while he was drinking. One Christmas Eve, he threw the family Christmas tree out the door (in full view of the children) when Mamaw failed to produce the freshly cooked dinner he demanded.

Mamaw, though not a drinker herself, was willing to give as good as she got when she retaliated against her husband. One one occasion, she cut his pants with scissors while he was passed out drunk. Other times, she would hide his wallet in the oven. During one fight which Vance’s Uncle Jimmy describes as being _particularly_ violent, Mamaw hurled a glass vase at her husband’s face, splitting his forehead wide open.

In perhaps the most shocking display of all, Mamaw saw her husband came home drunk, where he proceeded to pass out on the couch. Infuriated, she poured gasoline over him and lit him on fire. It was only through the efforts of their eleven year-old daughter that he survived.

Eventually, before JD was born, Mamaw and Papaw separated and he moved out of the house. Despite this, they never formally divorced, and would remain entwined in one another’s lives through the shared ties to their children and grandchildren.

### The Statistics Catch Up

Despite this war at home, **two of the family’s three children managed to escape the cycle of dysfunction and abuse** and go on to lead successful productive lives. Uncle Jimmy went to night school and found a sales job with Johnson & Johnson in California, getting out of Appalachia altogether and starting a true professional career (rather than just a wage-earning job).

Aunt Lori (or Aunt Wee, as Vance calls her) managed to recover from an abusive first marriage at the age of sixteen, later establishing a career in radiology and finding a stable, loving partner in her second husband.

Unfortunately, **most children who grow up in abusive homes emerge with emotional scars.** Jimmy and Lori beat the odds—JD’s mother Bev didn’t. Looking back, JD would wryly observe that the statistics on abuse caught up with Mamaw and Papaw’s middle child.

Bev’s subsequent struggles with unstable marriages, substance abuse, and mental illness would come to wreak havoc on her own two children’s lives and leave a permanent stamp on JD’s worldview.
