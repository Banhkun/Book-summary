## Part Four: The Teenage Years

When JD was 13, his grandfather passed away at his home. This was obviously a major event for everyone in his family.

Papaw was a man from another time and place who sometimes embodied the very worst aspects of hillbilly culture: **he could be patriarchal, willing to resort to violence to resolve disputes, and clearly had a drinking problem** that inflicted real trauma on his wife and children.

But he also managed to rise above the circumstances into which he’d been born and had provided a level of material comfort for his family that would have been unthinkable if he’d stayed in the hillbilly heartland where’d come from.

Most importantly, **Papaw believed in the value and efficacy of hard work** and tried his hardest to instill these ideals in his children and grandchildren. Papaw wouldn’t have denied that the family was poor or disadvantaged, but he would never rely on that as an excuse. To him, **work mattered more than luck**.

One of JD’s most powerful memories was of his Papaw staying up late to help him with math homework, so that JD was eventually able to master increasingly complex math problems. In doing this, Papaw taught JD that there was a difference between lack of intelligence and lack of knowledge. He showed JD that he could improve his knowledge through effort and a desire to learn. His effect on JD’s life was profound: at the funeral, JD tearfully described his grandfather as **the closest thing to a true father** **he had**.

### Mom Spirals (Again)

For JD’s mom, the loss of her father inflicted a terrible blow on her already-fragile mental state. She quickly spiraled into a deep depression.

Her notorious temper also began to flare up again. Mild “provocations” like unwashed dishes would prompt outbursts in which she would scream at her teenage children, “I’ve lost him and you’re not making this any easier!” She was simply unable to accept anyone _else’s_ grief over the loss of Papaw.

Soon, Bev’s behavior began to take a turn for the worse. She was arrested during a domestic squabble with Mamaw that (once again) spiraled out of control. She also started abusing prescription drugs—to which she had easy access as a nurse—around this time, stealing from her patients to feed her addiction. Ultimately, she was fired for rollerblading through the emergency room. Evidently, her substance abuse had altered her mental state to the point where this seemed like a normal and appropriate thing to do.

She was transformed into a person **completely unable and unwilling to conform to the basic norms and standards of adult behavior**. Eventually, she had to go to rehab in Cincinnati, where JD and his sister Lindsay would visit her on weekends. These visits showed JD the true horrors of American addiction, but they also gave him key insights into _why_ his mom was the way she was. For example, she revealed to him that **she had turned to drugs to escape her financial stress and to cope with the loss of her father**.

The family therapy sessions at the treatment center also brought to light resentments and wounds that had been long-simmering between Bev and her children. One weekend, Lindsay confronted her mother about how much she hated watching her little brother (JD) get attached to one of Bev’s boyfriends, only for the boyfriend to suddenly disappear from JD’s life.

#### A “Disease?”

JD also became acquainted with the idea of addiction as a disease during this time. According to this theory, being an addict was a disease that simply afflicted certain unfortunate people. Just as you couldn’t judge a cancer patient for having cancer, you couldn’t judge a drug addict for their behavior: they were sick.

**At the time, JD found this concept absurd and was opposed to its broader implication—that his mom wasn’t responsible for her actions** and that it would be _wrong_ to hold her accountable. As an adult, JD now _does_ acknowledge that there is a biological and genetic basis for addiction. But the disease concept of dependency still strikes him as not quite right: to him, the idea only reinforces the worst tendencies of hillbilly culture and provides an excuse, and even justification, for antisocial behavior.

### JD Faces a Test

Once Bev was discharged, **her pattern of erratic and unstable relationships quickly resurfaced**. She took up with a constant parade of new men, and JD was forced to change homes frequently. What was most painful was the instability and tumult: he was always surrounded by strangers, always in a new place, and cut off from everyone he knew and loved.

Thankfully, he was able to remain in school in Middletown and was able to visit Mamaw and his sister and her husband whenever he wanted. This provided him some measure of stability. But his mother’s romantic life was increasingly chaotic, even by her standards. JD and Bev ended up **moving in with a man she’d gone on a date with just a week before!**

The instability of this latest situation exerted a heavy toll on JD. He nearly flunked out during his freshman year of high school and was struggling to even maintain a 2.0 GPA. He was also starting to experiment with marijuana and alcohol, taking the first steps down the same path that his mother had.

During this time, Bev’s substance abuse got worse, and her emotional toll on the rest of the family was about to come to a head. One day, **she demanded that JD give her a jar of his clean urine so she could pass a drug test.** This floored JD. He saw how completely entitled she was, expecting that he would just help her cheat on a drug test, like it was some basic responsibility he owed her. She was also utterly remorseless at having broken her promise to remain sober.

JD even told Mamaw to her face that _she_ was responsible for Bev’s amoral behavior, arguing that if she’d put her foot down decades ago, Bev wouldn’t be at the low point of asking for her son’s urine. Ultimately, Mamaw convinced JD to relent and give his mother what she needed to pass her drug test.

But this was truly a last straw for both JD and Mamaw. JD could never go back to living with her after what she’d pulled. He moved in with Mamaw, where he would remain until he moved out after high school.

### Life With Mamaw

While the instability and trauma of living with his mother and her men were a thing of the past, life with Mamaw wasn’t exactly easy. She was a tough old hillbilly who didn’t suffer fools gladly and wouldn’t accept anything less than the best from JD. **She made sure he did his homework, kept his room neat, and took out the garbage** —and, in characteristic fashion, called him a “lazy piece of shit” when he didn’t.

She was still a still a powerful force for good in his life. He saw **her grit, determination, and strength, as well as her compassion and warmth.** She was incredibly nurturing and loving with the children in her extended family—JD’s little cousins, nieces, and nephews. He saw that being around children always brought out the best in Mamaw. JD describes Mamaw as the best thing that ever happened in his life, the person who truly saved him.

Soon enough, the stable environment and Mamaw’s no-nonsense style of parenting began to pay real dividends. When JD was in his junior year of high school, he was accepted into the honors math program. **Education remained deeply important to Mamaw** , as it had been to Papaw.

Despite the family’s poverty, and her own relative lack of schooling, she made sure JD had an expensive graphing calculator so he could excel in algebra and trigonometry. To Mamaw, this was far more important than JD having a cell phone or trendy clothes. This also deepened JD’s commitment to academics, because he saw firsthand the major investment that Mamaw had made in his education.

### “An Amateur Sociologist”

During this time, JD also got a job at a local grocery store. From this vantage point, he got a firsthand look at many of the social ills that he would later identify as **key sources of the problems plaguing his community**.

He noticed that poorer customers tended to pile their carts with unhealthy prepackaged, canned, or frozen foods. The more affluent customers, meanwhile, bought more fresh meat and produce. More importantly, he saw how financially irresponsible so many of his neighbors were. Many of them were dependent on government assistance, but they were adept at gaming the system.

For example, they would use their food stamps to buy soda, and then sell them at a discount for cash. It was all profit, since they weren’t paying for the soda in the first place—the government was. Even as a teenager, he could astutely observe that **people living off cash assistance programs were living at a level of material comfort that he couldn’t even dream of**.

He saw destitute people still throwing their money away on luxury items like iPhones and big screen TVs, usually financed through high-interest credit cards and payday loans. Nobody seemed to save for a rainy day:**as soon as you got some money, you squandered it on something frivolous.**

There were other examples of self-destructive behavior in the community, outside of the customers at the grocery store.

  * There was the neighbor who got high on pain meds, passed out in the bathtub with the water running, and destroyed the bottom floor of her home through water damage.
  * Then there was the neighborhood “welfare queen” with seven children, one of whom ended up in an abusive relationship, and another one who was arrested shortly after finishing high school. Vance notes the kids never really had a chance.



Sadly, stories like this were all too common.

### The Trouble With the Welfare State

He really felt the injustice when he began seeing the taxes that were being deducted from his wages: **taxes that were being used to pay for the very same welfare programs that his customers were using to cheat and avoid working.** Vance marks this as the beginning of his shift to Republican Party-stye conservatism and general ideological opposition to the modern welfare state.

He’d been raised in a household and culture that had at least nominal loyalty to the Democratic Party (traditionally the party of working people). But these experiences were beginning to teach him that **well-meaning assistance programs created too many disincentives to hard work** and reinforced what he saw as the worst features of hillbilly culture.

JD argues that this disillusionment with the policy excesses of the New Deal and Great Society is what turned working-class whites in Appalachia and the South away from the Democratic Party, beginning in the 1970s. He believes that this, _not_ religious/cultural conservatism or backlash to the Civil Rights Movement, is what reshuffled the partisan landscape of American politics.

> **Shortform note:** The debate about how this phenomenon occurred is highly controversial and is a major topic of research among political scientists. A counterpoint to Vance’s theory lies in the fact that, starting with Barry Goldwater’s 1964 campaign and Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign for president, GOP operatives openly embraced what they called the “Southern Strategy.” This was an effort to peel southern whites away from the Democrats by stoking racial resentments over gains made by African-Americans during the Civil Rights Era.
> 
> Characteristically, the strategy was rooted in appealing to white resentment without _overt_ racist language—”dog whistling,” so that Republican politicians could _claim_ that their policies were race-neutral, while still delivering coded racial appeals to their intended audience. Under this electoral strategy, therefore, abstract-sounding policy positions like opposition to welfare, taxes, busing, food stamps, and being “tough on crime” were intended to be read as implicit attacks on African-Americans.

Today, **JD views the problems with his community as being ones rooted in culture, values, and family**. Hillbilly culture, in his view, had bad values regarding work and family that were inhibiting its progress and contributing to its spiritual and material decline.These weren’t problems that government programs could solve. Sure, throwing some money around might help alleviate some of the material poverty around the margins, but the crisis ran far deeper than that.

The defeatism, indolence, and dysfunctional families that JD saw were**deep-rooted cultural problems that lay beyond the ability of government to address**. For him, there wasn’t an easy public policy solution to these issues—and any attempts by the government to address them tended to make the situation worse (like the welfare cheats he saw at his job).
