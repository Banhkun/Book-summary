## Exercise: Identify an Area for Improvement in a Past Sale

Think about a time in the past when you failed to make a sale to a customer, and consider how Jones’s key phrases could have helped you succeed in that situation.

* * *

Write down at what point the customer rejected your product or service. Was it right at the beginning, when you tried to approach them? Was it after you gave them some additional information, and they said they needed to think about it?

Now, based on when the conversation went awry in the situation you described above, write down which of Jones’s key phrases were applicable at that point. (For example, if the customer was undecided, you could use the phrase “How would you feel if…” or “The good news is…”)

Use one or more of the key phrases above to write a statement or question you could have used in that conversation to either persuade the customer to say yes or to get a downsell.

How do you think using the statement or question above might have changed the outcome?
