## Exercise: Think Bigger

Learn how to think bigger about yourself.

* * *

Write down your five best “assets.” Pick things that your trusted friends and colleagues would agree with.

Then, for each asset, list one to three successful people you know who don’t have this asset to as high a degree as you.

What does this mean about your abilities? Your potential for success? How do you feel now?

Let’s stop sweating the small stuff. What is something small you’re currently obsessing over that really doesn’t contribute to your goals? What should you use that time for instead?
