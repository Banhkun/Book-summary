## Exercise: Create Your Own Pep Talk

Create your own commercial to market yourself to you.

* * *

What are your greatest assets? What sets you apart from other people? List up to five.

Now write yourself a commercial using these assets. Pretend you were paid money to get the most people possible to admire this person. Donâ€™t be afraid of feeling corny.

Now say the commercial out loud. Really mean it. Now, how do you feel about yourself?
