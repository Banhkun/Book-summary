## Chapter 7: Make Sure Your Environment Is “First Class”

We’ve all heard the old expression, “you are what you eat.” This means that our well-being is tied directly to the food we use to fuel our bodies.

The author proposes that your mind is also a product of what it is fed, and what feeds your mind is your _environment_. The people you surround yourself with, the clothes you wear, the neighborhood you live in, and the food you eat all shape you into the person you are.

Most importantly, the size of your thinking, your attitude, and your goals all are the products of your environment, particularly the people around you. If you are surrounded by petty, negative people, you will likely pick up the habits of negative, petty thinking. If you are surrounded by positive, ambitious people, you will begin to reflect those traits, as well.

**Your environment changes how you think. Improve your environment to improve how you think.**

There are three aspects of your environment to change: your internal environment, your social environment, and your physical environment.

### Recondition Yourself for Success

The biggest obstacle to success is thinking you’re just not cut out for any major accomplishment. “Big things are just not in the cards for me.” Too many adults are conditioned toward this sense of mediocrity.

Children don’t dream of someday getting by in a dead-end job. Kids set high goals and fully expect to do exciting, important things. But as they grow up and gain responsibilities, these free-thinking children often become short-sighted adults. They’ve likely been bombarded with the advice of others to “quit dreaming,” and “be practical.” They’re told they’ll never get ahead because they don’t have the luck/money/connections/character traits.

Some people surrender completely to this input. They settle for a job they don’t love and rationalize themselves into a rut from which there’s little chance of escaping.

Others surrender partially at first, holding out hope that someday big things will happen. As time goes by, however, this group loses their fight and decides that greater success isn’t worth the effort.

The third group never surrenders to the “you’ll never accomplish anything big” line of thinking. What’s different about this group? **Big thinkers refuse to listen to suppressive talk and advice and instead think about success and drive toward success.** They simply don’t listen to anyone who says their goals can’t be accomplished. They’ve developed a defense against the negative opinions of other people, **seeing negativity only as an opportunity to prove the naysayers wrong**.

Even if you’re not in the third group now, you can get there. You are fully capable of reconditioning yourself for success. (Much of this book is about doing this). It takes a shift in attitude and a deep-seated belief in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals. You have to condition yourself to ignore the poisonous opinions of others, which can be aided by _managing your social environment_ , which we’ll discuss next.

### Manage Your Social Environment

There are several aspects to managing your social environment and creating positive surroundings that will nurture success:

  1. Stay away from “negators.” 
  2. Stay away from people who gossip and backstab.
  3. Seek advice only from “first-class” people.
  4. Get some “psychological sunshine.” 



#### Stay Away from “Negators”

“Negators” are the negative people around you who keep telling you it can’t be done. They laugh at other people who try to get ahead, and they tear down people who make them feel small.

Negators come in many forms. Sometimes these are well-meaning individuals who have been beaten down by life and have good intentions; other times they’re jealous people stuck in a rut who want to trip you and keep you down with them. Sometimes they’re subordinates or colleagues; sometimes they’re supervisors who want to give you their misleading rules to success.

**Stay away from all negators.** They drag down your thinking, and they introduce seeds of doubt that fuel Mr. Defeat (recall him from Chapter 1).

A few examples of getting away from negators:

  * The author had a college friend who was very smart, but who was convinced the only paths to success included marrying someone rich or knowing the “right” person and getting in on a “good deal.” The author realized that listening to this friend was like “listening to the voice of failure.” He stopped absorbing the negativity and instead began studying the friend objectively, from a distance. 
  * An employee carpooled to work everyday with an incessant complainer, who was bitter about every aspect of the job. The employee found herself arriving at work each day in a negative, depressed state. She realized what was happening and switched carpools, changing her morning environment to be surrounded by positive, uplifting people who liked their jobs and were optimistic about their futures. She instantly felt an improvement in her mood.



#### Stay Away From Gossip

Gossip, or negative discussion about people, is like food poisoning. If a restaurant causes just a few cases of food poisoning, word will get out, and people will stay well away.

Similarly, gossip is “thought poisoning.” It wastes your time on petty, negative things about other people. It misrepresents people with misleading hearsay. It makes you feel guilt when you see the person you’re gossiping about. Gossip makes you a small thinker.

Gossip is done by both males and females and can be disguised as productive talk. “He only got the promotion because of politics.” “I found out something juicy about the new manager.” “Don’t tell anybody, but…”

Even worse, if you gossip, successful, positive people will start viewing _you_ as “poison.” Gossip gives off an unlikable and unreliable air that will repel the very people you want to attract on your journey to success.

An analogy: Taking an axe to your neighbor’s furniture doesn’t make _your_ furniture any nicer. So chopping down your neighbor with the verbal axe of gossip doesn’t make you look any better — it only destroys your character. On the other hand, speaking about others with positivity presents a first-class view of you as a quality, positive individual.

Don’t be around people who gossip. They’re small thinkers who will infect you with poison. And when you do talk about people, keep it positive.

#### Seek Advice Only From First-Class People

Be very careful about where you’re getting your advice. Getting “first-class” advice means seeking the counsel of a knowledgeable and positive source, not someone ready to spew reasons why something can’t be done.

Say you’re starting a new job and someone who’s been there a long time takes you under his wing. His advice: lay low, or you’ll get bombarded with work and you’ll have to stay late. Clearly, if you want to be noticed and succeed in this company, this is terrible advice and this is someone you’d want to get away from fast.

Instead, seek the advice of someone who is already successful in your area of interest. Don’t be intimidated. Successful people tend to be open and eager to help others on their path.

  * Get advice about the new company from a successful executive who is enthusiastic and energetic. 



Get advice for your upcoming triathlon from someone who has successfully completed a similar race, not someone on the couch telling you it’s impossible.

#### Get Some Psychological Sunshine

**“Psychological sunshine” describes positive experiences that nurture your mind. Like fertilizing a crop, positive experiences expand your creativity and improve your emotional happiness.**

**You have control over designing your experiences as positive or negative. Let’s take a typical weekend.** Does it include boredom, mindlessly using the Internet, or a hangover? Or does it include a home-improvement project, quality time with your kids, a hike with your spouse? The first experience is a poor mental diet, the equivalent of junk food. The second experience is a rich mental diet, building things of value.

A few suggestions to pepper your life with psychological sunshine:

  * **Find new social groups.** Hanging out with only the same handful of people keeps your world closed. Meeting and spending time with new people broadens your overall understanding of people.
  * Seek out friends with different viewpoints than yours. Understanding people of different cultural backgrounds, religious faiths, and political views helps you become someone who can see both sides of a situation.
  * Find friends who are above petty, unimportant concerns. If your friends are obsessed about the size of their house and the types of cars they drive, it’s easy for you to sink into valuing these types of things. Find friends who embody your highest ideals and are genuinely rooting for your success.



### Managing Your Physical Environment (Going First Class)

Finally, to create an _overall_ “first class” environment, manage your _physical_ environment. In Chapter 6, we discussed how “looking important” and taking care of your appearance was a critical element in “thinking big.” The idea of going first class with your physical environment takes it further to include going first class in _every_ aspect of your environment, not just your clothing and appearance.

To go first-class, spend well. Buy high-quality things that make you feel good about yourself. This includes food, clothing, services, hobbies. If money is an issue, then buy fewer, higher quality things, rather than a mass of low-quality items.

For the sake of saving, we often take shortcuts. We eat at the cheap restaurant or buy the off-brand clothing. We hire an inexpensive accountant or take our car to a mechanic that promises a bargain. But these cost-saving measures can be penny-wise, pound-foolish. The dubious accountant might land us in an IRS audit, while the shady mechanic might damage the car, risking safety and costing more in the long run.

In fact, taking the quality, first-class route often doesn’t cost much more than the cheap route in the long term. In return, you get quality goods and services that make you feel better about yourself, while improving the way you are seen by others.
