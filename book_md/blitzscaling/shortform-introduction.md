## Shortform Introduction

### Be Aware of the Viewpoints of Venture Capitalists

Reid Hoffman spends part of his time as a venture capitalist. Much as with Peter Thiel’s _Zero to One_ , be aware of the incentives venture capitalists have to push the “take huge risks, move fast at all costs” narrative, and how these incentives might conflict with yours as a founder:

  * VCs need outsized returns on a few companies to make up most of the returns of their entire portfolio. They’d prefer for each company to go for broke than to be conservative - for a VC, it’s ok for 9 companies to fail if 1 is a blockbuster. In contrast, you only have your one company, and another company’s success is little condolence when yours fails.
  * VCs need to deploy large amounts of capital if they raise large funds (e.g. if they raise a $1B fund, they can’t write $1MM checks). For you, raising more capital may not be worth the dilution and liquidation preferences if you can’t effectively deploy the capital.
  * VCs raise funds with a limited lifetime (usually 10 years with extensions) and need to get liquidity for their equity in your company during that time (sell stock, IPO, acquisition). They therefore want to push for fast growth and exit sooner. If you prefer a longer time horizon or want to stay private forever, your interests may conflict.



In many cases, VC performs a valuable function when the stars align. In a superb case like Facebook, everyone’s incentives were aligned - the business actually needs capital to grow in a winner-take-all market, the strategy thesis is correct, the business effectively deploys capital, and the company explodes in value.

In the most punishing case, your market doesn’t have huge returns of scale or winner-take-all dynamics, you raised too much capital to burn on strategies that don’t return, and liquidation preferences for investors sap your returns on exit. In an alternate universe, you might have built a more sustainable, meaningfully successful company and pocketed more returns.

### This Book Focuses on Operations

Finally, like most startup/management advice, _Blitzscaling_ focuses more on _operational_ best practices, which are repeatable and teachable. It doesn’t teach as much on _how to generate the core idea_ of the business - the best it gets is describing commonalities of previously successful strategies.

This isn’t the authors’ fault: vetting good ideas that will work is a hard problem, and even professional investors have a low batting average. Plus, many valuable ideas are contrarian and thus by definition unteachable; the more “obviously good” ideas will have been competed away.

To set your expectations for what the book _does_ cover, _Blitzscaling_ answers these questions: “What attributes are common to winner-take-all markets, and to strategies that benefit from blitzscaling? When should you blitzscale? And, mostly, _how_ do you blitzscale?”
