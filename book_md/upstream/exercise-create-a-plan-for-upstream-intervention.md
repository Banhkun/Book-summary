## Exercise: Create a Plan for Upstream Intervention

Once you identify a problem that you want to take responsibility for, Heath’s advice for upstream intervention includes three key components: gathering a team of people who are invested in solving the problem, making small changes with a large potential impact, and using data to experiment with different interventions. In this exercise, we’ll walk through each of these steps to help you implement an upstream change in your life.

Write down an ongoing problem in your life that you’d like to take responsibility for. It could be a challenge in your personal life, a problem in your business, or a community-level problem like a lack of places in your neighborhood to buy healthy food. How does the problem impact you in the short term and the long term?

Next, brainstorm the root causes of the problem by writing down a few upstream contributing factors. How does each of these upstream factors play a role in the long-term outcome or problem?

Now that you’ve considered some potential root causes, identify different people who might also want to solve the problem through upstream action. For each of these people, what unique skills or perspectives could they offer in the problem-solving process?

Make an action plan to begin addressing some of the root causes you identified, focusing on small changes that will have a big impact. Write down your first step and the timeframe for doing it. Then, write down a few metrics that will help you measure your success and explain how each of the metrics aligns with your goal.
