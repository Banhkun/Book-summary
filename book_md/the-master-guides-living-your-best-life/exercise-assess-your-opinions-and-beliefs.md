## Exercise: Assess Your Opinions and Beliefs

An important part of clarifying what you want out of life is assessing whether your current opinions and beliefs align with who you _really_ are.

* * *

Write down one opinion or belief you have about yourself. For example, you might believe that you’re not talented enough to succeed in your career.

When was the first time you came across this belief? For example, you may remember receiving negative feedback in school and feeling inadequate.

How does this belief influence your judgment of yourself, other people, and your experiences? For example, this belief may cause you to doubt your abilities and compare yourself to others, discouraging you from pursuing your career goals.

How might adopting an _opposing_ belief impact you? For example, if you choose to believe in your potential and embrace growth, you’ll boost your self-confidence—which would encourage you to take on challenges and seek out opportunities.

How would you choose to think about or reframe this belief if your thoughts were already aligned with _who you really are_? For example, if your aligned self recognizes that success is a result of dedication and continuous improvement, you might reframe your belief as, “I don’t feel _prepared_ enough _yet_.” This new belief can encourage you to focus on developing your skills and embracing learning opportunities, which will help you move toward excelling in your career.
