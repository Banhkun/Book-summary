## 1-Page Summary

You may have heard of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs, usually presented as a pyramid, in which he lays out the basic needs people must meet in order to reach their full potential. In _Transcend_ , psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman argues that Maslow’s ideas about this “pyramid” of needs are largely misunderstood, and he provides an updated view of Maslow’s hierarchy that’s more in line with modern science as well as Maslow’s full body of work and the teachings of other humanistic psychologists. Kaufman’s updated hierarchy of needs is split into two categories (security needs and growth needs), and he argues that we must meet both to self-actualize (realize our full potential).

Although reaching self-actualization is important, Kaufman maintains that humans can also reach beyond our needs for security and growth. In other words, **we can _transcend_ our selfish needs—simultaneously fulfilling them while reaching toward a higher purpose beyond ourselves**. Reaching this transcendent state of existence, though, takes work. To do so, you must first meet your needs in a healthy and sustainable way.

In this guide, we’ll first explore the tenets of humanistic psychology and go over the basics of Maslow’s work. We’ll then describe Kaufman’s updated hierarchy of needs with a focus on discovering your unmet needs, meeting those needs, and realizing your full potential. Finally, we’ll go over what it means to _transcend_ your needs and live a more fulfilling and connected life. Throughout the guide, we’ll provide a better understanding of Kaufman’s ideas by looking at the works of other humanistic psychologists, examining critiques of humanistic psychology, and presenting research from the fields of psychology, sociology, and neuroscience.

### The Tenets of Humanistic Psychology

According to Kaufman, the ideas of humanistic psychology arose around the 1930s largely in response to the two most common fields of psychology of that time: behaviorism and Freudian psychoanalysis. According to both those theories, people are inherently selfish beings driven by basic motives like power and lust, and in order to be good we must thwart these selfish desires.

Humanistic psychology, on the other hand, is focused on the positive aspects of humanity and human consciousness. It’s based on the idea that **humans are capable of free will, self-awareness, and compassion**. Though we are sometimes driven by things like power and lust, we’re capable of much more than just following our selfish desires. Through conscious decisions, not mindless behavior, we’re able to be creative, to love, to think rationally, and to want more out of life than just surviving and reproducing. Because of this, humanistic psychologists like Kaufman and Maslow argue that the main focus of psychology should not be about thwarting selfish desires, but tapping our unlimited potential as conscious beings.

(Shortform note: Though humanistic psychology arose out of the perceived limitations of other psychological fields, it has its limitations as well. For one, critics argue that humanistic psychology relies too heavily on the study of the subjective experience of individuals—it uses too much qualitative research, which is difficult to accurately measure. Also, it ignores some of the arguably valid concepts of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. For example, its focus on the importance of human consciousness tends to leave out the fact that human behavior, at least to some extent, is driven by _unconscious_ motives and desires—we’re not always fully aware of our motives or why we behave a certain way.)

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs

Considered one of the founders of humanistic psychology, **Abraham Maslow argued that humans are inherently good, and it’s only when our needs aren’t met that we behave in ways that are considered “bad.”** If our most basic needs are met, then we’ll treat ourselves and others with dignity, respect, and kindness, and we can focus on striving to be the best person we can be.

It’s from this idea that Maslow developed his hierarchy of needs. At the bottom of the hierarchy are our basic needs, which include our physiological needs of food, warmth, and shelter, our social needs of community and affection, and our personal need of self-esteem. At the top of the hierarchy sits our need for self-actualization—our need to live a fulfilling life and make full use of our capabilities. He argues that we can’t reach self-actualization unless our basic needs are first met.

(Shortform note: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is based on the idea that humans are fundamentally “good,” and the philosophical debate on whether we’re inherently good or evil stretches back centuries. Some, like Aristotle, argue that we’re born neither good nor evil and that we learn morality through others. Thomas Hobbes argues that people are naturally selfish and cruel, which is why we need societal rules and norms to keep people in line. Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues the opposite, saying that we’re naturally kind and that society teaches us to be cruel and immoral. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is more in line with this interpretation.)

He also argues that **we instinctively want to reach the self-actualizing stage** : We naturally want to do more than just satisfy our basic needs. We want to become the type of person who’s constantly moving forward and growing in our skills and abilities.

(Shortform note: Beyond the traits Kaufman mentions, psychologists have identified several other common traits of self-actualizing people. Importantly, when pursuing a goal, self-actualizers are more focused on the journey rather than the destination, which Kaufman and Maslow allude to when describing them as always growing and moving forward. Self-actualizers are also likely to be grateful: They appreciate what they have and don’t take the good things for granted. They’re likely to be good at problem-solving and enjoy applying their knowledge to difficult situations. Some other traits of self-actualizers include spontaneity, independence, and valuing of privacy.)

According to Maslow, all human behavior that’s mean or cruel is really just a misguided attempt to satisfy our basic needs. Therefore, Maslow suggests that **we should focus not on ridding ourselves of our negative tendencies but on satisfying our needs**. This is what humanistic psychology focuses on: enhancing our lives through positive action rather than identifying and removing our negative tendencies and behaviors.

> **How Maslow’s Work Informed Positive Psychology**
> 
> To better understand how Maslow’s theory of human needs can be a useful tool, we can look to the recently developed field of positive psychology. As its name suggests, Positive psychology focuses on the good parts of human nature and how we can live healthier, happier lives. Positive psychology is based heavily on Maslow’s teachings; even the term positive psychology is attributed to Maslow.
> 
> Just as Maslow suggested, positive psychologists believe that simply reframing mental health as the presence of positive qualities rather than the absence of negative qualities can make psychology not only more realistic but also more useful. For example, the ideas of positive psychology are used by teachers, therapists, and employers to help motivate others and improve their well-being.

#### Maslow’s Two Categories of Needs: Deficiency and Growth

Kaufman argues that while people generally focus on the traditional, pyramid-shaped depiction of the hierarchy of needs, in his writings and speeches, Maslow highlighted a more important distinction: that all human needs can be split into two main categories: deficiency needs and growth needs.

**Deficiency needs are driven by a person’s sense that they’re lacking some basic needs** of food, safety, shelter, affection, and self-esteem. Satisfying these needs is important, but they alone won’t lead to self-actualization, and Maslow argues that most people fail to self-actualize because they spend most of their lives motivated by the need to compensate for deficiencies.

**Growth needs are motivated by a desire to progress and to be a better person** , rather than by the fear, insecurity, or short-term satisfaction that drive deficiency needs. These kinds of needs will lead to self-actualization, as they prompt you to learn, develop, and expand.

(Shortform note: While Kaufman argues that most people fail to self-actualize because they can never satisfy their basic needs, other psychologists suggest that people become complacent when their basic needs are met and never even try to grow. According to some, in the developed world, most people have their basic needs met—they don’t feel unsafe, they have friends and community, and they feel capable. But once these basic needs are met, most people mistake their longing for self-actualization as a longing for _more_ of the same basic needs—more possessions, more self-esteem, more fun. Instead of always trying to fill a void with things we don’t need or things we already have, we should focus on improving ourselves.)

### Kaufman’s New Hierarchy of Needs

Kaufman argues that modern neuroscience and psychological research support Maslow’s theories regarding deficiency and growth, and he thus bases his new hierarchy on these two categories of needs. Instead of deficiency needs, however, Kaufman uses the term _security needs_ , noting that all deficiency needs are a form of insecurity, whether it be a lack of physical, emotional, social, or mental security.

In the coming sections, we’ll explore both security needs and growth needs.

### Security Needs

According to Kaufman, there are three major security needs: the need to feel safe, the need to connect to others, and the need for self-esteem.

#### The Need to Feel Safe

Kaufman claims that the most critical aspect of security is the need to feel safe, as it’s the foundation upon which all other needs are built. Satisfying this foundational need is vital for growth because if at any point this foundation is lost, your thoughts and behaviors will be dominated by the need to regain it. Kaufman breaks the need to feel safe into two categories: physical safety and emotional safety.

##### Physical Safety

The needs of physical safety include the physiological needs of food, warmth, shelter, and protection from harm. In modern society, this also includes financial security, as a stable income helps provide for all the other physical safety needs.

According to Kaufman, **the need for physical safety is tied to our need to understand and control our environment to achieve our goals**. When we feel uncertain about our ability to do this, fears and anxieties arise, which get in the way of developing as a person—if you’re worried about how you’re going to put food on the table, you won’t have the time or energy to think about much else. It’s impossible, however, to understand everything around you and to be fully in control of your environment, so on top of maintaining a secure, stable life, you should also learn how to manage and respond to uncertainty.

(Shortform note: To regain control and reduce uncertainty in our lives and thus maintain the feeling of physical safety, psychologists recommend two things: implement structure in your life and be more empathetic. Structure can help manage uncertainty by giving us a sense of control over the things we _can_ control. For example, when faced with uncertainty during the Covid-19 pandemic, the structure provided by mask ordinances and distance guidelines helped people navigate their daily lives. Empathy, on the other hand, helps people adapt to uncertainty when structure may not be enough. For example, if the changes brought on by the pandemic seemed overwhelming, giving and receiving empathy might have helped quell people’s anxieties.)

##### Emotional Safety

**To achieve emotional safety, we need to feel safe with the people around us** , and Kaufman argues that this begins with the development of a secure attachment style early in life. When you have a secure attachment style, you feel you have the trust, love, and support of the people closest to you, and you’ll have the confidence and energy to focus on other things, like exploring your environment or making new friends.

Kaufman points to research that shows that **a secure attachment style sets you up for success and growth later in life**. Studies show that those with a secure attachment style are better at regulating their thoughts and emotions and dealing with stress, are more satisfied in their relationships, and show heightened senses of empathy and tolerance.

When you’re an infant, you develop a secure attachment to your caregiver when you can rely on them to respond to your needs. As you grow older and develop more relationships, your emotional attachment style is also influenced by other attachment figures like romantic partners, close friends, siblings, or other family members. If you feel the people close to you have been sensitive to your wants and needs throughout your life, you’re likely to be a more trusting person and feel you’re worthy of love and support.

If you don’t feel as though friends or family members are sensitive to your wants and needs, you may develop an anxious or dismissive attachment style, which can hinder your ability to develop and maintain relationships. An anxious attachment style comes from a fear of abandonment and leads to a constant need for attention and reassurance. A dismissive attachment style also comes from fear of abandonment or rejection, but instead of being needy or reliant on those close to them, a dismissive person will avoid closeness or intimacy altogether.

> **How to Develop a Secure Attachment Style**
> 
> Kaufman acknowledges that your attachment style stems from childhood experiences and often extends into adulthood, but that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with one particular attachment style for life.
> 
> The first thing to do if you wish to develop a secure attachment style is to recognize your current attachment style and how it’s affecting your relationships. Take a long look at yourself and determine how you feel about yourself and how worthy you think you are of love. Then, examine your current relationships and the people closest to you. People tend to attract others with similar attachment styles, so if you notice most of your friends seem to have an anxious attachment style, there’s a good chance you do too.
> 
> Once you’ve determined your attachment style, here are some things you can do to make it more secure:
> 
>   * **Work on yourself, not just your relationships**. If you become more comfortable in your own skin, your relationships will benefit as well.
> 
>   * **Rid yourself of toxic relationships**. Sometimes a friend or loved one just isn’t good for you and you need to move on from them.
> 
>   * **Work on expressing your emotions**. Whether you’re anxious or dismissive, learning how to recognize and share your feelings can benefit your relationships.
> 
>   * **Confront your past**. Since insecure attachment almost always comes from unhealthy relationships, you may need to confront your past to heal from traumatic or harmful events. Therapy can be especially helpful in this regard.
>

#### The Need to Connect With Others

Kaufman says that once the needs for physical and emotional safety are met, people will feel a strong desire to connect with others. Our need to connect with others differs from our need for emotional safety, as it’s more than just the need to feel safe and protected;**it’s the need to maintain close relationships as part of a larger group**.

Kaufman breaks our need to connect with others into two smaller needs: the need for community and the need for intimacy.

##### Community

Though connecting with others is more than just our need for safety, it did originate from our evolutionary need for social protection, writes Kaufman. Humans are social creatures, and close affiliations between small tribes or groups helped us gain resources and protected us from threats. The need to be part of a tribe or community was often a matter of life or death—if you were kicked out of the tribe, you probably weren’t going to survive much longer. Today, though most of us can survive without being part of a community, this psychological need remains strong.

People need to feel accepted within a group and, more importantly, to not be rejected. We’ve evolved to be highly sensitive to threats to our sense of belonging, and we’ve evolved painful emotions when we feel rejected. Most of us can easily pick up on subtle social cues when someone doesn’t like us, and we’re likely to feel emotions like jealousy or sadness as a result. If you feel lonely or ostracized, you’ll likely find this experience incredibly painful and it will be difficult to grow as a person.

> **How to Deal With Rejection**
> 
> While we dislike rejection because it threatens our social connections, rejection is inevitable, so learning how to cope with it can benefit your mental well-being. Here are some tips on how to deal with rejection in a healthy and productive way:
> 
> **Remind yourself why rejection is painful** : Because rejection is tied to our evolutionary need to be part of a tribe, remind yourself that the painful emotions don’t reflect the reality of the situation. Though rejection hurts, you’ll be just fine.
> 
> **Focus on the positives** : Like with almost any negative experience, there are lessons to be gained from rejection. Focus on what you learned and how you can grow from the situation.
> 
> **Reach out for support** : Everyone has been rejected at some point in their life. Instead of wallowing in your sorrow, reach out to friends or family to express your sadness or frustration. This can help lessen the emotional impact of rejection.

##### Intimacy

While the need for community is mostly about avoiding the rejection of a larger group, the need for intimacy is more about maintaining strong, close relationships with at least a few people. Strong connections are important to growth because they enhance many aspects of our lives and well-being. Studies have shown that those with strong connections are healthier physically and mentally, have higher self-esteem, are more hopeful, and are better able to manage stress.

(Shortform note: Many psychological studies support Kaufman’s argument on the importance of intimate relationships, providing overwhelming evidence that high-quality relationships are associated with a decreased risk of mortality. Because of this, some psychologists recommend increasing social connection as a public health priority since a lack of social connection has been shown to be as prevalent and dangerous as other health risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity.)

#### The Need for Self-Esteem

The third major security need of Kaufman’s hierarchy is the need for **self-esteem, which he defines as a sense of self-worth and confidence in your abilities**. Your self-esteem largely depends on the other security needs of safety and connection—it’s difficult to feel valuable and confident if you don’t feel safe or accepted by others.

But the feelings of safety and acceptance from others don’t necessarily lead to self-esteem—it’s possible to feel safe and connected while still feeling inadequate. It’s also possible to mistake the vital need for self-esteem for unhealthy desires of superiority, power, and social status that accompany acceptance from others. However, if you feel safe and connected to others while maintaining a high opinion of yourself, you’ll have a strong foundation on which to build and grow as a person.

(Shortform note: The term _self-esteem_ was first used in the field of psychology by William James, considered to be one of the founders of psychology as a scientific discipline. James provided a simple formula for self-esteem: **self-esteem = success/pretensions.** In other words, your self-esteem is dictated by your perceived level of success divided by your perceived potential. Thus, self-esteem, according to James, isn’t just about your successes, but how you view them. If you aren’t very successful but don’t have any pretensions about how much more successful you _could_ be, you’ll have high self-esteem. If you’re successful but feel like you could be doing much better, you’ll have low self-esteem.)

Kaufman identifies two key components of self-esteem: self-worth and proficiency.

##### Self-Worth

According to Kaufman, **self-worth is about feeling that you’re a good person who contributes value to the world**. Although self-worth is how you feel about yourself, Kaufman points to research that shows that how you feel about yourself is strongly correlated with how others see you: Because we’re a social species, our perception of self-value is largely determined by the perception of our value within a community. Despite this, Kaufman claims that you should try to base your self-worth on your own judgments as much as possible. The more you internalize your sense of self-worth, the less you’ll be affected by the opinion of others.

(Shortform note: In _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_ , Nathaniel Branden agrees with Kaufman’s notion that self-esteem is heavily influenced by others. Branden argues that your culture in particular can have a massive impact on your feeling of self-worth. For example, in patriarchal societies, women have lower self-worth because society constantly reminds them of their inferiority and subservience to men. Patriarchal societies can also affect men’s self-esteem, however, as men are largely judged by their ability to provide rather than their intrinsic worth.)

##### Proficiency

While your perception of self-worth is how you view your intrinsic value as a person, y**our perception of your proficiency is how you view your abilities**. In other words, do you feel like a capable person who can achieve your goals? A person’s sense of proficiency is influenced by their past experiences. If you have largely been successful in progressing toward your goals, you’ll be confident in your ability to do that in the future. If you feel you’ve often failed in the past, you’ll be insecure and doubt your abilities.

While perceptions of self-worth and proficiency tend to correlate with one another, it’s possible to have one without the other. You may feel like you're capable of achieving your goals but not have a high opinion of yourself. Alternatively, you may be pretty fond of yourself while not feeling confident in your abilities. However, both are important if you wish to have healthy self-esteem.

(Shortform note: Because feeling capable is such an important element of self-esteem, people often focus intensely on their abilities and are often overly critical of themselves as a result. Self-criticism can be a helpful tool that leads to a more accurate assessment of yourself and your abilities. But many people see self-criticism as a way to push themselves to be more successful. This can lead to a mindset in which you’re preoccupied with your failures and shortcomings, damaging your self-esteem. To avoid this mindset, make sure you balance your critical side with an appreciation of your successes.)

##### Self-Esteem and Unhealthy Behavior

Kaufman claims that **because self-esteem is so important to our psyches, many people take extreme steps to protect it**. Often, these extreme steps are forms of unhealthy behavior that seemingly help us maintain our high opinion of ourselves but that actually prevents us from growing. These unhealthy behaviors come from feelings of insecurity. To make up for their insecurities and protect their self-image, people usually behave in one of two ways: They’ll try to suppress or hide their insecurities, or they’ll overcompensate for their insecurities by inflating their ego.

People who try to hide their insecurities to protect their self-image do so because they’re uncertain about their own self-worth. To protect themselves,**they’ll hide their feelings from others and actively avoid social situations that may damage their self-image**. They’ll also be so desperate for validation from others that they get upset when they feel they aren’t getting the attention or respect they deserve.

This kind of behavior prevents growth because if someone avoids any person or situation that might be damaging, they may also inadvertently avoid people and situations that bring them joy and connectedness. Also, if someone is too focused on validation from others, their identity will be dependent on pleasing others.

> **The Dangers of Inauthenticity**
> 
> Another term for healthy self-esteem is _authentic_ self-esteem, and it may be helpful to frame it this way if you want to avoid potentially damaging behaviors. Some psychologists note that when we change our behavior for the approval of others, we damage our authentic self, which can hinder our ability to self-actualize and lead to inauthentic relationships.
> 
> To be authentic, you need to be transparent about your innermost thoughts and feelings. But most people are too worried about what others think of them and hide their true feelings and intentions. When we do this too often, it becomes hard to grow as a person because we’re constantly shifting our words and actions in accordance with other people’s values instead of our own.
> 
> Additionally, this inauthenticity can be extremely damaging to your relationships, as it can prevent you from having the difficult conversations that you sometimes need to have. If one party is inauthentic, they’ll become too subservient to the other’s needs and grow resentful and avoidant. If both parties in a relationship are inauthentic, the relationship will become stagnant, as no meaningful conversations will occur.

Alternatively, **some people protect their self-image by exaggerating their positive traits** , **which, when done to an extreme degree, is known as narcissism**. According to Kaufman, narcissists are aggressive, selfish, and impolite, and they may overreact when they feel slighted. Because they have such a high opinion of themselves combined with deep-seated insecurities, they feel the need to be liked and respected by everyone while chasing things that signify a high social status like power, money, or fame. Narcissists’ behaviors push people away, so they struggle to deeply connect with others. Also, because they spend so much time and energy projecting a false image, they lose touch with reality and with themselves.

> **How to Spot Narcissists in Your Life**
> 
> Narcissists can be hard to spot for many reasons. They’re so focused on maintaining their self-image that they hide their narcissistic tendencies even from themselves. They’re also master manipulators and often seem very confident and charming.
> 
> Furthermore, they tend to target empathetic people who more easily fall prey to their manipulative behavior. Because of this, it can be beneficial to identify a narcissist through their behavior. Here are some traits to look out for that may indicate narcissism:
> 
>   * **Lack of empathy** : They won’t seem to be bothered when other people are in pain or trouble.
> 
>   * **Self-importance** : They believe they’re superior and entitled to special treatment. They’ll ignore or act rudely toward people they think are inferior or can’t get anything out of, and they might overreact when they don’t get their way.
> 
>   * **Over-jealous** : They’ll be overly concerned with people who are successful and try to knock them down as much as possible. They might also think others are jealous of them.
> 
>   * **Obsessed with power or material wealth** : They’ll constantly fantasize about being in positions of power or talk about their desire for objects that indicate wealth and status.
> 
> 


### Growth Needs

In Kaufman’s new hierarchy of needs, the three security needs set a foundation for self-actualization, or what he calls fulfilling your growth needs. Kaufman equates self-actualization with growth because self-actualization isn’t about meeting all your needs and then stopping; it’s about making constant progress. **To live a fulfilling life, you need to always feel as though you’re developing as a person and reaching toward your fullest potential**.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Minimalism _argue that what constitutes a meaningful life is different for everyone, but in general, a meaningful life is one in which you feel _successful._ However, they add that success is tied to constant improvement. Whether in your relationships, your personal health, your career, or any other area of growth you deem important, if you feel you’re improving on a daily basis, you’re likely to find happiness and meaning in your life. According to the authors, the key to living a more meaningful life is to find ways to enjoy positive experiences you dislike. In other words, find ways to enjoy the things that are good for your personal growth that you normally don’t enjoy.)

Kaufman identifies three growth needs: the need to be curious, the need to love, and the need for purpose.

#### The Need to Explore

According to Kaufman, the need to be curious, which he defines as the urge to seek out new and challenging experiences, is a fundamental human need. If you feel safe, connected, and sure of yourself (satisfying the security needs outlined above), you’ll likely then want to learn more about the world and the people around you.

The need to be curious is about facing the inherent uncertainty of life, and though this can be stressful, it allows you to learn more about yourself and your surroundings and make new connections. Each of these will lead to growth.

**Learning through curiosity is essential to growth**. When you’re curious, you try to understand yourself and the world around you. This puts you in touch with your wants, needs, and capabilities, which helps you know what you want from life and which areas of growth to focus on. If you seek to understand your environment and surroundings, you’ll develop useful skills and abilities as you learn more about the world. Also, you’ll be more flexible when you face a challenging situation because you’ll think about the different ways of solving the problem instead of shutting down or giving up.

**Making new connections is conducive to growth in several ways**. First, when you get to know others and their stories, you learn from them. You not only learn from their mistakes, but you also gain insight into potential opportunities that may benefit you. For example, you may meet someone who teaches you how to paint, which becomes a source of lifelong joy and meaning for you. Another way making new connections benefits you is by increasing your ability to evaluate others. Research shows that people who explore socially can more accurately assess others. Since we’re such social creatures, accurately evaluating others helps us adapt to social situations and develop stronger relationships.

> **How to Foster an Experimentation Mindset**
> 
> In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young argues that experimentation is necessary if you wish to learn and grow, which echoes Kaufman’s argument that curiosity is necessary if you wish to self-actualize. Young contends that experimentation helps you grow in three ways: you develop a more personal and effective learning style, you become more efficient, and you become more creative and original.
> 
> Young also provides five different avenues of experimentation you can try:
> 
>   * **Replicate others** : This can be a good starting point, as you can copy someone else who you admire and learn how to approach whatever task you’re experimenting with. This aligns with the idea that learning from others can benefit you, even in an indirect way, like if you take up a hobby they’re already doing.
> 
>   * **Compare separate but similar approaches** : Try two different methods with slight variations so you can narrow down what works best for you. This approach is a way to better understand yourself in order to grow.
> 
>   * **Set restrictions** : By setting restrictions, you limit what you can do and force yourself to be more creative.
> 
>   * **Experiment with a variety of skills** : Sometimes seemingly unconnected skills can reinforce each other in unforeseen ways.
> 
>   * **Get out of your comfort zone** : Fight the urge to get complacent when you master a skill. If you get out of your comfort zone, you’ll learn a lot about yourself and what you’re capable of. Getting out of your comfort zone is another way of learning through exploration, and you could do so mentally, physically, or socially.
> 
> 


#### The Need to Love

Kaufman identifies the ability to love as an important aspect of growth. Though this may seem like it should fall under our need for connectedness, Kaufman makes an important distinction: the need to _feel_ loved is vital to our security, but the ability to _give_ love is vital to our growth. The need to feel loved is a somewhat selfish desire that depends on others to give you what you lack. **The ability to love others entails having a selfless, loving attitude toward the world that helps you grow and live a more fulfilling life**.

Kaufman claims that the ability to love is conducive to growth for several reasons. First, people who have a more loving attitude toward others are less likely to _need_ love from others while simultaneously being more likely to maintain healthy, strong connections. In other words, the more loving you are, the more love you’ll receive.

Another reason the ability to give love is so beneficial to growth is that it helps you maintain your connections to others (answering that basic need) without losing your sense of agency or identity (maintaining a healthy sense of self-esteem). If you’re too caught up in your need for others to love you, you may lose your sense of self—you may be so focused on being a good partner or friend or maintaining love that you lose sight of your own needs and wants. But if you’re more focused on giving love, you can maintain healthy, mutually beneficial relationships in which both sides grow as individuals while also strengthening their connection.

> **Love as Dependency**
> 
> In _The Road Less Traveled_ , M. Scott Peck provides further insight into what makes a healthy, loving relationship and how the need to be loved can hinder individual growth. First, Peck dispels the myth that love is about dependency. Genuine love, according to Peck, involves choice—it’s not about needing someone; it’s about not needing them but choosing to love them.
> 
> The belief that without love you can’t feel whole can be extremely harmful. Peck refers to this overwhelming need for love as a _passive dependent personality disorder_ , which he says leaves you unable to give love to yourself or others.
> 
> Common characteristics of passive dependent personality include the insatiable need for love, the inability to be alone, a lack of genuine intimacy, and a lack of identity. These traits, as Kaufman would likely point out, are all symptomatic of a feeling of deficiency. Like Kaufman, Peck argues that such dependency can hinder growth. He says that dependency hinders _spiritual_ growth because the dependent person is only worried about their own needs rather than building a genuine, lasting relationship.

#### The Need for Purpose

The final need of Kaufman’s new hierarchy of needs is **the need for purpose, which he defines as the need for an all-encompassing goal or series of goals that gives meaning to your life**. When all other needs of security and growth are met, a person needs to feel they’re striving toward a goal they feel is important in order to reach self-actualization. Kaufman notes that finding and maintaining a purpose is hard, however, and offers advice on how to strive for meaning in a realistic and healthy way.

(Shortform note: The study of purpose in the field of psychology was popularized by Viktor E. Frankl’s _Man’s Search for Meaning_. Frankl, a holocaust survivor, saw that the people most likely to survive concentration camps had goals for their future and could find some sort of meaning in their suffering. He thus theorized that meaning, or purpose, is the driving force of a person’s life.)

Kaufman cautions that if your purpose or goals conflict with your values, they can actually impede your growth. For instance, if you don’t feel like your purpose or goals are particularly important or valuable, you’ll have a less fulfilling life than someone who feels they’re contributing to society, and you’ll eventually lose motivation and growth will stagnate.

(Shortform note: The idea that your purpose should be about contributing value to society is a common theme regarding theories of human motivation. In _Grit_ , for example, Angela Duckworth defines purpose as the desire to increase the well-being of others. She states that the desire to help others is crucial because it helps you remain passionate in pursuit of your goals. If your purpose revolves around helping others, you’re likely to work harder and stick with it longer.)

Other research shows, however, that there’s often a disconnect between your purported values and your actual values, so **it’s important to find a purpose that aligns with your values _and_ your deeper interests and motives**. For example, you may believe that education is extremely important and that teachers are a vital part of society. But when you start your teaching career, you find that you just don’t get a lot out of it and that deep down you aren’t that interested in teaching. When this kind of disconnect happens, it’s important to accept it without guilt or shame. Kaufman recommends evaluating your strengths and weaknesses, determining which of your strengths you long to use more, and choosing a purpose based on those strengths.

> **Develop Purpose by Following Your Passion**
> 
> Duckworth also gives some advice on how to develop a purpose. Like Kaufman, Duckworth argues that purpose can’t just be about helping others, it has to align with your interests as well. She claims that successful people with a strong sense of purpose usually follow a predictable pattern:
> 
> First, they become interested in something for selfish reasons. Then, through practice, they become more and more skilled at the thing they’re interested in. Eventually, they’ll see how these skills can benefit others, and they’ll seek to help others as much as possible. So while Kaufman argues that you should base your purpose around your strengths _and_ interests, Duckworth maintains that all that really matters is what you’re interested in because with practice that interest will eventually turn into a strength anyway.

### Transcendence

In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, self-actualization sits at the top, representing the pinnacle of human potential. Yet Kaufman notes that toward the end of his career, Maslow noticed that some people can reach for something greater—they can _transcend_ self-actualization. In other words, they can fulfill their deficiency and growth needs while simultaneously being motivated by values that go beyond the self, like beauty, truth, or justice. Kaufman suggests that **some people are able to consistently live by such transcendent values and that this is the level of being to which we should all strive**.

(Shortform note: Kaufman argues that transcending self-actualization means living by values that extend beyond the self. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins also emphasizes the importance of values, saying that living by your values brings you fulfillment and joy. Although he doesn’t explicitly say you should live by _selfless_ values, he maintains that you should work to understand which values are most important to you so you can actively pursue them. With this in mind, perhaps an important step in transcending self-actualization is to determine which transcendent values are most important to you.)

To better understand transcendence, Kaufman examines transcendent _experiences_. **Transcendent experiences occur when you experience a heightened sense of joy, awe, or wonder** —when you’re completely absorbed in the present moment, detached from your usual fears, anxieties, and needs. According to Kaufman, transcendent experiences give a glimpse into a higher form of human potential that goes beyond the needs of self-actualization.

Transcendent experiences are often seen as spiritual experiences, but they don’t necessarily have a religious or spiritual association. Kaufman points to the feeling of awe as the most common transcendent experience that most people have felt. The most common trigger of awe experiences, according to Kaufman, is natural beauty, but awe is also triggered by things like athletic skill, music, art, or an epiphany. When people feel a sense of awe, they often feel a minimized sense of self, a connectedness to the people or world around them, and a sense that time is slowing down. After the experience, people often report a renewed sense of self and a more optimistic view of life.

(Shortform note: Awe and its ability to transform the way people think and behave is a long-studied psychological phenomenon, one that can be difficult to conceptualize. But modern psychological research suggests that awe-inducing experiences really can change our views of ourselves and the world around us. One study found that feelings of awe changed how people thought about themselves. After experiencing awe, people are more likely to view themselves as part of a larger group than as individuals, suggesting that awe can indeed make us feel more connected to others. Additionally, the tendency of awe to make us feel "beyond" ourselves is likely why it's been often interpreted as a religious experience.)

Kaufman argues that a key aspect of transcendence is that people lose their sense of self. When you’re in a transcendent state of consciousness, you enter an egoless state in which you’re primarily focused on the present moment and less focused on your own thoughts and feelings. You temporarily forget about your pains, fears, and anxieties while also feeling more connected to humanity and the world. Research suggests that those who enter this state regularly have stronger mental, physical health, and social health—they have stronger familial relationships, a stronger sense of purpose, and exhibit more charitable and social behaviors.

Kaufman points out that though anyone can have a transcendent experience, self-actualizing people are able to live a more transcendent life. In other words, **people who have all their deficiency and growth needs met are more likely to be absorbed in the present, simultaneously fulfilling their individual needs while reaching for something greater**. Those who do this on a regular basis may experience transcendence not just as a temporary, fleeting moment, but as a sustained state of being. Such people are able to remain in touch with themselves while also being less concerned with their egos and material possessions. They reach their individual potential while also connecting with and helping others.

> **Understanding Different Views on Self-Transcendence**
> 
> Losing your sense of self, known as self-transcendence, is receiving increasing attention in the scientific world, and some suggest a better public understanding of self-transcendence could be a major benefit to society**.** One researcher, Paul Wong, argues that self-transcendence is an essential aspect of well-being, even going so far as to argue that self-actualization doesn’t lead to self-transcendence, as Kaufman claims, but that self-actualization is a _side effect_ of self-transcendence. In other words, the more we lose ourselves to a bigger cause, the more we can be our true selves and reach our greatest potential.
> 
> Another way to think about self-transcendence is provided by Viktor E. Frankl’s argument that humans are driven by a desire for meaning**.** Frankl maintains that the human desire to seek and create meaning in our lives is a fundamental aspect of human nature. This “will to meaning,” while echoing Kaufman’s need for purpose, is a form of self-transcendence because it involves looking outside the self to make sense of the world and your place in it. Finding meaning outside of yourself can provide the will to live even in the most dire of circumstances.
