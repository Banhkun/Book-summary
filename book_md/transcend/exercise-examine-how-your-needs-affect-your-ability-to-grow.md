## Exercise: Examine How Your Needs Affect Your Ability to Grow

A core idea of Kaufman’s work is that your insecurities can hinder your ability to grow and become the best version of yourself. Let’s explore how this idea applies to your life and experiences.

* * *

Describe a time recently when you felt insecure about yourself or your abilities. For example, maybe a friend or loved one criticized how loudly you chew.

Now think about how you tried to cope with these feelings of insecurity. Did you try to hide them from yourself and others? Did you try to boost your ego by exaggerating your positive traits? How did your coping mechanism(s) affect your ability to perform tasks or maintain healthy relationships? Using the example above, perhaps you felt ashamed about your loud chewing, but instead of acknowledging your feelings, you got defensive.

Now that you’ve identified how you coped with your insecurities, think about how you could have reacted differently. What are some healthy ways you might cope with your insecurities in the future? Next time someone criticizes you, perhaps you decide to acknowledge right away how that made you feel instead of denying your embarrassment.
