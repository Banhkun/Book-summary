## Chapter 7: Payday

While Eisman, Lippmann, and the Cornwall Capital team were looking into the eye of the coming storm in Las Vegas, Michael Burry was trying to placate his investors at Scion. He was confident that his bet against the housing market would be vindicated. But **it was an expensive position to maintain** , and one that was costing his wealthy clients significant money in the here and now, as he continued to owe the banks the premiums on the credit default swaps he’d purchased. For the first time, Burry was _underperforming_ the market. In 2006, the S&P had risen by more than 10 percent—Scion had _lost_ 18.4 percent.

Burry was baffled by how the market was behaving. The data from the mortgage servicers kept getting worse and worse as 2006 turned to 2007 (and the teaser rates expired). The loans were faltering at higher and higher rates, yet the price of insuring the bonds composed of these loans kept falling. **It was as if a fire insurance policy on a house had become cheaper _after_ the house was on fire**. Logic, for once, had failed Dr. Burry. And he was facing an investor revolt, as his clients began to clamor for their money back out of his fund, thinking that _he_ was either a criminal, a madman, or an idiot.

This was a major problem for Dr. Burry. There was language in Burry’s credit default swap contracts with the banks that allowed the major Wall Street firms to cancel their obligations to Burry if his assets fell below a certain level. Thus, even if Scion’s predictions proved to be correct, the big banks could bluff their way through the crisis, maintain high prices for subprime mortgage bonds, run out the clock on Burry, and force him to void his position before he collected a dime. It was imperative to him (and to his investors, though few were convinced) that there not be a mass withdrawal of funds from Scion. **They would _lose_ everything, right when they were on the cusp of _winning_ everything.**

### Side-Pocketing

So what did Burry do? He told his investors, no, they couldn’t have their money back. He exercised a rarely used provision in his contracts with the investors that enabled him to lock up their money if it was invested in assets for which there either was no market or that could not be freely traded. He argued that credit default swaps were just such an asset and that the market for them was either fraudulent or totally dysfunctional. In doing this, he “side-pocketed” his investors’ money, keeping it invested until his bet had fully played out.

But as the aforementioned downturns in the subprime market began in 2007, Scion’s fortunes began to shift, just as Burry had told investors they would. In the first quarter of 2007, Scion was back up by 18 percent. The loans were going bad and borrowers were getting slammed with higher interest payments. The bill was finally coming due for Wall Street.

In just one pool of mortgages that Scion bet against, delinquencies, foreclosures, and bankruptcies rose from 15.6 percent to 37.7 percent from February to June 2007. **More than a third of borrowers had defaulted on their loans.** The bonds were suddenly worthless. The house was on fire. Investors were scrambling to either sell off these bonds (for a fraction of their original value) or purchase insurance on the bad bets they’d made—insurance that Mike Burry (as well as Eisman, Lippmann, Ledley, Mai, and Hockett) now owned in spades.

### Howie Hubler: Hoist by his Own Petard

What went up on Wall Street eventually had to come down. Our collection of oddball investors were about to see their big-time bets pay off—although they didn’t know by whom they would ultimately be paid.

**The big banks had made a catastrophic bet,** often with upper management not even knowing what its bond trading desks were up to. The story of Howie Hubler, Morgan Stanley’s famed star bond trader, illustrates how the risk from subprime became so diffused throughout Wall Street’s balance sheets.

Hubler was Morgan Stanley’s point person in the subprime mortgage bond game, as well as the manager of side bets through credit default swaps. Through Hubler’s desk, Morgan Stanley was effectively selling worthless triple-B mortgage bonds to investors (often German land banks and pension funds), then betting on those very same bonds to fail through the swaps. Hubler’s team became a bank-within-a-bank: by April 2006, they alone were **generating an estimated 20 percent of Morgan Stanley’s profits.**

For the bank’s leadership, Hubler was the goose that laid the golden eggs. They didn’t understand _how_ he did what he did, they only knew that it continued to make them rich. And they were always afraid that he’d leave to start his own fund. To keep him happy, Morgan Stanley set Hubler up with his own proprietary trading desk (on his own private floor), where he would keep a chunk of the profits he generated.

Hubler thought he had everyone outsmarted. He was selling mortgage-backed CDOs on the one hand, and credit default swaps _against_ them on the other. Like our other investors, Hubler was also betting big on the housing markets to collapse. But he also had to fork over $200 million annually in premiums on the swaps until the defaults started. To solve this cash flow problem, he decided to _sell_ some swaps on triple-A mortgage bonds, which would generate premiums to his group.

Of course, **this effectively made him the _owner_ of those bonds and he would be on the hook for the full loss when the crash came**. Here, the inflated ratings on the bonds worked _against_ him. Because the triple-A bonds he sold insurance on were rated _higher_(as opposed to the triple-Bs he’d bet against), the premiums they generated were _lower_. It cost less to insure what was seen as a safer asset. Thus, he needed to sell _ten times_ the swaps he’d bought to even out the cash flows. He’d effectively gone _long_ on the same subprime bonds that Burry, Eisman, Lippmann, and the Cornwall team had gone short on. **The star bond trader had been fooled by the complexity of his own creation**. And, as we know, the triple-A CDOs that Hubler bet _on_ were no safer than the triple-Bs he’d bet _against_. They were all composed of the same worthless mortgages: if one pool failed, _all_ of them were likely to fail. By mid-2007, Hubler had sold $4 billion in credit default swaps to Deutsche Bank alone, and $16 billion total.

### The Crash Comes

By July 2007, the housing market was in freefall and Hubler’s $4 billion sale of swaps to Deutsche Bank (Greg Lippmann’s employer) now translated to a $1.2 billion loss. Lippmann himself had the pleasure of calling Morgan Stanley to let them know just how much they owed ($47 million would ultimately go to him personally). Refusing to accept that the CDOs had declined that much in value, Morgan Stanley agreed to send $600 million to Deutsche Bank, while Hubler stubbornly maintained his position in the trade.

But**Hubler was, by this time, playing a losing hand**. He should have folded when he had the chance. When Morgan Stanley finally admitted defeat and exited the trade, **they had lost a net $9 billion, the single largest trading loss in Wall Street history**. By the end of 2007, the bank lost over $37 billion through the subprime mortgage bond and related derivatives market. In an infamous conference call with shareholders, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack revealed that he had zero understanding of what his bond department had been up to. The game had grown too complex for even the titans of Wall Street themselves to understand. **Total losses on U.S. subprime-related assets would eventually top $1 trillion.**

For the Cornwall team, _now_ was the time to act. Their credit default swaps on the collapsing CDOs were worth more than they had ever been. But if they waited too long, they might lose everything. Either the government would step in and guarantee the bad subprime loans, or the banks they’d bet against (like Bear Stearns) would go bankrupt and be unable to pay them. It was time to sell. On August 6, 2007, at a pub in the south of England (where he was on vacation with his family), Ben Hockett logged onto his laptop and looked for buyers on $205 million in swaps on double-A tranches of subprime mortgage CDOs. UBS, Merrill Lynch, and soon-to-be-bankrupt Lehman Brothers fiercely competed with one another to buy what Hockett had to sell. In the end, **Cornwall’s swaps costing about $1 million sold for $80 million by the close of business that day. Their long shot had paid off 80:1.**

Dr. Burry cashed in his chips on August 31. **His profits were over $720 million**. To his chagrin, the investors who had had so little faith in his strategy never thanked him or apologized to him for questioning his ethics and even his sanity. He had always rejected the standard money manager policy of charging a 2 percent fee off the top of his total portfolio of assets managed, believing that this was nothing more than a way to scam investors without doing any actual work. This integrity had cost him dearly while he was paying hefty premiums on his credit default swaps. He’d even had to fire employees to maintain his short position. After he made his clients even richer with his wildly prescient and successful bet, he decided to reverse course and start charging the fee.

Steve Eisman, ever the cynic, held out the longest. **He didn’t want to just make money—he wanted to make the banks _hurt_.** To him, the big investment banks were little more than criminal operations that had created a machine designed to prey off the hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans. In their greed and stupidity, they had brought themselves, and the entire global economy to its knees. This was more than just an investment for Eisman: it was a moral crusade.

On March 14, 2008, at an event attended by a who’s-who of Wall Street figures, Eisman publicly excoriated the famously bullish investor Bill Miller, who’d just spent his three minutes of speaking time extolling the virtues of Bear Stearns and explaining what a good investment the bank’s stock was. He said that Wall Street banks only failed when they became embroiled in criminal activities. But _as Eisman was speaking_ , refuting Miller’s laughably optimistic views of the market, the collection of cell phones and Blackberrys in the room started going off like mad.

**Bear Stearns stock was in a freefall.** In the half-hour or so that Eisman spoke, the stock fell by more than 20 points. There had been a classic run on the bank as investors scrambled to move their money away from subprime assets—which made up most of Bear’s balance sheet by this point. By Monday, it would be gone, sold to J.P. Morgan for $2-per-share. That same day, Merrill Lynch would sell itself to Bank of America, after losing $55.2 billion. In this chaos, Eisman was vindicated: **he had found a way to profit from the foolishness of the bankers he despised.**

(Shortform note: Eisman’s fund, FrontPoint, is believed to have more than doubled in value from $700 million to $1.5 billion through its bet against the housing market.)

### The Final Sucker: You

The investors we’ve followed all believed that they were getting one over on the big banks. Through greed, short-sightedness, and outright stupidity, they believed that **Wall Street had been given enough rope to hang itself.**

But, in the end, this wasn’t really true. Yes, Eisman, Burry, Lippmann, Ledley, Mai, and Hockett were vindicated and got paid. But they final payer wasn’t Goldman Sachs or Deutsche Bank or AIG or Morgan Stanley. **It was the U.S. taxpayer**. When the final meltdown occurred in September 2008, Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the (in)famous $700 billion bailout of the financial sector. **The gains, it turned out, were privatized—the losses were socialized.** Wall Street was pro-free market, until _they_ were in trouble. As John Gutfreund, former CEO of Salomon Brothers remarked, **“It’s _laissez-faire_ until you get in deep shit.”**

The $13 billion that AIG had lost to Goldman Sachs betting on subprime mortgage bonds was fully covered by the government. Likewise, the Treasury Department guaranteed $306 billion of Citigroup’s assets (equivalent to nearly 2 percent of total U.S. GDP). The U.S. government decided that it could not allow all of Wall Street to go under: **the toxic subprime assets were spread too far, too wide, and too ambiguously**. If one firm needed a bailout, they _all_ needed a bailout.

Did the big banks know that they were too big to fail and that they would receive a bailout no matter what kind of irresponsible risks they took? And did this knowledge _bring on_ the excessive risk-taking? It’s certainly easy to gamble when you know you’re playing with the house’s money. Our collection of esoteric investors had keen insights that few in the period from 2005-2008 had. But what they didn’t know is that **the public—all of us—would be the ones ultimately on the hook.**
