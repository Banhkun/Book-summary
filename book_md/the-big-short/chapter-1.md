## Chapter 1: An Untapped Asset—The Home

The deadly virus that infected the global financial system in 2008 was a relatively new class of asset: the mortgage-backed security. At its most basic level, **a mortgage-backed security was a bond, a debt instrument.** But it was very different from a traditional bond that might be issued by a government or a corporation. These latter types of bonds were essentially loans, for which the lender would be paid a fixed interest rate over a given period of time until the bond matured and the bondholder received the principal (or “face value” as it’s sometimes known).

Traditional bonds always entailed _some_ level of risk (the company or government from which you purchased your bonds could default, or fall behind on; payment or interest rates could rise and erode the value of your bond on the open market), but these risks were relatively transparent and easy-to-understand for most investors. This was _not_ to be the case with mortgage-backed securities.

### Mortgage-Backed Securities

**Mortgage-backed securities brought the world of high finance into the lives of everyday Americans** —even if they had no idea how much their homes had become chips on the table in the vast casino of global finance. A mortgage-backed security was **a bundle of home mortgages (often running into the thousands) that had been packaged together into a tradable asset.** When an investor purchased one, she was purchasing the cash flows from the individual home mortgages that made up the security.

This type of asset had actually existed for decades before the global financial meltdown of 2008, though few investors (and even fewer ordinary people) had heard of it. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, it was an obscure corner of the overall bond market, drawing only occasional interest from major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley, Bearn Stearns, and Goldman Sachs.

Many investors at this time, in fact, shied _away_ from them because the cash flows were undesirable. During this era, the bonds were made up of rock-solid mortgages to creditworthy homeowners who were in little risk of default. Ironically, this was the original problem that investors had with these securities. Borrowers could always pay off their mortgages any time they wished, and it was usually easiest for them to do so in a low-interest environment.

Buyers of mortgage-backed securities at this time weren’t concerned about default:**they were worried about being paid back too _quickly_.** As an investor, you want to be sitting on cash when interest rates are _high_ so that you can reinvest that money and earn even greater returns. The basic nature of mortgage-backed securities seemed to cut against this basic investing principle. Because people were paying off their mortgages when interest rates were low, **the holder of a mortgage-backed security received their money back precisely when it was _least_ valuable to them**.

#### Specialty Finance

Wall Street, however, had a workaround to this problem.**Instead of buying the _whole_ bundle, investors could purchase a _slice_ of the underlying mortgages** (or “tranche” as they would become infamously known). Investors in the lowest tranche would receive the first wave of repayments (again, when this cash influx was least valuable). To compensate for the untimely cash flow, these investors would receive a higher interest rate from the bank on the tranche that they purchased.

The tranches ran on a sliding scale all the way to the top. **Top-level investors would receive the last wave of mortgage repayments** , presumably when interest rates were high and the new influx of cash would be of greatest value. _These_ investors received the lowest rate of interest but enjoyed the security of knowing that they would be getting their money back at the time when it was worth the most.

But this whole structure created a perverse incentive: **mortgages made to un-creditworthy borrowers could actually be worth _more_ than mortgages made to qualified borrowers**. If your biggest fear as an investor in mortgage-backed securities was that you’d be repaid too _early_ , the last thing you wanted to see in your portfolio was a bunch of financially secure, stable, low-risk mortgages. You wanted high-risk mortgages that stood little chance of being repaid early. Such borrowers wouldn’t qualify for refinancing that would enable them to pay off their mortgages when interest rates fell. They would instead **be on the hook for the _entire_ life of the mortgage**—making them the ideal borrowers for mortgage-backed security investors.

According to the theory behind these new bonds, even if a few people in the mortgage pool _did_ default (as they invariably would), there were enough other mortgages for the bundle as a whole to be considered diversified—and thus, a safe and profitable investment.

### Subprime

In the 1980s and 1990s, a new industry, led by firms like The Money Store, was being established to provide financial products and services to the least-creditworthy Americans. It bore the characteristically euphemistic name of “specialty finance.” **The home loans issued to un-creditworthy borrowers became known as subprime mortgages**. Although subprime mortgages still only represented a small fraction of the total U.S. credit market at this time, they received a boost from the nation’s growing income inequality. A more skewed income distribution created more and more potential subprime borrowers.

Superficially, the structure of subprime mortgage bonds resembled that of the original mortgage bonds that had been composed of mortgages to creditworthy borrowers. Investors would purchase different tranches, or tiers, of the bonds, only now they were exposed to a much higher risk of actual _defaults**, because the bonds were composed of subprime mortgages.**_

**Subprime mortgage loan originators were happy to issue loans to almost anybody**. Bad credit score? No problem! No income? Nothing to worry about! Past history of delinquency and/or foreclosure? Everyone deserves a second chance!

Home prices seemed to be going up and up with no end in sight. Indeed, the U.S. was living through a period in which the residential housing market had been on a general upward trend since the end of World War Two. **The most secure, rock-solid investment appeared to be in homes**. For this reason, subprime lenders were largely unconcerned with the risk of default. With the price of their homes always rising,**borrowers would always be able to refinance easily.** Refinancing simply meant using the equity in one’s home as a form of collateral to obtain a _new_ loan. With this cash, people could pay their original mortgages (thus eliminating the possibility of default) and just take on new debt. It was a way to use a home as a piggy bank, a source of easy cash for over-extended borrowers.

And even if a few borrowers failed to make their mortgage payments on time or couldn’t refinance and obtain a new loan, the lenders would simply take back the house and issue a new mortgage to a new homeowner at an even higher principal, or money owed to the lender.

Moreover, the subprime lenders weren’t keeping the loans on their books. Through mortgage bonds, the loans they had issued to risky borrowers could be bundled, packaged, and sold off to other investors. Any risk of default would be _their_ problem. These incentives contributed to a widespread degradation of lending standards across the mortgage industry.

### Ramping Up

Despite the inherent irrationality of the subprime mortgage bond market, it continued to thrive and grow as the 1990s became the early 2000s. In the 1990s, the market was maybe $30 billion: a drop in the ocean of the global credit market. **By 2005, there were $625 billion in subprime mortgage loans, $500 billion of which had been packaged into bonds**.

Even more alarming, the quality of the underlying loans had only deteriorated over time. **Seventy-five percent of the loans by this time were floating-rate or adjustable-rate**. This meant that the borrowers received a low “teaser-rate” for the first two years or so of the mortgage, after which they would face rate increases and ever-larger payments (these latter were to become known as “balloon payments”). Of course, this meant that **many borrowers would be unable to make their payments in just a few short years,** which would, in turn, set off a wave of foreclosures. Although a few foreclosures were no big deal for investors, a large number would wipe out the value of the bonds made up of these mortgages. The time bomb had already been planted.

But the subprime borrowers and the financial institutions still were unable to see what a dangerous game they were playing. A massive game of hot potato was taking hold of the financial system. **Lenders had an incentive to make as many subprime loans as possible and immediately sell them off to big Wall Street firms.** These firms would then package them into mortgage-backed securities and sell them off to unwitting investors.

The loan originators and the big banks that assembled and sold the bonds were making so much money selling these bonds off to investors that neither really cared about the quality of the underlying loans. The banks pressured the subprime companies to make more and more loans, regardless of the borrowers’ financial position. **It became a matter of quantity over quality and volume over value.** This was easy to get away with in the unregulated, Wild West world of bond trading. Unlike the relative transparency of the stock market, the bond market was defined by the buying and selling of increasingly**** complicated financial instruments of which customers had an extremely limited understanding. This gave the bond traders a powerful informational advantage that they exploited to the fullest. **The ignorance of the institutional investors who purchased these securities, like pension and retirement funds, was a goldmine for the big banks.**

By 2005, the major players on Wall Street, who had once spurned the subprime game because they saw it as too risky, were now eager participants. Increasingly, this market dominated the overall bond market, and because the bond market dominated the dealings of all major investment banks, the subprime market affected the stock market as well. Every financial company had direct or indirect exposure to subprime. The value of their stocks was now inexorably tied up with the performance of highly dubious home mortgages. **Subprime was now the tail that wagged the dog.**

### Steve Eisman: Financial Iconoclast

While the subprime market was growing and coming to cannibalize the wider financial system, an analyst named Steve Eisman was making a name for himself on Wall Street. Eisman had been fascinated by the existence of the subprime market and by the sheer madness of the whole enterprise ever since he’d first become aware of it in the mid-1990s. Originally an attorney, he switched gears relatively early in his career to become an analyst at Oppenheimer, a financial advisement firm.

**Eisman rapidly developed a reputation as a brash truth-teller** , unwilling to offer up the praise and platitudes that so many financial and banking leaders expected to hear. Wall Street, he saw, was awash in flattery, in which brokers, analysts, and customers told the financial class what it wanted to hear, even when it wasn’t true. Eisman tended to buck conventional wisdom. He was unafraid of telling the truth about the underwhelming performances of the companies he was tasked with analyzing—and telling it loudly.

On one occasion, he delivered a speech at a luncheon in which he lambasted the head of a major U.S. brokerage house (who happened to be in the audience), claiming that this man knew nothing about the business he led. Another time, Eisman crumpled up the financial statements of a Japanese real estate firm and told the CEO that they were “toilet paper.” With his often-unkempt appearance and unrestrained personality, he cut a unique figure among the smartly dressed and cautiously reserved Wall Street set.

**But he was also guided by a strong moral compass** and began to realize just how much of Wall Street’s business model was based on deceiving the clients whose interests it supposedly existed to serve while gouging working-class Americans out of their homes and savings. He saw these injustices even more acutely after his infant son, Max, passed away in a tragic accident. He saw that **bad things could happen to anyone, anywhere, without any warning**. This new ability to imagine a worst-case scenario amid a culture of unbridled (and ultimately, unfounded) optimism was to serve Eisman well as the financial sector began to lose all sense of rationality during the 2000s.

#### The Household Finance Corporation Scandal

The story of the Household Finance Corporation was an early indication to Eisman of just how rotten the lending business had become. In 2002, he obtained sales documents from Home Finance Corporation, a major player in consumer lending that had been founded back in the 19th century.

The sales documents offered borrowers a 15-year, fixed-rate loan, but used language designed to fool customers into thinking it was a thirty-year loan. **Customers would think that they had twice as long to pay off their mortgage as they actually did** and that they would be making lower monthly payments than they actually owed.

Household did this by “hypothetically” pitching to the customer what their “effective rate” of interest would be if they stretched their 15 years of payments over a 30 year period. The customers were then told that this was their “effective rate” of interest, even though this was entirely fictional. A customer could be bamboozled into thinking she was paying 7 percent interest when she would in fact be paying closer to 12.

**To Eisman, this was blatant, even criminal fraud.** He tried to sound the alarm about Household, contacting public officials and journalists. But he saw that regulatory officials were unwilling to act to bring Household to heel—the attorney general of the state of Washington even told Eisman that he feared there’d be no other company to make subprime loans in Washington if the state cracked down too hard on fraud.

To Eisman’s dismay, **the leadership of Household was never punished—in fact, it was _rewarded_ for its deception.** The company settled a class-action suit out of court for $484 million (a fraction of what they had defrauded from customers), then sold itself to HSBC for $15.5 billion. The CEO personally made $100 million on the deal.

The impunity with which the company had acted was a genuine shock to Eisman. The CEO was being showered with wealth, when, in Eisman’s view, they should have “hung him up by his fucking testicles.” It was a revelation to Eisman. The market had _not_ punished bad actors. **The incentives had _not_ worked the way they were supposed to**. His political views began to shift too, as he started his transformation from a free-market, Reaganite Republican to a progressive, populist, almost socialist Democrat. He now saw **the true ethos of the system: “Fuck the poor.”**
