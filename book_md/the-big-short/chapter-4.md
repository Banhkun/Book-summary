## Chapter 4: Bubble Nation

Despite Steve Eisman’s keen awareness of how depraved, corrupt, and outright ludicrous the subprime mortgage market was, he still viewed Lippmann with deep suspicion. Lippmann seemed to be a caricature of a sleazy Wall Street bond trader, only out to screw the customer. If it was such a great deal, why was Lippmann offering them a cut of the action?

The answer was that **Lippmann _needed_ co-investors like Eisman for his plan to work**. While he was confident that his bet against the market would pay off in the long-run, in the short-run, it was expensive. **He was sustaining losses on the premiums due on the credit default swaps before the mortgages started failing**. He needed other investors to help him share those losses. And, for once, he really _wasn’t_ trying to screw his partners over—they would end up getting rich just like him.

### Into the Belly of the Beast

As Eisman dug deeper into the subprime market, he became more and more convinced that Lippmann was right. The market was even _worse_ than he could have possibly imagined. Lending standards, he saw, had deteriorated to the point where **lenders were throwing money at people in the bottom 29th percentile of the income distribution** —in other words, people who were poorer than 71 percent of the U.S. population!

Eisman and his partners went down to Miami—a flashpoint of the rising default crisis—and saw for themselves empty neighborhoods and subdivisions built entirely through subprime loans. This scene was replicated across the so-called “sand states” of Florida, California, Nevada, and Arizona. The “originate-and-sell” business model of subprime lenders like Long Beach Savings had thrown wads of cash at dubious borrowers, inflating a massive—and largely undetected—housing bubble in the process.

(Shortform note: Housing bubbles occur when the demand for houses increases and supply—the number of houses on the market—can’t keep up with demand. Consequently, home prices increase, sometimes dramatically. The bubble bursts when the tide turns and demand decreases sharply while supply increases—there are more houses available than people who want to buy them. Consequently, home prices plummet.)

The lending standards Eisman saw were obscene. **Homeowners with no credit and no proof of income were issued mortgages with no money down**. In one instance, a strawberry picker earning $14,000 per year was loaned the money to buy a house worth over $700,000. Eisman even saw the bubble affecting people within his own personal circle. His housekeeper was offered an adjustable-rate, no money down-mortgage to purchase a townhouse in Queens. His daughters’ baby nurse somehow managed to purchase _six_ townhouses in Queens through easy credit. **One of his partners even knew** **a stripper who had five separate home equity loans.**

In Eisman’s view, the willingness of borrowers to take out these kinds of loans wasn’t the shocking part. Borrowers had _always_ tried to get as much as they could from creditors. But it had traditionally been the rigid adherence to strict lending standards that had stopped lenders from giving money to obviously un-creditworthy borrowers. Why were they suddenly now so eager to lend money like this?

The answer, of course, lies in the fact that **lenders were just repackaging these loans off to the big banks to be sliced and diced into CDOs** to be sold to unwitting investors like insurance company AIG. But to truly understand the brewing crisis, we need to understand _why_ mortgage-backed securities were considered so valuable. And for that, we need to look at the ratings agencies.

### The Ratings Agencies: Rubber-Stamping Fraud

The credit ratings agencies are _supposed_ to play an important role in the financial system. By evaluating the risks and returns of financial instruments, agencies like Moody’s and S&P help investors determine how much they should pay for these products. **The pricing system on Wall Street was inextricably tied up with the grades that the agencies applied** to the bonds being sold by firms like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. When Moody’s assigned a triple-A rating to a bond composed of worthless subprime mortgages, that bond became worth far more on the market than it really should have been.

Unfortunately, the big investment banks had become experts in **playing the ratings agencies for suckers**. People who worked at the agencies were widely seen by the big bond traders as second-rate intellects who could be easily manipulated into giving the stamp of approval to complex financial products that they didn’t understand. As one Goldman Sachs trader remarked, **“Guys who can’t get a job on Wall Street get a job at Moody’s.”**

Traders were surprised to see how easy it was to game the ratings. For example, Moody’s and S&P didn’t evaluate all of the mortgages in the CDOs to see what proportion of them were likely to go bad (and thus, cause the entire bundle to become worthless). All they looked at was the _average_ FICO score (a measure of individual borrowers’ creditworthiness) of the _entire_ portfolio. And a few outliers can always skew an average one way or the other. **To be triple-A rated, all the ratings agencies required was that the _average_ FICO score in the entire pool be 615 **(still below the U.S. median score of 723).

Moreover, the agencies’ models took no account of the effect of the teaser rates. These models assumed that borrowers would be as likely to pay back their mortgages at an 8 percent teaser rate as they would be at a 12 percent adjustable rate. Of course, this made no sense.

#### Thick Skulls, Thin Scores

Thus, the investment banks could sprinkle a few high-quality mortgages into a pool of subprime loans and transform the whole package into an investment-grade bond that could be passed on to gullible investors at wildly inflated prices. In allowing this, **the ratings agencies muddled the difference between averages and medians**. A bond made up of _all_ 615 FICO score loans stood a far lower chance of tanking than did a bond composed of one half 550 scores and another half 680 scores (even though both bonds would have the same “average” score). But the latter is what **the agencies were short-sightedly marking up as triple-As.**

Furthermore, not all FICO scores were created equal. One borrower’s score of 615might mean something totally different than that of another borrower. **The agencies didn’t distinguish between “thin-file” and “thick-file” scores.** Thin-file scores referred to those borrowers who had minimal credit history. It was easy to have a high score if you’d never borrowed money in the first place. Immigrants who’d never been given loans before thus had artificially high FICO scores.

And there was _every_ incentive for the original lenders and bond traders to create packages of the worst, most un-creditworthy loans. These mortgages were simply the raw materials that they were using to construct their final products—mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, CDOs, and ultimately, synthetic CDOs. And, like any business,**they wanted cheap raw materials.**

#### On the Take

**But the ratings agencies weren’t just stupid. As Eisman saw, they were corrupt as well**. When he and his partners traveled down to Orlando to a subprime mortgage conference, they met with representatives from both Moody’s and S&P.

One woman from Moody’s shocked Eisman’s team with her candor. She had actually done her homework and seen these bonds for the junk that they actually were. But **she was told by her bosses that she could not downgrade the bonds.**

Although this woman didn’t say so explicitly, the reason was clear—the investment banks hawking these dubious bonds were _clients_ of the ratings agencies. The ratings agencies were for-profit entities paid by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. _Of course_ **they weren’t going to alienate a powerful client by slapping a bad rating on one of their premier revenue-generating products.**

And the agencies were making a killing. Since going public in 2000, Moody’s had seen its revenues go up from $800 million in 2001 to $2.03 billion in 2006. Most of this increase came from the fees they received from the Wall Street banks for rating CDO deals. This was a booming business, and the ratings agencies weren’t going to put a stop to the party by downgrading the bonds of their powerful clients. Essentially, **the agencies were paid to accept the ludicrous assumptions of the finance industry** : that home prices would continue to rise and that subprime loan losses would be no more than 5 percent.
