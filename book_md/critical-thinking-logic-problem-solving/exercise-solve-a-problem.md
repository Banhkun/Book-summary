## Exercise: Solve a Problem

The authors explain how to solve a problem using their 5-step process. Apply this to a problem in your own life and come up with a solution.

* * *

First you need to identify the problem. What gap can you identify between your current situation and what you desire? Define this gap using the 5W2H questions.

Next, begin forming solutions. Use a logic tree or other visual tool to lay out your options and their consequences and advantages.

Choose one of the solutions youâ€™ve come up with by assessing the pros and cons of each. Select the option that provides the most advantages and the fewest drawbacks.

Now that you have your solution, create a plan to implement it. Use the 5W2H method again to form your plan.

Finally, assess your process and outcomes and note things you did well and things you could improve. Record them somewhere so you can refer back to them next time.
