## Exercise: Consider Your Inherited Structure

In Part 1, Matthew describes some of the life experiences that taught him to honor structure if you want to be free. This exercise leads you to reflect on your own inherited structures and the ways you can honor them.

* * *

What are some of the “structures” you inherited from your childhood, whether values, habits of mind, or codes of conduct? How did your upbringing teach you to think, talk, and live?

How has your life reflected the influence of these structures?

How can you best honor your inherited structures to find more freedom? (What traditions could you keep? What values or habits could you maintain?) On the flipside, how would _refusing_ to honor these impair your freedom? (What inner or outer conflicts or confusions might you encounter by totally abandoning your past?)
