## Exercise: Practice Being a Genius

When Camila was pregnant, Matthew narrowed his focus by cutting various things out of his life. He identifies this paring away of extraneous activities and relationships as the key to genius. This exercise will help you identify areas where you may be able to narrow your own focus to unleash your potential for genius.

What are the major obligations that fill up your life right now? What people, organizations, and activities claim the majority of your time, energy, and attention?

In your heart of hearts, what’s the most important claim on your life at this moment? For Matthew when he learned Camila was pregnant, it was his family. What is it for you—a person, a project? Name only one or two things.

Which of your obligations could you let go of? Which don’t support your most important priorities?

What specific actions can you do this week to narrow your focus and free up more of your time, energy, and attention for the most important things in your life?
