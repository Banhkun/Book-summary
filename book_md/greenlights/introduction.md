## Introduction

Matthew McConaughey’s _Greenlights_ is not a conventional memoir. As he neared age 50, the Oscar-winning actor revisited the journal that he had kept for the previous 35 years to see what he could learn from it. The result is this book, which combines hard-earned insights about the art of living with vivid accounts of McConaughey’s upbringing in rural Texas, his adventures in the movie business, his global travels, and his lifelong search for love and fatherhood. Part autobiography and part life-guide, _Greenlights_ both explains and illustrates McConaughey’s approach to recognizing and even creating those moments when life says “yes” and you cruise into success as you pursue your destiny.

### Orientation

As you head into Matthew’s story, you’ll better understand his thought process and personal lingo if you first understand his signature concepts of _inevitability, relativity,_ and _greenlights_.

#### Inevitability and Relativity

“Inevitability” refers to inescapable facts: the non-negotiable realities that life hands you, such as your parents, place of birth, and events beyond your choice.

“Relativity” refers to a person's choices in response to the inevitable facts in their life. Freedom comes from your ability to “get relative with the inevitable” (one of Matthew’s favorite ways of phrasing it) by choosing your responses and attitudes to inevitable things. In Matthew’s thinking, all of life is an interaction between the inevitable and the relative. The choices you make in response to the inevitable add up to the story of your life. These philosophies guided Matthew when he wrote this book. It presents the story of his first five decades.

#### Greenlights

The book’s other guiding concept is the idea of “greenlights.” These look and feel like health, prosperity, and success. Or a greenlight could be a sense of rightness, inspiration, or well being. When you receive a greenlight—you get the job, you receive the insight, you meet the person of your dreams—it’s a sign that your life is on the right path.

You can get better at “catching” greenlights. You do this by identifying your red lights (see below) and then changing your course to avoid them. You can also “earn” greenlights through skillful living. And you can catch them through good timing, good luck, intuition, karma, and pure fate. Although you often stumble into green lights through sheer luck, you can get better at catching them through skillful living (practicing relativity toward the inevitable).

You can also catch more greenlights by identifying and dealing properly with red or yellow lights. These show up as detours, interruptions, illnesses, and sometimes full-blown failure. We don’t like yellow and red lights, but sometimes we recognize later that they were exactly what we needed in a given situation, because they eventually led us to a greenlight.

In dealing with a red light, you have three choices:

  1. Push and persist against the barrier.
  2. Pivot to approach the barrier differently (swerving to catch a greenlight as described above).
  3. Surrender and accept the full stop.



#### The Art of Living

Greenlights are connected to inevitability and relativity. **The art of living is to understand how and when to either persist, pivot, or surrender whenever you receive an inevitable red light.** Matthew sees his lifelong practice of using intuition and intelligence to deal with the inevitable as the very key to his success.

### A Guide to This Book

The parts that follow take you from Matthew’s early years growing up in rural Texas to his experiences as an exchange student in Australia, a film school student at the University of Texas, a green young actor in _Dazed in Confused_ , a rising star in Hollywood, a traveler in Europe, a pilgrim to Peru, a seeker in Mali, and a family man who returned to Texas, The book traces the three intertwined topics of his movie career, his quest to become his real self, and his lifelong search for love and fatherhood.

Each part of this summary covers a different era in Matthew’s life, and each begins with a distillation of the lessons he learned during that period. Each part’s biographical account then illustrates those lessons in various ways.
