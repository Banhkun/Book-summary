## Part 3: Becoming Immersed

Having begun to learn who he was by discovering who he wasn’t, and having at last passed the threshold to manhood, Matthew was now ready to head into the world of college and career. In this stage of his life, he went to film school at the University of Texas at Austin, gained his first real film role as Wooderson in _Dazed and Confused_ , suffered the loss of his father, moved to Hollywood, and took a motorcycle tour of Europe. The insights and lessons he gained from all of these experiences include the following:

  * Life is a combination of DNA and willpower, innate ability, and hard work.
  * **People everywhere have fundamentally similar needs.** These include the needs for love, family, community, and a future hope. Such things are our shared values. If you’ll relate to people on this level instead of dwelling on what separates us, then real communication becomes possible beyond the fraught political factors of such things as gender and race.
  * We’re here not merely to tolerate each other’s differences but to accept and celebrate them. We’re also here to celebrate the places where our values unite us.
  * The proverbial “road less traveled” can mean different things for different people. Introverts may need to get out more. Extraverts may need to learn how to stay home and read a book.
  * **To really live the life you’re meant to lead, you have to become less impressed with your own success and more involved with your future.** This also means you take full adult responsibility for the things you took for granted as a child.
  * To succeed and avoid choking at the finish line, become fully immersed in the work you’re doing.
  * Enjoy the doing itself. You can turn red lights green by recognizing that the road is the destination.



### Away to University

Since eighth grade, Matthew had planned on attending law school and becoming a defense attorney. He applied to multiple universities and was accepted to three of them. He wanted to attend Southern Methodist University, but instead chose the University of Texas at Austin when his brother Pat told him that the McConaughey family finances were suffering because the oil business was in a slump, and a degree from UT Austin was significantly cheaper than one from SMU. Matthew never told his father that he had switched his choice to help the family.

By the end of his sophomore year at UT Austin, Matthew found himself writing a lot of short stories. A friend who was studying film at NYU read some of these and suggested that Matthew ought to consider going to film school. **To Matthew, the idea sounded foreign and irresponsible. Film school was just too “artsy.”**

He changed his mind after he went to the house of some fraternity buddies to study for his psychology final exam, but he felt distracted and instead spent his time reading a book that he found there titled _The Greatest Salesman in the World_. This book gripped him with its message that the world’s greatest salesman is actually you, the reader, and with its presentation of positive affirmations to recite multiple times per day in order to form good habits and let them rule you. (Shortform note: Read our guide to The Greatest Salesman in the World.)

Reading this book, Matthew suddenly realized that he didn’t want to be a lawyer. He wanted to be a storyteller. In fact, he wanted to go to film school. But first, he had to tell his father, whose intensely practical streak might make him balk at such an idea.

Matthew strategically timed his phone call for 7:30 p.m., when Jim would be relaxing after dinner with a drink. When he broke the news, Jim asked if he really, deeply wanted to go to film school. Matthew said yes. In response, Jim simply told him not to “half-ass it.” This was the best validation Matthew could have received. **Jim’s approval of Matthew’s decision to attend film school was a significant greenlight.**

#### Film School at UT Austin

Matthew’s GPA of 3.82 got him into the honors program in UT Austin’s film school. He was the only fraternity guy in the program; the other students were all goths and artsy types. He liked blockbuster movies like _Die Hard_ , his classmates called these shit and recommended art films. He eventually realized that they never actually watched the movies they trashed. Their condemnations arose from ignorant prejudice. This led him to flatly reject their habit of condemning something just because it’s popular. **It was a miniature defining moment for him when he claimed ownership of his film preferences.**

Meanwhile, to get some real-world experience he signed with a local talent agency and interned at an ad agency. He got a pager and began leaving or skipping classes frequently to audition in Dallas and San Antonio for television commercials and beer ads. He received work as a hand model. He appeared in one of Trisha Yearwood’s music videos. He worked both behind and in front of the camera in short film productions.

When a dean threatened to fail him because of his frequent absences, Matthew told the man that real-world experiences were more valuable than college classes, and he asked if he could receive all C’s if he promised to show up for every exam. So that’s what happened. This was another greenlight.

### Wooderson

Matthew’s breakthrough into the world of feature films occurred when met producer Don Phillips at the Hyatt bar in Austin. Phillips was in town to work on a movie, and when Matthew introduced himself, they hit it off. Before the night was over, Phillips had offered Matthew a small part in the movie he was casting. Its title was _Dazed and Confused_.

When Matthew read the screenplay, he loved the line spoken by the character of Wooderson, a twenty-something stoner who hangs out with teens, about loving high school girls because they stay the same while he gets older. **Today, Matthew refers to lines like that—lines in a script that generate pure delight and make him want to be involved in a movie—as “launchpad lines.”**

When Matthew developed his performance as Wooderson, he looked to his brother Pat for the basic inspiration, since he had worshiped Pat since childhood and found him cooler than James Dean.**** Matthew’s first scene as Wooderson, and thus the first scene that he ever shot for any feature film, came about spontaneously when the director, Richard Linklater, talked to him about the kinds of things that a character like Wooderson would love the most. Then, on the spur of the moment, Linklater decided to shoot an unscripted scene where Wooderson tries to pick up a nerdy intellectual girl. He told Matthew just to improvise.

Matthew prepared by reflecting deeply on who Wooderson was and what he loved. He decided that Wooderson loved four things: his car, getting high, rock and roll, and chicks. He had already had three of these on hand. The fourth was represented by the girl he was trying to get. So when Linklater said “Action!”, Matthew-as-Wooderson drove up, thought about those three achieved desires, and said, “Alright, alright, alright.” That improvised line became an iconic moment in his career, proving to be a life-defining greenlight and following him forever afterward.

### Death of a Father

Five days into shooting his scenes in _Dazed and Confused_ , Matthew received a call from his mother to inform him that his father had died. Jim had suffered a heart attack after making love to Kay. Matthew left Austin and drove back to Houston for an Irish wake.

As he grappled with the inevitability of this loss, he began to realize that this was his most important rite of passage to manhood. The impact of Jim’s death filled him with a sense of adult responsibility and increased involvement in his own life. **Formerly, he had always been _playing_ at life to some extent, like a child. Now it was time to really live it as a man, to be _less impressed_ with himself and _more involved_ in his future.**

Four days after Jim’s wake, Matthew returned to finish his work on _Dazed and Confused_. When he got there, Linklater gave him some dialogue in a scene where Wooderson wasn’t originally supposed to speak. Wooderson’s advice to another character in that scene to just “keep livin.” was Matthew’s own creation. He based it on what he told Linklater before shooting: that he felt he could keep Jim McConaughey’s spirit alive forever by living as Jim had taught his sons to do.

### Off to Hollywood (and Europe)

After graduating, Matthew earned $4,000 in Austin for playing the lead villain in _Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation_. Then he drove 24 hours to Hollywood with a loaded U-Haul, having arranged to stay at producer Don Phillips’s house for a while. When he arrived, Phillips refused at first to let him in, telling Matthew through the closed door that he would see him later. Matthew kept insisting, and finally Phillips opened the door naked with an erection and said to please give him 20 minutes.

While Matthew was living with Don, he lost a planned job as a production assistant on the Coen Brothers film _The Hudsucker Proxy_. When Matthew asked Phillips to get him a meeting with an agent because he really needed money, Phillips told him that with that kind of attitude, he ought to leave Hollywood for a while because the movie business would chew up and spit out a needy person.

Matthew decided to put Don’s advice in action. In short order, he left town and flew to Europe with two friends from _Dazed and Confused_ , Cole Hauser and Rory Cochrane. After convincing a motorcycle shop owner named Johan In Rosenheim, Germany, to rent them three bikes for a month for just $1,200 (all they could afford), they rode through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, taking a grand tour and enjoying life. Afterward, Matthew headed back to America with new friends, new stories to tell, and a head newly cleared of the neediness that Don Phillips had warned him about.**The trip was a greenlight.**
