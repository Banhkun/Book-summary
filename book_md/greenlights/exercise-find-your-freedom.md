## Exercise: Find Your Freedom

Matthew learned a hard lesson about the importance of balancing freedom with preparation. This exercise will help you to learn more about the balance of these intertwined principles in your own life.

* * *

Some people place too much emphasis on preparation and control. Others place too much emphasis on freedom and spontaneity. Which one are you?

Whichever way you answered the first question, describe a situation where your innate tendency caused you a problem. Maybe it was a missed opportunity or a botched performance. How did insisting on too much control, or too much spontaneity, end up hurting you?

Whichever side of this divide you fall on, why do you think that’s your comfort zone? What is it about the other approach that seems foreign or frightening to you?

What would it look like for you to achieve a better balance between your comfort zone and its opposite? What’s one specific action that you could take this week to begin building that better balance?
