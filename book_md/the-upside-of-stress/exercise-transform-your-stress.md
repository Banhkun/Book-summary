## Exercise: Transform Your Stress

In _The Upside to Stress,_ Kelly McGonigal argues that to benefit from stress, you need to change your mindset about it.

* * *

Think of a time when you were very stressed. What was the situation? Did you feel like you could handle it? What was your response?

Reflect on your mindset at the time. What resources could you have drawn on to build confidence at that moment—for instance, supportive loved ones, or a memory of when you handled a similar situation well?

Did you ask for or receive any support? Write about two ways you could’ve connected with people to better cope with the situation. As you write your answer, consider McGonigal’s advice on how to invoke a tend-and-befriend response: Focus on helping others, aim for a common good (a goal you share with your family, friends, or community), and normalize stress (recognize other people are dealing with similar issues and be open about your experience).

Now, think about your highest values. These might be a loved one, your family, or a goal you have. Write about how the stressful experience you’re thinking of relates to one of your most important values. For example, if you were stressed because of something involving your job, think about how enduring the stress of your job ultimately supports your family or helps you save money for a trip that’s meaningful to you.

Finally, write about at least one way this stressful experience has led to personal growth. If you can’t think of any ways you’ve grown from the experience, imagine how you might grow from it in the future.
