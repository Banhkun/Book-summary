## 1-Page Summary

In _Where Good Ideas Come From_ , Steven Johnson explains that good ideas and novel innovations are largely the result of social collaboration. For an idea to be good, it must be built upon accumulated knowledge and be put forward at a time when users can conceive of how to use the idea and when the needed resources for the idea are available. Ideas can result from a combination of underlying unfinished ideas fed over time, sudden inspiration, mistakes, and the practice of using other innovations for purposes distinct from their original functions.

Steven Johnson is a best-selling author and theorist who frequently contributes to outlets like _The New York Times_ and _The Wall Street Journal_. His other works include _Everything Bad is Good for You_ , _Future Perfect_ , and _Enemy of All Mankind_.

In our guide, we’ll examine how good ideas build on previous ones and combine via networking. We’ll also explore how good ideas can be cultivated over time, how they can suddenly be realized through insights, how mistakes lead to new ways of thinking, and how changing the way we use a previous idea or innovation can create a new innovation. Finally we’ll look at how capitalism affects the development of ideas and innovations. We’ll also compare Johnson’s ideas with similar ideas from other authors, contextualize them in scientific and business fields, and add tips for putting Johnson’s recommendations into practice.

### How Ideas Develop

According to Johnson, good ideas don’t emerge miraculously from nothing. Instead, they build on existing knowledge and ideas. If every writer had to create their own writing system, or if every app developer had to reinvent the internet, we wouldn’t be able to progress as a society and would be stuck with only the most basic ideas. **The more we innovate and create, the more we draw on established knowledge to innovate further, enabling us to come up with increasingly advanced ideas**.

(Shortform note: In _The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking_ , Edward Burger and Michael Starbird expand on this idea and suggest that studying how an idea has developed over time can help you come up with new ideas. Doing this gives you a better understanding of the idea’s underlying concepts and also leads you to consider innovations for an idea even after it seems to be completed.)

These previous ideas provide platforms of knowledge on which to build. Platforms can be physical—such as a piece of technology like a steam engine or a computer—or conceptual—such as the ideas and knowledge that allowed us to create such technologies. Platforms not only prop up new ideas, but they also provide parameters, or, in the case of the arts, genres. It’s necessary to understand these parameters in order to bend or break them, which allows for greater insight and innovation.

For example, someone writing a book uses a number of different platforms that developed over millennia: the language they’re writing in, the tool they’re using to write (such as a computer or pen and paper), and any previously written works that are informing their current work. That writer may then choose to take parameters from various genres—such as children’s literature, romance, and coming-of-age stories—to create a new genre like young adult literature.

(Shortform note: Consumer needs can also act as a platform for new ideas. Noticing something that consumers need—even if the consumers don’t know they need it—can provide parameters for the development of a new idea, such as its desired function and the context in which it will be used. Experts recommend using empathic design to identify what a consumer needs, which involves observing someone as they use a current product and noticing what could be made easier or better. They suggest that observation works better than methods like surveys because consumers often develop work-arounds for design insufficiencies without even noticing.)

Combining or shifting across platforms of knowledge can open up further opportunities for discovery. Johnson gives the example of how scientists figured out Darwin’s Paradox. This paradox was Charles Darwin’s observation that a massive biological system like a coral reef could exist in an ecosystem with very little nutrition and resources. The question of how such a system could exist was solved when scientists from multiple fields, including biology, chemistry, systems, and more, combined their knowledge to discover that a number of different biological platforms work together to recycle resources and nutrients that keep the system alive. This combination of sciences led to a new field called ecosystems ecology.

(Shortform note: Combining platforms in the way Johnson describes is a type of transdisciplinary thinking. This is an extension of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. Multidisciplinarity refers to approaching a single topic from a variety of perspectives, each of which adds its own distinct understanding or analysis to the topic. Interdisciplinarity also involves multiple perspectives, but instead of viewing them separately, they’re treated as interrelated. Transdisciplinarity connects the disciplines even further, breaking down the boundaries between them to form a cohesive whole—such as a new field of science or a new genre of media.)

Johnson points out two other hallmarks of the most successful ideas: They proliferate in networks and emerge in the “adjacent possible.” We’ll look at both hallmarks next.

#### Developing Ideas That Are Within Reach

Platforms of knowledge also shape the realm of the _adjacent possible_. The adjacent possible is a theory developed by Stuart Kauffman that refers to the realm of new ideas that are within reach based on society’s current available information, resources, and abilities. While good ideas can come from outside the adjacent possible, all _successfully implemented_ ideas come from within it.

**Ideas developed in the adjacent possible are understandable and achievable at the time they’re created**. Those that are developed outside the adjacent possible may be great ideas, but a lack of knowledge or resources makes them unachievable at the time they’re created. Such ideas fail but may be developed later when the needed resources become available.

(Shortform note: Kauffman developed his theory of the adjacent possible specifically in reference to evolutionary biology, while Steven Johnson is noted for applying the theory to innovation and idea generation. Kauffman also added that the number of possibilities in the adjacent possible increases exponentially with each new development, as each of those developments comes with a huge range of possible further developments that continue to build on each other and create a massive web of potential.)

To explain the adjacent possible, Johnson discusses the work of the inventor Charles Babbage. In the 1830s, Babbage developed the idea for what would have been the first ever programmable computer. Because of the resources and knowledge available to him, the computer would have been made entirely of mechanical parts and would have been incredibly slow if he had managed to build it. The idea failed because it was outside the realm of the adjacent possible, but a century later, our cumulative knowledge and resources had widened the adjacent possible to encompass this invention, and modern computers were then developed using the same basic blueprints that Babbage had created.

(Shortform note: In a TED Talk, Johnson adds further context to Babbage’s invention and the platforms that led to it and argues that invention often comes not from necessity but from a sense of playfulness. He explains that the origins of the programmable computer can be traced back to the invention of the flute thousands of years ago. This invention that created sound by blowing air through a tube led to the organ, which used a keyboard to produce such sounds and, hundreds of years later, was adapted into the keyboard of a typewriter. The organ also led to the invention of the music box, which was programmable in the same way Babbage’s computer was—you could swap out the box’s cylinder with the musical “code” on it to make it play a new song.)

The idea of the adjacent possible helps explain the phenomenon of “the multiple.” This is a historical trend in which the same novel idea is discovered by multiple people working independently of each other. For example, two separate inventors, Dean Von Kleist and Cuneus of Leyden, both invented the electrical battery separately within one year of each other in the mid-1700s. If different people are working from the same knowledge base, then the realm of possibilities for their work will be similar, even if they aren’t working together, because they’re all limited to the base knowledge’s adjacent possible.

> **Alternative Theories to “The Multiple” and the Invention of the Battery**
> 
> The multiple stands in contrast to the heroic theory of invention discovery, which is the belief that new ideas and innovations are the result of moments of brilliance by heroic figures acting in isolation. This theory discounts the existence of platforms and the adjacent possible in favor of the exaltation of specific inventors, but historical evidence more strongly supports the theory of the multiple.
> 
> However, Johnson's assertion that Dean Von Kleist (who is more commonly referred to as E. Georg von Kleist) and Cuneus of Leyden (who, in turn, is more often known as Pieter van Musschenbroek) invented the battery isn't quite accurate: They invented what's now called the Leyden jar, which is a _precursor_ to the battery. Still, the fact that the Leyden jar was later used by Benjamin Franklin in his famous kite experiment and by Alessandro Volta, who is commonly credited with building the first battery, reinforces Johnson's argument that all innovations build on previous knowledge.

#### Networking to Create Better Ideas

According to Johnson, **having _networks_ of ideas that build and connect with each other is also essential to coming up with good ideas**. Networks can take many different forms, including physical communities, online spaces, or anything that facilitates collaboration between people. They can even include the networks that comprise our own brains. Johnson suggests that the more people that are involved in a network, the more effective they’ll be at spawning and promoting ideas.

(Shortform note: The professional world has long recognized the benefits of networks in innovation, but some experts suggest that more people in a network doesn’t automatically mean greater productivity, as not everyone participates equally. Often, a very small number of people end up being responsible for a disproportionate amount of the work, which can lead to numerous problems including collaborative overload—when collaboration becomes so draining that it begins to reduce productivity. Experts recommend that, instead of pushing employees to collaborate as much as possible, employers should consider employees’ personal reserves of time and energy and only encourage a manageable amount of collaboration.)

One of the most important networks Johnson discusses is the city. He points out that in the age of the hunter-gatherer, we remained in small groups that rarely met or collaborated with each other. In these environments, even if some lone individual had a great idea, it was rarely shared widely or improved upon by others since people had no means of record-keeping. After the development of agriculture, we began to gather in large groups, forming communities that grew into cities. These cities led to a great confluence of different thoughts and perspectives, and importantly, the storing and recording of ideas through common knowledge or written language.

(Shortform note: The other benefit of agriculture and the communal living it enabled is that only some people had to be involved in food production, as opposed to the hunter-gatherer era when all members of a group had to work together to find food. The more people gathered in agricultural communities, the more people had free time to work on other things. So not only do networks help in the sharing of ideas, but they also allow people to delegate labor so that some people can keep the community alive while others create innovations. This same principle is reflected in modern workplaces when jobs are specialized to certain tasks within an organization.)

In recent years, the internet has proven to be an effective tool for networking ideas, as well. The internet provides immediate access to vast amounts of information and, unlike city networking, it can be accessed no matter where you are geographically.

(Shortform note: The internet was especially crucial during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many companies experienced a shift to a work-from-home structure, which inhibited in-person collaboration. Collaboration tools like Google Docs, Zoom, and Slack helped facilitate remote teamwork and allowed networks to continue to flourish in the workplace.)

We rely on networks between people, but we also rely on networks within our brains. The brain consists of a hundred billion neurons with 100 trillion connections between them. Like a network of people, the power of these neural networks comes from the connections rather than the individual neurons. These connections and their ability to change and form new patterns—an ability known as plasticity—is the key to the mind’s ability to learn and grow.

(Shortform note: While neural connections create networks with massive cognitive potential, not all connections are equally useful. Research suggests that the strongest neural connections are the ones between neurons that are already similar in function or are in close proximity to each other—sort of like how we are more likely to connect with people who are like us or near us. However, the brain’s large number of weaker neural connections plays an important part in brain plasticity, since they allow the brain to adapt much more quickly to new input than if it had to create new connections from scratch.)

Now that you understand how ideas form, you can apply that understanding to better harness the upcoming forms of ideation. We’ll now look at some of the processes that go into the formation of good ideas, including the development of unfinished ideas over long periods of time, sudden insights, mistakes, and exaptation.

### Developing Ideas Over Time

Most ideas take a long time to develop and require a lot of patience. They begin as suspicions, hunches, or ideas that aren’t yet complete, and often, they need to be combined with other people’s unfinished ideas to take shape—which is part of why networks are so important. Ideas like this can brew for years or decades before they find the other ideas that complete them and push them into the realm of the adjacent possible.

(Shortform note: It’s easy to get impatient or frustrated when you have an incomplete idea brewing that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. This can lead you to fall prey to the _creative cliff illusion_ —the misconception that most of your good ideas happen early and that, once they stop flowing quickly, you’re “out” of ideas. This can lead you to give up too soon and abandon ideas that aren’t quite complete. Research suggests that the greatest number of our good ideas occur near the end of any given period of idea generation, suggesting that patience and perseverance are essential in the cultivation of ideas.)

Johnson distinguishes these unfinished ideas from gut instincts. While both can act as underlying ideas that lead to something greater, gut instincts are immediate and fast. Unfinished ideas or hunches begin with an inexpressible suspicion that there is something greater at play in a situation or problem you’re considering, and they don’t lend themselves to quick decisions like gut instincts do. Instead, they remain in the back of your mind for long periods of time, slowly connecting to new things you’re learning and eventually coalescing into a whole idea that’s greater than the sum of its parts.

(Shortform note: Other experts make less of a clear distinction between hunches and gut instincts, suggesting that gut instincts may actually be responsible for the “inexpressible suspicion” that Johnson says sparks a half-formed idea. They propose that gut instincts are vital for making judgments and decisions, both of which are necessary aspects of the development and refinement of unfinished ideas. However, some experts caution against relying too much on gut instinct to make decisions, as it can cause us to fall back on hidden biases and limited ideas.)

It’s easy to lose track of these long-term partial ideas. They can be nebulous and ill-defined, which makes them easy to forget. To keep track of these ideas, Johnson recommends that you record every one that you have.

(Shortform note: Recording every idea you have immediately is not always feasible, especially considering our greatest moments of inspiration often occur when we are engaged in activities like showering. To remember these insights, you can take steps to improve your memory such as getting exercise and good sleep or using mnemonic devices. If you’ve already forgotten an idea, you can try retracing the thought process that led you to it or even physically retrace your footsteps to trigger your memory of the idea.)

#### Making Workplaces Conducive to Idea Formation

Johnson also notes that people who bring ideas like this to fruition are often able to develop them as part of their careers. For example, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, spent his life—starting in childhood—cultivating the idea for this invention. Part of the reason he was able to develop it fully is because the Swiss lab he worked for, CERN, allowed him to use work time to develop it.

(Shortform note: Berners-Lee recognizes the importance of having the time, resources, and previous knowledge available to create his groundbreaking innovation, and today he works with the World Wide Web Foundation to help provide others with these resources by making access to the web a basic right. This idea of open access to information was the foundation of his invention and continues to guide his work.)

To encourage this type of innovation, companies like Google deliberately set aside certain percentages of their employees' work time (20%, specifically) for them to pursue ideas that interest them outside of their specific roles at the company. While most of the ideas developed during this time are never used by the companies, **they often lead to highly profitable innovations**. In Google’s case, their tools AdSense and Gmail both came from ideas developed during this designated time, and the company’s vice president of Search Products and User Experience has said that ideas created during this designated time account for more than half of the company’s new products.

> **What Really Gets Done During “Innovation Time”?**
> 
> Some Google employees have suggested that the 20% time practice actually leads them to perform 120% of their normal work because they’re still expected to accomplish their full workload in the time they’re not spending on innovative ideas. Critics have also suggested the company may no longer be using the practice (though the company says it is) since, as of 2020, there hadn’t been any notable new products developed since 2014.
> 
> Still, experts recommend “innovation time” as an effective innovation strategy. Businesses would have to be willing to accept a potential reduction in overall productivity, but since research suggests that the average worker is only productive for about three hours per day anyway, they might find that the same amount of work is still getting done and employees are using time to innovate that they would have otherwise spent browsing the internet or on social media.

### Creating Ideas From Sudden Insights

**Sometimes ideas can click suddenly into place as a result of inspiration or insight** , writes Johnson.**** Rather than coming together purely from steady, incremental development, an idea that you’re mulling over can be spontaneously completed by an epiphany.

(Shortform note: The feeling of having an idea click into place from an epiphany can be extremely satisfying and often causes people to feel grateful for the insight. Experts recommend practicing introspection and opening your mind up to personal change in order to prompt more epiphanies.)

Johnson explains how the brain goes through periods of neural synchronization—called neural phase locking—that alternate with periods of chaos. During neural phase lock, the brain’s neural networks are firing simultaneously at the same frequency. In contrast, there are other periods where all the neurons are firing completely out of sync with each other. During these periods of chaos, scientists believe the brain is making links and associations that it wouldn’t normally make, resulting in new ideas and connections. Research into neural phase locking in children showed that individuals varied in the amount of time their brains spent in each phase and that longer periods in the chaotic phase correlated with higher IQs.

(Shortform note: Phase-locking and its effects on the brain are not fully understood, but research suggests that it facilitates greater communication between brain areas, which can make it easier to “train” your brain. While the chaotic states outside of neural phase-locking are greatly conducive to creativity, phase-locking may enable you to focus and learn more easily. Some scientists are working to create music that can induce a state of neural phase-locking, which they believe will help people focus and may one day replace medication for conditions such as ADHD.)

The brain also makes new links and connections when dreaming or daydreaming. Dream states are also states of neural chaos, where the brain triggers memories and thoughts at random that cause us to dream—and sometimes result in moments of brilliance. Johnson explains, for example, that German scientist August Kekulé had a sudden insight during a daydream that enabled him to understand the structure of the benzene molecule.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that dreaming and daydreaming facilitate creative thinking by activating the brain’s default network. This is a group of neural structures that activate when you’re resting or doing a passive activity. However, while there is substantial evidence to suggest that the activation of this network produces a creative state, a causal link has not yet been proven, and there is scientific debate about what parts of the brain constitute the default network and what causes them to activate. Additionally, some historians believe that Kekulé didn’t discover this insight while daydreaming but rather stole the idea from two other scientists who were studying the concept.)

#### Collaborating With Technology

Additionally, Johnson suggests that **technology can help us make sudden insights**. He describes an indexing software that he uses called DEVONthink that helps him catalog information and search for it with an algorithm that detects not only verbatim search terms but also terms related to what he’s searching (like returning results including the word “waste” when he searches for the word “sewage”). He describes how this tool has given him insights that he doesn’t think he could have achieved otherwise and suggests that these insights weren’t solely his own but were instead the result of collaboration between two intelligences: his own, and the software’s artificial intelligence.

(Shortform note: The continued advancement of artificial intelligence technology is further enhancing the technological collaboration that Johnson describes. Employers are encouraging workers to use artificial intelligence to not only access information but to use its suggestions for possible ways to apply that information. Additionally, while human intelligence continues to be the best source of creativity, artificial intelligence technology is also beginning to gain what some call “artificial imagination,” as AIs are being created that can generate unique images and text based on human input. Some have even suggested that we should begin crediting computers as inventors when they contribute to patentable innovations.)

Google can provide a similar collaborative search function to DEVONthink but with the added benefit of being able to draw from the entirety of the internet’s information. Johnson points to criticism of internet search engines by writers who suggest that it has ended the practice of going to the library, browsing the shelves, and pulling out books that interest you at a glance. However, Johnson points out that this wasn’t a practice that everyone—or even most people—made a habit of. While their searches are now curated by internet filters—which he says are actually beneficial since they block out all the irrelevant search results—more people are searching the internet than ever browsed libraries in the way these critics lament.

(Shortform note: In browsing a library, your interests and curiosities act as search result filters, but with internet searches, filters aren’t the only aspect of search engines that help curate your results. While a filter merely blocks out results that don’t fit your search criteria, search engine algorithms use a huge number of criteria to specifically seek out results that match not only your query, but also relate to other criteria including your search history, the reliability or authority of a site, and site traffic. However, some results may be boosted over others based on less relevant criteria—for instance, YouTube is given priority in Google searches over other results, which may be because YouTube is owned by Google.)

#### Cultivating Sudden Insights

To put yourself in a state that promotes sudden insights, Johnson recommends taking a walk or a bath. These activities take your mind off of your daily tasks and put you in a more associative state, letting your unconscious mind make those important connections.

(Shortform note: The phenomenon of getting sudden insights during activities like baths or walks is known as the shower principle. However, some experts caution against giving too much credence to ideas generated during these activities, suggesting that they can be so exciting you may overlook practical limitations and fail to realize they’re unfeasible or unachievable.)

Another way to open yourself up to sudden insights is to take in as much new information as you can through reading or other means. Johnson notes that a flaw in this process is that it’s easy to forget what you’ve learned from these sources if you’re only taking in a little bit of information each day. He points out that people like Bill Gates take annual reading vacations, where they take a week or more to deep dive into books they’ve added to their reading list, allowing them to absorb and process all the new information in a concentrated period of time. Johnson suggests that it may benefit workplaces to allot time for such vacations since they can be so beneficial in creating new ideas.

(Shortform note: Reading vacations may be especially productive if you’re reading physical books rather than doing research on the internet. Experts suggest that we’re often much more distracted when reading online because of the prevalence of hyperlinks in text, which causes a break in our concentration as we decide whether or not to click the link. There are also other issues like frequently pausing our reading to check email or attend to some other task. Setting aside large chunks of time to just take in information from physical books can greatly enhance your concentration and retention.)

### Forming Ideas by Making Mistakes

Johnson argues that **mistakes can lead to better ideas and greater innovations**. Many inventions throughout history have been the result of mistakes, including penicillin, the daguerreotype, and the pacemaker. He suggests that making mistakes and then exploring _why_ those mistakes happened makes people smarter. Mistakes open us up to new ways of thinking and prompt us to explore additional ideas in the adjacent possible.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that you learn more from mistakes if you believe you can learn from your mistakes, as opposed to believing that your intelligence is fixed and that mistakes are a personal failing. This suggests that learning from mistakes has more to do with your mindset and openness to exploring what went wrong than the simple act of making the mistake itself.)

Johnson also describes a study carried out by Berkeley professor Charlan Nemeth that showed that mistakes in group settings (or networks) cause people to think more flexibly. In the study, a group of participants was shown a series of colors on different slides and asked to list some words they associate with those colors. The vast majority of the associations were predictable, like associating green with “grass.” However, in subsequent studies, actors were added to the group who deliberately identified the colors incorrectly, like saying they saw a blue slide as green. The actual participants then began making much more creative associations, suggesting that adding inaccurate information to the group’s pool of knowledge led to greater creativity. Further studies showed similar results in settings like mock juries.

(Shortform note: While these studies may suggest that it’s beneficial to have someone deliberately play “devil’s advocate” in groups that are coming up with ideas or making decisions, Nemeth has added in her other work that the devil’s advocate—someone who agrees with the majority position but is deliberately drawing attention to alternative arguments—is not as effective at prompting different types of thinking as someone who genuinely believes in the minority position. In fact, Nemeth’s research suggests that the devil’s advocate position can actually reinforce the majority position rather than eliciting dissent.)

Johnson notes that even evolution makes use of errors to improve a species. Mutations, which are essentially errors in DNA, create changes in an organism, and if those changes are beneficial to its survival, they’re passed down to its offspring. The majority of mutations are either neutral or harmful, but some push a species into a new realm of the adjacent possible, which is how we went from single-cell organisms billions of years ago to the vast array of diverse species we have today.

(Shortform note: Mutations, like human discoveries, also seem to develop by means of “the multiple,” as research shows that different mutations can lead to the development of the same beneficial trait. In other words, the same features in the adjacent possible can be achieved from different combinations of mutations. Scientists think these “multiple” mutations may be more likely to persist through generations because traits that result from a specific, complex mutation are less likely to occur in different organisms—and thus less likely to be passed down to more offspring—than traits that can result from different combinations of mutations.)

Johnson suggests that organizations that seek to eliminate error are closing themselves off to greater ideas in the adjacent possible. He says that, while the goal shouldn’t be to make mistakes, they should be embraced and allowed to happen. Only then can we truly understand and learn from them.

(Shortform note: In _The Five Elements of Effective Thinking_ , Burger and Starbird go a step further and recommend making mistakes on purpose in order to prompt deeper thinking and exploration of an idea. They note that beating yourself up over a mistake or discouraging yourself or others from making mistakes is unproductive and that you should in fact reward people for mistakes because it shows learning and creativity. They recommend making leaps in logic you know are incorrect and following that idea through to its conclusion to see what other ideas it opens up.)

### Innovating Ideas Through Exaptations

Johnson also describes how **exaptations—using a tool or trait in a context that’s different from the one it was originally intended for—can lead to innovation**. Exaptation is a term from evolutionary biology for when a trait that evolved for one purpose changes function and is used for another purpose. Johnson gives the example of how feathers initially evolved to keep animals warm, but when they began flying, feathers turned out to be a perfect tool to facilitate gliding through the air.

(Shortform note: Some scientists question whether exaptation is actually distinct from adaptation, suggesting that if you trace any given evolutionary trait back far enough, you’ll find that it developed from the coopting of a structure for a function different from its original function. This would make the distinction between adaptation and exaptation arbitrary and irrelevant. Others note that it’s a term that’s not frequently used in scientific literature, possibly because of its unclear definition. They say, however, that it has become more frequently used in fields like the history of technology and innovation studies because of humans’ tendency to consciously apply one idea to different contexts.)

Exaptation plays a large role in media and art. Taking a narrative device like stream-of-consciousness writing and adapting it for film changes its function and creates a new innovation in cinematic storytelling.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that the development of art itself was a type of evolutionary exaptation of communication. They note that humans have an innate drive to use symbols to communicate with each other and that the neural networks that developed for this purpose exapted over time to allow us to create and appreciate art.)

Johnson explains that networks such as cities are hotbeds of exaptation because they help connect people with different ideas and cultures. When these differences collide, they lead to greater innovation and more creative ideas. Coffeehouses are an example of exaptation of a physical space in society because, while they were originally created as businesses to sell food and drink, they were quickly exapted into spaces where people could meet and share ideas on a larger and more diverse scale than is possible in the home or workplace.

(Shortform note: The convergence of different cultures is one of the most important benefits of exaptational hubs like cities and coffeehouses. However, some experts suggest that this mixing of cultures can lead to a quashing of good ideas when people clash over cultural differences. Studies show that people who view themselves as open-minded are more prone to this type of ideological shutdown. Participants in these hotbeds should take care not to be overly critical of others with different ideas to avoid the risk of shutting themselves off to these exaptations.)

### Capitalism’s Effect on Ideas and Innovation

According to Johnson, good ideas come largely from social interaction and the sharing of knowledge through networks. He points out that, especially in the modern world, **there are limits to information sharing, particularly when there is a financial incentive to keep information secret** through things like copyright, patents, and intellectual property laws. The competitive nature of capitalism encourages companies to keep their innovations under wraps so that other companies can’t take those same innovations and use them for their own benefit. Johnson suggests that this tendency may limit our innovative ability as a society.

Johnson looks at innovations throughout history and categorizes them based on whether they were market-driven or non-market-driven, and also whether they were created by an individual or by a network of people. Based on his assessment of hundreds of major inventions and innovations throughout history, he sees a shift over time: during the Renaissance, most innovations were non-market-driven and developed by an individual. This trend gradually shifted and today, most ideas are still non-market-driven but are developed by networks. He suggests that this contradicts the capitalist principle that competition and profit motive are the primary drivers of innovation.

He doesn’t use these conclusions to call for a different economic system but instead suggests that we should shift our society toward a more open system of sharing ideas and information, one similar to the way universities and research institutions work—as opposed to corporate R&D labs.

> **Do We Need a New Business Model for Innovation?**
> 
> Some companies, such as Nathan Myhrvold’s company Intellectual Ventures, are working to incentivize innovation by turning it into its own profession—the reverse of Johnson’s suggestion to direct innovation away from the market. They argue that if we turn invention into a kind of capital that private-sector investors fund, it will allow inventors to create things based on what would be useful and economically valuable rather than basing innovation on what government or research organizations are willing to fund.
> 
> They also suggest that such a model would eliminate the competition between individual patent-holders and corporations and instead would turn them into collaborators. Furthermore, private investors would compete with each other to fund the most useful and valuable ideas that would provide the highest return on their investments.
