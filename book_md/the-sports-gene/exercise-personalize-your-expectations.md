## Exercise: Personalize Your Expectations

As we have seen, people respond differently to identical training plans. We might work hard at something and still not get the results we want, or, we might be pleasantly surprised by our bodyâ€™s response to training.

* * *

Has there been a time when you trained or practiced for something and were surprised by your results? Compare your expectations to your results.

In the above instance, how did you structure your expectations? (Did you create your goal by comparing yourself to other people on a similar training plan? Did you create your goal based on your past performance and experience?)

Given the above discussion of genes and response to training, does the experience you described above give you any insight into your natural strengths or challenges?

What are some ways that you benefited from your training that were not related to your initial goals?

How can you use this insight in setting future goals?
