## Part 8: Sex and Performance

All of the genes discussed so far can have an impact on an athlete’s success. But Epstein argues that no single gene has as much of an impact on an athlete's performance as the SRY gene found on the Y chromosome. He even goes so far as to say that, **should there be a single gene to be labeled “ _the_ sports gene,” it would be the SRY gene**. We will look at his argument for why next.

**Epstein cites differences in athletic performance between men and women as a decisive testament to the power of genes in sports.** Differences in performance between men and women are well documented, largely predictable, and can, at least in part, be traced to the SRY gene. In this section we will:

  * Look at some of the physiological differences between men and women 
  * Discuss why these differences exist 
  * Present evidence that a binary view of the sexes does not encompass the full range of physiologic diversity among athletes 



### Differences at the Elite Level

**Until very recently, women’s records in running events were gaining rapidly on men's, and Epstein notes that it looked to some like male/female differences in running performance might disappear.** He discusses a 2002 article in the science journal _Nature,_ and another in 2005 from the _British Journal of Sports Medicine_ proposing that women would soon close the performance gap in running events. This was a logical projection based on side-by-side comparisons of men’s and women’s records. Women’s world records were getting faster at a much greater rate than men’s. If the rates were assumed to be relatively constant, then female runners would eventually catch up to and surpass men.

Looking at running data alone, however, does not tell the whole story.**** Epstein explains that **cultural factors can likely account for a great deal of the steep improvement in women’s performance.** Men and women did not even have the same track and field events until 2008, and historically women have certainly not been given the same training opportunities as men. After the surge of the last few decades, **women’s running records today have hardly advanced at all, while men’s are still advancing slowly.**(Another factor that may account for some of the women’s records in sprint and power events from the 1980s was the illegal use of testosterone (steroids) in female athletes from Eastern Bloc countries during that time period).

The reality is that many female world record holders would not even qualify to compete in the same Olympic events against men. And some of the top female athletes in their sport can be bested by high school boys. Statistically, those women, of whom there are many, who can outperform the average man in sports are the exception. Epstein cites **innate physiological differences between men and women as the reason women are unlikely to surpass men in most sports.** We will look at some of these differences next.

> **Women Best Men in Other Measures of Strength**
> 
> Research has shown that from birth to death, women are ‘tougher’ than men in ways that science has yet to explain. Even at birth female babies have higher survival rates than males. As adults, women better survive 12 of the 15 leading causes of death and are older than men at the onset of common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Women also survive longer than men. In 2017, 42 out of 43 supercentenarians (people who live past 110) were women. Women also survive infections better than men.
> 
> Evolution may explain much of this toughness. Epstein suggests that our female evolutionary ancestors were not as likely as men to participate in the most physically demanding or intense aspects of society. But this may not be true. As we learn more about ancient humans, anthropologists are discovering that the notion of women tending to the home while men hunted, gathered, and traveled long distances is flawed. It appears that women not only hunted and worked alongside men, but they had to do so while pregnant, nursing, and physically carrying young children. In this more modern vision of our female ancestors, it makes sense that natural selection would have developed an extra level of ‘toughness’ in women.

### Differences Explained by Physiology

In general, men throw harder, run faster, and jump higher than women.

(Shortform note: This is not to suggest that if you were to line up a man and a woman the man would always outperform the woman. These differences occur on the level of a population and are based on statistical averages.)

  * On average men are three standard deviations more powerful than women when it comes to throwing ability. Epstein notes that **if a population were sampled at random, 998 men out of 1,000 would be able to throw harder than the average woman.**



Epstein concedes that cultural expectations and stereotypes may account for some of the difference in throwing ability, but in aboriginal populations where both sexes grow up throwing for hunting and combat, researchers found that boys were still able to out-throw girls. Additionally, 87% of boys were better than girls at tracking and catching flying objects.

  * As additional evidence that culture alone cannot explain throwing differences, girls who have a condition that results in extra testosterone during fetal development end up throwing more like boys. 



**Across running events, men are about 11% faster than women.** And, on average, men are able to jump 19% farther than women in the long jump. Differences between male and female physiology largely explain these differences.

  * Men are taller and heavier than women 
  * Men have relatively longer arms and legs
  * Men have bigger hearts and bigger lungs
  * Men have denser bones which can support more muscle
  * Men have more narrow hips, which makes running more efficient. (Shortform note: This is a contentious topic and research does not give a definitive answer about whether energy is indeed lost in runners with wider hips.)
  * On average **men have 80% more muscle in their upper body and 50% more muscle in their legs** than women. 



> **Swimming: The Smallest Performance Gap**
> 
> Epstein notes that the smallest gap in Olympic events between men and women is in distance swimming events, with women coming within 6% of men in the 800m swim. In long open water swims, the gap between women closes and even reverses. Studies of finishing times from the English Channel, Catalina Channel, and Marathon Island Swim over several years found that women were as fast as, and more often faster, than men in these events.
> 
> One possible reason for these findings is that women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men, and they are better able to utilize that fat as a fuel source over long distances. More body fat can also mean more buoyancy for women in the water, as well as more insulation during cold open water swims.
> 
> The same trend seems to hold in ultra-running. An article in _The New York Times_ discusses how in extremely long races, male physiological advantages become less relevant. In ultramarathons, in which athletes run up to 200 miles over multiple days, it seems that mental toughness and psychological fortitude allows women to run alongside and even beat their male counterparts. The article highlights Courtney Dauwalter, who has become a celebrity in this sports niche and frequently bests the entire field of male athletes.

### Differences Explained by Evolution

The differences between men and women have their roots in our species’ evolution. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species. **This means that males and females of the same species display different characteristics.** Epstein notes that the difference in strength between men and women is similar to the difference in strength between male and female gorillas. While we may think of ourselves as ‘more evolved’ than our primate ancestors, it has not been very long since our species’ behavior looked very similar to the behavior we see in wild animals.

In our very recent evolutionary past, men were violently competing against each other to earn the ‘rights’ to women. **Males that were stronger and better able to physically fight off other males had more access to breeding opportunities.** Anthropology tells us that in hunter-gatherer societies, 30% of men were killed by other men. There is also evidence that we have fewer male ancestors than female ancestors. As Epstein explains, this suggests that the most physically imposing men were able to establish dominance and ‘claim the rights’ to multiple women.

> **Sports as a Platform for Male vs. Male Competition**
> 
> As Epstein discusses, it was not long ago in evolutionary terms that our male ancestors engaged in hand-to-hand combat and violent competition (both one-on-one and with a tribe) on a regular basis. While outright violence may be less prevalent, and at least less socially acceptable, in modern culture, some researchers suggest that organized sports offers an outlet for men to express an innate proclivity for physical competition.
> 
> The authors of a three-part study on male and female participation in organized sports highlight three theories for why sports (with particular emphasis on team sports and sports where skills can be seen as combat-related) may hold special appeal for men.
> 
>   * Sports serve as a modern counterpart to courtship rituals in nature and offer men a way to display their physical attributes.
> 
>   * Sports allow men to compete for social status in a safer and more controlled way than outright combat.
> 
>   * Sports serve as a way for men to “train” for physical activities such as hunting and combat (in modern society the need to use this training may never arise, but the innate desire to train may still be present.)
> 
> 

> 
> The authors found a difference in participation rates between men and women in organized sports, and team sports in particular, with men choosing to participate more than women. They note that these findings should be viewed in the context of other cultural factors such as male/female gender norms and the encouragement and access to sports that girls receive.
> 
> The above study’s findings are supported by another study of 50 societies around the world, that also found universally more male than female participation in sports. However, the cross-cultural study did find that the gender gap was smaller in non-patriarchal societies, supporting the idea that culture plays an important role.

### Differences Explained by the SRY Gene

Epstein explains that **the Sex Determining Region Y (SRY) gene accounts for most sexual variation between men and women. It is found on the Y chromosome**. (Most women have two X chromosomes, and most men have an X and a Y chromosome.) At six weeks gestation, the SRY gene causes the formation of testicles, which release the testosterone that produces male characteristics in developing fetuses.

(Shortform note: Testosterone is a steroid hormone that is produced in both men and women, although men generally have much higher levels. In men, the testes produce testosterone, and in women, it is produced in the ovaries. In men, testosterone regulates sperm production, sex drive, fat distribution, bone mass, muscle size, and red blood cell production. In women, testosterone impacts sex drive, muscle strength, and bone density.)

**Testosterone levels may be one of the most powerful factors in athletic performance.** Epstein explains that performance differences between boys and girls are almost non-existent in many sports before puberty. Once boys hit puberty their bodies produce extra testosterone and the athletic gap widens quickly. (This is one reason why it makes sense to have co-ed sports teams for young children). **Testosterone has such a defining impact on athletic performance that in 2012 the Olympic Committee decided that an athlete’s sex should be determined by how much testosterone their body is able to use.**

  * Women typically produce under 75 nanograms of testosterone per deciliter of blood, while men produce between 240 and 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. 
  * Anecdotes from runners who have transitioned from male to female add compelling evidence of the influence of testosterone levels on performance. A small sample of transitioning runners consistently shared that, while their running times have gotten slower, they have remained equally as competitive against women as they were against men. 
    * The NCAA mandates that a male athlete who transitions to female must wait for a year while her testosterone levels fall before she can resume competition as a woman.
  * One study of elite female athletes showed that across sports, the elite female athletes have twice as much testosterone in their blood as non-elite female athletes. 



> **Sex-Linked Traits**
> 
> Traits that are produced by genes found only on the X or Y chromosome are called sex-linked traits. Off the field, genes found on one chromosome or another can help explain why some diseases are more common in men than in women.
> 
> Women have a greater degree of protection from diseases known as X-linked recessive diseases. These diseases are caused by a recessive gene on the X chromosome. Since women have two X chromosomes they can have the recessive version of the gene on one chromosome and the dominant version on the other and be carriers of the disease. Since men only have one X chromosome, if they inherit a disease-causing version of a gene on their X chromosome, they will have the disease.
> 
> Sex-linked traits also explain why red-green color blindness is more common in men than in women. The gene that causes red-green color blindness is located on the X chromosome. Women can carry one “faulty” gene but still see color normally, but if a man inherits that single “faulty” gene, he will be color blind.

### Gender In Sports

**The biological distinction between male and female is not black and white.** Sports divide men’s and women’s events into two distinct categories for good reason, yet on the level of the individual athlete, **the distinction between the sexes is not so easy to define.** Epstein highlights a few scenarios:

There are some women who have an X and a Y chromosome, testes, and male levels of testosterone. Some of these women have androgen insensitivity. This means that, while they have male levels of testosterone in their bodies, they are not able to use it. In the general population, this happens in one out of 20,000 to 64,000 women. However, it is much more common in sports. From data taken over five Olympic games (the last time this data was collected was in 1996), one in 421 women had XY chromosomes and androgen insensitivity.

Epstein explains that**“XY androgen insensitive” women are overrepresented in sports due to their body type rather than testosterone**. Even though these women are unable to utilize the testosterone their bodies produce, their build is more “masculine” than that of other athletes. They are generally taller than most women, with longer arms and legs. For this same reason, it is likely that this genotype is also overrepresented in the modeling industry.

While women with XY chromosomes and androgen insensitivity cannot use any of the testosterone their bodies produce, another condition called partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency causes women to produce extra testosterone. This likely gives these women a significant advantage in sports. One study found that **elite female athletes across several sports had twice as much testosterone as non-elite female athletes.**

In yet another condition called De La Chapelle syndrome, people who have two X chromosomes (characteristic of women) develop as if they had an X and a Y chromosome (characteristic of men). This is because during recombination (the process in which chromosomes from our mothers and fathers “mix” their information), some of the genes from the father’s Y chromosome end up on an X chromosome.

> **Testosterone as a Basis for Discrimination**
> 
> An article questioning the efficacy and ethics of testing for hyperandrogenism (high levels of testosterone) in female athletes asserts that there is no evidence of high testosterone levels boosting female athletes’ performance. The authors go so far as to state that, in women, naturally occurring testosterone levels are “not related” to sports performance. Therefore, the authors assert, tests conducted at elite sporting events looking for “intersex” women can only serve to damage the lives and careers of these athletes.
> 
> The article notes that the main impetus for conducting “verification” tests is to ensure that men do not masquerade as women during competition. However, the authors note that since testing began in 1966, this situation has never been documented (with a notable exception of an unproven incident in women’s volleyball in 1972).
> 
> Like _The Sports Gene_ , the article’s authors suggest that it is the increased height of “XY” women that gives them an advantage. They argue that to test for intersex conditions in sports is discriminatory, as it falls into a large category of naturally occurring, genetically based differences between athletes. If athletes are not being screened out for other advantageous traits, they argue, neither should XY women or other athletes who would be considered “intersex.”

> **Women and Men Are Both Fierce Competitors**
> 
> Epstein makes a reasonable, evidence-based argument for why women will never catch up to men in terms of sports performance, with the implication being that men are _better_ at sports than women. It may be true that women will never, on average, jump farther, lift heavier, or run faster than men. But the book is not titled _The Power Gene_ or _The Speed Gene,_ the book is titled _The Sports Gene._ And just because men may be able to outperform women in measures of speed and strength does not mean they are inherently better at sports.
> 
> The main feature of sports is the competition. This is what viewers tune in for. We love to watch athletes at the top of their form test their limits against other athletes. In this respect, men hold no advantage over women. Female athletes are fierce competitors in their own right, who test their athleticism against other female competitors in the same way that men do.
> 
> An article in the _Columbia Journalism Review_ notes that for fans, there is a connection between self-esteem and the success of their favorite sports teams. This is because when we feel connected to something, our brain adopts some of that person or team’s success as our own. This can happen while watching women represent their country at the Olympics or World Cup just as much as it can while watching men.
> 
> An article from _Grantland_ discusses research on mirror neurons. The research shows that when we watch someone perform an action, approximately one-fifth of our own neurons for the same action fire. (If we watch someone do something strenuous, our own respiration and heart rate increase!) The more experience we have in a sport, the more our brains can “fire along with it” while we watch. The article cites an interview with one of the researchers who says that, while it is “very hard to prove,” watching sports makes us feel good in part because our mirror neurons are playing along with the players on the field. This happens whether the players are men or women.
> 
> If sports simply boiled down to statistics measured in meters jumped, seconds run, or points scored, there would be no need to tune in to watch the events. We don’t love sports for the final numbers, we love sports for the competition, the heart, and the story. These qualities are just as present in women’s sports as they are in men’s.
