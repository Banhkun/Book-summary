## Part 7: Insight From Animal Athletes

**While human athletes self-select into their sports, often based on inherited advantageous physical traits, canine and equine athletes are bred for their events**. The power of genetics in athletic performance has long been known to breeders looking for the fastest dogs and horses. Whippets and Alaskan Huskies are breeds whose genes are especially well-suited to their respective races. In this section, we will look at Epstein’s research on athletic traits from animal athletes and the insight they provide for humans.

### Whippets and the GDF-8 Gene

Racing whippets are bred for speed. In the most competitive category of whippet racing (grade A), 40% of the dogs have a copy of what is usually a very rare mutated version of the **gene that produces myostatin, a protein coded for by the GDF-8 gene, which acts as a stop signal for muscle growth.** At less elite levels of racing, the frequency of the mutation decreases. Epstein notes that 14% of the dogs in grade B racing carry the mutation, and there are almost no carriers in grade C.

It seems clear that having one mutated copy of the GDF-8 gene is beneficial for speed. But if a puppy inherits two copies of the mutated gene (which will happen 25% of the time if two carriers are mated), they grow so much muscle that they are too bulky to race and are often killed off by breeders. These heavily muscled dogs with two copies of the mutation are called “bully whippets.”

The relationship between myostatin and muscle holds across species.

  * Epstein notes that two separate studies found that racehorses with a version of the GDF-8 gene coding for less myostatin (and as a consequence more muscle) won 5.5 times as much money on the track as horses with two copies of a gene variant that produces more myostatin. 
  * Two species of cattle, Belgian Blue and Piedmontese, are purposefully bred to have mutated copies of the gene, resulting in a lack of myostatin and what Epstein calls “double muscle.”
  * There has been one famous human example of a baby with two mutated copies of the GDF-8 gene. He was nicknamed “superbaby” because of his lack of myostatin and extra muscle. His mother, a professional sprinter, was the only human adult on record as having the mutation. 



> **Artificial Selection**
> 
> When breeders purposefully select for desirable traits, such as extra muscle and extra speed, they are practicing artificial selection. Artificial selection mirrors the mechanism of evolution by natural selection, except that humans act as the driving force rather than the environment.
> 
> In evolution by natural selection, individuals with genetic traits that help them survive and reproduce will pass their genes to the next generation. Over the course of many generations, the traits that help individuals survive (and reproduce) in their specific environment will become more common. In artificial selection, humans act as the environment by choosing the traits they want and selectively breeding for them. By intentionally pairing two animals with desirable traits as well as culling (either literally or by removing them from breeding) individuals who do not possess those traits, humans are able to accelerate the process of genetic change in a population of animals (or plants).

Epstein notes that interest in the myostatin gene extends beyond sports to medical research on muscle-wasting diseases such as muscular dystrophy and the universal experience of muscle loss with old age. At the time of writing, Epstein notes that clinical trials were underway on a molecule that researchers had successfully used to bind to myostatin and thus promote muscle growth in mice.

(Shortform note: A 2020 article from the journal _Current Opinion in Neurology_ notes that clinical trials using myostatin inhibitors in humans, such as the one mentioned by Epstein, have yet to produce promising results for muscular dystrophy patients.)

### Alaskan Huskies and Work Ethic

Alaskan Huskies are impressive athletes specifically bred to excel in endurance events in cold environments. Some of their most racing-relevant traits highlighted by Epstein include:

  * With no training, **they have four to five times the aerobic capacity of most men.** When they are trained, their VO2 max can be eight times higher. This means that they can supply their muscles with massive amounts of oxygen while running. 
  * Unlike humans, who need rest between workouts to allow muscles to recover, Alaskan **Huskies are able to train and recuperate simultaneously**. This is ideal for the type of races that these dogs are used for (like the Iditarod, which is over 1,000 miles long).
  * **Their hearts are able to return to a resting rate nearly instantaneously** once they stop running, decreasing the need for lengthy rest periods. 



Perhaps **more important than all of these physical traits is the work ethic that Alaskan Husky breeders select for.** Alaskan Huskies are used as sled dogs in 1,000-mile races over snow and ice. (Famous sled dog races include the Iditarod and Yukon Quest.) In a race that takes roughly 10 days to complete, having a dog that wants to run can make the difference between winning and losing. Epstein highlights the importance of breeding for personality with the story of Lance Mackey, who won both the Yukon Quest and Iditarod in 2007 and 2008 and has won the Iditarod a total of four times.

Mackey began his career as a sled dog breeder without the financial resources to purchase “elite” dogs. He took in street dogs and dogs that other breeders did not want. Rather than looking for speed, Mackey looked for dogs who wanted to run. His dogs were not fast in comparison to other sled dogs, but they would happily run forever with no motivation other than intrinsic desire. Over many generations, Mackey’s approach to breeding changed the culture of sled dog racing from a style in which dogs sprinted between checkpoints to a “marathon” style. He and his dogs became celebrities in the sled-dog world, with one of his dogs even being shipped to Europe where people paid thousands of dollars per breeding.

> **Animal Athletes or Animal Abuse?**
> 
> While people generally play sports because they want to, animal athletes are not given a choice. There have been growing calls to end what animal rights activists characterize as animal abuse in the dog racing industries in recent years. The 2016 movie _Sled Dogs_ is thought to have severely tarnished the image of the sled dog industry, and the Iditarod has been denounced by the Humane Society of the United States and lost lucrative sponsors in recent years. Enthusiasm for greyhound racing is also waning. An article in _National Geographic_ notes that by the end of 2022, there will only be two commercial greyhound racetracks left, both in West Virginia.
> 
> One of the main reasons activists cite for shutting down dog racing is the killing of dogs who are either too slow or at the end of their racing careers. According to an article in the Washington Post, sled dogs that do not show racing promise may be culled from the pack. Epstein touches on this reality when he explains that Mackey got his first dogs as “castaways” from other breeders. The greyhound racing industry faces similar allegations, with an article in _National Geographic_ describing instances where dogs were either shot or left to die at the end of their racing careers.
> 
> Horse racing has faced a similar decline in popularity and public approval. An article in the New Yorker notes that 35 horses died at one racing track (Santa Anita) in less than a year in 2019, prompting animal rights demonstrations and calls for legal action. Animal rights activists cite doping, forcing horses to train and race while injured, and the killing of “retired” racehorses as reasons to shut down the industry. PETA estimates 10,000 racing horses are slaughtered every year, and one activist cited in the article estimates that 2,000 racehorses die every year in the process of racing and training.

#### Exercise Motivation in Humans and Mice

Sled dogs are not the only creatures with a desire to run. Epstein cites **research on mice and humans that suggests a genetic component to our desire to exercise.**

  * In one experiment, researchers bred mice based on their desire to run on an exercise wheel. After several generations of breeding, the mice voluntarily ran much farther than previous generations, and their brains grew. The researchers hypothesized that the area that grew was likely the part of the brain that controls motivation. 
    * The same brain changes were not seen in a population of mice bred to be “runners” by being forced to run. After many generations of breeding these mice had larger hearts, less fat, and more symmetrical bones, (the same was true for the voluntary runners) but their brains had not grown like the voluntary runners. These findings support the idea that there is a genetic component to motivation. 
  * Research on mice also showed that mice who showed an affinity for running on the wheel became agitated when they were denied exercise. 



Further research on mice suggests that the way we process dopamine (which is a function of our genes) may play a determining role in exercise motivation. In a follow-up experiment with the mice discussed above, when the group of mice who were bred to love running were given dopamine, there was no change to their running habits. However, when the group of mice who had been forced to run were given dopamine, they began to voluntarily run more, presumably because they began to enjoy it.

(Shortform note: Dopamine is a chemical that carries messages between our neurons. It is part of our brain’s “reward system” and helps us feel happy and satisfied. According to _Psychology Today_ , dopamine improves our mood and increases our attention and motivation. Since dopamine makes us feel ‘good,’ we tend to seek out activities that release dopamine. (This may be why people with low levels of dopamine may be more susceptible to addiction). Having high levels of dopamine can make people more resilient and optimistic in the face of challenges. Exercise is one way to naturally increase dopamine production.)

Epstein cites testimony from several highly successful athletes (Herschel Walker, Floyd Mayweather, Haile Gebrselassie, and Pam Reed) who identify as having a relentless drive, or need, to exercise. **Epstein notes that differences in the way our bodies process dopamine can make some people more susceptible to drug addiction, and suggests that there may be similar genetic reasons for why some people have an extra powerful motivation to exercise.** The findings of several research studies support exercise motivation being a function of our genes. **A large study of nearly 40,000 sets of twins estimated that between half and three-quarters of exercise motivation was genetic.**

> **Exercise Addiction**
> 
> An article in _Psychology Today_ discussing exercise addiction estimates that 3% of the general population and 25-52% of “long-term endurance athletes” may be addicted to exercise, with the highest rates of addiction occurring in triathletes, runners, and those who have an eating disorder. The article defines exercise addiction as feeling compelled to exercise even when it causes negative social, emotional, or physical consequences. The author cites seven symptoms of exercise addiction, but notes that most exercisers can relate to some of these, and this does not necessarily constitute an addiction:
> 
>   * Tolerance: constantly increasing the amount of exercise needed to feel satisfied
> 
>   * Withdrawal: negative experiences when someone is not able to exercise
> 
>   * Intention effect: constantly exercising more than we planned to
> 
>   * Lack of control: feeling compelled to exercise even when it interferes with other needs and obligations
> 
>   * Time: exercise taking up more time than is recommended by medical professionals or is healthy for each person
> 
>   * Interference with other activities
> 
>   * Continuance: continuing to exercise even while injured, sick, or experiencing other negative outcomes from exercise.
> 
> 

> 
> The takeaway from the article is that while exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, it, like most things, should be practiced in moderation. The article even cites research suggesting that engaging in intense exercise for more than 17 hours a week may be just as unhealthy as not exercising at all!
