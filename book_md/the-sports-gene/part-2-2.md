## Part 2.2: Less Obvious Traits and Performance

The traits discussed above may be obvious, such as a basketball player’s height, or more subtle, such as a relatively long torso. But all of them are visible to the naked eye. Next, we will look at a few traits that Epstein highlights that are not as readily apparent.

### Eyesight: Visual Acuity

**Testimony and measurements from optometrists and ophthalmologists reveals that professional baseball players have eyesight that far exceeds the average person’s.**

(Shortform note: When we visit an optometrist or ophthalmologist, we hope that they will tell us that we have “20/20 vision.” This ratio has become a colloquialism for “perfect eyesight.” It means that from 20 feet away, we can clearly and accurately see what we should be able to see from 20 feet away. If we could stand 20 feet away to see what most people see from 10 feet away, then our vision would be 20/10.)

Epstein includes testimony from**an ophthalmologist working with major league baseball teams who found that the visual acuity of the average MLB player was 20/11 or 20/12**(Most charts available for the general population only go to 20/15). Half of the players on the Dodgers between 1992 and 1995 had 20/10 vision (the theoretical maximum is thought to be 20/8). As Epstein highlights with two large studies from India and China, **this level of visual acuity is very rare**.

  * In a large-scale vision test in India, only one in 9,411 people had 20/10 vision. 
  * In China, 22 out of 4,438 people had 20/17 vision.



(Shortform note: While these studies give a sense of how rare the eyesight of professional baseball players is, it is worth noting that India is one of the countries with the highest rates of vision impairment worldwide. There are likely more individuals with exceptional eyesight in other countries.)

Epstein suggests that the general decline in hitters’ statistics around the age of 29 may in part be because visual acuity begins to decline around that same age.

### Depth Perception and Contrast Sensitivity

In addition to literal “off the charts” visual acuity, Epstein adds that measures of baseball players’ depth-perception were also far better than average. **Fifty-eight percent of MLB players had “excellent” depth perception,** compared to 18 percent of the general population. The same trends held true when Olympic softball players were tested. Olympic archers had visual acuity comparable to baseball and softball players, but their depth perception was not as good. Epstein suggests that this is because archers are aiming for a flat, immobile target.

**Olympic athletes who have to track a moving ball through the air** (baseball and softball players, soccer players, and volleyball players) **were all found to have better than average contrast sensitivity.** This makes sense as keeping track of the ball is an integral part of the game.

(Shortform note: Advances in eye care, including contact lenses, Lasik surgery, and glasses, may provide some leveling of the playing field for athletes who do not have 20/20 (or better) vision. Novak Djokovic (ranked as the number one tennis player in the world in 2021) wears contact lenses to correct his vision during games. It seems likely that the earlier vision problems are identified and corrected (such as in childhood vision screenings), the greater the chances that athletes with less than perfect vision will have the opportunity to excel. Vision problems that go uncorrected may cause a talented young athlete to either self-select out of or be cut from their favorite sports team.)

### Muscle Fiber Type

An athlete’s ratio of fast to slow-twitch muscles can also provide sport-specific advantages.**** Epstein explains that **most of us have a roughly equal percentage of fast-twitch to slow-twitch muscle fibers.** Fast-twitch muscle fibers are more explosive than slow-twitch and allow us to sprint for short distances and lift heavy objects just a couple of times. Slow-twitch muscle fibers are not as explosively powerful as fast-twitch, but they can fire for much longer; think distance running. Epstein explains that, to some degree, we can train our fast-twitch muscles to have more endurance and our slow-twitch muscles to become stronger, but we cannot actually change the ratio of slow-twitch to fast-twitch fibers that we are born with.

**Athletes who compete in explosive sports tend to have a higher percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers than the general population. And athletes who compete in endurance events tend to have proportionally more slow-twitch muscle fibers**. Epstein includes data showing that some sprinters have 75% fast-twitch fibers in their calves, while marathon runners can have up to 80% slow-twitch muscle fibers in their legs.

Epstein notes that since we can test samples of muscle fibers to learn athletes’ ratios, some athletes have been able to change their training programs and events to suit their physiology better. For example:

  * A kayaker on the Danish national team who was struggling in sprint events used the results of his muscle testing (which showed that his upper body had 90% slow-twitch muscle) to switch to endurance races. This switch allowed him to become one of the most competitive kayakers in the world. 
  * Tests on soccer players have shown that those players with a high percentage of fast-twitch fibers are more prone to injury on the field. This knowledge could allow coaches to tailor training programs to suit each athletes’ strengths. 



> **Creatine Supplements**
> 
> Many athletes take creatine supplements to boost the performance of their type 2 (fast-twitch) muscles. Creatine is found naturally in our bodies. It is synthesized in the liver and kidneys and we also ingest it in our food. Almost all of the creatine in our bodies is stored in our muscles.
> 
> Creatine helps our body produce ATP. ATP is a molecule that stores the energy that we use during short periods of powerful movement. ATP stores in our muscles are depleted within roughly 10 seconds of explosive exercise. Creatine supplements give athletes just a few more seconds of extra power by increasing ATP stores. In explosive sports, a few seconds can make a huge difference. Since the power-boost is so short-lived, creatine supplements are mainly used by athletes who participate in sports that rely on type 2 muscle fibers.
> 
> Creatine is generally considered to be a safe supplement and is allowed by the NCAA and Olympic Committee. However, research has shown that responses to creatine vary by athlete. While some athletes may see significant gains following creatine supplementation, some may see only minor gains, and some may see no gains at all. This is an example of how our underlying genetic differences affect our response to training.

### Skeletal Strength

Some athletes’ advantage in their sport comes from their bones. **Research on skeletons from around the world suggests that some people are born predisposed to be strong**. Epstein explains that one kilogram of bone can support five kilograms of muscle in men, and about 4.2 in women. **Having a heavier skeleton can be a benefit to athletes, particularly in sports where packing on muscle is an advantage.** For example, Olympic shot putters and discus throwers have skeletons that are about 6.5 pounds heavier than average, but on those 6.5 pounds, they can pack on 30 extra pounds of muscle.

The five to one (or 4.2 to one in women) ratio of muscle to bone is of particular interest to athletes looking to maximize their weight to power ratio. **Beyond this ratio, the skeletal scaffold for muscle will be full, and extra weight gain is likely to be fat**. Epstein notes that athletes who need to be lean and strong, such as javelin throwers, may do well to adhere to this ratio as closely as possible. They need to be strong enough to throw (which means having as much muscle as possible) but lean enough to sprint (meaning not having extra mass beyond this ratio). Athletes for whom force output is more important, such as shot putters, sumo wrestlers, or NFL linemen, may gain weight (as fat) beyond this ratio in an attempt to make their bodies more massive.

> **Exercise Builds Bone Density**
> 
> **** It is easy to think of our skeletons as the static scaffolding for the rest of our body, but bone is living tissue that can respond to exercise. According to the National Institutes of Health, roughly 75% of our bone mass is genetically based, while our lifestyle can influence 25%.
> 
> Participating in sports is one of the best ways to build bone density and help reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life. (Osteoporosis is a disease that occurs when bone breaks down faster than it is replaced, leading to weaker bones that are more susceptible to breaking.) Weight-bearing and resistance exercises are some of the best ways to build bone density, but the timing of exercise is important. Bone density in women generally peaks around 18 years of age (with men peaking a little later). We can build bone density until around age 30, at which point it begins to decline (but we can slow this decline with exercise).

### Speed

While we have discussed common traits shared by sprinters above, sports and science have yet to determine the exact recipe that makes an athlete fast. **Speed seems to be a talent that can be cultivated but not taught.** While it is not a physical trait in the same sense as those discussed above, speed is a necessary trait shared by athletes in many sports.

Epstein cites a manager at the Sports Sciences Institute in South Africa who has tested over 10,000 young athletes looking for speed. He attests that he has never seen an athlete who started out slow learn to become fast. Similarly, 2,000 12-year-old boys in the Netherlands were followed as part of a study tracking future professional soccer players. As they grew up, those who went on to play at the highest level were always in the fastest group during shuttle sprints.

Epstein cites a study of collegiate football players in the book’s afterword, which showed that four years of weight training in college made athletes much stronger but did not increase their speed. These studies suggest that there is a genetic component to speed.

In an interesting counterargument to the “10,000-hour rule,” Epstein notes that**trying too hard to cultivate speed at a young age can actually be detrimental**. Athletes who train too hard too early can get stuck in a rhythm while running that results in a “speed plateau,” a top speed that they cannot train past.

> **Corroborating Research on Sprinting Performance**
> 
> An article on sprint performance discusses research findings supporting ideas on sprinting presented in The Sports Gene. A few of these include:
> 
>   * While there may be an optimal technique in sprinting, athletes whose bodies are not “predisposed” to execute those techniques will not be able to benefit from technique-specific training. This may be part of the reason for the idea that speed cannot be taught.
> 
>   * The article also discusses how people are born predisposed to be fast, and notes that speed seems to be a polygenetic trait (meaning that no single gene confers a speed advantage).
> 
>   * Data on the top 100 sprinters in the world in their early 20s showed that the runners only improved by 0.1% to 0.2% a year. While there was a range in improvement, and improvement rates varied by age and experience level, these statistics support the idea that sprinters are naturally fast.
> 
>   * The study also noted that the 10,000-hour rule does not seem to apply to sprinting and that athletes can reach an elite level in five to six years if they have natural talent.
