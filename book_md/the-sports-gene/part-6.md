## Part 6: Genetic Mutations in Sports—Helpful and Deadly

In addition to the genes discussed above, Epstein discusses a few specific genetic mutations and their impact on athletic performance.

> **Genetic Mutations**
> 
> Genetic mutations can have a major impact on any person, including athletes. Our DNA is made up of several molecules, but most of us think of our DNA as a series of letters: specifically, A, T, G, C. These four letters stand for Adenine, Thymine Cytosine, and Guanine. These are the four nitrogen bases found in nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. The order of the nucleotides is “read” like a book of instructions to make living things. Every series of three “letters” codes for a specific amino acid. Amino acids are put together to build proteins.
> 
> Changing a letter in the sequence can change the way the genetic code ‘reads’ and can alter the instructions for making proteins. Some of these changes will not affect the organism, and some can have large effects. For example, sickle cell anemia (a disease in which red blood cells take on a sickle shape and are less able to travel through blood vessels) is caused by a single A being changed to a T. Other ways that mutations can change the reading of our genetic code include adding a letter (nucleotide), deleting a letter, deleting an entire series of genes, attaching parts of one chromosome to another (like a misplaced copy-paste), and more. Mutations can be inherited, acquired through environmental exposure (like skin cancer from UV radiation), or can happen spontaneously.
> 
> The word mutation has a colloquially negative connotation, but mutations can be harmful, neutral, or even helpful to an organism. In fact, genetic mutations are largely the reason we have so much diversity among living organisms. When a mutation leads to a new trait found in 1% or more of the population, it is often no longer called a mutation but simply another “trait” (or allele, or variant) like the ones we have discussed in this guide. The term “mutation” is often used when traits are very uncommon and/or lead to disease.

### A Beneficial Mutation in Cross-Country Skiing

Epstein recounts a trip he took to Finland to interview famous cross-country skier Eero Antero Mäntyranta, who won seven Olympic medals (three gold) from 1960 to 1968 (Eero passed away in 2013). His achievements included a decisive win in the 15km race at the 1964 winter Olympics, with 40 seconds separating him and the second-place finisher (this is the greatest margin of victory in this Olympic event ever). Epstein describes Eero’s dedication to his sport, with long hours of practice during the dark Scandinavian winters. However, Eero also had a genetic mutation that may have conferred an athletic advantage.

Eero had a mutation in his erythropoietin (EPO) receptor gene, a gene that codes for a molecule involved in producing red blood cells. The mutation results in an overproduction of red blood cells (**Eero had up to 65% more red blood cells than other men**) **and very high levels of hemoglobin** (the molecule on red blood cells that carries oxygen). A high volume of red blood cells is an advantage in sports, as**it indicates a greater capacity to carry oxygen to hard-working muscles.**

Epstein notes that Eero disagreed that his mutation gave him a natural advantage in skiing, but evidence suggests otherwise. There have been cases of other elite athletes in skiing and cycling (both of which place intense demand on the cardiovascular system) who have had abnormally high levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells and have been very successful at the elite level. **Some athletes will even inject themselves with synthetic hormones in an attempt to get their bodies to produce more red blood cells**. This is considered cheating and Epstein notes that in endurance sports, athletes may be required to provide documentation that their high hemoglobin and red blood cell counts are natural to compete.

Eero’s mutation was hereditary, and evidence from his family adds to the idea that the mutation provides an advantage in sports. He had a niece and nephew who also race (the only other family members who do). His nephew has won two Olympic medals (one gold) in cross-country ski racing, and his niece was a two-time junior world champion in cross-country skiing relay events.

> **Gene Doping**
> 
> “Gene doping” is a term used to describe athletes injecting pieces of DNA into their bodies to enhance performance. Gene doping remains largely theoretical in sports. But as gene therapy for medical purposes advances, the World Anti Doping Agency cautions that gene doping is likely to become a new frontier of cheating in sports (whether gene doping should be allowed is a current and interesting debate that we will not cover here). An article in _Nature_ identifies the EPO gene as a “candidate” for doping in the future.
> 
> Currently, EPO is given as a hormone to patients with anemia, kidney failure, or undergoing chemotherapy. As Epstein notes, these hormones can also be abused by athletes. However, the article notes that scientists hope to develop a gene therapy technique for EPO in the future, which will likely also be attractive to athletes looking to boost their performance. Eager athletes may be tempted to use EPO gene therapy before research is complete. This would be a dangerous situation, as the article notes that early experiments of EPO gene therapy in monkeys caused the monkeys’ blood to become as thick as “sludge.”

### Sickle Cell Anemia

Eero Mäntyranta’s mutation seems to either give carriers an athletic advantage or, should the carrier not be an athlete, have no effect on overall health. But this is not the case for many mutations.

**Sickle cell anemia, as we’ve mentioned, is a disease in which red blood cells have a sickle rather than a round shape. This shape impairs their ability to travel through blood vessels and deliver oxygen to the body.** The sickle-shaped cells also die much more quickly than normal red blood cells, leading to anemia. People can either be carriers of the sickle cell trait with a single copy of the mutation, or, if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene from their parents, they will have the disease.

Even though sickle cell anemia can shorten a person’s life, the mutation seems to have persisted in the human population for so long because **being a carrier of the trait has a protective effect against malaria.** The mutation is very common in parts of Africa where malaria is prevalent and in African-Americans whose ancestors came from areas with a high incidence of malaria. (Research suggests that having low hemoglobin levels in these populations also protects against malaria.)

While carriers of the sickle cell mutation are relatively common in certain populations, they are underrepresented in endurance events. This is because low oxygen environments, such as those created during heavy aerobic exertion, can cause the red blood cells in sickle cell carriers to curl up into the sickle shape, which can impede blood flow. **As a result, there are virtually no athletes carrying the sickle cell trait in elite running events longer than 800 meters**. More than a disadvantage, being a carrier of the sickle trait in endurance events can be dangerous. Since 2000, Epstein notes that nine collegiate football players who were carriers of the trait have died, prompting the NCAA to provide genetic screenings to athletes.

> **“Gene Therapy” as a Cure for Sickle Cell Anemia**
> 
> Sickle Cell Anemia affects 100,000 Americans, making it the most common hereditary blood disorder in the country. One in 12 African-Americans and one in 100 Hispanic Americans carry the trait. The National Institutes of Health notes that, until recent medical advances, most people with the disease did not live past childhood. Today, only 50% of people live past 50 years old.
> 
> The only current cure for sickle cell anemia is a bone marrow transplant. However, since we know that the disease is caused by a mutation on chromosome 11, scientists are working on a cure using gene-editing technology. Research on mice has shown promise for a technique in which some mutated bone marrow cells could be removed from a patient, corrected using technology, and then inserted back into the patient’s bone marrow; where they should start producing healthy red blood cells. This is an example of how findings from the Human Genome Project and other research into the human genome give the medical field much more power in fighting diseases.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is another mutation that has proven to be deadly on the sports field. HCM is a disease caused by a mutation in which the walls of the heart’s left ventricle become thicker. This means that the heart does not relax as it should after each heartbeat, and the heart muscle itself can be deprived of oxygen. The mutation is relatively common. One in 500 people have it, but many people will never show any symptoms.

**Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of death in young athletes.** Epstein notes that a high school, collegiate, or professional athlete will die from the condition every two weeks. During intense exercise, electric signals in an athlete with HCM’s heart can misfire. In the excitement of competition, athletes may not recognize that anything is wrong, making getting prompt medical attention more difficult. In addition to dangerous cardiac events being unpredictable, the condition can be difficult to diagnose. A symptom that doctors look for to determine whether someone has HCM is an enlarged heart. But the heart muscle can grow as a result of athletic training, adding an additional degree of difficulty in diagnosing the disease in young athletes.

> **Heart Murmurs in Sports**
> 
> Epstein explains that another reason diagnosing heart problems in athletes may be difficult is that heart murmurs are common in athletes; particularly athletes in sports with high cardiovascular fitness demands. According to the Cleveland Clinic, most heart murmurs in athletes result from the heart becoming enlarged through exercise and pose no health risk. The clinic also notes that the timing and pitch of the murmur can help distinguish an “innocent” murmur from something more serious, like HCM.
> 
> An article from the National Institutes of Health notes the extra burden that this difficult diagnosis places on health care providers. Of course, no provider wants to be responsible for dismissing a life-threatening problem as an “innocent” heart murmur. But a doctor would also not want to give a young person a diagnosis that unnecessarily keeps them off the field.

### Mutations and “Injury Genes”

Some people are more prone to injury than others. **Knowing whether your genes make you more likely to sustain certain types of injuries can allow athletes to use “prehabilitation” exercises to strengthen at-risk body parts and modify training plans**. Epstein highlights two of these “injury genes.”

  * A mutation in the COL1A1 gene causes brittle bone disease. Athletes (or anyone) with this mutation can break bones more easily. 



(Shortform note: Brittle bone disease is also called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Children are born with the disease. OI can cause soft bones, malformed bones, and other types of bone problems that can be mild or severe. The National Institutes of Health notes that people once believed children with the condition should be “protected” as much as possible by avoiding many activities. However, it is now recommended that children with the condition participate in sports to the extent that they are able, as strong muscles can support weak bones. However, the NIH does note that the choice of sport is important; for example, no contact sports).

  * A COL1A5 mutation causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in which abnormal collagen fibers make people especially flexible. This syndrome is uncommon but represents one extreme of the multiple variants of the gene that can influence how flexible people are and how likely they are to injure their connective tissue (ligaments and tendons). 



(Shortform note: An article from the American College of Sports Medicine notes that Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) affects roughly one in 5,000 people, but as it is present in different people to different degrees it is difficult to determine an exact number. In athletes, common issues from EDS may include “tissue fragility,” joint pain, joint instability, and joint dislocation.)
