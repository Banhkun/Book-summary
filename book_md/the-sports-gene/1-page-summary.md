## 1-Page Summary

In _The Sports Gene,_ science and sports journalist __ David Epstein makes a science-based argument against the popular idea that enough practice can guarantee success in sports. As he argues in the book, practice cannot make you great at a sport unless you have the “right” genes to go with it. Epstein uses data to argue that **some people are genetically hardwired to be better at certain sports than others,** and he explores the complex interplay among genes, environment, culture, and training that produce the world’s greatest athletes.

In this guide, we have focused on Epstein’s four main themes:

  * Theme 1: **Practice** plays a role in sports performance (although not as significant as many believe).
  * Theme 2: **Genes** play a role in sports performance. 
  * Theme 3: The **environment** plays a role in sports performance.
  * Theme 4: **Culture** plays a role in sports performance.



### Theme 1: Practice Plays a Role in Sports Performance

#### The Myth of Practice

The thesis of _The Sports Gene_ is that our genes determine our potential in sports. In making this claim, Epstein offers a counterargument to the emphasis our culture places on hard work and determination. The media popularized the idea that enough practice can guarantee success; in particular, Malcolm Gladwell’s bestselling book _Outliers,_ in which he coined the term “**the 10,000-hour rule.”** This “rule” **claims that 10,000 hours is the amount of practice it takes to become an expert in a given field**. Were the rule valid, it would mean that practicing any sport for 10,000 hours would be a virtual guarantee of success at the elite level.

> **Early Specialization in Sports**
> 
> The attitude that more practice is better is common in American culture. As a result, parents encourage their children to specialize in sports from an early age. While this may work for some athletes (Tiger Woods would be a top-of-mind example for many people as he was hitting golf balls by 11 months old), research has shown that early specialization is not only unnecessary but potentially harmful in most sports.
> 
> A literature review of studies involving specialization in sports noted that early specialization carried risks of physical injuries, burnout, and psychological stress. The study concluded that, for most sports, waiting until late adolescence to focus on a single sport was the best strategy.
> 
> Interestingly, Tiger Woods (as noted in chapter 3 of _The Sports Gene_) maintains that he was never pushed to practice golf but was always the one asking to play.

#### Debunking the Practice Myth

As Epstein explains,**practice does matter, but its power and potential vary by individual**. He shares research findings to illustrate this point.

  * In a study of ultra-endurance athletes, those who performed similarly reported a tenfold difference in practice time logged. 
  * A study of darts players who had been playing for 15 years showed that only 28% of the variance in their skill came from practice.
  * A study of chess players found that it took an average of 11,000 hours to become a chess master, but the range was 3,000 to 23,000 hours. Some who had practiced more than 25,000 hours were not masters. 
  * In a study of athletes in “cgs” sports (“centimeters, grams, and seconds” sports such as rowing, jumping, and weight lifting), the most elite athletes logged fewer hours of training than their peers until their late teenage years. 



These findings highlight why the 10,000 hours rule should not be a guide for how much to practice. As Epstein explains, there are many more factors involved in success than hours logged.

> **A Meta-Analysis of Practice and Sports**
> 
> A 2016 study called “The Relationship Between Deliberate Practice and Performance in Sports: A Meta-Analysis” (which included studies on endurance sports and weight lifting as well as games such as chess and darts) found that 18% percent of the difference in athletes’ performance could be explained by practice. While that may seem like a low number at first, 18% percent is a huge difference in sports. For example, the world record in the mile run is 3 minutes and 43 seconds. Eighteen percent slower (4 minutes 23 seconds) would be blown away by talented high school runners. The same study found that at the highest level, _deliberate practice_ (practice aimed at improvement rather than enjoyment) explained just 1% percent of the difference in performance, a powerful testament to innate ability.

#### The Real Power of Practice

Even though practice is not equally effective for everyone, Epstein notes that it is still a vital piece of sports success. So, rather than focusing on the way practice impacts an athlete's strength, endurance, and physical skills, he focuses on the ways that practice gives elite athletes a mental edge.

**Epstein explains that practice allows elite athletes to build a sophisticated mental model of their sport.** The more time an athlete has spent practicing, the more extensive their mental database of sport-specific knowledge and the better they can quickly and accurately make sense of what they see on the field. Epstein cites studies showing that **elite chess players, field hockey players, and basketball players can accurately recreate the setup of an entire board or field after looking at a photo for just a few seconds.** This increased processing speed allows athletes to make better decisions during play.

> **Evidence of Improved Data Processing in Athletes**
> 
> An article from _Grantland_ shows that the brains of professional basketball players were better than basketball coaches and non-players at predicting whether the ball would go into the hoop while watching short video clips of a person shooting free throws. These findings support Epstein’s discussion of practice building mental models.
> 
> Even more intriguing was that the neurons of the non-players showed “generalized” activity, while the neurons of the professional players and coaches showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with taking a shot. Only the professional players showed increased firing of neurons associated with hand muscles (specifically the muscles in their pinkie fingers). This last result suggests that the players have a sophisticated mental model of how taking a good shot feels.

### Theme 2: Our Genes Play a Role in Sports Performance

#### Some Physical Traits Are an Advantage in Some Sports

**No amount of practice can change that certain body types have a natural advantage in certain sports**. Epstein gives several sport-specific examples of advantageous physical traits, including the difference in body proportions between elite runners and elite swimmers.

**Sprinters have longer legs than the general population proportionally**. Epstein cites a study that found that male sprinters were on average two inches taller than the average man, but all of the height difference came from having longer legs. Hurdlers and high jumpers also benefit from having long legs because a higher center of gravity means producing less vertical force with each jump.

> **Body Mass Index and Running Speed**
> 
> In addition to leg length and height, one study found that elite runners’ body mass index (BMI) varied predictably according to their event. The study found that athletes became lighter and smaller as race distances increased, while sprinters benefitted from being taller and heavier.
> 
> Sprinters need muscle mass to generate enough power to cover short distances quickly. They use their mass to apply enough force to the ground with each step so that their muscles can rebound and propel them forward. If they were to sacrifice too much mass, they would lose their power and explosive speed. In contrast, distance runners do not need to be as explosively powerful as sprinters and benefit from being lighter. Being lean means that it takes less energy to propel their bodies forward. In addition, the forces of gravity and wind resistance decrease with decreased mass, and ground reaction forces are smaller for lighter runners, meaning their bodies don’t have to absorb so much energy from the shock of each step.

While long legs are an advantage in some running events, **having a proportionally longer torso is advantageous in swimming.** Epstein**** cites a study of Olympic athletes showing that male swimmers were 1.5 inches taller on average than Olympic sprinters, but the swimmers’ legs were half an inch shorter. All of the extra height was in their torso. Long torsos mean more surface area gliding through the water, which helps swimmers move at high speeds.

> **Michael Phelps: The Ideal Body Type for Swimming**
> 
> Michael Phelps has been highlighted as the model of the ideal swimming physique. He has won more Olympic medals (28 Olympic medals, 23 gold) than any athlete in history and has set 39 world records. He is tall (6 feet 4 inches), with a large wingspan (6 feet 7 inches), and a long torso (his torso would fit someone who is 6 feet 8 inches). In addition to providing a larger surface area to glide through the water, long torsos benefit swimmers by putting their center of mass closer to their lungs, which is their center of flotation. Having their center of mass near their center of flotation allows athletes to float horizontally in the water more efficiently.

Some traits are less evident than height and torso length. For example, Epstein cites research showing that **Kenyan distance runners’ calves were an average of 15-17% less thick than those of a control population.** This difference translates to nearly a whole pound of mass per calf that Kenyan runners do not have to move, saving them 8% of their energy each kilometer compared to their peers. Thus, slight calves may help explain a piece of why Kenyan runners dominate the marathon.

(Shortform note: It takes more energy to move “extra” weight in the legs farther from the hips, which is why companies that make running shoes put so much effort and advertising into making the lightest shoes possible.)

#### Genes That Influence Athletic Performance

Our body type and proportions are a product of our genes, but which gene(s) is hard to say. Epstein explains **that almost all of our traits** , even ones as seemingly straightforward as height, **are determined by multiple genes.** Advances in genetic research (notably the 2003 completion of the Human Genome Project, which successfully mapped the roughly 20,000 genes encoded in our DNA) have allowed researchers to hone in on some specific genes and how they relate to sports performance. Epstein highlights several of them in the book.

> **We All Have the Same Genes**
> 
> There is a common misconception that people are different from each other because we all have different genes. If this were true, there could indeed be a “sports gene” that people simply would or would not have. However, the reality is that all people on Earth are over 99% genetically identical to one another.
> 
> When we say we have the “gene” for something, we are referring to alleles. (Epstein uses the term variant rather than allele.) Alleles are different versions of a gene that lead to differences in the way that gene is expressed. Even though they represent well under 1% of our DNA, different alleles account for the huge diversity we see in the human race. For example, we all have the ABO gene that determines our blood type. But there are different versions of the gene (alleles) that result in different blood types among people. Instead of saying that an athlete has the “right gene” for their sport, it is more accurate to say that they have the right _version_ of a gene, or allele, for their sport.

##### Genes and Our Response to Training

Epstein uses studies highlighting people’s varying responses to exercise programs to illustrate the power of genes in shaping athletic careers. He discusses two studies that followed groups of people participating in cardiovascular fitness and strength-building exercise programs. The results showed that **people’s genetic differences cause them to respond differently to training**. Results from the cardiovascular exercise program showed that:

  * The aerobic capacity of 15% of participants did not improve at all, while the aerobic capacity of another 15% improved by 50% or more. The other 70% of participants fell somewhere between these values.
  * Half of the participants’ base level of fitness and their response to training could be statistically determined by studying their parents. 



As Epstein explains, these results make it clear that there is a strong genetic component to how people’s bodies respond to cardiovascular training. **The researchers were able to find 21 alleles (versions of a gene) that accounted for the diversity in responses to cardio training.** Results from the strength training program were similar:

  * 17 participants added up to 50% more muscle mass. 
  * 32 participants gained 25% more muscle mass
  * 17 participants had no muscle gains despite identical training



Along with these results, researchers again found that those who responded the most to the training program had pre-existing genetic differences from those who did not. Epstein explains that the participants who gained 50% more muscle had more active IFG-IEa, MGF, and Myogenin genes than those who did not respond to exercise.

Epstein suggests that **elite athletes likely fall into the category of people whose bodies elicit a greater response to exercise _and_ whose genes give them a naturally more athletic starting point.**

> **There Are Benefits to Exercise Outside of Sports Performance**
> 
> There is still reason to exercise even for people who do not see performance gains despite training. Epstein notes improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and insulin sensitivity as benefits of aerobic training outside of sports. There are also cognitive, social, and emotional benefits to exercise for athletes and nonathletes alike. An article from the University of California, Berkely outlines several benefits of exercise that have less to do with performance on the field and more to do with overall well-being. They include:
> 
>   * Greater happiness and overall satisfaction
> 
>   * Less loneliness and a lower risk of depression
> 
>   * A greater sense of purpose and more feelings of love, gratitude, and hope
> 
> 

> 
> As the article explains, this is because exercise has a powerful effect on our brains, even if we don’t see any gains in our muscles.

#### Single Genes Can Have a Large Impact on the Field

While researchers have only been able to identify groups of genes that influence some elements of our physiology (as seen in the examples above), the relationship between some specific genes and athletic performance is more apparent. Epstein highlights some of these genes in the book.

**ACTN3 Gene:** Our ratio of fast- to slow-twitch muscle fibers can determine our success in some sports. Epstein discusses two versions of the ACTN3 gene, which codes for a protein found in fast-twitch muscle fibers: the “R variant” and the “X” variant. While scientists do not know how this happens, **there is a strong correlation between the R variant and sprinting speed.** Tests on athletes from around the world have revealed that **the X genotype is almost nowhere to be found in elite sprinters.**

**The SRY Gene:** Epstein uses the performance difference between men and women to emphasize his assertion that genes matter in sports. **Epstein explains that the Sex Determining Region Y (SRY) gene accounts for most sexual variation between men and women.** It is on the Y chromosome (women have two X chromosomes). The SRY gene causes the formation of testicles, which release the testosterone that produces male characteristics in developing fetuses. Epstein credits this gene and the associated higher levels of testosterone in males as the reason male athletes are (on average) bigger, faster, and stronger than female athletes.

> **Epigenetics: Our environment acts on our genes**
> 
> An athlete’s performance is a function of both her genes and her environment. Simply knowing the gene (or genes) that codes for a particular trait is just one piece of the puzzle in demystifying human genetics. Our internal and external environments impact the way our genetic code is expressed in the real world.
> 
> Chemical compounds and proteins within our cells attach to our genetic code and control the way our DNA is read (and thus which proteins are produced). These ‘DNA attachments’ are referred to as our epigenome. Elements of our epigenome are inherited from our parents, and some are acquired (and change) throughout our lifetime. Much of our epigenome is determined after birth. Our environment and lifestyle can change the expression of our genes. This is often called epigenetics. (The term “epigenome” falls under the epigenetics term.) A well-known example of epigenetics in daily life is the risk of skin cancer from our cells being damaged by UV radiation.
> 
> As this article from the National Library of Medicine notes, even if researchers are able to pin down the exact genes for certain athletic traits, unraveling which traits in sports have a purely genetic origin is an impossible task. Athletes will always be the product of genes and environment, or as Epstein calls it, nature _and_ nurture.

### Theme 3: The Environment Plays a Role in Sports Performance

Our environment has an impact on our genes. Since our genes play such a large role in our sports performance, Epstein argues that **you cannot understand what makes an athlete successful without the context of their environment.** He illustrates this point using Kenyan distance runners.

The dominance of Kenyan athletes in distance running events is one of the best-known stereotypes in sports. As Epstein explains, this well of talent mainly comes from one specific tribe within Kenya. **Athletes from the Kalenjin tribe represent only 12% of the Kenyan population but 75% of its elite runners.** At the time of _The Sports Gene_ ’s __ writing, only 17 men in the United States had ever run a marathon faster than two hours and 10 minutes. But 32 men from the Kalenjin tribe accomplished the same feat in October of 2011.

#### Latitude and Limb Length

Epstein’s research suggests that the environment in which Kalenjin runners’ ancestors evolved helps to explain the tribe’s exceptional running ability. The Kalenjin tribe has what anthropologists call a “Nilotic” body type, characterized by long, thin limbs. Evidence from animal and human populations shows that limbs generally become longer and thinner **as you move closer to the equator.** Epstein explains that this is likely due to the higher temperatures in many low-latitude environments since**long limbs create a greater surface area for cooling.** During long-distance running events, becoming overheated will not only decrease performance but can be dangerous.

> **Evolution by Natural Selection Develops Human Traits**
> 
> Traits that are an advantage on the sports field may also be helpful in survival situations. Evolution by natural selection, the accepted theory of evolution in modern times, posits that traits that boost an organism’s survival and (more importantly) reproductive success will become more common in a population over time.
> 
> Advantageous traits are specific to an organism’s environment. For example, while having long, thin limbs may confer a survival advantage near the equator, Epstein notes that populations that evolved in the arctic tend to have short legs (short legs conserve heat just as long legs allow it to dissipate). The traits that help certain athletes succeed in specific sports may have helped their ancestors better survive their natural environments.

#### Altitude and Aerobic Capacity

Another environmental factor that likely enhances the Kalenjin’s running ability is altitude. Ancestors of the Kalenjin tribe evolved close to sea level but migrated to a higher elevation in recent evolutionary history. Today the Kalenjin live at altitude in the Rift Valley. **Epstein presents research suggesting that the body’s initial response to a move to altitude is an increase in the production of hemoglobin**.

Hemoglobin is the molecule that carries oxygen in our blood. Producing more hemoglobin is the body’s way of capitalizing on every molecule of available oxygen in the thinner air at altitude and is the reason athletes use altitude training to maximize aerobic capacity. The combination of sea-level ancestry and living and training in the altitude “sweet spot” for hemoglobin production (between 6,000 and 9,000 feet) likely contributes to the Kalenjin tribe’s running prowess.

> **Sherpas as Superathletes**
> 
> Epstein reinforces the idea that no single factor, genetic or environmental, can account for an athlete’s success by pointing out that other populations living at altitude are not producing Olympic endurance athletes. Nepal has competed at the Summer Olympics since 1964 but has yet to take home a medal. If simply living or training at altitude could make someone a great endurance athlete, we would expect to see marathoners from Nepal running alongside Kenyan runners.
> 
> Natives of Nepal who work on Mount Everest as sherpas are widely regarded as superathletes in their own right. Not only have many of them made the ascent up Everest many times (a feat considered by many as a pinnacle of athletic achievement), but they do so while caring for groups of other climbers and carrying the extra weight of climbing gear on their backs. If mountaineering were to become an Olympic sport, Nepal would surely be raking in the gold medals, and Sherpas would be highlighted as athletes with a genetic makeup perfectly suited to their sport.

### Theme 4: Our Culture Plays a Role in Sports Performance

An athlete’s genes, practice, and environment all play an important role in her performance. But none of these explains why athletes from certain cultures choose to specialize in specific sporting events. Epstein argues that an **athlete’s culture and socioeconomic status can help explain why sport-specific talent**(such as the Kenyan marathon phenomenon) **tends to cluster in certain areas.** He focuses on Kenyan distance running and Jamaican sprinting to highlight this point.

Epstein highlights the following factors as reasons why so many Kenyans choose to pursue a running career:

  * Poverty: The average income in Kenya is $800 per year. **The prize money from winning a large marathon would be a fortune for the average Kenyan runner**. Even winning a local or regional race could mean more money than athletes would otherwise earn in a year. 
  * Inclusive training philosophy: Epstein describes an open training culture in the Kalenjin population. He notes that elite athletes often train alongside aspiring runners, who will drop in on training sessions to see how they compare. Additionally, aspiring Kenyan runners are often young adults coming into the sport for the first time. In contrast to the push in US sports culture to begin training as early as possible (before it is “too late”), Epstein notes that**Kenyan runners believe that if someone has the talent and puts in the work, age is not an obstacle.**
  * Early “training”: **One study showed that 81% of elite Kenyan runners were from low-income families and had to walk or run to school**. This walking served as a form of early training and resulted in a 30% higher aerobic capacity than those who did not walk to school. The same research showed that the top runners had to walk six miles, sometimes more, to school every day. 



Coupling these factors with physiology exceptionally well-suited to distance running creates a well-rounded view of why there are so many successful Kalenjin runners.

> **Kalenjin Runners and Exceptional Mental Toughness**
> 
> An NPR article highlighting the success of Kalenjin runners offers an additional culturally-based explanation for why Kalenjin runners are so successful. The article proposes that in addition to physiological advantages, athletes from this tribe are conditioned to have an exceptionally high pain tolerance. According to the article, learning to tolerate pain is an important part of growing up in the Kalenjin tribe. The article describes pain ceremonies as a rite of passage where teenagers prove their mental toughness to the rest of the tribe. High pain tolerance is a clear advantage in a sport such as the marathon, where athletes push themselves through discomfort for hours.

Taking culture into account can paint a more well-rounded picture of why Jamaican athletes have such a strong presence in sprinting events.

  * As Epstein describes it, **youth track is to Jamaica what football is to the United States**. High school championship track meets are even more popular than professional sporting events in Jamaica. 
  * All children in Jamaica are pushed to try sprinting from a young age. Young children who show potential are recruited to high schools with competitive track teams, and high school students are even sponsored by local retailers. That such an interest is taken in runners at such a young age is a testament to the cultural importance of sprinting events in Jamaica, and explains why so many athletes choose track (and sprinting in particular) over other sports. 



> **Talented American Sprinters Choose Other Sports**
> 
> According to a Gallup poll, the most popular sports (measured by viewership) in the United States are football, basketball, baseball, and soccer, in that order. Less than 0.5% of people chose track and field as their favorite sport to watch. This helps to explain why young American athletes would choose to focus on the four sports listed above instead of focusing on their speed on the track. In fact, in _The Sports Gene,_ Epstein notes that some people worry that the growing popularity of basketball in Jamaica may draw promising athletes away from the track.

### Applying _The Sports Gene_ to Our Lives

In the Afterword of The Sports Gene, Epstein invites us to explore our unique genome by trying new sports and experiencing personal growth and discovery through a training program. As his research findings and stories show, we never know what we may be good at unless we try!

(Shortform note: These invitations convey a tone of optimism and possibility. Our takeaway from _The Sports Gene_ should not be that we don’t have the “right” genes to excel in sports. Instead, the book invites us to explore how our own genes, environment, culture, and training interact. Perhaps the most important takeaway from _The Sports Gene_ is that we should be patient with ourselves and others along our sports journeys. If we are open to trying new things, we will likely find a sport that feels like a “natural” fit. While we may not end up in the Olympics, understanding that our bodies are programmed to have their own strengths and weaknesses can help us identify a sport that we find personally rewarding.)
