## Part 3: Sports Is a Magnet for “Extreme” Body Types

Athletic people with an average build have the potential to perform well in several different sports. Epstein notes that experts in the field of anthropometry (the study of human form and function) used to be convinced that the best athletes would be those that fell right in the center of a bell curve of human form; or, the most average person possible. This logic does make sense in the context of finding the best all-around athletes. Athletes who are too big and heavy will likely have a harder time running long distances. Athletes who are too small will likely have a harder time lifting or throwing heavy objects. It stood to reason, then, that an average person should be able to compete in any sport with some degree of success.

Until relatively recently, this was the case. Epstein notes that in 1925, elite volleyball players were the same size as discus throwers, and high jumpers were the same size as shot putters. Put someone with an “average” build into any event at the Olympics today, and they would likely look quite out of place. **Today, athletes in many sports represent some of the extremes of human proportions**.

Epstein cites a survey that looked at body measurements of elite athletes from the early 1900s through the modern day. Results showed that **athletes in different sports have become radically physically dissimilar from one another in recent decades**. The survey authors call this explosive appearance in diversity “The Big Bang of Body Types.”**** Epstein notes that **the increasing frequency of “extreme” physical traits in sports is a product of changes in sports culture facilitated by technology.** We will look at this idea next.

> **Decathlon: The Best Athletes in the World?**
> 
> Most athletes in high-profile sports are specialists, competing exclusively in one event. Decathletes compete in 10 and are often applauded as the best athletes in the world (the NBC Olympic website even lists the 2021 decathlon winner as “the most athletic man in Tokyo”). Yet the winner of the Olympic decathlon would not necessarily place if they were to compete in each corresponding Olympic event. Decathletes and triathletes are considered to be “generalists'' in sports. In a way, they represent the “ideal athlete” envisioned by the anthropometrists discussed above.
> 
> Decathletes have to be powerful enough to throw a shot put, but not so massive (an advantage in shot put) that they cannot race in the 1,500 meters. While data on the morphology of elite decathletes and triathletes compared to corresponding specialists is difficult to find, the results of the 2021 Olympic decathlon illustrate this compromise.
> 
> Damian Warner won the 2021 Olympic decathlon and set an Olympic record for the event in the process. He is 6 feet 1 inch and 183 pounds. In the shot put, Warner’s best throw was 14.8m. The winner in the shot put event was Ryan Crouser, whose best throw was 23.3m (also an Olympic record). Crouser is 6 feet 7 inches tall and roughly 320 pounds. Every one of the top 12 shot put competitors threw over 20 meters. Clearly, athletes who are generalists must make compromises in their training. Being great at a single event can preclude being great at another, due to both body type limitations and practice constraints (if you only compete in one event you can focus all of your training there).

### The Global Sports Stage

**Technology and cultural enthusiasm for watching elite sports have facilitated the concentration of “extreme” body types into various athletic disciplines**. Epstein notes that sports culture used to center around local clubs. Players, fans, and the events themselves were local (or regional). Today popular sports are widely televised and recorded, and the audience has shifted from local to global.**As Epstein explains, the increasing visibility and popularity of many sports has created a “winner take all” sports culture.** Elite athletes are no longer local heroes but global superstars, with a corresponding increase in earning potential.

In 1975, professional athletes made, on average, five times more money in a given year than the average American. Today, Epstein notes, professional athletes’ salaries are 40-100 times higher than average. At the very top of the most popular sports, **an average person would have to work for over a century to match some athletes’ wages.**

(Shortform note: In 2021, 10 NFL players signed contracts for annual salaries of $30 million or more (with the highest being Patrick Mahomes at $45 million). In contrast, the real median earnings in 2020 for full-time work in the US was $61,417 for men and $50,982 for women.)

Of course, not all athletes sign multimillion-dollar contracts, even in the world’s most popular sports. But being a professional athlete in the modern-day does hold unprecedented potential for fortune and fame. Sports superstars are famous on and off the field. Epstein notes that in 1983, the NBA entered into a collective bargaining agreement with its athletes that allowed the players to collect royalties, portions of ticket sales, and profit from their fame (Michael Jordan’s sneakers were an early and famous example). This decision reflects the shift in sports culture toward superstardom for the most elite athletes.

With the greater potential for glory comes greater interest from potential athletes around the world. Within three years of the new collective bargaining agreement, Epstein notes that the NBA had doubled its number of seven-foot players. The NBA now draws players from countries like Croatia and Lithuania, among the world’s tallest populations.

(Shortform note: Viewership (and revenue) for major sporting events is huge. While numbers vary by year, Super Bowl viewership hovers at around 100 million people. About 150 million Americans watched the Tokyo Olympics, down from 198 million for Rio in 2016. According to FIFA, more than 3.5 billion people watched part of the 2018 World Cup.)

The powerful appeal of fame and fortune in some sports may explain why the WNBA lags behind the NBA in attracting the tallest female athletes. Female basketball players make far less money than men. Players in the WNBA are only 10% taller than the average woman, while NBA players are, on average, 15% taller than the average man.

(Shortform note: In 2020, the WNBA signed a collective bargaining agreement that increased players’ base salary to an average of about $130,000, as well as increased their potential for total earnings. While this is an improvement, it does not come close to the $7.7 million average NBA salary in 2019. A similar discrepancy in soccer has been the source of much media coverage in recent years. In September 2021, after a long and highly publicized legal struggle, the US Soccer Federation announced that it would offer the same contracts to the men’s and women’s national soccer teams.)

> **The Increase in “Extreme” Traits in Sports Is _Not_ Evolution**
> 
> Epstein states that body proportions in athletes are changing more quickly than in the general population. For example, he notes that within eight years of the Fosbury Flop technique (in which athletes clear the bar backward by arching their backs) taking over the high jump world, the height of jumpers increased by several inches. He also notes that Croatian water polo players’ arms “grew” five times longer than the rest of the population in a 20-year time frame. Epstein is speaking about groups of athletes as their own populations to illustrate the increase in certain traits by sport. It should be made clear that Epstein does _not_ suggest that these athletes are somehow “evolving” more quickly in a biological sense.
> 
> Evolution by natural selection, the accepted theory of evolution in modern times, posits that traits that boost an organism’s survival and (more importantly) reproductive success will become more common in a population over time. For evolution by natural selection to account for longer arms in water polo, the athletes' lives and reproductive opportunities would have to hinge on their winning the game. Then those traits that helped them win, if they were heritable, would have to be passed to their offspring and help them survive and reproduce. Over the course of several generations, the trait would have to become common enough to change the overall frequency of longer arms in the general population. Even if all of these stipulations were met, lasting evolutionary change in a species often takes one million years!

Epstein notes that the **frequency of athletes breaking records in their sports has slowed in recent years.** It may be that, for now, sports has reached the bulk of the global talent pool. However, it may also be that when sports such as women’s basketball produce a significant enough incentive, we will see another surge of highly specialized athletes emerge to claim their place.
