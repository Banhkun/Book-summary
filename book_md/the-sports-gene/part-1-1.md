## Part 1.1: Practice and Performance | Popular Ideas About Practice Are Flawed

In _The Sports Gene_ , a _New York Times_ bestseller published in 2013, science and sports writer David Epstein makes an evidence-based argument against the popular idea that enough practice can guarantee success in sports. Rather, he argues, **some people are genetically hardwired to be better at certain sports than others.** His research covers the complex interplay among genes, environment, culture, and training, and he paints a well-rounded picture of why elite athletes excel in their field.

**The idea that anyone can become an expert in anything if they practice enough is ingrained in popular culture.** In the perennial nature vs. nurture debate, the idea that nurture (practice) can overcome nature (innate ability) has obvious appeal, especially in sports. _The Sports Gene_ takes a scientific approach to this assertion and has a decisive rebuttal: **Practice is not an equalizer in sports** , and hours of hard work are no substitute for innate ability.**** Instead, **the combination of innate ability**(that comes from genes)**_and_ practice creates elite athletes**. Part 1 will explore Epstein’s research on practice and sports performance by:

  * Discussing where popular ideas about practice come from
  * Discussing why the idea that practice alone determines success is flawed
  * Offering a more nuanced view of practice that accounts for innate ability



> **Meritocracy in Society and Sports**
> 
> We like to think that the athletes who work the hardest are the ones who will succeed. Meritocracy is a social belief system that sees success (particularly wealth and power) as the outcome of skill and hard work. This idea is popular worldwide, but it is most popular in the UK and US, where **most people believe that hard work is more important than luck or heredity. **While this idea has obvious appeal, some argue that it is dangerous and unhealthy for society and individuals.
> 
> Believing that people end up in the social standing that they “deserve” can make people behave more selfishly, make them less likely to critique their behavior, and can even be used to justify discrimination (in part because it conveniently explains away present circumstances). In contrast, acknowledging the importance of luck can make people behave more generously.
> 
> Since meritocratic views are so prevalent in popular culture, it makes sense that they are also popular in sports. We love the story of the gritty underdog making it to the top. But failure to recognize differences in innate ability (genes) can lead people to believe that they are simply not working hard enough when they don’t meet their goals. The reality may be that no amount of hard work will propel them past athletes whose natural abilities are better suited to their sport. It is easy to see how meritocracy could be a particularly detrimental idea in youth sports as children are forming their beliefs about themselves and building their self-esteem.

### The “10,000 Hours” Study and the Promise of Mastery

**The phrase “the 10,000-hour rule” has become a popular way to express the idea that enough practice is a virtual guarantee of expertise**. It epitomizes the idea that practice (nurture) can overcome nature (innate ability). The phrase is based on a 1993 study entitled _The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance_ , which examined the number of hours violin players at a prestigious music academy practiced. The study found that:

  * The top violinists had spent more time practicing on their own since taking up the instrument than less-skilled players. 
  * By the time the musicians reached the music academy, the difference in practice times had added up to thousands of hours.
  * Using the estimates of practice time given by the musicians, the authors came up with an average of 10,000 hours of practice by the time the top musicians were 20 years old. 
  * **The authors proposed that this accumulated practice accounted for the difference in performance and suggested that the idea could be transferred to sports.**



(Shortform note: For the rest of the summary, we will refer to _The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance_ study as “The 10,000-hours study.”)

> **Practice vs. Deliberate Practice**
> 
> Not all practice is equally productive. The authors of the 10,000-hours study use the term “deliberate practice” instead of “practice” to reinforce this idea. **Deliberate practice is time put aside to improve one’s skills. **By definition, it is structured and requires effort and engagement. It also requires attention to strategies that best suit an individual’s learning style or needs.

> The authors make it a point to note that deliberate practice is not necessarily enjoyable. Simply participating in a sport or activity does not necessarily count toward hours of “deliberate practice.” The seemingly endless drills run during sports practice (often not inherently enjoyable) are an example of deliberate practice (if players are actively engaged).

#### Limitations of the 10,000-Hours Study

While well-known and heavily referenced, **we should be cautious when applying findings from the 10,000-hours study to other disciplines and situations**. The study has been cited by other researchers more than 12,000 times, and it has become one of the most well-known studies in the field of psychology. However, Epstein notes that it has significant limitations that are unfortunately overlooked in popular interpretation. Some of these include:

  * The study asked participants to recall how many hours they practiced the violin as children. The violinists themselves were inconsistent in their reporting. 
  * The study included only talented musicians at a prestigious music academy. These musicians had already dedicated themselves to their craft and rigorous practice. Therefore, the sample included in this study is not representative of musicians as a whole.
  * 10,000 hours was the _average_ of the reported practice times. The range was not reported in the study. 



**The authors of the 10,000-hours study did not use the phrase “the 10,000-hour _rule,_ ” nor did they propose 10,000 hours as a guarantee of expertise. **Epstein notes that the catchy term was a product of the media reporting on the study. It was pushed further into the mainstream by Malcolm Gladwell’s bestselling book _Outliers_ (where he coins the term “the 10,000-hour _rule_ ” and asserts that the ability and luxury to dedicate thousands of hours to practice is what truly sets elites in their fields apart). **The lead author of the study himself has stated that the phrase the “10,000-hour rule” misconstrues the study’s findings.**

> **Follow-up Research Does Not Support the Study’s Findings**
> 
> A 2019 study sought to replicate the findings of the original 10,000-hours study while addressing gaps in experimental design. Similar to the original study, the researchers found that a large amount of the difference in violinists' performance was explained by practice. However, the follow-up study found that practice had less of a determining effect on overall skill level than the original study. In fact, the newer study found that the “best” violinists had practiced for _fewer_ hours (on average) than the “good” violin players by the time they were 18.
