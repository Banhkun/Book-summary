## Chapter 2: The Reciprocity Principle

**The Reciprocity Principle tells us to repay others when they do something for us.** This fixed-action pattern of behavior is so deeply ingrained that we hardly think about it, yet we practice it all the time. When a friend treats you to lunch, you make sure you pick up the check the next time you go out; when your neighbors invite you to a party, you invite them the next time you’re hosting an event.

That the phrase “much obliged” is a synonym for “thank you” is a powerful encapsulation of the Reciprocity Principle: **we naturally feel obliged,_indebted_ to those who have done something for us.**

The Reciprocity Principle can even extend beyond these small day-to-day courtesies to the world of international diplomacy. When Mexico City was devastated by an earthquake in 1985, Ethiopia dutifully made a foreign aid contribution to help the rebuilding and recovery effort. But why would a country like Ethiopia, poverty-stricken and suffering through a devastating famine, spend its scarce resources to help people all the way on the other side of the world? Simple: the Reciprocity Principle. In 1935, when Ethiopia was invaded and occupied by the Italians, Mexico was one of the few countries to send aid. The Ethiopians were returning the favor, 50 years later.

### The Origins of Reciprocity: Networks of Obligation

Why is the Reciprocity Principle such an intuitive part of the human experience? Because evolution favored early human communities with strong social cohesion and an ability to work together.

**The Reciprocity Principle was the glue that enabled social cohesion.** If another individual brought you some firewood, for example, bringing them some of your _own_ firewood would help the two of you survive and make the overall clan or tribe stronger.

**This created networks of obligation among early humans** that made it easier for the group as a whole to multiply and survive. In a harsh and unforgiving environment, like many prehistoric peoples faced, this was the only way to ensure group survival and prosperity.

**It also lowered the cost of giving things up to one’s neighbors:** you weren’t really losing something if you knew it would eventually come back to you. This is how humans came to rely on the principle so heavily. These networks of obligation, in turn, enabled communities to divide labor, trade for scarce goods with their neighbors, create systems of mutual defense, and develop hierarchies and functional divisions within society. This inheritance from evolution is why we still adhere to the Reciprocity Principle today: **we’re all taught that it’s bad to be a moocher or freeloader.**

(Shortform note: The Reciprocity Principle became even more deeply ingrained as primitive communities grew into complex and interdependent societies. Looking at early Mesopotamia, for example, we see that large-scale, collective efforts like monument-building or the irrigation projects that enabled the Sumerians to control the flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers could have only been possible if there were some social mechanism that obliged people to assist one another in these endeavors.)

### Gifts, Favors, and “Free” Samples: Exploiting the Reciprocity Principle

Unfortunately, **the Reciprocity Principle also represents an evolutionary blind spot that compliance practitioners know how to exploit**. They know that you’re more likely to feel obliged to them if they offer you some small gift or token gesture of kindness before they make their request.

The Reciprocity Principle overpowers our other senses: you don’t even have to _like_ the person making you the offer, you don’t need to have asked for it, nor do you have to desire the thing being offered to you for the principle to work its persuasive magic.

Without the sense of indebtedness, most people would never agree to the requests. **The Reciprocity Principle is why sellers are so fond of promotional offers, free samples, and small gifts.**

They know that by accepting these offers, you’ll become indebted to them: and their goal is to get you to fulfill your social obligation by purchasing their product. The best part for them is how subtle it is. **They don’t have to directly ask you for anything** , and they can never be accused of pressuring you into anything: all they did was offer you a free sample!

Of course, they know how hard it is for you to take a small piece of cheese, for example, without buying at least a little: they know how painful it is for you to feel like a moocher. Thus they comply with their request or abandon your ingrained sense of fairness and obligation.**

> **The Soda Experiment**
> 
> In an experiment that demonstrates the power of the Reciprocity Principle, experimenters had a participant sit in a room with a researcher pretending to be a participant. The fake participant (the book calls him “Joe”) offered the real participant a free can of soda. In the control group, Joe did _not_ offer the participant any soda. Later, Joe came back and asked the participant if they would be willing to purchase raffle tickets he was selling: in effect, testing to see if they would be willing to return the favor of the can of soda from earlier.
> 
> The contrast between the experimental and control groups was stark: **participants who had been offered soda bought twice as many tickets as those who hadn’t.** Even those who later reported that they didn’t particularly _like_ Joe were no less likely to purchase raffle tickets than those who _did_ like him, as long as they’d been offered a can of soda. This is the power of the Reciprocity Principle to induce compliance.

> **The Hare Krishnas**
> 
> The members of the Hare Krishna Society are a familiar site at airports around the world. Recognizable by their shaved heads, robes, beads, and bells, they are known for soliciting contributions from people passing by. There are also highly skilled exploiters of the Reciprocity Principle. They don’t begin their request for donations with a straightforward ask: instead they present the prospective donor with a small gift, like a flower or a book. Even if you don’t want it, they are insistent that you take what they’re offering: “No, please accept it, it’s our gift to you.”
> 
> It’s only at this point that the Hare Krishnas will ask for a monetary contribution. They know that **the Reciprocity Principle will work its effects even on those who didn’t want the gift or find the Hare Krishnas weird or off-putting**. The tactic has been a great success for the society, funding the creation and maintenance of over 300 religious centers around the world.

### Rejection-Then-Retreat

A favorite of compliance practitioners looking to make use of the Reciprocity Principle is the rejection-then-retreat tactic. The tactic plays upon the contrast effect, in which **we exaggerate the differences between things depending on the order in which they’re presented to us.**

A classic example is lifting a light object and then lifting a heavier object. Studies show that people who lifted the lighter object first consistently rated the second object as being heavier than those who had _only_ lifted the heavier object.

Here’s how compliance professionals use the rejection-then-retreat tactic:

1) **They make you an extreme first ask**. For example, they might ask a high initial price for an item you’re looking to buy or ask you to commit a large amount of time volunteering for some cause. **These first asks are _meant_ to be rejected**. They’re _counting_ on you balking at the initial request.

2) After you’ve rejected them the first time, **they make you a more “reasonable” second request.** The second request looks small and reasonable because it comes immediately after a larger initial request: the compliance professional has primed your brain by using the contrast effect.

They’ve scaled back their initial request: they’ve offered you a concession. Because of the Reciprocity Principle, **they know that you’ll be more likely to match their concession with one of your own,** by saying “yes” to their second request.

The technique also fosters a deeper commitment from the customer. You’re more invested in following through on the contract or purchase because **you’ve been tricked into thinking that you “won” a hard-earned concession from the compliance professional**. Of course, you haven’t won anything: you’ve fallen perfectly into the trap they laid for you. The compliance professional is hoping to lure you into this cycle of reciprocal concessions.

The rejection-then-retreat tactic has been shown to be highly effective at getting people to accede to requests that they would otherwise reject out of hand. The “reasonable” second request doesn’t even have to be small for the tactic to work. It can still be an objectively large ask, as long as it’s smaller than the first request.

It should be noted, however, that there are limits to how effective this tactic is. If the initial request is _too_ outlandish, the tactic will backfire. For example, a compliance professional can’t ask $1 million for something that they really only want to charge $200 for.

> **TV Producers Vs. Censors: A Tale of Reciprocal Concessions**
> 
> Producers of shows that air on network television in the United States have to clear the shows’ content with censors at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) before it can be aired. The FCC will flag material that they deem to be inappropriate. But producers are good at using the Reciprocity Principle and the rejection-then-retreat tactic to get the content they want on the air. **Producers will deliberately insert lines into scripts that they _know_ will be rejected by the censors: they then pull back to the lines that they really wanted to include all along.** When Happy Days was on the air in the 1970s, producers included the word “virgin” in the initial script seven times. The censors ended up cutting six uses of the word and leaving in one, which was the producers’ plan from the start.

> **Talking the Top of the Line: A Sales Trick**
> 
> You might think that salespeople would want to show you the cheaper, economy model of a product first, because you’d be more likely to buy it. They could then talk you up to purchasing the more expensive model.
> 
> But you’d have it backwards. Salespeople always want to show you the most _expensive_ model first. This technique, called “talking the top of the line,” is a time-honored Reciprocity Principle move. If you buy the expensive model at first sight, then that’s obviously a win for the salesperson. But if you reject it, they’ll then show you the more reasonably-priced model. By contrast, it will look far more affordable than it really is. You’ll want to match the salesperson’s concession by conceding to buy the cheaper model.
> 
> The numbers bear this out: According to _Consumer Reports**sales figures were twice as high when customers were shown more expensive models first than when they were shown the cheaper models first**_. The lesson? Rejection-then-retreat _works_.

### Resisting Reciprocity

It’s important to defend yourself against compliance practitioners who employ the techniques we’ve discussed. **It’s hard to tell if someone is using reciprocity to exploit you or if they’re genuinely offering you something** with no expectation of anything in return. Accepting an invitation to a party and then inviting that person to your own party isn’t being exploited by the Reciprocity Principle: that’s exactly how networks of obligation are _supposed_ to work. There are plenty of people in our lives who simply wish to do acts of kindness for us.

Clearly then, **you can’t just refuse gifts and offers of help from _everyone_**. If you did that, you’d end up being pretty unhappy and socially isolated: as we’ve discussed, reciprocity is the glue that holds so much of society together.

The solution is to distinguish between exploiters and benefactors, and to treat the former objectively. Figure out if the person is an exploiter by asking yourself if they stand to gain by your acceptance of their favor. Are they doing something for you just to get something in return later? If so, then it’s not genuine: you should think of these interactions as a form of social predatory lending.

Once you’ve determined that someone offering you a gift, sample, or favor is really employing a compliance trick, you should cut off your reciprocity instinct. See the gift, not as a gift, but as a sales device.**You have no social obligation to return a _trick_ with a _favor_. **Don’t think of accepting the favor as putting you in their debt. You’re not.

It’s useful to be explicit in calling out the compliance practitioner for exactly what they’re doing. You can tell them, “I see what you’re doing. You’re offering me this free gift in the hopes that I’ll be more inclined to buy whatever it is you’re really selling. But**I don’t owe you anything, because your free offer was made in bad faith.”**

In fact, by taking their free sample and _not_ making a subsequent purchase, you _are_ living up to the Reciprocity Principle. You’re matching _their_ attempt to take advantage of you by taking advantage of _them_.
