## Chapter 7: The Scarcity Principle

The Scarcity Principle tells us that **we find more appealing those things with limited availability.** On a basic level, we encounter this all the time: rare goods are expensive, while abundant items are cheap.

Scarcity is closely related to the idea of _loss aversion_. As humans, we are powerfully guided by our desire to avert losing what we already have. We are inherently conservative and cautious. Loss aversion is a strong framing effect: we are more afraid of losing something than we are enticed by the hope of gaining something of equal value.

As you know by now, **compliance practitioners know how to frame their proposals to make them seem like rare, fleeting opportunities** that we’ll miss if we don’t capitalize on them immediately. “Limited-time only” or “first come, first serve” sales offers are the most common use of the Scarcity Principle. Compliance practitioners can greatly enhance the appeal of their product if they can convince you that what they’re selling is in short supply, will be taken off the market imminently, or is only available to an exclusive set of customers.

The Scarcity Principle is powerful because it manipulates our desire to be in control and have as many options of possible:**when we face a deadline or a competitive scramble for a rare item, our freedom to have whatever we want is limited.**

As we’ll see, the Scarcity Principle is most effective when:

  1. Something is rare;
  2. It has _recently_ become rare;
  3. It is rare because of social demand or competition.



### Why We Want What We Think We Can’t Have

Scarcity, or the appearance of it, is a powerful motivating factor in influencing our behavior. We want things we can’t have—or at least _think_ we won’t be able to have if we don’t act quickly and decisively.

Like our other fixed-action mental shortcuts, **scarcity usually _is_ a good gauge of how valuable something is. **It’s simple supply-and-demand: when there’s less of something and there’s a high demand for it, the price increases.

(Shortform note: Throughout human history, across all societies, humans have valued rare goods and skills. Gold was used as the standard for currency in ancient societies because it was a highly rare metal. In the late medieval and early modern period, European traders braved dangerous sea and land routes to access the spices of the East Indies, because they knew that the rarity of these commodities would make them desirable and valuable to other Europeans who couldn’t access them locally. Today, people with expertise in fields like bioengineering and cryptocurrency are paid very well because there are very few people who have their knowledge— there is a scarcity of their skillset.)

### Maximizing Choices: The Magnetic Pull of Scarcity

The Scarcity Principle derives much of its strength from**a phenomenon known as psychological reactance.** This is the adverse reaction we have to any restriction of our choices.

When something is freely available and abundant, we don’t feel any limitation in our options: we can have as much of it as we want. Conversely, **scarcity limits our choices,** especially when whatever we desire was previously abundant.

Psychological reactance stems from loss aversion, our desire to preserve what we already have: when this freedom is restricted, we desire the item more than we did before.

> **“The Terrible Twos”**
> 
> Anyone who has toddlers can tell you that the job of parenting becomes much harder after the child’s second birthday. Children at this age start exhibiting:
> 
>   1. Outright defiance (doing the opposite of what their parents tell them).
> 
>   2. Refusal to let their parents hold them _and_ simultaneous refusal to be put down.
> 
>   3. Rejection of food, sleep, and any other source of comfort that used to be able to calm them down.
> 
> 

> 
> The reason this happens is because **children become self-actualized at this age: they realize that they are full individuals.** They come to desire autonomy and freedom of choice: and saying “no” is the most powerful expression of that autonomy. They feel that this new freedom is being taken away from them (being made scarce) by attempts to force them to eat, sleep, or clean up their toys.
> 
> Thus, psychological reactance kicks in: they strenuously resist their parents’ attempts to curb their freedom through tantrums.

> **The Romeo and Juliet Effect**
> 
> The famous Shakespearean tragedy _Romeo and Juliet_ tells the story of two young star-crossed lovers who ultimately choose to take their own lives than let their feuding families tear the couple apart. Romeo and Juliet, however, might just be literature’s most famous example of psychological reactance.
> 
> Psychologists have studied the “Romeo and Juliet” effect to see the role that parental interference and restriction play in driving teenage romances. One study of 140 Colorado couples showed that **couples who reported parental disapproval of the relationship were _more_ likely to want to get married.**
> 
> Moreover, when the parental interference increased, so did the feelings of attraction. The lesson is clear: don’t spark psychological reactance if you’re a parent. If you don’t like your child’s significant other, your disapproval will likely drive your child right into their arms.

> **The Dade County Phosphate Saga**
> 
> By now, you should be getting the idea that psychological reactance makes us want what we can’t have. **It’s the forbidden fruit, the scarcity that makes it attractive.**

**> **One case from Florida stands as a powerful demonstration of this concept on a community-wide scale. In the early 1970s, Dade County, Florida (containing Miami) banned the use and possession of phosphate in cleaning products. The reaction of residents was classic psychological reactance: they began importing phosphate cleaners in droves, often resorting to smuggling and hoarding!

> Not only did they start consuming more phosphate cleaners, they also started changing their _attitudes_ and _opinions_ about these products. **The majority of Miami consumers came to see phosphate cleaners as being _better_ products than they had before**.
> 
> Psychological reactance produced the desire and then people retroactively assigned positive attributes to the product to justify that desire.

### Amplifying the Scarcity Principle

We’ve established that scarcity is a powerful motivator of human behavior and a useful tool for compliance practitioners.

A famous experiment by social psychologist Stephen Worchel demonstrated just how vulnerable human beings are to man-made scarcity. Test subjects were asked to eat a chocolate chip cookie from a jar and rate its taste and overall quality. But there was a twist: half the participants were asked to evaluate a cookie from a jar that contained ten, while the other participants were asked to rate a cookie from a jar containing only two.

Based on what you know about scarcity from the other examples in this chapter, you can probably guess that participants rated the “rarer” cookie as being tastier and of higher quality (though the cookies in both jars were identical).

OK, no surprise so far. But two additional findings from the study show that **scarcity is even stronger under certain conditions.**

#### Recent Scarcity

Worchel wanted to test and see if people would desire the cookies more not only if they began as scarcer, but if they had _recently become_ scarcer.

In this experimental twist, participants were first asked to evaluate cookies from the ten-cookie jar. They were _then_ asked to rate a cookie from the two-cookie jar. Thus, the previously abundant supply of cookies was suddenly and drastically reduced.

**This group that experienced a sharp drop in their cookie supply rated the cookies higher than those who had only known scarcity from the beginning.**

We can see this dynamic playing out in the real world, beyond the confines of this cookie experiment. People in the Soviet Union in the 1980s had become accustomed to a higher material standard of living and greater government tolerance of free expression under Premiere Mikhail Gorbachev’s twin policies of _perestroika_(reform)__ and _glasnost_(openness).

When a cadre of Communist Party hardliners ousted Gorbachev in 1989 in a coup and sought to reinstate the repressive policies of the Soviet past, the results were shocking to party leadership: the **people rebelled, rioted in the streets, and _refused_ to give back their newly earned and hard-fought freedoms**.

This was a classic example of the power of recent scarcity: freedoms were being taken away that people had become accustomed to. Once the Soviet people had tasted freedom, it was clear that they would fiercely resist any attempts to claw it back.

#### Scarcity Through Social Competition

Worchel added yet another twist to the cookie experiment. Certain participants who saw their cookie supply dwindle from ten to two were told that the experiments had made a mistake and over-assigned cookies to their jar.

_Another_ subset of participants, meanwhile, was told that their cookies had to be taken away so that they could be given to other raters.

The results were clear: **people liked the cookies more when they became scarce through social competition that they did when they became scarce by accident.**

> **Scarcity in Television**
> 
> A famous example from the world of network television illustrates just how firm a grasp scarcity-through-competition can have over people’s rational thought process. In the 1970s, Barry Diller was in charge of prime time programming at ABC. In 1973, he and his rival network executives were presented with what seemed like a great opportunity: to air the hit film, _The Poseidon Adventure_.
> 
> A bidding war for the rights to air the film broke out between Diller and the executives from NBC and CBS. In the end, Diller won the prize by agreeing to pay the movie studio the then-unprecedented sum of $3.3 million for one airing of the film. This was a gross overpayment by any standard: ABC ended up losing $1 million on the deal!
> 
> The Scarcity Principle (and its social competition accelerant) was the likely culprit for Diller’s colossal misjudgement. This was the first time a studio had put the rights to a film up for auction to the networks: **the competitive frenzy and desire not to be outbid made Diller vastly over-value the film.**

### Resisting the Scarcity Principle

How do you avoid getting caught up in the mania of scarcity? How do you resist the temptation of “buy now, limited-time only?”

Knowledge, as with the other principles, is power. When you sense that your desire for some scarce item or experience is clouding your judgement, precisely _because_ it is scarce, you should hit the pause button.

You’re never going to make a wise decision in this state of irrational exuberance. Compliance practitioners know this all too well, that’s why they try to work you up with scarcity tactics.

Once you realize that this is where your mind is going, you can begin to us your rational faculties to better assess the potential decision. Ask yourself, **“Do I truly want to _experience_ this scarce thing or merely possess it?”**

In other words, do you really value it for its intrinsic social, economic, material, or psychological benefits, or is your desire driven solely by scarcity itself? If your answer is the latter, then you are probably being lulled into a scarcity compliance trap.

Rare or scarce things aren’t inherently better than common things.Compliance practitioners know this better than anyone. Used-car salespeople, for example, know that they can greatly increase the desirability of a given car, simply by making potential customers wait in line while _other_ potential customers inspect it and take it for test drives.

But the fact that they have to wait doesn’t make the car any better: the tires, transmission, shocks, and alignment are still the same. These customers become consumed by their desire to _have_ the car, not by the actual _utility_ of the car.

You should remember this as you confront the compliance practitioners of the world. **Is the rarity of the thing itself what’s drawing you to it?** If so, are there any inherently desirable qualities that would _make_ the item rare? If there aren’t, then you might be buying something for entirely the wrong reasons.
