## Conclusion

By reading this summary, you’ve hopefully gleaned some important insight into how the compliance practitioners of the world are looking to pull the wool over your eyes by manipulating your fixed-action patterns.

Whether through reciprocity, consistency/commitment, social proof, liking, authority, or scarcity, the goal is always the same: **to get you to suspend your rational judgement and comply with a request that you would otherwise never agree to**. Although our fixed-action patterns were useful survival tools for our prehistoric ancestors (and still largely serve us well today), they are exploitable mental blind spots in the hands of a seasoned compliance practitioner.

By recognizing when someone is trying to pull one of these tricks on you, questioning your own decision-making process, and forcefully calling the tricksters out, you’ll lead a happier, less stressful life. You’ll make decisions for the right reasons. You’ll keep more of your money. Most importantly, **you won’t be a sucker.**
