## Exercise: Wanting Things For The Right Reasons

Figure out whether you _really_ want what you think you want.

* * *

Have you ever wanted something, solely because it was rare or difficult to obtain? Describe your emotions and thought process.

Think of something rare that’s actually cheap or undesirable. What do you think this says about the relationship between scarcity and quality?

How can you teach yourself to desire things because of their intrinsic value and not because they’re rare?
