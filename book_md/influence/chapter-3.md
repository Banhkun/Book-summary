## Chapter 3: The Consistency Principle

The Consistency Principle says that humans have an obsession with sticking to their guns. Consistency is closely related to commitment.**Once we’ve committed to a course of action or to a belief, we pressure ourselves to conform to that commitment.** We go through great mental gymnastics to convince ourselves that our current behavior and beliefs align with our past behavior and beliefs, even when they clearly don’t.

In one Canadian study, experimenters looked at the beliefs and behavior of bettors at a racetrack. Thirty seconds _before_ they placed their bets, they were uncertain about their horse. Just thirty seconds _after_ , however they were far more optimistic and confident in their choices. Nothing had objectively changed in this short span of time. The Consistency Principle just forced the bettors to bring their beliefs into line with the action they had already committed to.

The principle creates a valuable opening for those ever-present compliance practitioners. **By getting you to make just a small commitment, a skilled compliance practitioner can get you to make larger and larger ones.**

### Freedom From Thought: Why We’re So Consistent

Like the other instincts, consistency and commitment are powerful instincts that usually _do_ lead us to the correct conclusions and behaviors. Consistency is a luxury: it frees us from having to assess each situation individually.

**We don’t have to weigh every pro and con, sift through every obscure fact, or think through every possible ramification of every decision.** Instead, we have an easy, one-size-fits-all guide for how to react to a multitude of situations and people that we encounter each day.

The obvious benefits of consistency are why we value it so highly and have great disdain for those who don’t seem to embody it. We label people whose words and deeds don’t align as indecisive, weak, vacillating, and even dishonest.

(Shortform note: In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee John Kerry was lambasted by the media and his political opponents for his alleged inconsistency and was labelled a “flip-flopper.” This was based chiefly on his incongruous votes and statements with regard to the Iraq War. Exit poll results showed that this criticism of Kerry’s character played a role in his narrow defeat).

Conversely, we view people who exhibit high levels of consistency as being strong, decisive, resolute, and honest. Thus, **there is a strong social incentive for us to be consistent in our words, deeds, and even our thoughts.**

### The Commitment Trick: The Story of The American POWs

The experience of American POWs held by the Chinese Communists during the Korean War is a telling example of how the Consistency Principle can radically alter someone’s beliefs and behavior through even small, token acts of prior commitment.

The Chinese engaged in what they called a “lenient policy” toward their captives. Unlike their North Korean allies, they didn’t physically beat or torture their American captives. Instead, they engaged in a long campaign of psychological warfare against them.

In doing so, the Chinese were able to get these POWs to collaborate with their captors and inform on one another.**** In fact, American authorities concluded that **virtually _all_ Chinese-held American POWs collaborated with their captors in some way.**

#### Starting Small

How did the Chinese achieve this level of compliance? By manipulating the instinct for consistency and commitment.

They started small, first convincing prisoners to write down mildly anti-American statements like “America isn’t perfect,” with which it would be difficult for any reasonable person to disagree. By getting the prisoners to take even these seemingly innocuous positions, the Chinese could extract more and more. **They could rely on the Consistency Principle to bring the prisoners’ later actions into line with their previous commitment.**

#### Escalating the Commitment

Next, the Chinese escalated the commitment. They might, for example, ask a man to make a list of everything wrong with America, sign his name to it, and read it to his fellow POWs. If he resisted, his captors knew how to use consistency to bring him back in line. They could remind him, **“But this is really what you believe, right?”**

Psychologically it was hard for the man to wriggle out of his commitment: after all, his statement was plainly written on paper, in his handwriting. How could he deny the truth of the statement when he had written it himself? They would then take it even further by broadcasting his essay over the radio to the other prisoners and to all American troops and allies in the region.

**The public nature of the man’s commitment was critical:** he had now gone on record as being a collaborator, for everyone to see.

#### Changing Their Self-Identity

This is where the exploitation of the Consistency Principle really worked its effects. In making the prisoner’s collaboration known to the whole world, the Chinese had changed his self-conception. **He now thought of _himself_ as a collaborator, because of all his previous commitments.**

With this label as an ingrained part of his self-identity, the prisoner could reliably be expected to model _all_ of his future behavior and beliefs to conform to it. The prisoner’s change in beliefs could be staggering. By the end of the war, the POWs had come to believe wild Chinese propaganda about American germ warfare; the United States as an aggressive, imperialist power; and the merits of the communist system.

#### Minimal Rewards

Interestingly, while the Chinese didn’t resort to harsh punishment, they also didn’t give generous material incentives to collaborators. The rewards they did give were minor luxuries like cigarettes or fresh fruit.

This was also by design. If the Chinese granted the collaborators overly generous rewards for their compliance, they might provide the prisoners with a psychological escape hatch: the Americans would be able to convince themselves that they were only collaborating for material gain.

This was _not_ what the Chinese wanted. They wanted the Americans to genuinely come to embrace their new identity as collaborators. **The use of the Consistency Principle was just as much about changing _belief_ as changing _behavior_.**

### Getting A Foot In The Door

Of course, most of us (thankfully) won’t have to go through the experience of psychological manipulation in a POW camp. But everyday compliance practitioners like salespeople and fundraisers are just as adept at using the Consistency Principle against us as were the Chinese Communists.

By getting you to make one small commitment, savvy compliance practitioners know how to **rope you along and lock you into progressively larger commitments**. This is the time-honored “foot-in-the-door” sales tactic. Below, we’ll explore some examples that show just how effective this technique can be.

#### “Drive Carefully”

In a study conducted in California in the 1960s, a researcher posing as a volunteer worker went door-to-door asking residents if they would be willing to install a small, three-square-inch sign on their front lawn that read “BE A SAFE DRIVER.” Since it appeared to be a well-intentioned and public-spirited request that involved no sacrifice on the part of the homeowner, the great majority of respondents said yes.

Two weeks later, the research team went back to the same neighborhood and asked people if they would consent to having a massive, unattractive billboard (one that would almost obscure their entire house) that read “DRIVE CAREFULLY” set up on their property.

Among those who hadn’t been asked to install the small sign two weeks before, the response was expected: 83 percent said no to the outlandish request, and only 17 percent said yes. But among those who _had_ been asked and said yes to that earlier request, the results were startling: 76 percent of them agreed to let their front yards be taken up by the billboard! **Their earlier commitment made these homeowners far more willing to comply with the second, larger request.**

The researchers then replicated their experiment in another California neighborhood, but this time with a twist. They sent a researcher (again posing as a volunteer) around to make another simple request: this time, for residents to sign a petition to “keep California beautiful.” Then, two weeks later, they sent a different “volunteer” around to ask the petition-signers if _they_ would consent to erecting the same massive billboard on their lawns that the previous group had been asked to. Around half of the petition-signers agreed to this obviously preposterous request!

But how could this be? The first commitment was about state beautification, while the second was about driver safety. The two commitments seemingly had nothing to do with each other. How could they have been linked by the Consistency Principle?

Because the researchers, like the Chinese Communists, had altered their subjects’ self-identity. **By signing the petition, residents came to view themselves as civic-minded, public-spirited citizens.** With this newfound identity, the Consistency Principle did the rest of the work: **they complied in order to be consistent with their new vision of themselves.**

> 
> Large consumer-facing companies like Procter & Gamble often host contests asking participants to write short essays (usually less than 100 words) explaining why they love the company’s products, awarding large prizes to the winners.
> 
> On paper, it seems like the company gets the short end of the bargain: they have to give out a big prize and all they get is a few words of praise from customers. What’s the upside?
> 
> It turns out there’s a _big_ upside. These companies are taking a page out of the Chinese Communist playbook: **they’re getting as many people as they can to go on record as liking their products.** From what we’ve learned about the power of consistency and commitment, writing a “Why I Love Tide Detergent” essay would greatly influence future consumer behavior.

> It’s an easy way to get potentially hundreds of thousands of customers to self-identify as admirers of a product—and then buy lots of it to bring their actions in line with that identity.

### Commitment by Ordeal: Building Social Cohesion

We’ve seen that putting a commitment down in writing is extremely effective in activating the Consistency Principle to guide future behavior. This is because writing something down requires effort: and**the more effort that goes into making a commitment, the more likely it is to influence our beliefs and behavior.**

We see this dynamic most clearly in the elaborate hazing rituals practiced by American college fraternities and sororities. Pledges are subjected to harrowing ordeals where they are beaten, exposed to extreme weather conditions, forced to drink to excess, deprived of food and water, and other elaborate forms of painful initiation. Hazing like this has resulted in severe injuries, psychological trauma, and even death for many college students.

Why do these organizations continue subjecting their members to what can only be described as ritualized torture? It’s _not_ that frat boys are uniquely sociopathic or deviant (as their detractors would like to believe).

**It’s really all about group cohesion** : the pledges will value their membership in the fraternity _more_ if they’ve gone through excruciating lengths to earn it. Researchers believe that the roots of this lie in cognitive dissonance—the mental burden of carrying two contradictory beliefs at once. The worse the hazing is, the more your mind needs to convince you that joining the group will be a positive, fulfilling experience. Thus, hazing binds new recruits closer to the group through commitment and consistency: you invest more into the group, because it’s impossible to stomach the idea that you went through all this hazing for something you don’t actually want.

The fraternities strongly resist any attempts to substitute their hazing rituals for some other, more socially acceptable activity, like community service work. Like the Chinese Communists, the fraternities don’t want to give their pledges a mental “out.” They don’t want new members to be able to tell themselves that they’re going through the ordeal for any reason other than their loyalty and commitment to the group. **Fraternities want the pledges to own the commitment intrinsically.**

Charitable work (even if it was genuinely unpleasant) _would_ provide such a mental escape route: it would dilute the pledges’ intrinsic commitment to the group. Thus, the fraternities have a strong incentive to keep up practices like “Hell Week”: it fosters the behavior and beliefs in new pledges that make the group stronger. In fact, it’s the key to their survival.

This effect applites to any group that requires a tough initiation to get in—the military, a career,a workplace, even a casual social group.

### Combating Consistency

So how do you resist the tricks and manipulations of compliance professionals looking to use your instinct for consistency and commitment against you?

As we’ve seen, thinking and behaving in a consistent way can be useful. It makes our lives more predictable, stable, and unburdens us from having to assess each and every situation according to its unique merits. But stubborn, rigid consistency is bad. It leads us to make the wrong choices and shut off our faculties of reason and critical thinking.

**You need to know when to switch _off_ your consistency fixed-action pattern** and focus on the merits of the situation at hand.

#### Going With Your Gut

You can feel it in your gut when you’re being lured into a compliance trap. As a reminder, this is when you’re being asked to do something or affirm something that you intuitively know you don’t want to. You need to be able to spot these situations quickly, otherwise **the compliance professional will corner you with your own commitment.**

When you get this sinking feeling that you’re being manipulated, turn the table on the compliance practitioner. **Tell them that you’re onto them and you know _exactly_ what they’re trying to do. **You can be perfectly blunt and direct:

“I know in my heart of hearts that I don’t want the movie magazine subscriptions that you’re selling. It doesn’t matter that I answered in the affirmative to your questions asking if I liked cinema. All you’re doing is trapping me into statements that you can then use to get me to buy something I don’t need. **It would be dumb of me to throw my money away on something I don’t want, and I won’t let you manipulate me**. Please leave.”

You can learn from past instances where you were lured into a consistency/commitment trap.

After you make the poor decision, ask yourself **“Knowing what I know now, would I make this decision again?”** If your answer is “no,” then you know you were bamboozled by compliance trickery.

The solution is to trust your instincts better. Train yourself to be attentive and listen to the little voice inside your head that tells you “You don’t actually want to make this decision. Stop yourself.”

Also, don’t over-intellectualize. As humans, we experience our _feelings_ about something before we have time to intellectualize about it. Trust those feelings and don’t give yourself too much time to rationalize a poor decision. **Make decisions for a reason; don’t make reasons for a decision.**
