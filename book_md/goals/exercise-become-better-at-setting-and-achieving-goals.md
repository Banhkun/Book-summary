## Exercise: Become Better at Setting and Achieving Goals

Tracy says that you can achieve anything that you set your mind to, but that it’s best to start with smaller goals so you can gain more confidence and increase your belief in yourself.

* * *

List three of your goals. These can be personal or professional—just remember to keep them relatively small and manageable.

Which of these goals can you achieve in the shortest amount of time? By when do you aim to achieve it?

What are the potential obstacles to achieving this goal within your given time frame?

What’s one thing you can do today to start moving toward this goal?
