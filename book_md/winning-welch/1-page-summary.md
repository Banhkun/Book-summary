## 1-Page Summary

In _Winning_ , business executive and former General Electric CEO Jack Welch shares advice on how to win in the business world, whether you’re running your own company or trying to climb the corporate ladder.

Welch began his career at General Electric (GE) in the 1960s as a junior engineer. Over two decades, he worked his way up in the company, eventually becoming chair and CEO in 1981, where he remained for two decades until his retirement in 2001. Welch transformed GE into the most valuable company in the world and, in the process, became one of the nation’s best-known business leaders. His ideas on business strategy and corporate management continue to guide the business world. His first book, _Jack: Straight from the Gut_ , is an autobiography on his career at GE. _Winning_ (2005), on the other hand, is a business guidebook containing the most useful information he gathered during his successful career.

In our guide, we’ll first look at some of Welch’s general business principles, such as the controversial practice of differentiation (sorting out your company's best and worst) and the importance of candor in the workplace. Then, we’ll review his advice on more specific business practices like how to hire effectively and how to adapt your company. We’ll finish with his tips on advancing your career, which include finding the right job and handling work-life balance. We’ll also take a deeper look at Welch’s advice, comparing and contrasting it with that of other notable business leaders.

### General Principles of Business

We’ll begin with some of Welch’s big-picture principles for running a successful company: candor and differentiation.

#### Candor

According to Welch, candor is one of the most important qualities to cultivate in your organization. **People should be encouraged to be outspoken, direct, and honest in their communication**.

(Shortform note: In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott argues that establishing “radical candor” in your organization, or a culture of respectful honesty and frankness, will make it more effective. Scott says that being a boss is about managing relationships, and it can be difficult to find the proper balance between being too friendly and too harsh. Radical candor helps strike this balance and is guided by two key principles: caring personally for people and challenging them. Caring personally for people will show that they can trust you, and it will make them more receptive to your feedback. Challenging them will motivate them to improve and give them clear guidance on how to do so.)

Welch claims that establishing candor in your organization helps in three key ways:

  1. **It produces ideas**. When everyone in your company is accustomed to speaking their mind, and accustomed to others speaking _their_ minds, without fear of punishment or ridicule, more meaningful and productive conversations occur. More ideas are presented, and these ideas are discussed and criticized until the best idea wins out. 
  2. **It saves your organization time**. Because ideas are being openly debated and discussed, your organization can get to the best ideas quicker. Instead of people keeping their mouths shut or tiptoeing around criticisms of their coworkers’ or bosses’ ideas, people will speak their minds and move on.
  3. **It saves your organization money**. A candid organization is less likely to waste money on meetings where nothing of substance is said or reports that don’t contribute value to the company’s bottom line. Instead, employees can focus on the things they feel are actually important.



According to Welch, the method for creating a more candid company culture is straightforward:**Recognize and reward candid behavior as much as possible**. Over time, people will grow accustomed to direct and honest communication, and they’ll grow to appreciate and see the value in it.

> **How Radical Candor Helps Your Company**
> 
> Though Welch looks at how a companywide culture of candor can help your organization become more effective and efficient, Scott, in _Radical Candor_ , takes a more focused approach, examining how candid leadership helps motivate individuals and improve the team’s productivity. This will not only save the organization time and money, it will enrich the lives of everyone in the company. Scott says radical candor helps your teams in four key ways:
> 
> **By building trusting relationships** : Candor can help you show your team that you care, which will build trust and motivate them to accomplish more. To build trust, you must not only be candid with your employees but also give them autonomy in their work and respect their boundaries.
> 
> **By improving the feedback you give and receive** : To help your team be more candid, you should first request criticism from them and show them how to respond appropriately. Ask for feedback and show you’re grateful for their criticism by listening and making a noticeable effort to follow their advice. To give feedback, your criticism should be based on helping your team member, not on lambasting them for their mistakes. Also, whenever possible, make sure you give constructive criticism in private, in-person conversations rather than in front of the whole team.
> 
> **By helping your team members grow** : As a manager, it’s important to know and understand your employees’ goals and motivations not only to build trust but also so you can support them to be the best employee and person they can be. With radical candor, an employee can comfortably share their goals and ambitions with you, and you can help them achieve these goals with honest advice.
> 
> **By building a collaborative atmosphere** : Similar to Welch’s ideas on how candor helps produce the best ideas efficiently, Scott argues that radical candor helps teams collaborate effectively and achieve much more together than they could separately. Scott says that a radically candid team will listen to each other, clarify what they mean, debate ideas, make decisions together, and then execute the plan.

#### Differentiation

Another guiding principle Welch advocates is what he calls “differentiation,” one of his most influential yet controversial ideas. **Differentiation is a process in which you identify the best- and worst-performing people, products, and services within your company, then nurture your best performers and remove your worst.** Welch claims that differentiation can greatly improve your organization’s chance of success.

(Shortform note: As a business term, differentiation usually refers to product differentiation, in which a company tries to make its products or services stand out from the competition. Product differentiation is focused _outwardly_ on other companies and products. However, when Welch speaks of differentiation, he’s inwardly focused, seeking to improve the company’s value by differentiating between and improving its products, people, or practices. For GE during Welch’s tenure in the 1980s, differentiation meant eliminating 100,000 jobs, dropping poorly performing products like clocks and TVs, and expanding into financial services and broadcasting.)

When it comes to products or services, differentiation means determining the most profitable sectors of your business and allocating resources to those key areas. With people, it means promoting or rewarding your best employees and firing your worst. Let’s look at both approaches.

##### Product Differentiation

Welch says that every company has its strong products or services and that investing more heavily in these will help your company flourish. To do this, you must first determine the criteria for what makes a “strong” product or service. For a large corporation, the definition of strong might be related to the product or service’s market share or growth rate. For smaller companies, you might determine your strongest products or services by the amount of revenue or profit they generate. Whatever your criteria, you need to have a clear understanding of the strong and weak parts of your business.

Once you know your business’s strengths and weaknesses, Welch recommends **committing your resources to the strengths and removing the weaknesses**. For a corporation, this might mean selling off the parts of your business that don’t have a steady market share or aren’t growing quickly enough. For smaller businesses, this might mean allocating all your marketing to your most profitable product and removing the least successful products from your catalog. According to Welch, committing and adhering to this process may hurt short-term revenues but will benefit the long-term health of your organization, as it ensures the underperforming parts of your business don’t languish and chip away at profits.

> **Other Factors to Consider Before Differentiating**
> 
> Before fully committing to Welch’s strategy of bolstering your company’s strengths and removing weaknesses, you may want to consider a few other variables. In _The Marketing Plan_ , William Luther says you should understand key variables about your product’s chance of success, and these variables may also affect how much you want to commit to a product or service. Let’s look at two of the variables Luther recommends understanding:
> 
> **Market size** : This is simply the total number of potential customers for your product or service. If you have a successful product, but it has a relatively small market size, it may be best to allocate resources to other products with a larger market size and thus more room for growth.
> 
> **Market Life Cycle** : It’s important to know what stage of the market cycle your product is in. According to Luther, there are three stages: introductory (when a new product or service hits the market), early growth (when the product or service begins to gain traction and consumer interest picks up rapidly), and late growth/decline (when the product or service is widely available and the leading companies are established). If you determine one of your strongest products by revenue is in the late growth stage, you might consider allocating resources to a weaker product in the introductory or early growth stages instead. Sometimes, it may be best to go against Welch’s advice of cutting out weaknesses.

##### Employee Differentiation

The more controversial side of differentiation is employee differentiation, which involves systematically firing your worst-performing employees.

Welch provides a specific method to implement employee differentiation: the 20-70-10 rule. The 20-70-10 rule recommends categorizing your workforce into the top-performing 20%, the middle 70%, and the bottom 10%. Then, reward the top performers, keep the middle, and fire the bottom. Though Welch admits that **implementing employee differentiation can be brutal, in the end, it’s both an effective and moral practice**.

(Shortform note: Welch’s method of differentiating employees based on the top 20% of performers is reminiscent of the Pareto Principle, which states that in many instances, 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. Applied to a workforce, this means you get 80% of productivity from the top 20% of employees. In The 80/20 Principle, Richard Koch explains that you can use the Pareto Principle to improve your business in several ways. Not only can you apply the 80/20 principle to help identify the top performers of your organization, you can also use it to simplify parts of your business and eliminate waste. For example, you can outsource the less important work or cut down on bloated management.)

Welch claims that employee differentiation is effective because it promotes candor and motivates employees. In a company that uses differentiation, employees know where they stand and if they need to improve. While some say that differentiation can be _demotivating_ to the middle 70%, Welch claims that most people in the middle 70% will try to reach the top 20% to receive rewards such as bonuses, stock options, or promotions for their work. Furthermore, when the top performers _aren’t_ rewarded for their production, _they_ can become less motivated, which will substantially harm the business.

Welch further claims that, despite the controversy surrounding it, employee differentiation is moral for several reasons. First, retaining underperforming employees isn’t doing them any favors. Eventually, these underperformers will probably have to be let go, so it’s best to get it over with. Second, differentiation involves honestly assessing an employee’s performance, which, along with the threat of potential termination, will help employees either improve or find something they’re better at. Finally, differentiation is moral simply because it’s necessary in order to stay competitive in today’s business world. If you don’t do everything in your power to improve your business, it’s likely to fail, and then _everyone_ loses their jobs, not just the bottom 10%.

> **Critiques of Employee Differentiation**
> 
> Though Welch heartily defends employee differentiation, the effectiveness and morality of the system are heavily debated. Highlighting the many problems of employee differentiation, major companies such as Microsoft, Ford, and Capital One have dropped the system.
> 
> Also known as “forced ranking,” “stacked ranking,” and “rank and yank,” employee differentiation can cause many problems in a company that may hurt its productivity. Critics say, for example, that it can cause a toxic and anxiety-filled workplace, as workers are pitted against each other and many, even above-average producers, constantly worry about being fired. No matter how you implement it, employees may feel they’re being judged and treated unfairly, which leads to low morale and self-interested employees who don’t work well together. Because of this, if a company relies heavily on teamwork and cooperation, differentiation may be especially harmful.
> 
> Another problem is the logistical issues of systematically ranking and firing employees. For one, high turnover can be incredibly costly. Also, as some critics point out, if you annually fire the bottom 10% of your workforce, you should have a largely productive workforce after a few years: As you remove people at the bottom, everyone slides down the scale, and valuable employees will eventually be removed, resulting in a less productive company. Further, this might also result in people who were previously in the top 20% being “demoted” to the middle 70%, potentially demoralizing workers who were previously considered highly productive.
> 
> There are also several arguments against the morality of forced ranking. A system that commonly leads to a toxic and hostile workplace culture can easily be seen as unethical. Beyond this, however, it can also lead to discriminatory practices. It led to age-related discrimination lawsuits for companies such as Ford and Goodyear, for example, and to a gender and race discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft. Whether forced ranking was the cause of or merely used as a cover for discrimination is up for debate, but either way, the ethics of a practice heavily associated with discrimination is questionable.

### How to Manage Your Company

Now we’ll look at some of Welch’s advice regarding best business practices, such as hiring, people management, and adaptation.

#### How to Hire Effectively

Welch emphasizes the importance of having strong hiring practices as a way to ensure the right people are working for your business. He claims that hiring is a tricky process, and though a strong résumé and experience are important, **you’ll often have to rely on instinct to determine who will be best for the job**. Through trial and error, Welch has identified five key characteristics to look for when hiring an employee:

  1. **Vigorous** : You want employees who are active and optimistic. Such people work hard and get along well with others.
  2. **Inspirational** : You want employees who can inspire and motivate others through both their words and actions.
  3. **Decisive** : In business, people have to make tough decisions, and they often don’t have as much time or information as they’d like to have. You want employees who try to analyze situations and make the best possible decisions when they can, but who are also not afraid to make a quick decision when necessary.
  4. **Effective** : Make sure your employees know how to get the job done. Welch admits that effectiveness can be easily overlooked—sometimes people seem to have great potential and the right characteristics but for whatever reason can’t implement decisions effectively. 
  5. **Enthusiastic** : Finally, you want employees who are excited about the work they’re doing. No matter your work ethic or business experience, it’s enthusiasm that truly sets people apart. 



> **Alternative Hiring Strategies**
> 
> Though Welch says that his five characteristics to look for have been effective for him, he also acknowledges that there are many different ways to go about hiring effectively. Let’s look at some hiring advice from other business experts and see how it stacks up against Welch’s advice.
> 
> One thing to consider is that it might be better to hire based on what people excel at rather than trying to find someone who ticks every box. As Peter Drucker says in _The Effective Executive_ , you won’t ever find the perfect candidate, so it’s best to focus on the traits you feel are most important. Though you may want to find someone who exhibits all five of Welch’s key characteristics, it may be more realistic and effective to determine which two or three characteristics are most important for the job. If you’re hiring a salesperson, for example, you might determine that energy and enthusiasm are the most important traits. If you’re hiring a manager, you may want someone who is decisive and inspirational.
> 
> What’s more, since Welch stresses the importance of using your instincts to find people with the right characteristics, you should focus more on interviewing the candidates personally rather than comparing their skills and experience on paper. In _Scaling Up_ , Verne Harnish recommends limiting your in-person interviews to five or 10 candidates so that you can perform comprehensive interviews with each interviewee. This will help you determine if the candidate has the right attributes and temperament to fit in with your company’s culture and values.

#### How to Manage Your Employees

Once you’ve hired the right people, you must set them up for success and manage them effectively. Welch provides several tips for managing employees:

**Establish a strong human resources department** : Welch argues that HR is crucial to the success of any company and yet is often overlooked or disregarded. HR, when implemented correctly, should be a transparent organization that addresses employees’ concerns, fosters compromise between departments, and helps people develop. Businesses are filled with people, and there will always be interpersonal conflict—office politics, hurt feelings, and disagreements. A strong HR department that has true power helps alleviate conflict and ensure that the company is as healthy and strong as it can be.

(Shortform note: Ben Horowitz, in _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , agrees with Welch on the importance of a strong HR department, framing it as a company’s quality assurance: HR may not be able to create a positive company culture on its own, but it can tell when things are bad: when a company’s culture is toxic, for instance. Horowitz outlines five specific areas in which an HR team is especially helpful: Hiring (is the interview process effective?), compensation (is employee pay fair and competitive?), training (does the training process get employees up to speed efficiently?), management (is the performance review/feedback system fair and effective?), and motivation (do employees work hard consistently?).

**Create a strong system for evaluating performance** : According to Welch, most companies don’t have a good method for evaluating employees. Though every company’s will differ, Welch says that an evaluation system should be direct (clearly stating what the employee did well and where they can improve), data-driven (using quantitative data to measure performance), and should occur at least once a year (though more frequent evaluations may be helpful).

> **CFRs: An Alternative to Annual Reviews**
> 
> While Welch argues that performance reviews should occur at least once a year, annual performance reviews are no longer the standard, with many companies now favoring more frequent manager check-ins or self-evaluations.
> 
> In _Measure What Matters_ , for example, John Doerr provides an alternative to annual performance reviews: CFRs (Conversations, Feedback, Recognition). CFRs emphasize continuous improvement and addressing issues promptly rather than waiting for a yearly review. CFRs involve weekly or monthly conversations between managers and employees, constant feedback between managers and employees, and recognition of accomplishments from both peers and managers. Echoing Welch’s advice, CFRs are direct (they aim to give clear feedback on how to improve) and data-driven (they focus on accomplishments and results).

**Delineate clear roles and responsibilities, with as few hierarchy layers as possible** : Welch points out that many companies, especially bigger ones, suffer from a lack of clarity regarding each employee’s role within the company. To avoid this, design a detailed organizational chart that clearly shows the work each employee is responsible for and who they report to. This will promote transparent communication and ensure that everyone knows what they should be doing on a daily basis.

(Shortform note: In _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , Patrick Lencioni argues that clearly outlining each person’s responsibilities also helps solve one of his five dysfunctions: lack of accountability. He argues that in addition to each person’s responsibility, you should publicly post the goals and standards of the organization. This will make crystal clear what the team needs to accomplish as well as what each individual needs to do to accomplish it. It also shifts accountability and discipline from the managers to the entire team, as each team member will be encouraged to pull their weight and hold others accountable when they aren’t contributing to the team’s goals or adhering to the organization’s standards.)

Welch recommends having as few layers of hierarchy in your company as possible because they cost the company time and money. He claims that some companies keep adding levels within their ranks as they grow; others add layers so they can more easily promote top performers. But a company with too many hierarchy layers becomes difficult to manage and for employees to navigate. It also tends to add unnecessary costs and complicate even the most basic business decisions, requiring employees and managers to run every decision up the chain of command. Instead of having several rungs of managers within one department, it’s better to have one manager who oversees the department and reports directly to the CEO.

(Shortform note: The authors of _No Rules Rules_ point out other key benefits of a company structure with fewer hierarchies: It empowers employees and fosters innovation. Many companies, they argue, require all big decisions to go through the higher-ups in a company, and these higher-ups may have a fixed mindset and limited perspective that can limit innovative ideas. A company with fewer hierarchies, however, lets its employees make decisions based on what they think is best for the company rather than what they think their bosses will approve of, so these decisions won’t be limited by the perspectives of a few senior executives.)

#### How to Adapt

Along with hiring the right people and having an effective management system, successful companies must also know how to adapt to changing market conditions. Yet enacting change within a company can sometimes feel like an uphill battle—employees are often resistant to change, and it can be costly and time-consuming. Welch gives three pieces of advice on how to adapt successfully.

**Adapt purposefully** : Because change is a necessary part of business, a common mistake companies make is to enact change without a clear direction in mind, jumping on the latest trend or trying to adapt in several ways at once. This can lead to a disorganized work environment in which time and money are wasted and employees don’t buy into the new way of doing things.

But if you instead adapt thoughtfully, with a clear goal, things will go much more smoothly. To do this, Welch recommends backing your changes with as much data as possible. This will ensure that the changes are actually good for the business and will be implemented correctly.

For instance, if you’re a car company looking to adapt to the rapidly growing market for electric vehicles, you should research _everything_ that might affect this transition—the expected market share of EVs, the expected cost of research and development, design, marketing, and manufacturing, customer sentiment regarding greener energy, quantity and quality of potential competitors, and so on. With this data, you’re more likely to make a sound business decision, and when your employees see the amount of research that’s gone into the decision, they’re more likely to be on board with the change.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Blue Ocean Strategy _provide advice on how to determine if a changing market trend is worth adapting to. You should adapt to a trend if it meets the following criteria: 1) The trend has a meaningful impact on your company. A change in how people consume media won’t have a big effect on a car company, but a change in the durability of engine materials will. 2) The trend must have a lasting, irreversible impact. For example, the trend toward more sustainable, environmentally friendly vehicles isn’t likely to be reversed. 3) The trend must have a clear direction. If you aren’t sure whether the vehicle market is trending toward electric vehicles or cleaner fuel alternatives, you can’t adapt your company with a clear goal in mind.)

**Dismiss the obstructors** : Though a purposeful and data-backed change will help sway the skeptics, there will always be employees who remain resistant. Welch says you have to get rid of the people who aren’t on board with the change. Not only will they provide little value, they’ll also lower the morale and motivation of everyone else.

(Shortform note: In _Leading Change_ , John Kotter writes that the people in your company most resistant to change are often managers. Because managers have extensive knowledge of the way things currently work, they usually feel they’ll be the ones to suffer the most from organizational changes. Further, their knowledge of the company and their power within it can make their resistance especially difficult to navigate. Kotter argues that the best way to deal with resistant managers is to approach them early and clearly explain why the change is necessary. Like Welch, Kotter argues that if a manager refuses to adapt, you must get rid of them.)

**Search for opportunities everywhere** : Sometimes, it’s obvious what changes your company needs to make—for example, buying out a struggling competitor for pennies on the dollar or transitioning to e-commerce with the rise of the internet. But Welch claims that to be a truly successful and adaptive company, you need to be constantly on the lookout for less obvious changes. This might mean staying up to date on the latest technologies or emerging industries. By staying ahead of the curve on potential changes your company can make, you ensure that you’re one step ahead of the competition and, when a new market trend develops, you’re not the last one to realize it.

(Shortform note: In _Only the Paranoid Survive_ , Andrew Grove provides advice on how to prepare for unexpected changes in the marketplace. Grove outlines six key areas in which a drastic change might occur: Current competitors, potential competitors, government regulations, customers, suppliers, and complementary businesses. By keeping your eye on changes in these areas, you can ensure that your company can adapt promptly to any market disruptions.)

### Advancing Your Career

Now let’s explore some of Welch’s tips on how to further your career. We’ll look at his advice on finding the right job, getting promotions, and handling work-life balance.

#### Finding the Right Job

Welch claims that finding a job that’s the right fit for you can only be done through trial and error. There is simply no way of knowing how much you’ll like a job, or how good you’ll be at it, until you try it out. Furthermore, it’s important to understand that no job is perfect and there will always be things you don’t like about it.**It’s not about finding the _perfect_ job, but the one that best suits your needs and capabilities**.

(Shortform note: In _What Color Is Your Parachute_ , Richard Bolles argues that job hunting is about learning who you are and what you want to do with your life. Though you may not know if a job is truly right for you until you try it, Bolles provides some tips on how to find a job that matches your identity and life goals. He recommends the flower exercise, in which you look at yourself from different angles such as compatibility with people, skills, purpose, and knowledge. Having a better understanding of yourself will provide clarity on what you want to do with your life.)

That said, there are things to look for that can help you determine if a job is the right fit:

**People** : Perhaps the most important part of any job is the people you work with. Welch claims that no matter how much you enjoy the work or how much money you make, you’ll be miserable if you don’t enjoy being around your coworkers. Pay careful attention to whether the organization and the people within it share your general attitude toward work and life. If you find early on that the people you work with aren’t “your kind of people,” it may be better to cut your losses and search for another job.

(Shortform note: Though you want to have a job with coworkers you like, quitting may not be a valid option, and even when you like most of your coworkers, it’s likely there will be one or two who you don’t get along with. Here is some expert advice on dealing with difficult coworkers: 1) Recognize your triggers: Acknowledge the things your coworker does that bother you so you can respond better to them. 2) Understand your differences: Knowing that you and a coworker have different priorities and approaches to work (and that that’s OK) can help you be more accepting of them. 3) Offer help: Offering help or advice to a difficult coworker can improve your relationship and might change your perspective on them.)

**Opportunities** : Welch argues that a job should provide you with opportunities both while you’re working there and after you leave it. By that he means that a job should help you grow as a person and learn new things while also giving you the credentials to further your career elsewhere if you choose to do so. Finding a job that challenges you is important because learning and growing keeps you motivated and mentally sharp. And a job that gives you credentials gives you options if your priorities change.

(Shortform note: Experts note that today’s career paths require more individual intention in order to build skills and find growth opportunities. There are so many career options, and so many skills that may boost your opportunities, that it can be difficult to know when to seek out new employment. There are some signs, however, that may indicate it’s time for a new job: 1) You aren’t learning. If you feel your job is too easy, it’s probably time to get out. 2) There’s no opportunity for career advancement. If you feel you can’t get a raise or promotion at your current job, you should seek out one in which you can. 3) You want to try something new. Sometimes, you just get tired of doing the same things and need to shake things up.)

**Joy and meaning of the work** : Though a job with the right people and opportunities is important, the work itself must also bring you happiness and meaning. Welch claims that if you find yourself making excuses for having a job, like that the money is too good to pass up, it may be better to find something else. He also says you don’t need to think too hard about whether you’re passionate about the work—when you find a job you’re truly passionate about, you’ll know.

(Shortform note: In _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , Cal Newport agrees with Welch—you shouldn’t think too hard about finding a job you’re passionate about. He says that the popular notion that you should find a job based on a pre-existing passion is flawed. He claims that you’re more likely to find happiness and meaning in jobs in which you feel competent and have autonomy and that most people who love their jobs don’t get them by following their passions. Therefore, Newport argues that you should focus primarily on improving your skills, as this will increase your feeling of competence and will give you more autonomy in your career and your life.)

#### How to Improve Your Chances of Promotion

Welch argues that getting promoted often requires a fair amount of luck, but there are some things you can do to improve your chances.

**Expand your role** : One major way to increase your chances of getting a promotion is to expand your position to include more responsibilities. This will help you prove your value to the company and stand out from the crowd. For example, if you’re a salesperson looking to become a sales manager, you could expand your role by coming up with a new sales strategy that everyone can use.

(Shortform note: Though expanding your role may make you a more valuable employee, some argue that the best way to increase your value is to focus on your most vital tasks. In _Eat That Frog!_ , Brian Tracy says there are likely three tasks that account for most of the value you contribute at work. To perform at your best, he says you should focus as much of your time and energy on these three tasks as possible, which would run counter to Welch’s advice to take on responsibility for _more_ tasks.)

**Embrace change** : Since adapting to change is crucial in business, employees who embrace change are more likely to receive promotions. Quickly and wholeheartedly embracing the new project or initiative your company is implementing is a surefire way to impress your bosses and prove your worth.

(Shortform note: Embracing change has become so vital to a company’s success that some companies employ an executive whose job is to foster change throughout the organization: a chief transformation officer (CTO). Experts point to certain qualities a CTO should have: They should be an independent thinker willing to challenge the status quo, have high emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills, and inspire others with enthusiasm. If you wish to impress your manager and get promoted, you might consider emulating these qualities.)

**Seek out advice** **from multiple mentors** : Welch says you should seek out advice from as many mentors as you can, both formal and informal. By gathering as much useful information as you can, you’ll stand out from the crowd. You might have one person who fits the classic mentor mold (an older, more experienced person in your industry that you meet with regularly), but you should also look for advice from people younger than you, people outside your work, and anywhere else you can find it.

(Shortform note: While studies show that formal mentors are common among business elites, experts note that we learn from formal and informal mentors throughout our lives. Just as you learned from multiple people growing up (your mother, father, siblings, teachers, friends, and so on), if you wish to advance your career, you should seek out advice from as many sources as possible. To do this, psychologists recommend that you reach out to those you admire and develop relationships with them. More often than not, they’ll be happy to share their knowledge and help you on your journey. When developing such a relationship isn’t an option, simply observe those you admire and learn from their words and actions.)

#### Handling Work-Life Balance

There’s no perfect way to balance work and your social life, but **if you want to advance your career, you’ll have to make some sacrifices**. How much you’re willing to sacrifice is up to you, but Welch says that to make the best decision for yourself, there are a few things you need to understand about work-life balance:

**You and your boss have different priorities** : Your boss’s priority is to get as much value out of you as possible. This doesn’t mean most bosses expect you to give _everything_ to the company, but they’ll take as much as they can get. A boss gets paid to keep their employees productive, and most bosses will be willing to work with you on work-life balance if you’ve proven your value to the company and can remain productive.

(Shortform note: Though you should understand that you and your boss don’t have the same priorities and that you have to make sacrifices for your career, there are ways to deal with a boss you feel is too demanding. **First,** b**e transparent** : Have a personal conversation with your boss, letting them know you’re committed to work but also have other responsibilities. **Second, empathize** : _Show_ that you understand the pressure they’re under to perform and ask what their biggest concerns are. This may help you better understand the work they value the most. **Finally, communicate** : Show your boss that you’re getting the work done. Check in as often as you can and let them see what you’re working on.)

**Figuring out how to balance work and life is ultimately up to you** : Welch says that some bosses are more accommodating than others, but ultimately, it’s your job to figure out how to balance work and life. A boss can help with scheduling or help you be more efficient, but you’re the one who has to implement that advice. You have to decide what your values are and what you need to do to make them a reality. If that means quitting a job that you feel demands too much of your time, so be it, but only you can make that decision.

(Shortform note: Welch says that you should clarify your values so you can balance work and life appropriately, but how do you choose your values? In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown recommends narrowing it down to your two most important values, as trying to live by too many values can make it more difficult to commit to them. Since determining your values is deeply personal and something only you can do for yourself, think long and hard about what you truly value, not what you think you _should_ value or what you want others to think of you. If narrowing it down to two values proves difficult, try making a list of 10 values and trimming from there.)

Once you understand your boss’s priorities and your own values, here are two things you can do to best achieve your desired work-life balance:

**Keep work and life separate** : However you prioritize your work and life, Welch says it’s important to remain focused on the task at hand and the people you’re with. When you’re at work, give it your full attention. Don’t plan your family vacation when you’re supposed to be working or text your spouse during a meeting. Similarly, try to limit the amount of time you work when you’re with family and friends. Don’t check your emails while playing with your kids or constantly talk business on a night out with friends.

(Shortform note: In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott says that instead of viewing work and life separately, work-life balance is about finding a way to integrate these two parts of your life in an enriching way. It’s okay, for example, to practice self-care at home so that you can perform better at work. Likewise, it’s okay to talk about work outside the office if you want to. Scott recommends trying to view work and life not as two aspects of your identity competing against one another, but as different parts of your whole self that complement each other.)

**Set boundaries** : Once you’ve determined your priorities, Welch says you must be able to say no to requests that disrupt your chosen work-life balance. Welch points out that saying ‘no’ can be hard for many career-oriented people, as they think being an agreeable person shows they’re willing to work hard. But if you say yes too often, achieving the goals you set for yourself becomes nearly impossible.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown provides some guidelines on how to deal with people who ignore your boundaries: 1) Don’t solve other people’s problems. It’s okay to help someone occasionally, but if you constantly solve their problems you’re cutting into your own time and enabling their behavior. 2) Create an agreement. Clarify to coworkers what you _will_ help them with and won’t you won’t help them with. This way, they’ll ask for help only when it falls within your boundaries, and you won’t constantly be telling them no.)
