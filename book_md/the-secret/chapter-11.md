## Chapter 11: The World and Your Role In It

You’ve learned how the Law of Attraction can help improve your personal life and well-being. But your personal life takes place in a public sphere. You can use the Law of Attraction to improve the world around you as you have to improve your life.

You may believe you are insignificant and have no power in the world, but that belief is a fallacy. Your thoughts shape the world. Rather than feeling powerless to change the world, **use your power of creation to bring about the positive you want to see.**

**Everything around you was created through a thought.** Some things continue to gain power as more and more people see them and turn their thoughts toward them, good or bad.

Focusing on the negative aspects of the world will not help. Not only will your negative thoughts add power to the thing you don’t like, but they also put you on a personal negative frequency, attracting more negativity to your life.

  * If you constantly worry about violence and anger, the Law of Attraction must bring back people, situations, or events that reflect violence or make you angry.
    * Instead, focus on a world where everyone feels love and joy. 
  * If you are disheartened by poverty and hunger, focus on abundance for everyone and more than enough food to feed the world.
    * Instead of sending out a frequency where people do not have enough to survive, you are transmitting a frequency where everyone is fed and secure.



When you focus on and feel joy, you bring joy into your life and into the world.

### Resistance Is Not the Way

As you resist the pictures you see on the outside, you are focusing on those pictures. That focus only adds more energy and power to them. **If your thoughts are on what you don’t like, you are only serving to call forth more of the same picture.**

  * Byrne uses the example of a statement made by Mother Theresa. She stated she would not go to an anti-war protest. But if there was a pro-peace rally, she’d be the first one there.



It may seem like there is always the same terrible story on the news, and why is that? Is it possible that society’s interest in and acceptance of flashy, scintillating headlines is attracting more of the same? Is humanity addicted to the act of resistance and has become obsessed with stories that trigger that feeling?

It is easy to become captivated by the pictures you see around you. But if those pictures are not of what you want, turn your mind to the pictures of what you do. Rather than resisting what we don’t like, **focus on the opposite of what you resist. Turn your thoughts to what you want to happen.**

### One Universal Mind to Govern Us All

Understanding that every person and everything in life is governed by the same Law of Attraction, the One Universal Mind, helps to strengthen community and the world. **We are all connected as part of the One Mind.** Although we feel separate from each other, the One Mind is the umbrella over all of us.

The One Mind is everywhere, encompassing all knowledge, wisdom, and goodness at the same time. In short, it is perfection. Because of this all-encompassing connection, **every possibility capable of existing already does**.

Believing that the world is every person for themselves deviates from that One Mind. Conflict, competition, rage, and hate all stem from the belief that you are separate from everyone else. When you believe you are separate, you create negative emotions and a negative environment around you. **Fear is the basis of nearly all negative emotions.**

  * For example, when you feel the need to compete with another, those thoughts stem from an ideology of lack. You are afraid there is a finite supply of this or that for a finite number of people. 
  * Even if you think you have won, you never truly win when you compete.
  * Your thoughts of limitation and lack will attract other people and circumstances with whom or in which you must compete. You are on the lack frequency, and experiences that mirror lack will continue to show up in your world.



There is more than enough for everyone, as the One Mind holds all possibilities for all people. You don’t need to compete. All you have to do is ask, believe, and receive.

#### How to Change the World with the One Mind

Now that you know all things in life are governed by the One Mind, you can use that knowledge to call forth things into the world to improve the world.

All information and understanding, all innovations, and all inventions for the future exist within the One Mind as possibilities. What could be different in the world? If you look around, do you see a need for something? Do you find yourself thinking, “Life would be so much better if we had a [fill in the blank]”?

Let’s say you live in a community where public transportation is not an option. You see your fellow community members struggling because they’re not mobile. You find yourself wishing there was a system to bring the advantages of city life to the outskirts.

  * Use your imagination to bring your idea to fruition.
  * Your job is not to come up with a prototype of the system in your mind or determine how you would get funding or manufacturers to support it. **You simply have to think of the need, picture the solution, and believe it can be fulfilled. The possibility of your idea already exists as soon as you think it.**
  * The One Mind will figure out the _what_ and _how_ and bring it to you



(Shortform note: This idea may seem simple and farfetched, but remember your instincts are the universe’s way of inspiring you to receive what you’ve attracted to your life. If you really want to invent or fix something, there will be work to do, but that work will be inspired action if you trust the One Mind.)

There is a never-ending quantity of ideas within the One Mind waiting for you to discover and draw out. If you want to help solve the world’s problems, believe you can, and you will.
