## Chapter 7: Behaviors to Increase the Law of Attraction

**What you do in life is as important as what you think.** Now that your mind is geared toward strengthening the Creative Process in your life, you can add appropriate behaviors to boost your success.

### Be Grateful

**Show gratitude for each day as it begins, as though everything you want to happen already has.** Gratitude is the cousin of expectation. Showing gratitude for what is to come is linked to setting your expectations.

  * When you are grateful for the day ahead, you set the expectation for a great day. This expectation creates the frequency of a great day, and a great day you shall have. 
  * Not showing gratitude for the day ahead means you are content to wake up and passively hope for a great day. You will wander from one action and event to another without any thought or control over how things will turn out. 



Byrne says that by the time she is ready to face the day, she has said “Thank you” hundreds of times. Through this action, she is showing gratitude for the day ahead, powerfully setting her expectations for what her day will look like.

  * (Shortform note: Gratitude is so important that Byrne says if you only take one thing from reading _The Secret_ , it should be learning to show gratitude daily.)



#### Gratitude and the Creative Process

When you give thanks for what is to come, you emit the frequency of knowing what you want is already yours. **When you ask, believe, and feel the sensation of receiving, gratitude reinforces those thoughts and feelings.** Be grateful for who you are and your power to change your life. Be grateful for the universe and the work it is doing to give you the life you want.

**If you are ungrateful for the life you have, you won’t be able to attract a better life.**

  * As you feel ingratitude for the things you don’t like in your life, you become mired in negative thoughts. 
  * Whether it is envy, self-pity, resentment, or feelings of lack, those feelings (as you know with your knowledge of negative frequencies) will only attract pictures that emulate them.
    * For example, if you want a new house but are ungrateful for the home you currently live in, your predominant thoughts are going to be negative. They will surround what you dislike about your current situation, rather than good feelings about what more might be out there. 
    * If you want a new house, being grateful for what you do have will strengthen your gratitude for the more you will receive. For instance, you might say, “I am so grateful for this starter home. It has served our family well.” Then, when you ask for your new house, it’s not mixed in with thoughts of “this house is terrible.” Instead, it’s mixed in with thoughts of improving your already lucky situation, which will bring about lucky results. 



**As you start to focus on all of the things you are grateful for, you’ll begin to notice more things to be grateful for.** The more you communicate gratitude with the universe, the more the universe will bring you to be grateful for.

### Act As If

Any action you take is guided by thought. **When you take action, you are fulfilling the thought that inspired us to act.** When you want to create something in your life, your actions should support what you’re trying to attract.

You’ve heard the phrase “Fake it till you make it.” The principle of _acting as if_ is the same thing. This idea is a physical embodiment of Step 3 in the Creative Process: _feeling_ the joy of receiving what you have asked for. The same is true for actions. **You should _act_ exactly as you would if you already had the thing you asked.**

  * For example, if you want a new bike but live in a cramped apartment, clear a space and hang a bike hook so the universe knows you are ready to receive.
  * If you want your significant other to commit and move in, make a new key, clear a space in your drawers and medicine cabinet, or get an extra parking pass. 
  * These **actions tell the universe you believe and know that you will receive what you want**.****
  * If you leave things as is, it’s like saying, “There’s no room in my life for what I’ve asked for.” If you send that signal to the universe, the Law of Attraction will continue to reflect that reality back to you. 



Actions, like feelings, are a good way to understand what your thoughts are. You may not even realize what you’ve been thinking. But by looking at how you behave, you can start to understand your underlying thoughts.

Example: Byrne had an artist friend who was attractive and successful but perpetually single, despite his desire to date.

When he painted, he always painted women with their backs to him, at first believing it was a stylistic preference. Later, he realized the pictures represented his subconscious thoughts about how women saw him. Despite his attributes, he thought he was unable to get noticed by women.

After realizing what his thoughts were, he started painting pictures of himself with women. A few months later, he was inundated with dates.

This artist hadn’t realized that his actions were antithetical to his wants. By **aligning his actions with his desires** , he was able to focus all of his power on the thing he wanted—dates with women. With his newly aligned actions, he signaled the universe to bring that picture to him.

#### Let the Universe Guide Your Actions

**Instincts are the manifestation of inspiration from the universe.** The universe is pulling you toward the thing you asked for so you can receive it. Trust your instincts and know they are leading you toward inspired action.

Inspired action differs from forced action. For many people, the term “action” denotes work. But action is often only work when it is forced.

  * _Forced action_ is blindly acting in a way you believe will bring something about.
    * For instance, you may overburden your life with work, thinking it is what you need to do to afford the lifestyle you want.
    * **You haven’t asked for what you want** and received the answer “take on more work.” You’ve forced the action to get a result. 
    * Forced action is a deviation from the Creative Process and feels like a struggle.
  * _Inspired action_ is when you are acting in accordance with the universe, or acting in a way that allows you to receive.
    * Inspired action doesn’t feel like work.
    * **Inspired action occurs when you allow the inspiration from the universe to guide what you do.**
    * Rather than overburden your life with work to be able to buy the things you want, trust the universe to provide the answers you need to attain what you want.
    * You may end up working more, but the work will be inspired by the universe. You will not feel a struggle because you know that, through the action, you are receiving.
    * With inspired action, it’s possible to not realize you are acting until you receive because you felt good or happy. 
  * Imagine that you’re running down a long country road. When you are acting to try to bring something about, you are running against the wind. You feel the pressure holding you back, fighting you for each step forward. When you are acting through inspiration, you are heading the opposite way, with the wind at your back. You are being pushed forward. You feel your momentum improving. 



#### Make a Vision Board

A Vision Board is a physical representation of all the things you want. To create one, get a poster board. Cut out pictures representing what you want in your life - things, people, experiences. Looking at your Vision Board, you should feel it encompasses all the major things you want out of life.

**The act of creating a vision board is the act of asking.**

As you put each item on the board, make sure you take a moment to feel the experience of already having that item now.

  * If you put a picture of a beach vacation on your board, feel what it’s like to be on that beach—the sun, the Mai Tai, the sand in your toes, the relaxation deep inside. If you can feel what it’s like to be there, the universe will find a way to bring those feelings into reality. 



Put your Vision Board in a place where you can see it everyday. Take a moment every day to visualize your ideal life.

Vision Boards are good activities to do with children to help them begin to understand the Law of Attraction. You’re never too young to start creating the life you want.

### Visualization

Visualization is mentally picturing what you want. It’s a way of saying to the Universe, “Look at me with what I want. It’s a pretty picture, no? I’m so happy to have received this gift.” **The state of mind—the plane on which we visualize—is as real as the physical world.**

**When you visualize, you situate yourself on a powerful frequency.** The Law of Attraction, by its very nature, will pick up that frequency and follow it until the end. **All the pretty pictures you created in your mind will become the pictures of your life.**

  * Byrne provides an example of Olympic athletes who visualized participating in their events. Hooked up to various transmission equipment, the data revealed that as the athletes mentally performed, the same muscles used during their physical performance were engaged. The brain sent the same signals throughout the body as if the actions were actually happening. 
  * Look at the big inventions in the world. Electricity, aviation, cars, the Internet. All of these seemingly impossible inventions at the time came into creation simply because someone somewhere saw an image of it in their minds. They visualized their creation, and all of the forces of the universe conspired to make that image a reality through the inventor. 



**More than simply holding a picture in your mind, you have to _feel_ the experience**, as well. Remember, our feelings take our thoughts to the next level. The feeling is what solidifies the attraction in the universe. The picture is just the thought.

  * Think about the Porsche you wanted. If you just hold a picture of you in the Porsche in your mind, the universe only has one dimension to work with. That picture might come true, but the result might just be you at a Porsche dealership testing out the comfort of the seats. You leave and go home without the Porsche because the universe only picked up that flat signal.
  * Static pictures are more difficult to feel on a deep level, so create movement in your picture. 
  * Rather than just seeing yourself in a Porsche, see yourself driving the Porsche. Feel the wind in your hair, the pride in _owning_ a Porsche. How special do you feel? It’s pretty great, right?



As you see the picture and experience the feelings encompassing it, you are placing yourself within the realm of believing and receiving.

  * You are telling the universe you trust it and have faith that the end result of what you want is certain, even if you don’t know how yet. 
  * Your entire being is acknowledging the process as completed. 



Here’s a trick: think of what you want as a fact of life already. When you believe something as fact, there can be no question that it will come to pass.

  * No one believed in Henry Ford when he wanted to build the automobile. But in his mind, the car was inevitable. It was a fact already in existence, which likely prompted his quote, “Whether you think you can or think you can’t, either way, you’re right.”



Do you believe you can do anything you want? If so, then just believe it’s true, and it will be.

### Praise and Bless

**When you praise or bless someone or something, you emit a feeling of love.** As you know, love is the most powerful frequency there is. Through that frequency, love will be returned to you time and again. So, praise and bless everything and everyone.

Praising and blessing is the kryptonite to negativity.

  * If you scorn or badmouth your enemies, your negative frequency will make sure more negativity comes into your life. 
  * But, as hard as it may be, if you can find praise for your enemies and bless them, that good feeling you have inside—love—will radiate into the universe.
  * As you emit this love, you will experience a shift onto a new frequency. That new frequency will carry forth the signal of good feelings you sent out. 
  * Think of how wonderful it will be to feel no negativity in your life. And all you had to do was show love to everyone and everything.
