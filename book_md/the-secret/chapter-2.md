## Chapter 2: The Infallibility of the Law of Attraction

Just because you may not fully understand or believe in the Law of Attraction doesn’t mean it isn’t working. **The Law of Attraction is at play at all times, with or without your consent or knowledge.** You are always thinking; therefore, you are always signaling the universe.

  * When you toss a rock in the air and it comes back down, you understand that gravity is the cause. Whether or not you understand how gravity works doesn’t stop it from existing everywhere at all times. 
  * Likewise, you may not understand how the Law of Attraction works, but it doesn’t mean your thoughts are not creating your life. 
  * There is no switch to turn off the Law of Attraction. The law is inclusive, and it never fails. Just like cars will not suddenly float from the ground, your thoughts will never not trigger the universe to respond.



Think of the Law of Attraction as a genie in a bottle. You know about genies from childhood stories and Disney cartoons. When you rub the bottle, the genie comes out and announces, “Your wish is my command.”

  * If you accidentally say, “I wish I had more time to choose my wishes,” the genie grants you more time. You’re also down to two wishes.
  * The genie is always listening and never questions your wishes. If you say, “I wish my hair was longer,” the genie won’t question whether long hair will look good on you. It will simply make your hair longer. 
  * Likewise, **the Law of Attraction is always in tune with how you think, speak, and act**. The second you think something, you create a thought message sent into the world, and the Law of Attraction begins to leverage the universe, through people, scenarios, and events, to fulfill your thought.



You don’t have to believe in the Law of Attraction for it to work in your life. Keep your thoughts positive, and it won’t matter. **Positive thinking will always lead to a more enjoyable life, whether or not you understand why.**
