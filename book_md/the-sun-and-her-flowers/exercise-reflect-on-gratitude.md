## Exercise: Reflect on Gratitude

Consider what you appreciate in your life and relationships and how they give you strength.

* * *

What’s a small act or experience that you appreciate, or that helps you through tough times? (For example, petting your dog, watching the sun rise, or listening to the blues.) How does this experience help you?

Who in your life helps you through hardships? Describe the different ways in which they help you.

What’s a small way that you could show that person your appreciation or gratitude?
