## Exercise: Create a Relationship Action Plan (RAP)

Making a relationship action plan will help you to identify not only your long-, medium-, and short-term goals, but also the people who you should network with to achieve these goals.

* * *

Write down your long-term professional goal: something that you want to achieve within the next three years. (Remember that your goal should be challenging yet achievable, and as specific as possible. Likewise, the best goals take into account both your passions and your skills.)

Write down at least one medium-term goal that will help you to achieve your long-term goal. These should be goals that you can achieve within one year.

Write down at least one short-term goal that will help you to achieve each medium-term goal. These should be goals that you can achieve within three months.

Next to all of your goals, write down who you think youâ€™ll need to network with to achieve them. (For example, if your goal is to gain a certain qualification, write down the admissions managers at colleges that offer it.)
