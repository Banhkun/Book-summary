## Chapter 7: Network Using Traditional Media

In Chapter 6, we discussed how you can use social media to get potential connections to come to you. In this chapter, we’re going to explore **how you can use traditional media—for instance, newspaper and magazine coverage—to do this, too.**

Getting coverage in a media outlet—for example, by publishing an opinion piece in a newspaper or convincing a journalist to interview you—exposes you to an audience of thousands or sometimes millions of people. Some of these readers will be so impressed by your ideas that they want to hear more about them. They’ll reach out to you—and thus, a new connection is born.

### How to Get Media Coverage

So how can you get media coverage? The simplest method is to follow these five steps:

**Step 1: Decide what type of content you want to pitch and what topic you want to write about.** For instance, do you want to write a prescient opinion piece on a current social issue? Do you want to be interviewed about your career so far? Do you want to write a short column on your area of expertise?****

To increase the chances that your idea gets accepted for publication, make it original. For example, approach an old issue from a new angle, or discuss the unique insights you’ve gained from working in your industry. Journalists are much more likely to publish innovative content since their readers will find it more interesting.

Likewise, if possible, make your content timely—for example, related to a current event. That way, the journalist you contact will be driven to publish your piece quickly, while it’s still relevant.

**Step 2: Decide which publication you’d like to feature in.** Start small—for instance, with a local newspaper or a trade journal. National media outlets are unlikely to accept a pitch from someone who’s had no previous media exposure. Likewise, choose a publication that’s relevant to your industry or your interests. There’s no point approaching a magazine about construction to pitch an opinion piece about the most important developments in the tech industry.

Once you’ve decided upon a publication, find out who specifically you need to send your pitch to—for instance, the editor who covers the topic you want to write about.

**Step 3: Write and send your pitch.** Describe your piece’s main point, why you think that point is interesting, and why you’re the right person to write about it. Make your pitch brief—no more than a few sentences. Editors will likely ignore any pitches that take a long time to read.

**Step 4: Follow up with the publication.** A few days to a week after you send your pitch, email the editor to find out whether they plan to run your piece. If they’re not interested, be gracious: Merely thank the editor for their time, and take your idea to a different publication. If you berate the editor for rejecting you or pester them to change their mind, they won’t be open to working with you in the future.

If the editor _does_ want to run your piece, check whether they want to make any amendments to it—for instance, give the piece a slightly different focus. If they do, and you’re happy with the suggested changes, start to draft the final article. If you’re unhappy with the amendments, take your piece elsewhere. It’s unlikely that you’ll change the editor’s mind about the suggested changes, and you should never write a piece that you’re uncomfortable with.

**Step 5: Send the completed article to the publication.** Thank the editor for accepting your piece and ask them when you can expect it to be published. Once it’s in print (or posted online), share it widely: for instance, post a link to it on social media and email it to your closest contacts. Getting media coverage is an impressive achievement that you shouldn’t be afraid to flaunt.

#### Networking Principle Reminder: Build It Before You Need It

**Network with journalists and editors who cover your industry _before_ you intend to get a piece published. **That way, when you _do_ decide to write a piece, you turn to these existing contacts and ask them to publish it. While many editors are open to publishing pieces from strangers, they’re much more likely to accept pitches from people they already know.

### Miscellaneous Networking Strategies

Ferrazzi also suggests a few miscellaneous networking strategies. Consider these supplementary strategies to use alongside those outlined previously—they may not help you gain _dozens_ of new contacts, but they will introduce you to a few.

**Strategy #1: Ask a friend to help you host a joint networking event to which you both invite a few contacts that the other person doesn’t know.** Everyone benefits: You, your co-host, and the invitees all get to meet new people.

There are two things to bear in mind if you choose to use this strategy:

  * Pick a friend you trust as your co-host—not someone who’s going to embarrass or belittle you in front of the contacts you invite.
  * You and your co-host should invite the same number of people. Resentment may grow if one host gets to meet more new people than the other.



**Strategy #2: Found an organization related to one of your personal or professional interests** —for instance, a book club, or a group for local young professionals in your industry. Advertise the group on social media, in your local newspaper, and among your existing contacts. Hopefully, you’ll attract not only members that you already know, but new connections, too. Getting close to these new contacts will be easy since you have a clear shared interest to bond over.

**Strategy #3: Engineer “lucky” encounters.** Ferrazzi argues that some of the most career-changing professional connections can be ones you weren’t planning on making: for instance, ones that grow from unexpectedly bumping into someone at an event, or being seated next to them on a plane. You may think that these kinds of encounters are impossible to engineer—after all, they’re based on being in the right place at the right time. However, Ferrazzi believes you can do a few things to increase the chances of these lucky events coming to pass:

  * **Adopt an open mindset** —see every person you come across as a potential new contact. Likewise, become comfortable with talking to strangers. You’ll only benefit from serendipity if you’re willing to approach people you don’t know.
  * **Appear approachable at all times** —whether you’re on the bus, in a café, or simply walking down the street. Smile at people and make eye contact with them. You’ll never make unexpected connections if you glare at every stranger you come across.
  * **Hang around places that are popular with the kind of people you want to network with** —for instance, the coworking space used by all of the local entrepreneurs, or the coffee shop that tech gurus always go to on their breaks. By frequenting these people’s “habitats,” you increase your chances of serendipitously bumping into them.
