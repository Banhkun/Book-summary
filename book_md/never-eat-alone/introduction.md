## Introduction

In _Never Eat Alone_ , author and entrepreneur Keith Ferrazzi discusses how to develop fulfilling and mutually beneficial professional relationships:**** in other words,**how to network.** Ferrazzi believes that networking is crucial to career success for several reasons:

  * **When looking for people to do business with, leaders tend to choose people they already know and like.** If you’re in this leader’s network, that person could be you. 
  * **You’ll gain a reputation for being well-connected, which will increase your popularity even further.** People tend to like those who are well-respected by lots of people. 
  * **You’ll also gain a reputation for having good people skills.** After all, you must be doing _something_ right if you’ve successfully networked with lots of people. This reputation may make it easier for you to gain positions that involve managing others or working in a team.
  * **Finding a new job is easier when you have a large network.** You can call upon your connections to send you job postings. The more people you know, the more help you’ll receive. 
  * **Your employer will benefit from your networking efforts.** You can introduce your new connections to the company and its products and services, possibly drumming up new business in the process.



Networking can also improve your personal life. It gives you the opportunity to meet like-minded people with whom you can build strong friendships.

We’ll walk through how to network in three stages. First, we’ll cover the preparatory steps you need to take _before_ you start networking, including developing the right attitude to the process and choosing who to network with. Next, we’ll cover various strategies you can use to create your professional network. Finally, we’ll explore how you can maintain your professional relationships for years to come—in part, by holding so many catch-up meetings that you never eat alone.

(Shortform note: We’ve reordered and reorganized many of the book’s chapters to add coherency and avoid repetition.)
