## Exercise: Identify Mentors, Super-Connectors, and Prominent People

In addition to people who can help you achieve your goals, network with mentors, super-connectors, and prominent people. Identify people in each of these groups who you’d like to network with.

* * *

List one or two people who you believe could mentor you. Why have you chosen these people? What could you offer them in return for their guidance? (Remember: While it may be helpful to have a mentor who works in your industry, they don’t have to.)

Now, list one or two “super-connectors” you’d like to network with (or get closer to). Why have you chosen these people? What could you offer them in return for access to their network? (Remember: Super-connectors are people who have large professional networks. They usually work in industries such as politics, recruitment, and the media.)

Finally, list one or two prominent people in your industry (for example, CEOs or famous entrepreneurs) who you’d like to network with. Why have you chosen these people? What could you offer them in return for their wisdom and connections?

Look back at all of the mentors, super-connectors, and prominent people you’ve listed. Which of these professionals do you want to network with first? Why?
