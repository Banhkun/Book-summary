## Exercise: Brainstorm Compelling Social Media Content

One way to network using social media is to create compelling social media content that piques people’s interest and inspires them to contact you.

* * *

One type of content that social media users enjoy is posts that contain useful information—for instance, tips on how to break into a certain industry. Brainstorm two to three “useful” posts you could create. (Remember: All of the content you create should be authentic to your personality. Likewise, each post idea should be as unique as possible. Social media users love content that’s unlike anyone else’s.)

Posts about people’s successes and struggles also tend to be popular with social media users. Describe two recent successes and two recent struggles that you’d feel comfortable sharing online.

Social media users are often drawn to content about controversial issues. Describe a controversial issue that’s recently caught your attention, and outline how you might post about the issue online. (For example, what would your stance on the issue be? Would you write a long post about your position, or simply mention it in passing?)

Creating social media posts about the things you have to offer (for example, your skills or your expertise) may encourage potential contacts to message you. Draft two short social media posts, each highlighting a different thing you have to offer. (For instance, you could write a short Tweet in which you state one of your strongest skills and invite users to contact you if they need your services.)
