## Chapter 15: Society Causes Sleep Deprivation

Sleep deprivation goes far beyond our individual sleep practices. Walker argues that our society has structurally locked in sleep deprivation in two ways.

### 1) Work Schedules Disrupt Sleep

The ethos at many companies sees sleep as an indulgence for the weak. They lionize the road warrior who fearlessly crosses time zones on tiny amounts of sleep and answers emails at 1AM. In their minds, more hours worked equals more productivity.

This is short-sighted. **The effects of sleep deprivation are costly to employers:**

  * Lost productivity per sleep-deprived worker is in the thousands of dollars a year. Walker argues that insufficient sleep costs 2% of GDP. In a natural experiment studying workers on opposite edges of a time zone, workers who obtained an hour of extra sleep earned 5% higher wages.
  * Sleep-deprived workers show bad traits like reduced work performance, creativity, motivation, and social cohesion, as well as increased risk-taking, impulsiveness, and desire to cheat.
  * Leaders who sleep worse are rated worse by their team and cause less engagement in their workers. This is visible day-by-day—poor sleep one night is immediately seen as worse performance the next day.
  * Workers who sleep less rate their leaders as less charismatic, regardless of the leader’s sleep level (thus forming a multiplicative effect where sleepless leaders and workers make everyone miserable).
  * Insidiously, workers don’t perceive themselves as performing worse when sleep deprived.



**Another vicious cycle: People sleep less because of the amount of work they have to do, but their low sleep reduces their productivity and increases the work remaining.**

(Shortform note: In _Indistractable_ , Nir Eyal writes that employees feel the pressure to be “on” all the time—having to reply to late-night emails from their managers, for example. This constant pressure to be productive at all hours can cause employees to feel burned out, leading to reduced productivity and high employee turnover. By giving employees the time to rest and recharge, companies may be able to increase employee retention and satisfaction.)

#### Solutions for Employers

  * Focus less on hours worked, and more on real productivity and output.
  * Let people have flexible work hours to suit personal circadian rhythms. Don’t punish night owls more than morning people.
  * Add nap pods and adaptive office lighting to promote better sleep.



> **How the Covid-19 Pandemic Changed Sleep**
> 
> During the Covid-19 pandemic, many people had more relaxed work schedules, as they were working from home and didn’t have to spend time commuting to and from the office. The combination of more time at home plus the pandemic environment changed sleep on three levels, according to Walker:
> 
>   * **Amount** —Walker says that a sleep tracking company reported that total sleep time increased by 20%. He also cites two studies that support the finding that people were sleeping more during lockdown. One finding was that sleep schedules across weekdays and weekends were more consistent. Walker thinks this was because no commute meant extra sleep time in the morning and at night. They also didn’t have to get up too early to get kids ready for school. **However, despite the increase in sleep _quantity_ , there seemed to have been a decrease in sleep _quality_**. Walker theorizes that this is because some people lost their jobs or were experiencing general pandemic anxiety.
> 
>   * **Timing** —based on the two studies cited, people were going to bed an average of about 30 minutes later and waking up about 50 minutes later. Walker calls this the “revenge of the night owls,” as relaxed work schedules allowed people to sleep according to their chronotype.
> 
>   * **Dreaming** —there was no data available at the time of the interview, but Walker thinks there was probably an increase in dreaming during the pandemic. He says this might be because of 1) the timing of sleep (longer sleep means people have more time for REM sleep, or the dream stage), and 2) the brain was working overtime to provide more REM sleep to blunt strong emotions from pandemic-induced trauma it may have experienced during the day.

### 2) School Schedules Disrupt Sleep

To match parent’s schedules, primary and secondary school often begins at 8AM, and sometimes as early as 7AM. Kids whose parents can’t drive them to school may need to catch a long bus ride, meaning they must wake at 5:30AM or earlier. Remember that children have delayed circadian rhythms. Walker explains that this is akin to forcibly waking adults at 3:30AM every day. Society should push to change school schedules to better match the circadian rhythm of kids.

(Shortform note: The general public is becoming more aware of the importance of later school start times. In the U.S., a coalition called Start School Later is dedicated to educating the public about the issue, providing resources to communities and advocating for appropriate legislation. Their website lists schools in 46 states that have successfully implemented later school start times.)

Kids these days are sleeping two hours less per night, compared to children a century ago. **Kids with lower sleep show lower motivation, academic performance** , test scores, and IQ, as well as greater irritability, distraction, anxiety, substance abuse, and risk of traffic accidents.

In fact, many kids diagnosed with ADHD may actually have sleep disorders (Walker estimates >50% are misdiagnosed). Unfortunately, they’re treated with amphetamine (Adderall), causing _even worse_ sleep problems.

(Shortform note: One expert notes that it’s unlikely for sleep disorders to be mistaken for ADHD, but that a lack of sleep can worsen ADHD symptoms.)
