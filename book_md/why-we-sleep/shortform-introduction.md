## Shortform Introduction

You're probably getting less sleep than you should be. Many people are more chronically sleep-deprived than they realize, and the punishments for this are severe—reduced productivity and happiness, and increased risk of a panel of diseases. _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ discusses the mechanisms of sleep, its importance and major benefits, and the best ways to get better sleep.

### About the Author

Matthew Walker, Ph.D.—self-branded “Sleep Diplomat”—is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science, which investigates the role of sleep in human health. He’s also a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and was previously a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

He has published over 100 scientific studies, mostly on sleep science, and has appeared on numerous television programs, including _60 Minutes_ , _BBC News_ , and _CBS This Morning_.

Beyond TV programs and podcasts, Walker spreads the gospel of sleep through events, forums, and workshops—his 2019 TED Talk was one of the fastest to reach a million views, according to his website. His other pursuits within the field of sleep include serving as scientific counsel to companies like Fitbit, Google, and sleep therapy company Shuni.

In 2020, he won the Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization, which is given to researchers who’ve made science more accessible to the general public.

Walker’s official website states that he earned his Ph.D. in neurophysiology from the Medical Research Council (MRC) in London. However, in a blog post critiquing Walker’s book, researcher Alexey Guzey points out that the MRC does not grant Ph.D. degrees. Walker’s Wikipedia page states that he received his Ph.D. from Newcastle University, and that his research was funded by the MRC. It is unclear why there is a discrepancy in information.

### The Book’s Publication

_Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ , published in 2017 by Simon & Schuster, is Walker’s first book. It became a _New York Times_ Best Seller and landed at the top of the _Sunday Times_ Bestseller list in the U.K.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Walker sees insufficient sleep as a global problem, originally writing that the World Health Organization (WHO) even considers it a health epidemic. He has since corrected this information, saying that it should have been attributed to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). (It’s worth noting that the CDC currently doesn’t seem to consider insufficient sleep an epidemic. Blogger Guzey speculates that the source of the error might be CDC’s modified stance on sleep loss, from “public health epidemic” to “public health problem,” though this happened two years prior to the book’s publication.) Walker writes that society doesn’t seem to give sleep much importance in part because science hasn’t sufficiently explained _why_ we need it.

Historically, there wasn’t much scientific experimentation in the field of sleep prior to the 20th century, and the “study” of the field was largely centered around dream interpretation. Sleep science began to progress in 1952, when researchers first observed the rapid-eye movement phase of sleep. Walker writes that in the last two decades, there has been an “explosion of discoveries,” a “research renaissance” that reveals how sleep works and just how important it is.

#### Intellectual Context

While the book is classified under the genre of popular science—an interpretation of science geared toward a general audience—Walker and other researchers have cited it in academic papers. (You can find a list of citations on Google Scholar.)

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Positive reviews say that _Why We Sleep_ is a fascinating, engaging read and that Walker is adept at explaining complex scientific concepts to a general audience. However, even those who give the book positive reviews (including Microsoft founder Bill Gates) note that Walker doesn’t always back up his claims with solid evidence.

The most comprehensive criticism comes from researcher Alexey Guzey, whose blog post claims that _Why We Sleep_ is full of errors and contradictions, exaggerates the problem of lack of sleep, and misrepresents research. His blog post goes through Chapter 1, questioning or disputing the information from Walker’s book point by point. Guzey explains that he spent 130 hours fact-checking this one chapter to give readers an idea of the density of errors in the book. He cautions readers against taking everything in the book as fact. Since the publication of his blog post, readers have sent Guzey other errors that they found. (Note: We include these, along with Guzey’s findings, in this guide.)

In a podcast interview where he discusses sleep, Walker responds to critics and says that a critical part of good scholarly conduct is correcting errors, and he addresses some of the errors that he found and that other people have pointed out. In a 2019 blog post, Walker addresses some of the questions that have been raised about his book and mentions that he released a second edition to correct errors in the 2017 edition. While there is no record of a second edition online, the version this guide is based on does contain Walker’s corrections.

Some readers have noted how reading Why We Sleep has made them even more anxious about lack of sleep. Walker addresses this in his blog and has included a caveat in the revised version of the introduction that notes that the book isn’t meant to treat sleep disorders and advises reader discretion.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Why We Sleep_ includes a huge amount of scientific information, but Walker makes it more engaging by presenting it in layman’s terms and using easy-to-grasp analogies. The result is an educational read that is friendlier and more appealing than an academic paper. However, Walker himself notes that should you nod off while reading the book, he wouldn’t take offense and would in fact be delighted.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve combined some chapters and grouped together connected concepts that may have appeared in separate sections or chapters. We’ve also omitted chapter 1, which serves as an introduction and an overview of the contents of the book. The chapters of this guide discuss the following subjects:

  * **Part 1 (Chapters 2-5)** discusses how sleep works, including the phases of sleep, the parts of the brain and hormones at play, and how sleep cycles change across the human life span.
  * **Part 2 (Chapters 6-8)** covers the importance of sleep and the dangers of sleep loss.
  * **Part 3 (Chapters 9-11)** discusses how and why we dream.
  * **Part 4 (Chapters 12-16)** focuses on the things that are detrimental to sleep, how you can sleep better, and advancements in sleep technology.



Where applicable, we’ve included the errors and comments listed in Guzey’s blog post and other sources. We’ve also added commentary to expand on ideas in the book, such as counter-arguments or sleep studies that came out after the book was published.
