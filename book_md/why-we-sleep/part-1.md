## Part 1: How Sleep Works | Chapter 2: Your Daily Sleep Rhythm

(We’ve omitted chapter 1, which is an introduction that serves as an overview of topics explored in later chapters.)

Walker states that sleep is universal in animals, even in insects and worms, despite its apparent drawbacks (vulnerability to predators, loss of time for productivity). When a biological feature is preserved deep in evolutionary history, it is usually a critical function. He argues that this must mean sleep is a critical function, and it’s crucial to understand why it’s important.

(Shortform note: At least one study disputes the claim that sleep is a vital function, showing that a certain type of fly is “virtually sleepless.” The findings of the study thus present a different perspective when it comes to the biological role of sleep.)

### How Sleep Rhythm Works

Walker says that sleep is regulated by two mechanisms: the circadian rhythm and adenosine.

#### Circadian Rhythm

The first mechanism, the **circadian rhythm** , is regulated by **melatonin** (produced by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain). He describes this as a natural “wake drive,” making you stay awake during the day and waning during the night.

  * The circadian rhythm responds to light and darkness to calibrate itself. It’s naturally 24 hours and 15 minutes long on average.



(Shortform note: In the first edition, Walker had written that “every living creature on the planet with a life span of more than several days” has a circadian rhythm. In his blog, researcher Alexey Guzey says that this is false—brewer’s yeast, which lives for more than 20 days, does not go through this cycle. He writes that some people may dismiss this point as minor, thinking that brewer’s yeast doesn’t count as an animal. However, he still thinks it’s crucial to mention this information because it counters Walker’s assertion that all living creatures have a circadian rhythm. Walker addresses this point in the second edition by changing the phrasing to “ _most_ living creatures on the planet” (emphasis ours). He also clarifies in his blog that there are exceptions to the seemingly universal phenomenon, mentioning mammals that don’t seem to have a circadian rhythm.)

Circadian rhythms vary from person to person, dictating when they naturally wake up and have maximum energy. Walker says that this proves that the idea of “morning people” and “night owls” is real.

  * Whether you’re a morning or night person strongly depends on your genetics. 
  * Humans evolved with this variation because having a mixture of morning people and night owls allows a population to reduce its vulnerability. For example, as morning people go to sleep earlier (say at 10PM), night owls can keep up the watch. Then as night owls get tired (say around 4AM), the morning people are starting to wake.
  * Walker argues that in modern times, the night owls are heavily punished, since early start times at work force night owls to sleep and wake up earlier than their bodies are optimized to. This reduces performance in the mornings. Furthermore, by the time night owls peak in the afternoon, the work day has already ended.



> **Can a Night Owl Become a Morning Person?**
> 
> It’s very hard to change your chronotype (your biological propensity to sleep at particular hours), but given the way work and school schedules are currently structured, you might be looking to override your biology. Here are some tips to help night owls become morning larks:
> 
> **At Night**
> 
>   * Avoid blue light-emitting screens and engage in relaxing activities, like reading or meditating, a couple of hours before bedtime.
> 
>   * Turn the lights down low to signal to your body that it’s nearing bedtime.
> 
>   * Allow yourself to be bored—don’t do anything that excites you.
> 
>   * Be patient. It takes at least a week for your body to adjust to the new schedule, so don’t expect immediate results and just keep at it.
> 
> 

> 
> **In the Morning**
> 
>   * Give yourself something to look forward to in the morning, like playing a video game for 20 minutes when you wake up instead of before going to bed.
> 
>   * Adjust your wake-up time to half an hour earlier each week until you reach your target time.
> 
>   * Get outside and allow the sunlight to hit your eyes.

#### Adenosine

The second sleep-regulating mechanism, **adenosine** is a chemical that causes “sleep pressure,” or the increased desire to sleep. Walker explains that this rises consistently through the day without sleep, making you feel more tired. Sleeping depletes adenosine, which means you wake up with a decreased desire for sleep.

Sleep naturally happens when your adenosine is at its highest and your circadian “wake drive” is at its lowest. In the morning, your wake drive starts up again and your adenosine has been depleted by sleep—you feel awake because you’ve reduced the adenosine-circadian gap.

Walker says that this explains an odd phenomenon: Pulling an all-nighter and getting a second wind in the morning. Your adenosine keeps rising, so when your wake cycle dips at 3AM the gap is larger and you feel tired. But at 8AM, your wake cycle restarts and closes the gap and you feel more awake.

(Shortform note: It’s best to avoid pulling an all-nighter, but if you must, you can minimize the disruption to your sleep routine by keeping yourself awake until your next bedtime. Stay hydrated, and resist the urge to take a long nap—stay active, chew gum, or smell rosemary, peppermint, or coffee to help keep you up.)

### Stay On Rhythm to Avoid Sleep Deficit

Too much sleep disruption can lead to a sleep deficit, or the difference between the amount of sleep you _need_ and the amount of sleep you _get_. **How do you know if you have a sleep deficit? Walker suggests a few signs:**

  * You don’t wake up naturally at the time you set your alarm—this means your body wants more sleep.
  * When you read, you often lose track and need to read a sentence twice. 
  * You feel drowsy just a few hours after waking.
  * You need coffee to feel functional.



(Shortform note: Walker doesn’t mention another common sign of a sleep deficit: mood changes and/or irritability. Irritability may be due, in part, to increases in stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine.)

Later in this guide we’ll discuss how to improve your sleeping habits and reduce your sleep deficit.

(Shortform note: Keeping a sleep diary can give you a clearer picture of your sleep habits, making it easier to determine any problems. Include bedtime, wake-up time, length of time it takes to fall asleep, number of times you wake up and for how long, and caffeine and alcohol consumption. Fill it out for at least a week, then review it to see if you have a consistent sleep schedule and are giving yourself enough time to sleep. Review the data, then think about what could be the underlying cause of sleep disruptions, if any.)
