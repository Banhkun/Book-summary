## 1-Page Summary

How do formidable companies lose their footing and fall into irrelevance—or even cease to exist? And how can other companies avoid the same fate? These are the questions Jim Collins seeks to answer in _How the Mighty Fall_. Backed by years of research into once-mighty companies, Collins contends there are five phases leading to a company’s downfall: overconfidence, overreaching, ignoring the signs, overcorrecting, and surrendering.

While the book is a warning to companies that have grown complacent, it also serves as motivation for those in the throes of decline. Collins says that **by staying vigilant about the threat of failure, you can rechart your course, keep pushing forward, and ensure your company’s survival.**

Collins is a business adviser and author of best-selling books like _Built to Last _(1994), _Good to Great_ (2001), and _Great by Choice _(2011). In 2017, he was included in _Forbes_ ’s list of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. _How the Mighty Fall_ was published in 2009, but Collins completed work on it prior to the 2008 financial crisis; as such, his analysis doesn’t take the effects of the Great Recession into account.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the five phases that lead to a company’s decline. We’ll then break down Collins’s advice for resuscitating a faltering company. As the book was published in 2009, we’ll also include updates on the companies he mentions and newer developments in the business landscape, as well as connecting Collins’s ideas with concepts in his other books and examining the perspectives of other experts.

### The Five Phases Leading to a Company’s Downfall

Collins analyzes companies’ performance through the lens of failure rather than success, arguing that **understanding failure helps companies avoid it**. To determine the causes of decline, he takes pairs of companies in the same industry, analyzes what the failed companies did differently from the successful ones, and determines what the failed companies had in common.

(Shortform note: Collins employs the opposite method in his other books, such as _Built to Last_ and _Good to Great_ —in those books, while he also takes pairs of companies in the same industry and compares them, he instead maps out what the _successful_ companies have in common. Some argue that learning from success is more effective than learning from failure—in _Rework_ , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson write that understanding failure only shows what we _shouldn’t_ do, not what we _should_.)

Collins writes that companies don’t fail overnight. Instead, they decline gradually in a process involving five phases:

  * Phase 1: Overconfidence 
  * Phase 2: Overreaching
  * Phase 3: Ignoring—or misreading—the signs 
  * Phase 4: Overcorrecting
  * Phase 5: Surrendering



Collins acknowledges that his work shows _correlation_ , not causation—he can only infer why companies failed based on their similarities. He adds that while the five phases are typical in the case studies he reviewed, companies that deteriorate don’t necessarily undergo all phases, nor do they have to go through them in order. Still, companies should be aware of all the harbingers of failure to better guard against them.

(Shortform note: Aside from Collins’s five phases, some experts caution that there are other signs that a company is headed in the wrong direction: a lack of transparency, which breeds uncertainty and distrust within the company; a lack of cooperation, marked by disrespect, selfishness, and tribalism; and a bleak atmosphere, where people lack the drive to do good work.)

Here, we’ll describe each of Collins’s five phases in turn.

#### Phase 1: Overconfidence

The first phase of a company’s decline is overconfidence. When companies become successful, **some fall into the trap of believing they can do no wrong** and that success can only breed more success.

(Shortform note: The first phase might creep up on you because you may not realize that you’ve moved past confidence into arrogance. To check if you’re succumbing to overconfidence, ask yourself: Do I consult others before making a decision? Do I listen to customers? Do I have a large circle that gives me a comprehensive view of the company? Is there anyone who gives me dissenting opinions? If you answer “no” to any of these questions, then it’s time for a change. The first step is opening lines of communication: Empower employees to express their opinion by asking them what they think about their performance and the performance of the company. Also seek out customers’ views.)

Overconfidence manifests in two ways: Either a successful company arrogantly goes full speed ahead with ill-advised projects, or it takes its focus away from its successful core business because it’s distracted by shiny, new pursuits.

##### A Successful Company Becomes Arrogant

The first way overconfidence leads to decline is when a company becomes so arrogant that **it believes it’s immune to failure** and that anything it touches will turn to gold.

Collins gives the example of Motorola: A giant in the analog cellphone industry in the 1990s, the company poured its resources into developing the smallest analog cell phone in the world, just as digital technology was on the rise. Motorola brushed off the digital threat and tried to coerce wireless carriers into using mostly Motorola units. But the carriers refused to be bullied, and Motorola couldn’t stem the tide of the digital revolution. The company’s cellphone market share eventually suffered a huge drop.

(Shortform note: Collins uses Motorola as an example of an enduringly successful company in 1994’s _Built to Last_. However, by the time Collins worked on _How the Mighty Fall_ , Motorola had fallen from its perch, and in 2011, the company was split into two: Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions. Motorola Mobility then changed hands a couple of times—first it was acquired by Google, then it was sold off to Chinese brand Lenovo (which still sells phones under the Motorola brand). As of 2023, Motorola appears to be making a comeback through Motorola Solutions, which has become a major player in the security industry.)

##### A Successful Company Loses Its Focus

The second way overconfidence harms companies is when **they take their focus off what Collins calls their “flywheel”** : the core business whose momentum keeps the company moving forward. Because the company may seek to expand their success to new ventures unrelated to their core business, they may pay little attention to what drives their success in the first place. When the company finds that success is hard to replicate in other fields, it may turn its attention back to the flywheel, which by then has become shaky from neglect.

(Shortform note: Collins introduces the concept of flywheels in _Good to Great_. He explains that a company’s spinning flywheel results from a “buildup phase,” wherein the company focuses on sound management practices: having highly driven people, facing facts, sticking to its core philosophy, and using technology tactically. He explains that companies fail when they take shortcuts, barreling into new projects without gaining the necessary momentum in the buildup phase.)

According to Collins, one example of a company that lost its focus is Circuit City, a consumer electronics retailer that enjoyed impressive growth in the 1980s and ’90s. Collins argues that the company’s decline began when it turned its attention to building up other unrelated businesses, such as used car dealerships. In the process, its electronics superstores stagnated. Circuit City filed for bankruptcy in 2008.

(Shortform note: Some experts say that Circuit City had plenty of other problems aside from being distracted by unrelated businesses. It couldn’t differentiate itself from its competitors, it opened too many stores that ended up competing against each other, and it mismanaged its inventory. In a bid to keep its share price from plummeting further, it also disposed of valuable assets to buy back its own stock.)

Collins adds, however, that focusing on your flywheel doesn’t mean that your company shouldn’t innovate. Rather, it means building on what you’re good at. For example, if your company is successful at selling baked goods, you shouldn’t suddenly venture into manufacturing car parts. Instead, you might expand into baked goods for dogs, boxed mixes of your muffins, or kitchen equipment like cake pans and mixing bowls.

(Shortform note: Innovating by building on what you’re good at doesn’t automatically lead to success. In _Ten Types of Innovation_ , the authors contend that some innovations fail because many companies don’t know _how_ to innovate. The authors thus recommend treating innovation as a formal discipline with a standard set of strategies. For example, you can start by defining the specific objectives of a project and clarifying how it fits into the bigger business strategy.)

The only time you should consider completely pivoting away from your flywheel, says Collins, is when it’s bound to become obsolete in a few years or when it no longer excites you. (Shortform note: If your flywheel looks like it’s destined to become obsolete, you don’t have to completely pivot from it right away. In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton M. Christensen recommends establishing an autonomous organization within the company to explore and develop disruptive innovations. And if you’re no longer excited by your flywheel, you don’t have to abandon it, as Collins suggests—instead, consider channeling your passion into something else that can keep you going, whether it’s entrepreneurship or helping your employees grow.)

#### Phase 2: Overreaching

According to Collins, the second phase leading to a company’s downfall is overreaching. This is when **a successful company becomes obsessed with growth in all the wrong ways**. Rather than pursuing steady, controlled growth in crucial areas like performance and people, the company falls into the trap of thinking that “bigger is better” and looks for ways to grow exponentially and rapidly—even if it means veering away from the company’s core purpose or chasing after growth it can’t sustain.

(Shortform note: In _The Voltage Effect_ , economics professor John A. List discusses the four red flags that indicate a company may be overreaching, or attempting to scale beyond what’s realistic or prudent: the lack of a scalable audience, dependence on talented individuals or complex systems, unintended consequences of exponential growth (such as lower productivity), and increasing unit costs leading to reduced profits.)

Collins cites Ames Department Stores as an example of an overreaching company. Ames had seen impressive growth over three decades as a small-town retailer. In a bid to break into the urban market and increase the company to twice its size, Ames acquired Zayre, another department store chain. However, Zayre’s business model and strategies didn’t align with Ames’s, and Ames quickly tried to pivot, moving away from the formula that had helped it succeed. The move led to the company’s downfall: Ames went out of business in 2002.

(Shortform note: There were other factors beyond its acquisition of Zayre that led to Ames’s closure: the earlier acquisition of Hills Department Stores, the expansion of Wal-Mart and Target, and its drastic reduction in prices to attract customers. In December 2022, rumors were circulating that Ames would be reopening in 2023. However, as of June 2023, fact-checking website Snopes has deemed this news “unproven.”)

##### Key Driver: The Wrong Kind of Leader

What often drives a company’s pursuit of unsustainable growth is having the wrong leaders in place. Collins argues that while building a great company is a team effort, **one wrong person in power can plunge a company into decline.**

Having the wrong leader can stem from a succession problem, says Collins: A strong leader who helped propel the company forward may leave without having trained a replacement, or they may entrust the company to an incapable successor. The board of directors may also lock horns when deciding on the next leader, resulting in a leadership vacuum.

(Shortform note: In _Built to Last_ , Collins writes that visionary companies—those that have endured for generations—ensure that they have a leadership continuity loop so they don’t risk having a damaging power struggle or a leadership vacuum. These companies’ leaders come up with a succession plan and have a list of strong internal candidates whom they train. Whoever takes over then puts their own succession plan in place.)

Collins contends that having the wrong people—those who aren’t aligned with the company’s culture and who aren’t self-motivated and responsible—sets off a vicious cycle within the company: Because people who aren’t a good fit aren’t intrinsically motivated to act in the best interest of the company, the company might try to exert greater control over them by putting tedious processes and protocols in place. As a result, talented people in key positions, dismayed by the red tape, decide to leave. The company then fills those roles with less talented people, leading to more red tape and more good people exiting the company. Soon, a middling team making poor decisions is running the show.

(Shortform note: One company that recognizes the importance of having good people in key positions is Netflix. In _No Rules Rules_ , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings writes that an agile company needs innovators and high performers who push each other to produce quality work. Thus, Netflix has strategies in place to retain its top-tier talent pool: The company pays top-of-market salaries, gives raises that reflect employees’ market value, and offers employees larger base salaries instead of rewarding them with performance bonuses.)

#### Phase 3: Ignoring—or Misreading—the Signs

The third phase of a company’s downfall is when it disregards signs of decline and makes reckless decisions with potentially disastrous consequences.

Companies generally don’t collapse overnight. Collins writes that there are warning signs when a company is deteriorating, such as fewer customers and lower profits. However, instead of facing problems head-on and pinpointing internal causes of decline, leaders might respond by **blaming outside factors** like an economic slump, or by **choosing to interpret inconclusive data with an overly optimistic eye**.

(Shortform note: While Collins says you shouldn’t blame outside factors for any failure, it’s still important to keep an eye out for potential external disruptions to the business. In _Only the Paranoid Survive_ , former Intel CEO Andrew Grove says that potential sources of disruption are competitors, government policies, consumers, suppliers, and adjacent businesses. Grove writes that rather than interpreting changes in these areas optimistically, you should gain a more realistic view by listening closely to a wide range of perspectives, including those of employees who are on the ground.)

Turning a blind eye to the subtle markers of trouble, a company’s leaders might then take big risks—ones that could have catastrophic consequences for the company if they don’t pay off. Collins again cites the example of Motorola, which started developing Iridium, a satellite phone, before cellular phones exploded onto the scene. The arrival of the cellphone should have given Motorola pause. The evidence was clear: Cellphones were sleeker, cheaper, and offered better coverage than satellite phones. But the company chose to believe that there was still a need for satellite phones and went full speed ahead, funneling $2 billion into the project. In the end, the all-or-nothing bet didn’t pay off, and Motorola filed for bankruptcy.

(Shortform note: It’s estimated that Motorola actually spent $5 billion on the Iridium project. Some analysts go into more detail about the Iridium’s—and ultimately, Motorola’s—failure, saying that the company fell victim to a version of the sunk cost fallacy: sticking with a doomed venture because they had already invested too much in it. Additionally, there was a failure in leadership: Not only did the CEO refuse to back down on the project, but the board was also made up of people who had a stake in Iridium, which meant that they couldn’t make decisions objectively.)

Aside from careless risk-taking, a company in denial might also undergo reorganization—sometimes multiple times—**favoring cosmetic changes that don’t address the real issues over substantive action**. (Shortform note: Collins’s skeptical view of reorganizations may stem from the fact that these changes are typically unsuccessful. A McKinsey survey found that more than 80% of company reorganizations fall short of their intended outcome, 60% lead to reduced performance, and 10% have adverse effects on the company.)

For example, Collins writes that Scott Paper Company, once the leader in the toilet paper market, restructured three times in four years as a response to Procter & Gamble (P&G) gaining ground with its own brand of toilet paper. (Shortform note: Other analysts say that Scott Paper’s restructurings were more complex than a knee-jerk reaction to the P&G threat. Instead, they were likely a response to a combination of factors, including numerous new competitors, an oversaturated tissue paper market, and Scott Paper’s expansion to Europe, Latin America, and Asia.)

#### Phase 4: Overcorrecting

Whereas leaders can brush off problems or look at data through rose-colored glasses in the third phase, they eventually have to face reality when the situation gets noticeably worse. This is the fourth phase, writes Collins: Leaders can no longer deny that the company is in trouble, and they scramble for a quick way to stop the decline. Collins explains that this reaction is borne out of instinct—**we make desperate moves when we’re fighting to survive.**

(Shortform note: In the business world, we’re supposed to react rationally instead of emotionally, but evolutionary psychologists explain that we’re hardwired to react with emotions first. To keep from being caught off-guard and reacting in desperation in the context of a failing company, consider developing an infinite mindset. In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek writes that those with an infinite mindset view business as constantly evolving, with known and unknown players and changeable rules. This means you should be prepared to pivot on a fundamental, existential level _in anticipation of_ disruptive change.)

Collins writes that in this phase, companies pin their hopes on a savior. This may come in the form of an outsider who’s brought in to fix things or an overhaul of the company’s approach to business.

##### New People

The company might hire consultants or, with much fanfare, bring in a maverick chief executive from the outside, with the hope that new blood will bring fresh ideas to reinvigorate the company. However, Collins argues that hiring an outsider rarely works out. (Shortform note: In _Built to Last_ , Collins explains why hiring outsider CEOs rarely works: The new CEO typically lacks a true understanding of the company’s core values and purpose and thus may steer the company in a damaging direction. For example, when Charles Pearce took over Colgate, he was obsessed with expansion and ignored the company’s philosophy of dealing fairly with retailers. This soured the company’s relationship with retailers, and Colgate’s average profits dropped by more than half.)

##### New Strategy

Another quick fix that a company might attempt is changing its strategy. It might go through another round of restructuring, implement a culture makeover, launch a buzzy new product, or make a hasty acquisition. If all else fails, a company might pin its hopes on a buyout. (Shortform note: Part of the reason implementing a new strategy often fails to save the company is that employees resist the change. This resistance may come from a change in “personal compacts,” or the explicit and implied agreements between the company and its employees. When a company doesn’t explain how a new strategy will affect employees’ tasks and career trajectory, employees may not deliver the results that the company expects from them.)

**Often, a company’s dubious rescuer is a combination of people and strategy.** Collins gives the example of Hewlett-Packard (HP), which went through a rough patch in the late ’90s. To turn things around, the company tapped Carly Fiorina to be its CEO. Collins characterizes Fiorina as a media darling who made sweeping changes to the company, including coming up with a bold new vision for HP, restructuring, and making a major acquisition. After HP performed poorly during her six-year tenure, Fiorina was fired.

(Shortform note: Some analysts characterize Fiorina as being all vision and no execution—she touted HP’s new vision while delegating the work of bringing it to fruition to a weak senior team. She had a dazzling presence, but she didn’t make an effort to connect with people, and her leadership style didn’t jive with HP’s culture. Professors from top business schools thought her performance was so poor that they included her in a list of the worst American CEOs of all time. After her exit from HP, Fiorina explored other areas outside of the executive suite: She published an autobiography, served as a business commentator for Fox News, and campaigned for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.)

#### Phase 5: Giving Up

Collins writes that drastic moves in the fourth phase can lead to improvements in the company’s performance, but any positive change is usually short-lived. Instead, the dramatic changes that the company implements often result in confusion and strained finances: As a company pivots its vision and strategy, employees no longer know what the company stands for. More significantly, as the company pours resources into initiatives that are likely to fail, it further weakens its financial position. Thus begins the fifth phase: **giving up, either because the leaders believe it’s the best option or because the company has run out of resources to keep going.**

(Shortform note: In _Great by Choice_ , Collins analyzes companies that were able to survive and even thrive through tough times. He writes that such companies protected themselves by building cash reserves, having up to 10 times the ratio of cash to assets compared to other companies. While some might argue that having idle cash isn’t a good use of resources, Collins writes that having significant cash reserves can serve as a shock absorber in the midst of disruptive events, increasing a company’s chances of survival.)

##### When to Give Up

Collins argues that a company should keep fighting and find any means to get back on the long road to recovery. But he also writes that there is one situation when a company should surrender: when its existence no longer serves a purpose. (Shortform note: To determine whether your company is still serving its purpose, you should have a clear idea of what that purpose is. The company’s purpose should be something that brings value to _everyone_ , from customers (fulfilling a human need) to employees (giving them an outlet for their passion), shareholders, and communities.)

### How to Turn Things Around

Collins contends that if a company still has a worthy goal and the potential to make a meaningful impact, it should commit to putting in the time and effort required to recover and rise. Collins emphasizes that **reversing decline isn’t about looking for a miracle cure** (such as a savior CEO or a revolutionary new product) but about playing a long, steady game.

(Shortform note: In _Great by Choice_ , Collins writes that successful companies focus on _consistent_ performance, in good times and bad. He calls this the 20 Mile March, which comes from the concept of reaching a destination by traveling 20 miles a day, no more, no less—no matter what. In contrast, companies that fail often go all out in good times by pursuing massive growth, which leaves them vulnerable in bad times.)

Here, we outline what Collins prescribes for a floundering company: putting the right people in place, sticking to what your company does best, and being disciplined.

#### Put the Right People in Place

As we earlier discussed, having the wrong people can plunge a company into decline. But what qualities make the “right” people?

First, **key people should be a good cultural fit**. Collins argues that companies should only hire people whose values are already aligned with those of the company. Trying to fit people into a mold leads to decisions that don’t fit in with the company’s core purpose. In contrast, those who already believe in the company’s mission are more likely to be passionate about their role, which fuels them to keep going through difficult times.

> **How Successful Companies Ensure a Good Culture Fit**
> 
> Collins goes deeper into the importance of culture fit in _Built to Last_. He writes that enduringly successful companies stand the test of time because they only hire those who are compatible with—and thus preserve—their core ideals. He says these companies have cult-like characteristics: They have a tough screening process, indoctrinate new employees by immersing them in the core ideology (through orientation seminars that highlight the company’s history, values, and traditions, for example), and even encourage employees to socialize among themselves and not with outsiders.
> 
> Collins emphasizes that ensuring a good culture fit doesn’t mean a lack of diversity—color, gender, and size don’t matter as long as an employee is compatible with the company’s core philosophy. He argues that this practice isn’t meant to turn employees into unthinking robots; instead it enables the company to empower the employees to act on their own. By being sure that its employees are aligned with the company’s core philosophy, the company can trust the employees to work autonomously.

Second, Collins writes that **key people should be responsible**. They should know what their role is, be committed to doing it to the best of their ability with minimal supervision, and take accountability when things go wrong. (Shortform note: How can you tell if a candidate for a key role is responsible and accountable? In _Rework_ , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson write that you should look for someone who’s managed their own projects or run their own companies. This is a good sign that they’re proactive and don’t need someone to hold their hand.)

#### Stick to What You Do Best

As we discussed earlier, one of the key drivers of decline is when a company ignores its flywheel—the core business that made the company successful in the first place. Collins says that you should keep pushing that flywheel as long as you’re passionate about it and it can still serve its purpose. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t innovate—just that any innovation should remain within the area you’re already good at.

(Shortform note: The key driver of the flywheel is what Collins calls your “Hedgehog Concept,” a major idea in his book _Good to Great_. He describes the Hedgehog Concept as a deep understanding of where you can play, win, and make a profit. It’s best to decide on this with a council of five to 12 members from different job levels who understand the company’s mission and can engage in a respectful, regular exchange of ideas.)

#### Be Disciplined

Collins stresses the importance of adhering to time-tested management principles as soon as you realize your company is in a state of decline. He recommends reviewing the work of experts like Peter F. Drucker and Michael Porter to brush up on the foundations of management.

(Shortform note: Collins doesn’t go into great detail about management principles, instead citing authors who’ve written classic books on the subject. Peter F. Drucker is the author of many management books, including _The Effective Executive_ , where he writes that managing _yourself_ leads to individual and organizational success. This entails managing your time, focusing on just a few key tasks, making a unique contribution, maximizing your strengths, and making sound decisions. Michael Porter is a Harvard Business School professor who wrote _Competitive Strategy_ , which covers advice for increasing a company’s profit potential, anticipating competitors’ strategies, and outperforming competitors.)

One proven management principle that Collins emphasizes is calmly and rationally evaluating business decisions. He writes that you should carefully weigh risks and **only bet on something if it isn’t big enough to sink the company if things don’t work out**. This means not going all-in on an idea that _may_ turn things around quickly while exposing the company to catastrophic risks.

(Shortform note: In _Great by Choice_ , Collins goes into more detail about how enduring companies safeguard against risk. One method is the “bullets before cannonballs” approach, wherein a company fires “bullets” first, testing to see where they land. These bullets can come in the form of a new product, service, technology, process, or acquisition, as long as they have three characteristics: They don’t cost much, they don’t expose the company to much risk, and they don’t disrupt the company. Once a company has gathered convincing data from its bullets, it concentrates its firepower into a calibrated cannonball and launches that in the direction where bullets have shown the greatest potential.)

Collins says that strong companies should be disciplined as well. This means staying the course and keeping an eye out for the warning signs of deterioration: The earlier you recognize that the company is in trouble, the sooner you can get back on course.

> **Are Discipline and Vigilance All a Company Needs to Survive?**
> 
> In _Great by Choice_ , Collins similarly posits that successful companies have: 1) fanatic discipline, which means adhering consistently to their values, long-term goals, standards, and methods, and 2) productive paranoia, which means considering every kind of nightmare scenario so they can prepare for the worst.
> 
> However, some argue that there are some scenarios you simply can’t foresee. Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls these “Black Swans”—extremely unpredictable events that have massive impacts on society. In _The Black Swan_ , he cites the fall of the Berlin Wall, the creation of the Internet, and the 2008 financial crisis as examples of these events. He offers some advice for dealing with uncertainty, including preparing for the widest range of contingencies rather than predicting specific events. He explains that even though we can’t predict Black Swans, we can predict their _effects_ , and thus safeguard against those.
> 
> Similar to Taleb, the authors of _Lead From the Future_ write that no one can predict the future. Thus, they suggest future-proofing your business through _visionary planning_ —changing your focus from short-term concerns to the future you want to see five to 10 years from now. This process encourages you to think outside your company’s established processes and approaches and to reinvent your business, whether in whole or in part.
> 
> Finally, in addition to discipline, vigilance, and planning, your company should build up its resilience. Some experts say that for an enterprise to be resilient, it should have backup systems, diverse employees with varied ways of thinking, a segmented structure so that the failure of one segment won’t cause the entire organization to crumble, and alignment of its goals with those of wider-ranging systems (such as the economy and society).
