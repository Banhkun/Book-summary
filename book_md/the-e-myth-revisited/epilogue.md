## Epilogue

In your small business, which is a reflection of you, you have created a practical space in which to learn and grow. It’s similar to a dojo or practice hall, as described by Joe Hyams in _Zen in the Martial Arts_. It’s a space for immersive learning.

Your small business is a manageable world that responds to your actions instantly. You can test your ideas and assumptions about the business and yourself. You’re forced to be specific rather than make generalizations, and you have to think strategically as well as operationally. You have ideals, but you still must be practical and maintain rules and order.

Creating your own world, which is the entrepreneur’s dream after all, teaches you your limitations and strengths and helps you understand yourself and the larger world. Innovation, measurement, and execution are your belief system and way of functioning. You have the opportunity to develop all three facets of yourself — entrepreneur, manager, and technician — so that you and your business are whole and balanced.

Implementing the business development process changes both you and your business. You’re separate but working harmoniously. You realize the American small business dream.
