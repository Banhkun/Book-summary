## Exercise: Assess Your Business

A typical small business goes through infancy and adolescence phases. In the infancy stage, the owner usually focuses on the technician role and tries to do it all; in adolescence, the owner hires additional employees but begins losing control. A business doesnâ€™t reach maturity unless the owner expands his or her skillset.
