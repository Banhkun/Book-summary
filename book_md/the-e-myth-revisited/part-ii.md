## Part II: The Franchise Movement

The franchise movement, which provided a “turn-key” model for new businesses, has had a transformative effect on American small business comparable to that of the industrial revolution and the rise of technology and computers. The franchise model brings organization to the disarray of many small businesses and a path for development and continuous growth.

**The movement began in 1952, when a milkshake machine salesman, Ray Kroc, visited a hamburger restaurant owned by two brothers named MacDonald** in San Bernardino, Calif.

At the restaurant, he found high school students producing identical burgers systematically and efficiently under the supervision of the owners.

Kroc immediately saw that this process could be replicated to continually make money, and he persuaded the brothers to let him franchise it. A dozen years later, he bought them out and created what became the world’s largest prepared food delivery system.

McDonald’s, a $40 billion-a-year business with more than 28,000 restaurants at the time this book was written, calls itself “the most successful small business in the world.” It triggered the growth of franchised businesses in the U.S. to the point that, in 2000, there were 320,000 franchised businesses in 75 industries.

Franchising wasn’t a new idea — **Kroc’s innovation was his “business format franchise,”** a new-business template that’s been widely adopted by other companies. Under business format franchising, the franchisor teaches the **business format (marketing, selling, inventory, finance, personnel procedures)** to the franchisee. It was so successful that from 1971-87, less than 5 percent of franchises failed. In five years, 5 percent failed compared to the 80 percent failure rate for independently owned businesses.

### Chapter 7: A New-Business Model

Originally, franchised businesses were “trade name” franchises in which the franchisor merely gave small businesses a license to use its name and sell its products. In contrast, under a business format franchise, the franchisee **gets not only the name but also a complete _system_ for operating a business**.

In the case of a trade franchise, the value lies in the brand name it’s licensing (for example, Mercedes), but with a business format franchise, the value comes from the process or business model (how it sells something, rather than what it sells). **For Ray Kroc, the business — McDonald’s — was the product, not hamburgers.** Kroc sold franchisees a business that works. Here’s how he did it.

Franchisees who wanted to buy a successful business were Kroc’s customers. He sought to differentiate his franchises from others by making sure they worked better than any others did. Because small businesses failed so frequently, he had to create a model or format that would be nearly foolproof no matter who bought it.

He created a franchise prototype similar to the assembly-line model for making a mass-production product like a car: it was based on systems rather than people and could be assembled easily, efficiently, and inexpensively with uniform parts. Together, the systems produced exactly what the customer wanted and expected every time.

Kroc had tested every part of his prototype and standardized everything. For instance, he determined that:

  * French fries should be left no more than seven minutes in the warming bin or they’ll get soggy.
  * Pickles should be arranged a certain way by hand so they won’t fall out of the sandwich.
  * Food should be served in under a minute.



He created a rigorous training program (Hamburger U) to teach franchisees how to run the system. Having thought through every problem, he left franchisees with little discretion. The system has worked for owners, employees, and customers.

Many businesses have taken Kroc’s ideas and created their own business format franchises. The system is a proven success. Seventy-five percent succeed in their first five years, compared to the twenty percent survival rate of independently owned businesses within five years. Others using the franchise prototype include Federal Express, Mrs. Field’s Cookies, Subway, Domino’s Pizza, and KFC.

#### How the Franchise Prototype Works

Fortunately for would-be small business owners everywhere, Kroc’s model of systematizing a business can be applied to small business development in any field. Like Kroc in building McDonald’s, you can build a reliable system for operating your business that stops relying on you as a technician and is capable of scaling to handle more demand.

**Building your business prototype solves the problems, such as lack of coordination and inconsistency, that typically undermine small businesses**. It provides you, as a small business owner, with an organizational framework for realizing your dream. It’s an incubator in which you can test ideas and assumptions in a disciplined way. The system, with all its parts working together, turns your business into a smoothly functioning machine.

It balances the three roles of a business owner: it provides a vision of what the business is and how it should work (entrepreneur), a system for implementing the vision (manager), and specific standards and instructions for the daily work (technician).

By building your business template, you create your own way of doing business that differentiates it from competitors — and that functions automatically by design rather than force of will. You’ll control your business rather than it controlling you.

### Chapter 8: Rethinking Your Business

Before applying the prototype business format, you need to think of your business in a new way. The first and most important principle is that **your business is separate from your life**. Your business must _serve_ your life, as opposed to your life serving your business. When you accept this principle, your business becomes an entity you shape and work _on_ rather than _in_. This perspective should drive all of your actions.

Creating a franchise prototype helps you do this. Try this exercise for reconceptualizing your business. **Think of it as though it were the prototype for thousands of others like it.**

Imagine you’re going to franchise it with the following guidelines. How would your franchise prototype look compared to the way your business looks today?

1) **Your model will provide a level of value to your customers and everyone else your business touches that’s consistent and exceeds expectations**.

The answer to how your business will provide value is the reason it exists. Your customers, employees, and suppliers, not you, define the value your business provides. It’s reflected in such things as the way you greet customers and recognize/reward employees, the price of your service or product, or the time you spend answering a customer’s questions.

2) **Your model can be applied by people with the minimal skills necessary for each position**. If you base it on highly skilled people, you’ll have a harder time filling positions and you’ll pay more. Further, your model will be hard to reproduce.

Make your business dependent on systems rather than people. People can still help you improve your systems by coming up with ways to serve customers better. But when your business is people-dependent, it’s subject to their moods — you have to motivate them — and can’t produce consistent results. Your system is a tool you develop and use to teach people to do the work of your business and differentiate it from competitors.

3) **Your model provides organization and order**. There’s more than enough chaos in the world; most people are looking for order. A business that appears organized gives your customers, employees, and suppliers confidence that it can deliver the results they want.

4) **Your model is documented in an operations manual**. Documentation provides your employees with clarity. It explains the purpose of the work, the steps for doing it, and the standards that must be met. Without documentation, everyone creates their own processes and standards.

5) **Your business provides consistent service**. To be comfortable with your business, customers must receive the same service, in the same way, each time. If they don’t know what to expect, they’ll stop coming back. When you run a business arbitrarily, you’re running it for yourself, not the customer.

6) **Your business has a coherent, uniform look**. Everything, including the office design, employee dress code, business cards, signs, and printed materials, should be coordinated. Colors, shapes, and overall look motivate customers and should be professional and research-based.

To work _on_ your business:

  * Design it to work without your constant presence.
  * Design it in a way that enables people to work without close oversight.
  * Systematize it so that it works automatically, can be replicated, and allows you to do what you love rather than what you have to do.



When you can answer these questions, you’ll be thinking of your business in a new way, as your product, and with a new level of excitement.
