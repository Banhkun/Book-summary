## Part III: Building an Effective Small Business

### **Chapter** 9**: Developing Your Business**

To organize or reorganize your business into a model or prototype that could be replicated, you need a business development program.

It has seven components:

1) Personal objective

2) Business objective

3) Organizational plan

4) Management plan

5) Personnel plan

6) Marketing plan

7) Systems plan

#### 1) Personal Objective

As noted previously, your life and your business are separate things. But your business can and should play an important role in your life, and its purpose should dovetail with your personal goals.

Before determining your business’s role in your life, determine your own primary goal by considering what you most value, what kind of life you want, and who you want to be. You need to know where you’re going in life in order for your business to contribute to that goal.

Other questions to help determine your life goal include:

  * what you want your life to be like on a daily basis
  * how you want to relate to others
  * what you want others to think of you
  * what you’d like to be doing in both the short term and longer term
  * how you want to grow and what you’d like to learn
  * how much you need to earn to achieve your goals



Knowing your life goal can help you shape your business goals and provide the energy and purpose to drive your business.

#### 2) Business Objective

Your business can be part of achieving your life goal. Your business objective is a clear statement of what you want your business to look like and what you want it to accomplish.

A vision of what you want your business to be includes financial goals; clarity on what you propose to sell and specifically to whom; and considerations such as your growth timeline and standards for how you’ll do business.

##### Financial Goals

In picturing what your business will look like when fully realized, decide how big it will be in terms of gross revenue. Also, estimate pre- and after-tax profits. Does the amount match what you need to achieve your life goal? How much do you want to be able to ultimately sell the business for, and when do you want to sell it?

If the business you’re developing can’t provide the return you want, you need to change it, walk away, or come up with a better opportunity.

Other relevant questions include:

  * “Does the business address a need for a large enough group of customers to be sustainable? Based on demographic data, who is my best customer?”
  * “Beyond a specific commodity, what am I selling to this group of customers? What intangible need am I meeting?” For example, Revlon’s commodity is cosmetics, but it also sells hope.



Once you have a clear picture of what you want your fully realized business to look like, you need to create an organizational plan.

#### 3) Organizational Plan

Small business owners often think they don’t need an organization chart because they’re starting with only a few people. But a chart reflects not just where you are at present, but how you want the business to develop organizationally.

**Many businesses make the mistake of organizing around people** rather than around the necessary functions. For example, a naive business might merely think about hiring a specific number of people, equally distributing tasks between those people.

If you organize around people, your operating ability will depend on specific employees’ strengths, weaknesses, moods, and attitudes. When employees quit, you’ll be left in the lurch. Responsibilities will be unclear and you won’t be able to hold anyone accountable for getting the necessary things done.

Instead, **create an organization plan reflecting what your organization will look like when the business is fully evolved**.

  * List every position/function that will be needed, from chief operating officer to dishwasher, and note the lines of authority. 
  * Do each job yourself to determine their respective duties, results, and standards. Then write an operations manual for each position. 
  * Write a position contract for each position. This isn’t a job description, but rather summarizes results the person in each position must deliver, the standards for evaluating the results, and the work he or she will be accountable for performing.
  * Don’t advertise to fill a position until you’ve taken the above steps.



Your organization chart evolves from your objectives and establishes the logic and structure of your business, as well as how positions/functions relate to each other and to the whole.

#### 4) Management Plan

Your management plan is your operating philosophy: **it reflects why and how you do what you do**. Your management system is also the way you and your employees communicate your operating philosophy to your customers through your actions.

The author’s experience at a favorite hotel in the Pacific Northwest illustrates how a management strategy and system work. The hotel’s management plan or philosophy was to provide harried guests with a place of peace and order, where they could relax and feel taken care of.

The company had a system for going above and beyond expectations to consistently serve the needs (even unconscious ones) of each customer. The check-in staff and the staff at the adjoining restaurant used subtle questions to determine each guest’s preferences for wine, coffee, and newspaper brand. Automatic lighting inside and outside adjusted to the time of day and darkness. Staff anticipated the needs of guests — for instance, starting a fire in each room’s fireplace on chilly evenings and setting a timer to start the coffee pot in the morning.

To ensure that a plethora of little things were done consistently for each guest each time he visited, staff followed numerous checklists and supervisors did spot checks. Guests’ preferences were noted and addressed on subsequent visits as well. New employees were taught the company’s management philosophy and were walked through an operations manual for their particular job. The management system was effective in applying the business’s philosophy because of these and other automated processes.

#### 5) Personnel**** Plan

To get things done and done right consistently, create an environment in your business where doing what needs to be done is important and gratifying to the people tasked to do it. Create processes, as the hotel in the previous example did, that make doing what you want a habit.

In addition, make sure people understand the purpose of the work you’re asking them to do and make sure the steps and standards are clear. Go through the company’s objectives, standards, strategy, philosophy, and operations manual. Also, exemplify the behavior you want to see from your employees.

The work environment and rules you create for accomplishing the company’s purpose can be likened to a game in which everyone participates and tests their skills and talents. Communicate your business’s “game” (its purpose and method of achieving it) to each employee when you start your relationship. How you do this is your personnel plan.

Here are some guidelines for establishing and communicating your game (purpose and methods):

  * Establish the parameters at the beginning.
  * Be willing to play your own game (set an example, for instance, by how you treat customers).
  * Create opportunities for people to “win” or succeed and be recognized, although the game is always ongoing.
  * Constantly remind people of the game (purpose).
  * To keep it interesting, change tactics (methods) occasionally, although your overall strategy must remain the same.
  * Make playing the game (achieving your business’s purpose) fun.
  * Make it logical. Using the hotel example, here’s the logic of the hotel’s “game”: In today’s chaotic and busy world, people need a place of order and calm. Our business can fulfill this need by creating a special place, where the physical environment and everything we do contributes to a sense of order.



##### Your Hiring Process

Your hiring process is crucial to achieving your purpose. It’s your first opportunity to communicate your purpose to potential employees.

The hotel owner in the example followed a carefully designed and scripted process of choosing, hiring, and orienting employees. It included a presentation in a group meeting to all applicants, followed by an individual meeting to discuss each applicant’s reactions to the ideas presented.

A new employee’s first day of training included:

  * A review of the business owner’s purpose and methods.
  * A summary of the system for carrying out the business’s purpose.
  * A tour of the facility, accompanied by an explanation of each person’s job.
  * A question-and-answer period.
  * A presentation of the uniform and operations manual.
  * A review of the manual, position contract, and business objectives.
  * A discussion of how the business does things (rules of the game).



Your system or way of doing business, communicated clearly to and by your people, differentiates your business from your competitors’.

#### 6) Marketing Plan

Your marketing plan begins and ends with your customer. In deciding this strategy, forget what _you_ want — your dreams and goals for the business — and focus on what the customer wants, which you need to discover and cater to better than anyone else.

To do this, you need to know two things in detail :

  * Who your prime customers are — their demographics or facts such as age, gender, income, and marital status.
  * Why they buy — their psychographics, defined as the classification of people based on psychological criteria such as aspirations, attitudes, habits, tastes, and preferences. 



By knowing these things, you can scientifically build your business model or prototype to satisfy your customer’s needs (which may be subconscious). To learn about your target customers, you can buy market data, or you can learn from existing customers by asking them about their needs and interests via surveys and questionnaires that provide a reward (something free or discounted) in return for participation.

Many business owners make marketing decisions on how to attract customers without objective information, depending instead on instincts and opinions, which are likely inaccurate or incomplete. However, with a demographic and psychographic customer profile, you have a far better chance of reaching and satisfying your customers.

#### 7) Systems Plan

Every element of your business is part of a system, which is a set of interrelated procedures, methods, and routines designed to accomplish a purpose. You have multiple systems — for instance, billing or inventory control — that affect each other.

In a business, there are three general types of systems:

  * Hard or inanimate — for instance, your computer system or your office design.
  * Soft — for instance, systems involving people and ideas. Your verbal and written communications are soft systems. Your recruiting script is a soft system, as are your advertisements.
  * Information — for instance, sales activity reports or cash flow forecasts. These provide data about the interaction of hard and soft systems.



**Your business model or prototype must integrate your systems so they strengthen each other.**

  * For instance, you might have a selling system (soft) — a series of steps to be taken by salespeople to make a sale, including making an appointment with the client, presenting a needs analysis, and following up with a presentation on your company’s solutions to the customer’s needs. 
  * The selling system would be supported by your information system, which buttresses your salesperson’s presentation with data relevant to the customer and helps you evaluate employees with data tracking how the salesperson is performing. Sales data provided by your information system also helps you identify new sales opportunities or weaknesses you need to address. 
  * Your hard systems also help your salespeople do their jobs — for instance, tools such as a laptop computer or tablet help them make compelling presentations to customers.



Your business systems work together to present a single, consistent message — the idea or purpose driving your business.

### Chapter 10: Ongoing Business Development

Once you have your business organized and on track, development becomes an ongoing process that involves three activities: innovation, measurement of results, and execution.

#### Innovation

Most business owners think innovation means coming up with new products to increase sales. In contrast, **the franchise movement increases sales by applying innovation to the _process_ — how a business does (or sells) things — rather than to what it produces.**

For example, innovating or changing the way your business interacts with customers can improve your results. The innovation can be as simple as changing your greeting from “How may I help you” to “Hello, have you been here before?” The changed greeting allows you to pursue a conversation about what you have to offer. By contrast, when a salesperson simply asks how he or she can help, the customer usually replies, “I’m just looking,” and moves on. A small change like this can increase sales.

Changing the color of your employees’ suits or uniforms can increase sales as well. For instance, one business found that salesmen sold more while wearing blue suits than while wearing black suits.

Innovations should be:

  * Simple to implement rather than making things more complicated.
  * Meaningful to customers.
  * Based on accurate knowledge of what your customer wants and expects.



Innovations in the way you do business differentiate your business from competitors, and the process of continuous improvement generates energy among employees.

#### Measurement

Measuring the results and quantifying everything you do are the only ways to know what’s working and what’s not. However, many businesses don’t do it — for example, most can’t tell you how many selling opportunities they had the day before, an omission that’s costing them money.

You need numbers for everything in order to know where you are and where you’re headed. For example, to learn the impact of changing your customer greeting, you need to determine:

  * How many customers visited before the change
  * How many people bought something and the dollar value before the change
  * How many customers visited after the change
  * How many of them bought something and the dollar value after the change



You also need to be certain that any change in sales or revenue was in fact a result of the new greeting, rather than due to some other factor.

Begin your business development process by **attaching numbers to everything related to your business practices** , such as:

  * How many customers you have each day, in the morning versus afternoon
  * How many calls you get daily and when
  * How many items and of what type you sell each day and when
  * Which days and times are your busiest



#### Execution

Once you innovate (find better ways to do things) and measure how you’re doing, you need to **execute changes systematically** so that people know what to do and how, rather than acting on their own discretion.

If you’ve found that something works, do it consistently so customers can depend on it and your business retains the identity you created. Of course, if you find that something isn’t working, figure out what will work better and do that instead. Your business development process should be ongoing — you need to keep innovating, measuring, and executing.
