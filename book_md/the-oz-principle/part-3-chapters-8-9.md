## Part 3 | Chapters 8-9: Accountability in Organizations

So far, we’ve focused mostly on individual accountability. The final chapters shift to a big-picture view of accountability as a group endeavor. The authors __ explain how leaders can implement a mindset of accountability throughout their organization by modeling positive behaviors, teaching others how to hold themselves accountable, monitoring their progress, and ultimately reinforcing cultural changes so that they last.

### Be Accountable as a Team

_The Oz Principle_ cites several **benefits from creating an organizational culture of accountability** :

  * You’ll encourage initiative, creativity, and camaraderie among your team. 
  * You’ll anticipate problems before they arise; when they do arise, they’ll get solved faster. 
  * You’ll avoid costly disasters, saving time and money. 
  * People will feel more invested in their work because they’re taking greater ownership of it—they’re not just following orders.



(Shortform note: Other benefits of an organizational culture of accountability that are just as important, or even more important, include: creating and reinforcing a positive work environment, improving employee performance, encouraging greater adherence to company guidelines and rules, and greater profitability and performance versus your competition.)

Group or joint accountability starts with recognizing that, as part of a greater whole, you and your team members are _interdependent_.

While you have specific responsibilities for which you’re individually accountable, you also have shared responsibilities—like picking up the slack to meet a group deadline when a coworker is sick—for which you’re jointly accountable. Any group that’s working toward a shared goal—a sports team, students submitting a group project, or employees at a company—succeeds or fails together. That interdependence means members need to be accountable together, too.

(Shortform note: In _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Stephen Covey contends that interdependence is critical to success because your relationships with others affect your productivity and ability to grow. Three of his seven habits focus on developing your interdependence through collaboration, cooperation, and communication.)

#### Focus on Results to Nurture Joint Accountability

To help people look beyond their basic responsibilities and think about the things for which they share accountability with others, the authors recommend that leaders **emphasize the value of _results_.** It’s not enough that people just do what they’re supposed to do—follow directions, check off the list of duties in a job description—if they’re not producing positive results. It’s not enough for the company as a whole to maintain a status quo while falling behind competitors. The results matter more than performing assigned duties.

Make it clear to employees what kind of results you’re looking for, and be specific—whether it’s to hit a certain sales threshold or grow the team by a certain number of roles. Identify the numbers you’ll need to see to know that you’ve succeeded. **To score a goal, employees have to be able to see the goalposts.**

(Shortform note: In _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , Patrick Lencioni asserts that by having tangible measures of success, teams are better able to attract and retain achievement-oriented employees. Also, it’s easier to evaluate performance, and a focus on results avoids the distraction and waste of energy occurring when team members pursue individual agendas at the expense of the team.)

Once you’ve established the need to get results, defined the results you’re after, and explained how you’ll measure them, you’ll then have to motivate your team to focus on results.

(Shortform note: On their Partners in Leadership website, the authors of _The Oz Principle_ provide an interactive tool called the Propeller, which helps leaders and their teams focus, communicate and track key results, as well as build empowerment and ownership. As one aspect of the platform, team members each create a personal impact statement of how their role and duties contribute to achieving specific results; everyone can see everyone else’s impact statement to see how roles work together. A sense of empowerment increases team members’ motivation.)

The authors cite rewards as a valuable motivational tool, even if the reward is purely symbolic, like getting a gold star on your homework in school). **Give people gold stars in the form of praise and recognition, as well as substantive rewards such as commissions, bonuses, and so on.** Some companies offer equity, knowing that employees who own a piece of the company are invested in the whole, not just in their own job.

> **Design an Effective Team Rewards Structure**
> 
> If team-based rewards aren’t structured carefully, so that they’re clear and equitable, human resources experts caution that they can undermine individual initiative, trust, and therefore team success. Here are some typical rewards for successful teamwork, each with advantages and disadvantages:
> 
>   * **Incentive pay** : A team receives compensation based on performance against goals. **Pro** : Can be focused on both individual and team performance. **Con** : Employees may resist thinking of themselves as team members.
> 
>   * **Recognition** : A one-time performance award for a few employees or groups. **Pro** : Easy and inexpensive to implement. **Cons** : Employees may become competitive; offers less front-end motivation.
> 
>   * **Profit sharing** : The company distributes cash to all employees based on its finances. **Pro** : Builds awareness about company financial performance. **Con** : May be too far beyond workers’ control to affect performance.
> 
>   * **Gainsharing** : The company shares a percentage of the value of increased productivity. **Pros** : Most useful for production-oriented employees; well-received by employees because of its additional compensations. **Con** : May be too far beyond workers’ control to drive performance.
> 
> 

> 
> A key to employee acceptance of a team-based reward structure is having an objective, fair process with measurable rewards. In contrast, if vaguely defined or poorly implemented, team rewards can increase competitive behavior, including withholding information and less collegiality, resulting in a negative ROI for the company.
> 
> Further, studies show that the smaller the team, the more effective team-based rewards are. This may be because smaller teams have stronger bonds and more interaction among members than large teams.

### Lead With an Accountability Mindset

Once you understand the building blocks of an organization-wide culture of accountability, _The Oz Principle_ recommends these steps to become the kind of leader who can create that culture:

  * **Examine your own motivations.** Approach the task of creating an accountability culture with a desire to help people do better. If you use “accountability” to blame other people or shame them for slipping into a victim mindset, you’ll fail to create positive change. (Shortform note: Blaming or shaming others also likely means you’re not being honest about your own role in the problem. We’ll discuss honesty more below.)
  * **Set clear and specific expectations.** Make sure people understand what results you’re looking for, what the organization’s goals are, why you’re following up with them, what purpose their reports to you serve. Give them a target to aim for. (Shortform note: Steps for setting employee expectations include ensuring they’re clear in your own mind, clearly explaining the reasons behind them, and putting them in writing.)
  * **Lead by example.** Show people how you hold _yourself_ accountable by modeling behaviors such as being proactive, owning your mistakes, focusing on results, and following through. (Shortform note: In _Can’t Hurt Me_ , retired Navy SEAL and ultramarathoner David Goggins recommends holding yourself accountable by creating an “accountability mirror” by writing your goals on notes and taping them to your mirror, then having an honest conversation about your successes and failures while looking yourself in the eye each day.)
  * **Be understanding.** It takes time for people to learn to be accountable. If someone reverts to victimism, offer support, encouragement, and constructive feedback. (Shortform note: To best support employees, check in often and communicate more than you think is necessary.)



> **Accountability Strategies for Leaders**
> 
> In addition to the steps above, practice these daily accountability strategies for leaders:
> 
>   1. **Start with honesty** : Accountable leaders set aside pride and admit their mistakes. They acknowledge their own role in problems and devise solutions that resolve conflicts and challenges fairly and reasonably, and focus on an end goal. They say, “I’m sorry.”
> 

> 
> 2.**Seek input** : When results are disappointing, accountable leaders seek feedback from bosses, peers, direct reports, and others about how things could have gone better, so they can improve in the future. They advocate for changes that improve efficiency, decision-making, and developing talent.
> 
>   1. **Deliver on commitments** : Accountable leaders don’t shirk responsibility, over- or under-commit, or procrastinate. Before agreeing to do something, they ensure they have the time and resources to do it well.
> 


### Take Action to Change the System

While accountability is an individual choice, **you can create conditions within your organization that ensure people make that choice:**

#### 1\. Teach and Train Everyone in Accountability

Training people in accountability involves first explaining what you've learned from _The Oz Principle_ about behaviors that characterize victimization and failure versus accountability and success. **They might need to unlearn the idea that accountability is simply another form of blame.**

Discuss the behaviors of accountable people versus victims. Share personal anecdotes of times you fell into a victim mindset and how you overcame it. Giving concrete examples will help people self-reflect and apply the ideas to their own lives. (Shortform note: _Inc._ magazine offers the following “8 habits of highly accountable people”: Take responsibility, don’t make excuses, be on time, control our own fate, own your emotions, communicate expectations, collaborate, don’t expect praise—take satisfaction in accomplishment.)

Then, make it clear that accountability is the standard that your team and organization will be held to—incorporate accountability in your expectations and goals.

#### 2\. Coach Them Through the Change

Once everyone is on the same page about the meaning of accountability and what accountability looks like, coach them to form good habits around accountability.

(Shortform note: The Gallup organization notes that many companies’ accountability problems may actually be coaching problems. In a Gallup survey, 47% of workers reported receiving feedback “a few times or less” in a year; and only 26% strongly agreed that the feedback they got helped them do better.)

The authors point out that **_coaching_ people is different from _controlling_ them. **Instead of telling someone what to do, ask them what _they_ think they should do. Give them the opportunity to make decisions and solve problems, because that will help them form good habits around accountability. It also forces them to take responsibility for their own work, rather than only taking orders (thus leaving the responsibility with whoever’s directing them).

(Shortform note: To further clarify the difference between coaching and controlling (or managing), a Forbes article describes coaching as involving exploring, facilitating, partnering, encouraging ongoing improvement, and opening the door to multiple potential outcomes. In contrast, managing involves ordering, directing, meeting immediate needs, and producing a specific outcome. This chart shows additional differences in coaching mindset and behavior.)

A few elements of good coaching include:

##### Encouraging Two-Way Feedback

Anyone can revert to bad habits. The benefit of a team is that members can look out for each other, providing support, encouragement, and constructive advice to keep moving forward. To facilitate giving and receiving feedback,**make sure people feel safe speaking up.**

(Shortform note: Ways to ensure that employees feel safe speaking up include proving that you value what people have to say, avoiding making them feel wrong, listening without judgment, and ensuring psychological safety by being open, honest, and respectful.)

Validate those who speak up to offer another perspective: Thank them, acknowledge the value of their input, and engage thoughtfully with their points.

##### Following Up

Just as you monitor your own progress, **keep track of how the people you’re coaching are doing.** Set specific times and dates to follow up with them. Make it routine.

But don’t micromanage—be willing to leave people to their own devices, and trust that they’ll figure things out. Knowing when to intervene and when to rely on your team is part of being a good leader. (Shortform note: In contrast, micromanaging not only undermines trust, it’s also highly stressful for employees.)

##### Getting to the Root of What’s Holding Them Back

When there’s a problem, ask questions and do your own investigating if necessary to find (and guide employees to) the underlying causes.

People might give excuses, misinterpret events, lack information, or otherwise be unable to pinpoint why something went wrong. It’s not that you should distrust what they say; just be aware that people have biases, and you can’t always take someone’s version of events as the absolute truth. Remember, it’s not about blaming them—it’s about giving them the tools to overcome their obstacles.

> **Seven Essential Coaching Questions**
> 
> Coaching can address a specific issue with an employee, such as meeting or not meeting a goal. But it can also be an ongoing developmental process.
> 
> In _The Coaching Habit,_ Michael Stanier __ recommends routinely asking employees these “seven essential questions”:
> 
>   * What’s on your mind?
> 
>   * Anything else?
> 
>   * What’s the central challenge for you?
> 
>   * What do you want?
> 
>   * How can I support you?
> 
>   * What’s the cost of saying “yes”?
> 
>   * What was most useful to you?
> 
> 

> 
> By making a habit of asking these questions, you can help your employees become more productive, independent, and able to solve their own problems.

#### 3\. Ask the Right Questions

Next, help your team maintain a positive and productive attitude by asking questions that guide them toward an accountability mindset. For example, you might encourage your team members to respond to all problems with “How can I help?” Or to respond to obstacles with “What’s the next step?” This focuses people’s thinking on making progress and on how they can influence the situation.

However, you might also **come up with your own questions tailored to your organization’s unique needs.** These questions might draw attention to signs that you're making errors you've made in the past, or the unique goals and results you're aiming for now. For example, if your team once missed a project deadline because a mathematical error forced you to redo work, you might set checkpoints to ask: “Have we double-checked our calculations so far?”

> **Accountability Questions**
> 
> Another way to build a personal and organizational accountability habit is to ask yourself these questions weekly. Compare answers with an accountability partner, if you have one.
> 
>   1. Rate the past week on a scale of 1-10 (10 being fantastic).
> 
>   2. What was your biggest priority?
> 
>   3. Did you accomplish it, and if not, why not?
> 
>   4. What did you learn last week?
> 
>   5. What was your biggest business highlight?
> 
>   6. What was your biggest obstacle?
> 
>   7. What do you need to solve it?
> 
>   8. What was your biggest personal highlight last week?
> 
>   9. What needs to happen to make this week a success?
> 
>   10. What do you need help with and who do you need to contact?
> 
> 


#### 4\. Keep Track of Their Progress

**An accountability mindset, or lack thereof, will be evident in people’s work.** You’ll know if people are holding themselves accountable by whether they get results, complete tasks on time, and follow through on the things they say they’re going to do.

Help them stay on track by starting small, creating routines, and checking in on their progress. If they have many projects, tasks, or commitments on their plate, **get them to focus on one goal at a time.** Don’t just wait for them to finish and come to you with an update. **Follow up with them at mutually agreed-upon times.** If they falter, you can offer constructive feedback. If they’re succeeding, offer encouragement and praise. (Shortform note: Similarly, _The Coaching Habit_ recommends taking advantage of daily coaching opportunities. For example, if an employee sends you a long email about a problem, respond by asking, “Before I send you a detailed reply, can you tell me what the central challenge is for you?”)

You’ll slowly normalize accountability as part of the day-to-day operations within your organization.

#### 5\. Reinforce Accountable Behaviors

Once people begin to practice accountability, reinforce those behaviors so that they become habits. For example, use keywords or phrases—like the questions you came up with. **Even the word “accountability” can become a signal that reminds people of discussions you’ve had.**

Another way to reinforce good habits is to use rewards, especially praise or recognition. (Shortform note: In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano notes that managers tend to overestimate how much recognition they give. But recognition is a key part of a leader’s job, because quick recognition of positive behavior locks in that behavior while failure to reinforce it makes it less likely to be repeated. Further, a minute spent complimenting someone’s work can lead to hours of increased productivity.)

When accountability is a company value, those who show the greatest accountability are entrusted with more responsibility and earn promotions as well. They become leaders, which helps cement a culture of accountability in the organization.
