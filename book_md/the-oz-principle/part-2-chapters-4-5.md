## Part 2 | Chapters 4-5: Understand the Problem and Your Role

After _defining_ accountability, the authors explain how to _practice_ accountability in your daily life by following four steps that constitute a journey like Dorothy’s in _The Wizard of Oz_. The first steps are:

  * Step 1: Face facts, or evaluate problems without flinching from difficult realities.
  * Step 2: Admit your role by being honest about how your actions affected the problem



Chapters 4-5 discuss the importance of acknowledging the problem and figuring out the root causes, then examining how your actions (or inaction) played a role—because even if the situation was caused by forces out of your control, you’ll likely be able to identify a few things you could’ve done differently concerning the things you _could_ control.

### Step 1: Face Facts

You can't have accountability if you don't face the facts of a situation—that is, if you don’t confront reality. The authors contend that facing facts or reality entails dealing with three elements:

#### 1\. Changes in Your Surroundings

People often try to carry on as usual when circumstances have changed. It’s irrational, but it’s something we’re all prone to doing. Don’t get stuck in that rut; face the problem and think about how you’re going to adapt. For example, the arrival of a new competitor in your industry might mean your company has to come up with creative ways to stay relevant. Or a loud new neighbor moving in might mean you have to invest in earplugs if you want to sleep through the night.

> **Face the Inevitability of Change**
> 
> _Who Moved My Cheese, _a best-selling parable about mice whose cheese stockpile disappears, addresses the personal challenges of acknowledging and adapting to changed circumstances and remaining adaptable in the future. The book outlines four steps for facing change:
> 
>   * Realize it’s inevitable. Anticipate it and look for signs that it’s coming.
> 
>   * When change happens, overcome your fears, most of which are exaggerated, and move quickly to adapt.
> 
>   * Learn to enjoy change: Learning and experiencing new things is rewarding. Taking control of your situation is empowering.
> 
>   * Expect and prepare for further, ongoing change.
>

#### 2\. Other People’s Perceptions of You

Sometimes you’ll disagree with another person’s read of a situation, but their opinion has a real impact on you, so you have to make space for it. In your professional life, that person might be your boss or a client; in your personal life, they might be a partner, a child, a relative, or a friend.

For example, if your partner’s version of reality is that you’re not communicative enough, it’s not sufficient to say, “That’s not true,” even if you really believe they’re wrong. You have to confront those feelings and find a way to work it out if you want the relationship to continue—whether that means discussing your communication styles, compromising, or making an effort to change.

(Shortform note: Rather than denying the reality, you can change your behavior plus others’ perceptions of you with three steps: 1) Get more feedback (ask about the impact of your behavior and how you can do things differently); 2) Explain your intentions or the reasons behind your behavior; and 3) Ask others how you’re doing on improving.)

#### 3\. Your Own Shortcomings

Be honest with yourself about mistakes you’ve made in the past and areas where you could improve. No one likes feeling as if they’ve done something wrong. It’s easier to push the blame onto someone else, and we have an arsenal of excuses and rationalizations that enable us to do that, telling ourselves: They’re biased, they don’t understand us, they’re not treating us fairly. It feels like a form of self-protection, but it’s actually self-destructive.

For example, if your manager gives you a harsh performance review, your knee-jerk reaction might be denial: They’re biased, you might tell yourself, or they’re treating you unfairly. There may be some truth to those rationalizations, but you’ll benefit more from asking yourself: What if my manager is right? What specifically did they notice me doing—or not doing—that could have contributed to the review they gave me? That line of thinking might help you improve your work and your next review.

(Shortform note: _Thanks for the Feedback_ offers advice on reducing your resistance to feedback by controlling your emotional triggers, or negative, knee-jerk reactions. In addition, the author suggests steps for incorporating feedback—for instance, make it less daunting by focusing on just one aspect at a time and trying out a small change. We’ll discuss feedback further in accountability step 2: Admit your role.)

**What Prevents Us From Facing Reality?**

_The Oz Principle_ is far from the only text that points out how our biases affect the way we perceive and process events. We discuss others that touch on the subject (such as _Thinking in Bets _and _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_) elsewhere in this guide. Here are some of the specific ways that this perception-influencing bias can manifest.

**Rationalization** : when you use logical explanations (or explanations that sound logical on the surface) to justify thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, often to avoid an inconvenient or unpleasant truth. For example, you might tell yourself that you’re canceling plans because you’ve been feeling under the weather, when you just want to binge the newest season of your favorite Netflix show.

**Motivated reasoning** : when you're more likely to believe information or arguments that support beliefs you already hold and doubt information that contradicts those existing beliefs. Because you want to be right, you’re skeptical and distrustful of anything that runs counter to the way you think. This tendency can make it difficult to change your mind. A related phenomenon is _confirmation bias_ , which is when you notice and remember information that supports your beliefs and gloss over what doesn’t.

**Representativeness heuristic** : when you think something is more likely to be true because of its similarity to past events or things you already know. This tendency can affect your decisions and can cause you to judge other people based on stereotypes.

**Ego and Blind Spots**

In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio identifies two barriers to facing—and embracing—reality: 1) Ego (your desire to feel and be seen as capable), and 2) Blind spots where your biases keep you from seeing the world as it is. The antidote, he says, is radical open-mindedness, which (echoing _The Oz Principle_) includes accepting accountability for your mistakes.

#### Facing Reality Pays Off

**Facing reality is difficult, in part, because it’s inconvenient.** It can mean realizing you’ve got a lot of hard work to do, whether that means rethinking everything about how you communicate with your loved ones or changing a business model in order to keep up with a swiftly rising competitor. It’s a lot easier to pretend the problem doesn’t exist ... until it’s grown into a disaster.

But confronting inconvenient truths ultimately pays off. **Your reward is in improved relationships, career advancement, a more successful business, and a better life.** You’ll find that those rewards are far greater, in the long run, than the false security that comes with hiding from your problems.

(Shortform note: In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio adds that a primary benefit of embracing reality and relentlessly pursuing the truth is _improving yourself_ —for instance, by learning from your mistakes—which he calls life’s greatest reward because it’s so fulfilling.)

### Step 2: Admit Your Role

Once you’ve faced the facts of your situation, _The Oz Principle’s_ next step toward accountability is to “own”**** your situation by acknowledging that you’re not only a victim of circumstance, but that you _contributed_ to those circumstances. While this is uncomfortable, the authors point out that it comes with a benefit: Once you realize you had a hand in creating the problem, it’s easier to see how you can create the solution; it’s a way of taking back power.

> **Example: Learning From Experience**
> 
> You’ve probably had an experience where you dealt with a problem but didn’t reflect on how your actions, not just external forces, put you in that situation. So, it happened again.
> 
> For example, imagine that a friend proposed taking a trip together and you accepted. But you soon remembered why you and your friend never travel together: He left it to you to take care of everything—where to stay, what to do, how to get around. You spent the trip feeling annoyed and taken advantage of.
> 
> When you vented to your sister afterward, she reminded you of the trip you took with your friend after you both graduated from college. He behaved the same way then, too, leaving all the decisions to you. So the latest problems shouldn’t have come as a surprise.
> 
> **Taking Control of the Narrative**
> 
> Undoubtedly, your friend treated you unfairly in using you as a free tour guide. But being called out by your sister made you realize how you let yourself down, too:
> 
>   * You didn’t learn from the past.
> 
>   * You didn’t take steps to avoid trouble—for instance, working with him to create an itinerary in advance to establish mutual responsibility.
> 
> 

> 
> By reflecting on where you fell short, you took back power. Owning up to the ways you partially created your problem revealed that you have the ability to learn and prevent the same issue in the future.
> 
> Questions you can ask to learn from your experience or to help someone else learn from theirs include:
> 
>   * What am I realizing about myself and my situation?
> 
>   * What does this experience mean to me and about me?
> 
>   * What new awareness have I gained?
> 
>   * What principles can I draw from this experience?
> 
>   * How does my perspective need to shift?
> 
>   * What will I do differently next time and why?
> 
>   * What can I improve?
> 
>   * How must I change to confront this situation in the future?
>

### How to Make Sure You’re Seeing Things Clearly

The authors offer several techniques to help you see patterns of thinking and behavior that are holding you back from acknowledging your role:

#### 1\. Self-Assess

Ask yourself, based on prior experiences:

  * Whether you're open to other people's perspectives
  * If you often blame your problems on other people or outside forces 
  * If you often find yourself thinking that you can’t do anything about your problems
  * Whether you're usually able to admit when you've messed up
  * Whether you’re comfortable acknowledging that sometimes you’re wrong



(Shortform note: On their website, _The Oz Principle_ authors also offer this expanded 10-question self-assessment. Or, you can try this true-false victim mentality quiz from a counseling service.) This kind of reflection will help you gauge how often you have thoughts that make you a victim, and how much work you’ll have to do to create a mindset of accountability.

#### 2\. Be Proactive

If you have doubts or concerns about a situation, pay attention to those feelings; investigate them more deeply. In your professional life, you might make time to double-check your work for errors, research the market so that you’re aware of changes in your industry, and ask colleagues for feedback. (Shortform note: There are three steps to be proactive: Consider what’s likely to happen and plan for it (like setting aside money for vacation), keep up with less-urgent tasks (like preventive maintenance), and prioritize your to-do list and focus on what’s most important.)

#### 3\. Take an External Point of View

Imagine giving a friend advice about the same situation. When you think about it as an outsider, can you see what mistakes you made and what you could do better in the future? (Shortform note: Psychologists refer to this as self-distancing: Besides adopting an outside observer perspective, techniques include using third-person pronouns to describe the situation in writing and asking yourself how you’ll feel about the situation a week, month, or years from now.)

#### 4\. Learn From the Past

People are prone to falling into patterns of behavior. When you find yourself in a difficult situation, reflect on whether you’ve faced something similar before. Chances are, you have—and, as noted above, you can learn from it.

(Shortform note: Besides reviewing a specific experience, you can make learning from experience part of your routine. In _First Things First_ , author Stephen Covey recommends asking yourself a series of questions each week about how things went, such as: What goals did I achieve and fail to achieve, what challenges did I face and how did I overcome them, what prevented me from reaching my goals, and what are the main lessons I can take away from this week?)

#### 5\. Solicit Feedback

Even if you’re good at self-critique, it’s hard to improve without feedback. But people often won’t volunteer it because unsolicited advice is seen as impolite, and it can lead to arguments and hurt feelings. **So ask for the kind of feedback you need, and make the other person feel safe sharing their real feelings.**

  * **Let them know you’re looking for the truth** , even if it might be hard for you to hear. That way, they know you won’t be upset if they give you anything other than glowing praise.
  * **Explain why you need the feedback.** For example, if you’re trying to improve your work, then your critiquer understands that they’re helping you by giving you insight into what you’re doing wrong.
  * **Be specific.** Rather than asking, “What am I doing wrong?” you might say, “I’m trying to improve my communication style. Have you ever felt like I’m hard to talk to or I’m not listening to you?”



(Shortfiorm note: To get the most constructive feedback possible, you may need to ask questions that are uncomfortably direct. In _First Things First_ , Covey recommends asking these three questions of those close to you to get useful feedback at home or at work:

  * What am I doing that you’d like me to _keep_ doing?
  * What should I _stop_ doing?
  * What should I _start_ doing?)



**How you respond to feedback is just as important as how you ask for it.** Don’t argue, get defensive, or be dismissive. Even if you disagree, remember that the point of feedback is to make you see something that you couldn’t have seen yourself. Think it over even if you’re not sure you’re going to internalize and act on it. Also, thank your critiquer for their help.

**How to Incorporate Feedback**

In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen argue that your ability to solicit and incorporate feedback is a major factor in your ability to succeed. They suggest several ways to implement feedback:

1\. Focus on one thing: Instead of asking generally for feedback, ask, “What’s one thing you see me doing that I can improve?” Or, ask the feedback-giver what one thing you could do that would make a difference to her personally.

2\. Look for options that address the feedback giver’s underlying concern. For instance, if your partner says, “I want you to be on time,” her underlying concern may be that your being late suggests you don’t care about her needs. A solution might be to text her if being late is unavoidable and explain why (to show that the reason isn’t that you don’t care).

3\. Test with small experiments: So that change isn’t overwhelming, test the feedback advice in a small way—for instance, if your doctor advises you to change your diet, start by changing one thing, such as eating a piece of fruit with lunch.

4\. Motivate yourself to change by focusing on the benefits or by measuring your progress.

**Set an Example**

Besides helping you grow and succeed, positively receiving and incorporating feedback sets an example for your employees or coworkers. In _The Leadership Challenge_ , James Kouzes and Barry Posner identify five principles of leadership, starting with modeling your values. Part of this is being open to feedback. Similarly, in _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott discusses creating good practices around feedback among your team by first asking for feedback yourself and modeling a positive response.

### What if You’re Just Unlucky?

Although _The Oz Principle_ is largely about dealing with problems, the authors contend that **accountability is meant to be a positive and productive philosophy**. That’s why it applies even to people who are genuine victims of crime, bad luck, or other forces completely out of their control. In those cases, accountability is about taking back power so you can secure your future happiness and success.

For example, if your apartment is broken into, you’re not at fault but you’re accountable for how you respond. Rather than dwelling on how you’ve been wronged, you might focus on taking steps to better protect yourself and your home. For example:

  * You might decide to research safer areas and move.
  * To save money for the move, you could cut back on expenses and work longer hours to earn more.
  * In the short term, you might install new locks and sign up for an app like Nextdoor, where you can connect with your neighbors and learn about increases in local crime.



**Accountability is making every effort to be in control of the course of your life.**

(Shortform note: Ex-Navy SEALs Jocko Willink and Leif Babin advocate that leaders, especially, adopt an _Extreme Ownership_ mindset in all circumstances. This means taking full responsibility for themselves, their role, their decisions, their team, and their team’s actions. They own the team’s mistakes and objectively assess what works and what doesn’t in order to constantly improve. Further, when leaders practice extreme ownership, team members tend to adopt the same accountability, which puts everyone’s focus on the team’s success.)
