## Exercise: Build a Better Life, One Step at a Time

Before you can learn to hold yourself accountable, take a moment to identify areas of your life that could use improvement. Chances are, there are problems you’ve yet to acknowledge or opportunities to be more proactive than you’ve been in the past.

* * *

What is your least favorite part of your job, and why?

What are three actions you could take to improve that part of your job, or at least lessen the amount of time you have to spend on it?

Pick one of those actions. Below, make a plan: Write down all the steps involved, how long you think it will take, and when you can start working on it. By visualizing it and putting it into words, you put yourself on a path to success; you begin to make a commitment and take accountability for improving your life.
