## Chapters 6-7: Come Up With a Solution and Follow Through

After facing facts and admitting your role in the problem, _The Oz Principle’s_ next two accountability steps are:

  * Step 3: Taking charge of the problem (coming up with effective solutions)
  * Step 4: Taking action to solve the problem (following through on the solutions)



### Step 3: Take Responsibility for Solving the Problem

Even when you recognize a problem, you may be inclined to step aside and let someone else take care of it. But you should want to _be_ the problem-solver, according to the authors of _The Oz Principle_ , because being a problem-solver comes with benefits that make it worth the effort:

  * Solving a problem means averting catastrophes and implementing better ways of doing things. It leaves you better off in the long run.
  * Problem-solvers are _needed_. People rely on them, think well of them, and entrust them with more responsibility.
  * By becoming a problem-solver, you work your creative muscles and engage in active learning. You don’t just improve an immediate situation; you make yourself better, too. 



(Shortform note: Being a problem-solver also may be important to your career; it’s a key soft skill in the knowledge economy, where employers need people who can identify problems, analyze data, create solutions, and then take responsibility for acting.)

#### How to Solve Problems

The authors give this advice for solving problems:

**1\. Get at the root of the issue.** Don't waste time and resources focusing on superficial aspects. (Shortform note: The tendency to focus on the least important aspects of an important task or problem is known as “bikeshedding” or “Parkinson’s Law of Triviality.” The term bikeshedding comes from an instance where a group tasked to come up with a plan for a nuclear power plant spent inordinate time designing a bike shed. To avoid this, ask yourself whether what you’re focusing on will matter in a few months or years and whether it’s easy to change. If the answers are yes, then you’re probably bikeshedding.)

**2\. Mean it.** Don't take shortcuts or try to appease anyone. Implement long-lasting solutions and honestly believe in them.

**3\. Don’t be complacent.** Always look for things you can do better. This sentiment applies not only to resolving specific problems, but also to how you can approach work and life in general. Hone your existing skills and keep gaining new ones. Be aware of what other people are doing. By being more knowledgeable and well-rounded, you’re more likely to spot problems early and to be able to come up with solutions.

And if you get stuck, there are ways you can troubleshoot:

**4\. Try looking at the problem from a new angle.** Sometimes you need a different perspective. (Shortform note: Tips for examining a problem from different perspectives include: rephrase and reframe it, challenge assumptions, expand and narrow the view, view it through the eyes of each stakeholder, pose questions rather than making statements, and use the SCAMPER tool: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Rearrange or Reverse.)

**5\. Ask for help.** This might mean leaning on an existing relationship or reaching out to someone new, whether it's a colleague or another company that may be a potential ally.

**6\. Stay alert.** A solution might lie in a small detail that you’ve taken for granted or overlooked. Pay attention to all parts of the situation; nothing is unimportant.

Remember that if you ignore a problem, it’s likely to get worse. Like an unusual noise coming from your car’s engine or an unexplained pain in your knee, **what begins as a minor irritation might grow into a serious issue if you neglect it.**

> **Concrete Advice for Better Problem-Solving**
> 
> While the authors’ general advice provides a good place to start, solving tough problems may require more concrete strategies. Here are actionable tips on how to approach problem-solving:
> 
> **Schedule time** : In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , authors Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves recommend dedicating regular time to problem-solving as a tactic of self-management, because it’s difficult in a busy life to find time to think through decisions before making them. Schedule 15 minutes a day to walk away from your work and problem-solve particular issues. This will help you to make clearer choices and ensure that your feelings aren’t skewing your decision-making process.
> 
> **Accept struggle** : In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young recommends letting yourself struggle with problems. While he’s referring to the process of learning, his advice applies to problem-solving more generally as well: Force yourself to struggle when you encounter a difficult problem or obstacle when trying to learn something. Most problems can be solved with enough thought and effort, and deliberate struggle creates deeper understanding of the problem and builds resilience, leading to more efficient problem-solving later. Encourage this by setting a timer for 10-15 minutes and pushing yourself to work on the problem at least until the timer goes off.
> 
> **Ask this question** : FInally, in _12 Rules for Life_ , psychologist Jordan Peterson advises: Before blaming anyone else for a problem, you should be able to answer yes to the question, “Have I done everything within my ability to solve the problem?”

> **Analytical Versus Insightful Problem-Solving**
> 
> Most of us take an analytical approach to solving problems—of reasoning through them step by step. However, we can also solve problems with insight, which occurs when our mind moves from being at a loss to suddenly knowing exactly what to do, as in a “Eureka!” moment. According to researchers, insight happens when we _subconsciously_ reformulate the problem, seeing it in a different context.
> 
> Both approaches are innate, and we can use them in combination or one after the other. Further, insight is closely linked with creativity, and researchers say we can learn techniques to promote both creative thinking and insightful problem-solving, such as:
> 
>   * Soliciting different perspectives to help us see problems in a new way.
> 
>   * Approaching challenges with passion, which fosters creativity.
> 
>   * Taking a break from thinking about the problem to let ideas percolate.
> 
>   * Trying out many ideas, even outlandish ones because the best solution may come from an unexpected direction.
> 
>   * Persisting despite wrong turns and roadblocks. Success stems from learning from experience.
>

#### Prepare for Stormy Weather

The authors point out that when you’re trying to solve a problem, you’ll inevitably run into roadblocks. You might be discouraged and revert to a victim mentality. Instead, mentally brace yourself for things to get tough. **Try to predict setbacks or obstacles and prepare for them.**

(Shortform note: Following is a planning strategy for businesses to anticipate and prepare for problems; the same type of thinking can work for individuals too. Regularly brainstorm with your team to identify events or conditions that could upend your business. Identify early indicators of each event or condition, and determine what actions you would need to take in response, such as workarounds. Engage your up-and-coming leaders in “scenario thinking,” or imagining a range of problem scenarios and responses. Compile the scenarios and responses in a manual.)

> **Overcome Obstacles by Asking Strategic Questions**
> 
> When confronting inevitable challenges or setbacks, self-help author Tony Robbins recommends asking yourself problem-solving questions:
> 
>   * **What’s good about this problem?** This shifts your mindset from being upset about the problem to what you can learn from it.
> 
>   * **What needs improvement?** This question looks for ways to solve the problem, presupposing the situation will improve.
> 
>   * **What am I willing to do to improve the situation?** This question generates specific actions toward resolution.
> 
>   * **What am I willing to stop doing to improve the situation?** This question identifies disempowering habits getting in the way of resolution.
> 
>   * **How can I enjoy the resolution process?** After determining the problem and how to tackle it, this question encourages you to find pleasure in resolving it (which will motivate you to follow through).

### Step 4: Take Action

The final step of _The Oz Principle_ journey, taking action, is about staying committed and following through—not just when it comes to solving one problem, but when it comes to making accountability part of your day-to-day life.

The authors caution that people sometimes master the first three steps toward accountability—facing problems, acknowledging their responsibility, and figuring out solutions—then fail to implement these solutions.__

**However, a lack of follow-through on one issue can create a domino effect:**

  * The problem you’re neglecting to solve could be feeding into other, related issues, and you might not catch those related issues until you’ve addressed the initial problem.
  * You’ll miss the chance to implement better strategies and processes, which leaves you less prepared to deal with future problems.
  * Getting a team excited about potential solutions and guiding them into a mindset of accountability and ownership, only for all that talk to go nowhere, is disappointing. It’s like a broken promise. You might find it hard to inspire that enthusiasm again. (Shortform note: Conversely, following through in the workplace has multiple benefits: employee engagement increases, you create a culture of honoring commitments as employees emulate your behavior, the performance management process becomes more meaningful as employees understand they must follow through.)



> **A Sign of Integrity**
> 
> In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield argues that commitment and follow-through (action) are integral to success and also demonstrate your integrity, in addition to warding off a victim mentality. He gives two steps for following through on commitments:
> 
> **1) Only commit to things you can deliver on.** By being selective about your commitments, you ensure you don’t take on too many things or things outside of your capabilities. To do this, give yourself time to decide whether you’re going to do something, and be honest with yourself about whether you can deliver in the time frame specified.
> 
> **2) Record your commitments**. Use paper or digital calendars, reminders, or other tools to keep track of your timeline.

The authors offer the following advice for how to stay committed:

  * **Focus on future goals,** not just the immediate situation. For example, if you’re falling behind on your sales goal for the month, it’s not enough to work around the clock for the final week to get your numbers up. Also determine how to keep it from happening again in the future.
  * **Keep track of the results** you're generating. The results should be concrete, whether in the form of numbers or feedback from other people, so you can measure and learn from them.
  * **Don’t put things off.** Address problems right away. Procrastinating could weaken your commitment to following through and make the problem worse.
  * **Don’t get complacent** : Don’t let a few successes or good luck lull you into a false sense of security.
  * **Don’t stagnate.** To avoid stagnating and falling behind, stay engaged and invested in the work you’re doing, and always be open to innovation.
  * **Get comfortable with risk.** Taking action requires accepting that you might fail. You can’t accomplish anything without making the effort. Further, failure is an important part of learning.



**Example: Focus on Results**

Revisiting the travel buddy example, here’s how focusing on results can help you follow through on your solutions.

Step 1: You identified the problem—he takes advantage of your organizational skills.

Step 2: You recognized your part in the problem—you’ve ignored red flags and haven’t set boundaries.

Step 3: You’ve come up with solutions—you can avoid traveling with him, try to talk it out with him, or guide him into being a better friend by making tactful suggestions.

What might stop you from completing step 4: putting your plans into action?

Maybe you broach the subject, but he gets defensive or changes the topic. You drop it for now, intending to try again another time…and then you never do. **You encountered an obstacle and didn’t have the commitment to push through.**

Or maybe you resolve not to take any more trips with him, but then you have a few fun nights out and remember why you’re still friends. He suggests another trip, and you impulsively agree. **A few positive experiences gave you false confidence, and you slipped back into your old ways.**

This is where a focus on _results_ can keep you from getting off track. The result you’re looking for is a change in his behavior. Until you’ve seen that, the problem still exists.

> **Use Psychology to Stay on Track**
> 
> Even when you follow the authors’ advice, you may find it hard to stay committed. When desire and willpower aren’t enough, a _Psychology Today_ article recommends:
> 
>   * Visualize the benefits of following through and the downsides of not following through.
> 
>   * Remind yourself that you’re doing the _right_ thing.
> 
>   * Accept that not everything is fun.
> 
>   * Tell others about your commitment, so you’ll be less likely to renege.
> 
>   * Imagine feeling guilty and embarrassed about not following through.
> 
>   * Keep track of milestones.
