## Shortform Introduction

Many people fail to own their actions and results, especially at work, where it’s easy to shift blame and succumb to a victim mentality. But in _The Oz Principle,_ authors Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman use the story of _The Wizard of Oz_ to show how **being accountable for your successes and challenges is the key to improving results on both an individual and organizational level.**

### About the Authors

Roger Connors and Tom Smith are the founders of the consulting firm Partners in Leadership. They've worked with numerous companies to improve cultures and practices around accountability, and _The Oz Principle_ contains many anecdotes about how their clients overcame workplace issues. They co-authored two other _New York Times_ bestselling management books: _How Did That Happen?_ and _Change the Culture, Change the Game_.

The third author, Craig Hickman, is a prolific writer as well; his works include _Creating Excellence, Results Revolution, _and other nonfiction titles, but he also delved into thrillers with _The Insiders _and its sequel. He's a regional vice president at Partners in Leadership and was previously the CEO of Headwaters Technology Innovation Group.

### The Book’s Publication

_The Oz Principle_ was first published in 1994 by Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Random House. According to PRH, it has sold almost 600,000 copies; a revised version was released in 2004, 10 years after its initial publication. The updated version includes a preface and an acknowledgements page thanking the readers who helped _The Oz Principle_ succeed.

### The Book’s Context

#### The Book’s Impact

According to Partners in Leadership, _The Oz Principle_ was a _New York Times_ , _Wall Street Journal_ , and _Publisher's Weekly_ bestseller, and the president and publisher at Portfolio described it in 2009 as among their top five bestselling books in the Leadership and Performance categories, year after year, since 1994. Companies conduct workshops based on the book’s ideas, and universities teach it in business courses.

#### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

Critical reviews state that the book is repetitive, and that its message is too simple. Some people feel the book could have been much shorter, that it’s boring, that there are too many examples, and that its advice isn't specific enough. Lastly, some reviews characterize _The Oz Principle_ as, essentially, corporate propaganda designed to convince employees to take the blame for any unhappiness they feel at work rather than criticizing the failings of their supervisors and their company’s culture. However, other readers find the book's ideas empowering, logical, and easy to understand. They like that the principles were relevant to all parts of their lives, not just work.

Both the critical and positive reviews raise valid points; the book _is_ repetitive, but many people find its ideas clear and relevant to their lives.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_The Oz Principle_ is split into three parts—the first introduces the problem (having a victim mentality), the second offers guidelines for addressing it, and the third provides suggestions for applying those solutions on an organizational scale. Anecdotes about the trials and triumphs of various companies, some of which the authors worked with and others they didn’t, make up the bulk of the book’s content.

The inclusion of client anecdotes, with frequent emphasis on how _The Oz Principle_ ’s ideas enabled them to overcome their problems, at times make the book sound like an advertisement for itself. However, the anecdotes illustrate the book’s sometimes abstract ideas.

### Our Approach in This Guide

This guide breaks down the authors' ideas on individual and organizational accountability and explains how they compare with other literature on subjects related to psychology and business development.

We’ve omitted the anecdotes used by the authors and focused on drawing out the central points of each chapter; from there, we’ve fleshed out those points by linking them to other sources, including books, articles, and academic research.

_The Oz Principle_ ’s points are sometimes abstract; for example, the book discusses the importance of being a problem-solver, but its suggestions about _how_ to become a problem-solver are vague. To that section, we’ve added techniques to help bolster your problem-solving skills. _The Oz Principle_ ’s discussion of topics such as “victimhood” and “accountability” is narrow, as the text focuses almost exclusively on how these concepts relate to business and being an employee. We’ve added context to help you reflect on how you can apply _The Oz Principle_ ’s points to other parts of your life, and to provide you with a more complete understanding of the complexity of these topics.

For logic, we’ve grouped related chapters together. We’ve also moved a section on _joint accountability_ from part 1 to part 3, which focuses on creating a culture of accountability within an organization, as this seemed a more natural place for it.
