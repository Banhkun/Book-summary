## Exercise: Practice Owning Your Problems

To hold yourself accountable, you have to become comfortable examining the part you play (through action or inaction) in getting into or remaining in negative situations.

* * *

Think about someone you don’t get along with. This could be a person who’s in your life right now (a co-worker, a relative, a roommate) or someone you used to know but no longer have a relationship with. Why don’t you get along with them?

Now try to put yourself in their shoes. How would they have answered the previous question? What might they think about you? In other words, what did you do (or not do) that possibly made the relationship worse or just didn’t make it any better?

Assuming that you can’t change their behavior or personality, what are three things that you, alone, could do to improve your relationship with this person or at least lessen the negative impact they have on your life?
