## Exercise: What Would You Do With a Superintelligent AI?

Imagine that tomorrow morning scientists announce they have created the first sentient, superintelligent AI. The developers assert that the AI has a strong code of ethics, so it won’t do anything harmful or help anyone else do anything that would harm others. You’ve been invited on the first public tour of the facility that houses the superintelligent AI.

* * *

The tour guide invites each member of the tour to take a turn at the AI’s input prompt. You can ask it a question or request any kind of digital output (text file, graphics, computer code, etc.) What’s the first thing you would ask it?

The tour guide also explains that, while the data they’ve collected to date seems to imply that their AI has superhuman general intelligence, they’re still working to assess the full range of its capabilities. She invites you to propose a question or other test that could help them assess whether or not the AI is actually sentient and how intelligent it is. What would you suggest?

The tour guide assures you that they are also thoroughly vetting the safety of their AI before the project advances to the next phase. She invites you to propose a question or other test that could help them assess the AI’s regard for human life or predict how it would behave if given access to the outside world. What would you recommend?
