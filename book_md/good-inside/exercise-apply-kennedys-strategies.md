## Exercise: Apply Kennedy’s Strategies

Kennedy’s strategies can help you navigate your child’s challenging behaviors and make positive changes in the long-term.

* * *

What’s one of your child’s challenging behaviors you’d like to work on? How do you usually deal with it? For example, maybe your child is often whiny and the way you’ve been dealing with it is by taking screen time away whenever they whine.

Investigate the challenging behavior. What situations, emotions, or experiences usually trigger it? Is there a specific part of your child that seems to get rattled before this behavior shows up? For example, maybe your child is very extroverted and starts whining when you’re working and not giving them your undivided attention.

Investigate the challenging behavior’s impact on you. What emotions come up in you when it happens? How did your parents deal with that behavior when you were little?

Which one of Kennedy’s strategies could you use to deal with the challenging behavior? Remember that you should expect long-term, sustainable changes, not quick and easy fixes. So, consider what self-regulation strategies you might need to implement alongside Kennedy’s strategies.
