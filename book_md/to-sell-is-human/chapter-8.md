## Chapter 8: When in Doubt, Improvise

Once you’ve harnessed your pitching skills, Pink recommends learning improvisation to boost your creativity and adaptability. While improvisation is generally associated with theater, Pink contends it’s useful in sales too, because it can help you work through changing or unfavorable sales conditions. He points out that sales and theater are similar in several ways:

Similarity #1: Acting and sales both require courage and risk-taking. Salespeople make cold calls and actors make themselves vulnerable to an audience.

Similarity #2: Actors and salespeople experience more rejection than success. Salespeople are regularly told no in aggressive ways; actors receive nos after unsuccessful auditions.

Similarity #3: Both careers have experienced a similar evolution. Both sales and theater have historically valued scripts, which worked well in a predictable environment. The world is now less predictable and more complicated, and it continues changing unpredictably. This makes improvisation more valuable than a script.

> **Three Things Salespeople Can Learn From Actors**
> 
>   * **Tell the truth** : Despite the fact that they’re playing “make believe,” actors look for the most truthful way to portray a character. Similarly, sellers should be as authentic as possible when connecting with buyers. Authenticity builds trust and earns buyer respect.
> 
>   * **Pay attention** : The most important part of an actor’s job is listening. They listen with rapt attention to their scene partner, which allows them to respond with empathy and authenticity. Like a character in a scene, buyers have their own stories to tell, and sellers are most effective at meeting their needs when they care about the details of those stories.
> 
>   * **You can’t play every role** : Most actors aren’t versatile enough to play every type of role--they tend to find a niche. In a similar vein, not every product or service will fit every potential buyer. It’s important that sellers recognize and accept that they will not make every sale. When sellers can do this, they are able to focus on and find more success in the niches they best serve.

### The Rules of Improvisation

Pink argues that an ability to improvise can help you to adapt to changing or unfavorable sales conditions. But to improvise successfully, he recommends following three rules.

#### Rule #1: Listen

The best kind of listening you can do in any interaction (whether it be theatrical, personal, or professional) is active listening. _Active listening_ is listening to receive what is shared with you and allowing it to move you to engage. It’s transformative, allowing you to pick up on opportunities or avenues of conversation that you didn’t know existed, and inspiring action. In an improv scene, active listening allows actors to respond organically and creatively. To listen actively, slow down and be present. Don’t listen to respond, listen to hear.

In contrast, most of what we do when we’re in conversation is _passive listening_ , which is more about waiting for our turn to speak, rather than focusing on what is being said to us. Passive listening is transactional. It requires little to no intimacy, engagement, or action.

> **How to Improve Active Listening**
> 
> Keep the following tips in mind when you’re listening to others.
> 
>   * Reduce distractions.
> 
>   * Turn your body in the direction of the person you’re listening to.
> 
>   * Try paraphrasing what others are sharing with you to check whether you’re hearing them correctly.
> 
>   * Demonstrate engagement by nodding, asking questions, or making encouraging comments.
> 
>   * Practice empathy by asking yourself questions like, “How would I feel if I were this person in this situation?”
> 
> 

> 
> The more you practice, the better your communication skills will be, and the more likely you are to connect successfully with others.

#### Rule #2: Say Yes

Say “Yes, and” rather than no or “yes, but.” In an improvisation scene, the story playing out onstage can only continue if each participant is accepting of new twists and turns. If a participant rejects or resists changes in circumstances, the story becomes limited and stagnant. Similarly, Pink cautions that if you say no to something in a sales transaction, or add a qualifier (like “yes, but”), it limits the paths available to you and shuts the conversation down. Saying “Yes, and” expands existing possibilities and opens new ones.

For example, let’s say you’re in the middle of a potential sale, and the client asks you, “Is this refundable?” If you say no, or, “Yes, but you only have 48 hours to request it,” this stagnates the conversation. A better response would be, “Yes, and you have a full 48 hours to see how you feel.” This creates expansive, positive energy.

> **The Power of the Word Yes**
> 
> Research shows that positive words and phrases increase your well-being and sense of satisfaction. Whether the words are said aloud or in your head, they activate the centers of the brain that control motivation as well as support the long-term development of resilience.

#### Rule #3: Practice Principled Negotiation

Never have a “win/lose” perspective; always seek a “win/win” outcome. Make your partner (in theater or a sales transaction) look good. Create or paint the possibility of a result that will benefit all involved. In an improvisation scene, this means making choices that allow all the actors to perform their best, rather than focusing on one actor’s performance.

In a sales context, if you’re a used car salesman, and you can manipulate a client into purchasing a poor quality vehicle so you will make a large commission, you might call this a “win” by traditional sales standards. In principled negotiation, however, you’re willing to put extra energy into finding your client a car that fits her needs, even if it means taking a smaller commission. This allows both of you to win, but with integrity.

> **Three Tips for Principled Negotiation**
> 
> When it feels difficult to pursue a win/win outcome, keep the following tips in mind.
> 
>   * **“You versus the problem,” not “you versus each other.”** Refrain from seeing one another as opponents. Keep communication clear, respectful, and focused on listening.
> 
>   * **Be aware of everyone’s priorities and contexts.** Keep in mind that people come from different backgrounds, statuses, and value systems and respect these differences equally.
> 
>   * **Create solutions that benefit all involved.** Stay open-minded and actively negotiate based on the key needs of those involved in a transaction.
> 
> 

> 
> **Elements of Principled Negotiation**
> 
> _Getting to Yes_ lists four elements of principled negotiation:
> 
>   * Separate personalities and emotions from the issue.
> 
>   * Focus on the interests of each side, not on positions.
> 
>   * Come up with multiple options based on mutual interests.
> 
>   * Base the agreement on objective (fair and independent) standards.
> 
> 


> **The Value of Having a Sense of Humor**
> 
> Humor can also be an effective improvisational technique, boosting your ability to connect, increasing positive energy, and relaxing those you’re selling to. Here are four ways to incorporate humor into your sales game:
> 
>   * **Use simple jokes as icebreakers.** If you can get someone to crack a smile, they’ll likely feel more comfortable with you. Research indicates that humor makes people more likable, and the more likable you are, the more likely you are to persuade a buyer to buy.
> 
>   * **Set strategic limits.** Humor, while valuable for connection, interrupts critical thinking, which makes it harder to persuade buyers to make a purchase. Keep your humor in check by using it before and after key moments during the sales transaction.
> 
>   * **Use humor to make your pitches and presentations more memorable.** When you’re able to make people laugh, you seem more confident, connected, and trustworthy. For example, if you’re selling a service to a company, and you make lighthearted jokes about the company’s competitors, you remove tension and build rapport.
> 
>   * **Incorporate humor into your marketing strategies.** Humor makes your message shareable, which expands your digital network. For example, the official Twitter account for Wendy’s playfully “roasts” other fast food places with humorous “clapbacks,” often going viral and attracting new customers in the process.

### Tips to Practice Improvisation

#### Tip #1: Wait a Second

To make sure that you truly listen, Pink recommends pausing and counting to five before responding in a conversation.

> **The Value of the Pause**
> 
> In a sales conversation, pausing has three key benefits.
> 
>   * You reduce the likelihood of interrupting your buyer, improving rapport and building trust.
> 
>   * You show your buyer that you care about and want to consider what they’re saying, making them feel valued and that their needs are important.
> 
>   * You give yourself the opportunity to truly understand what your buyer is communicating, boosting your ability to connect with and help them.
> 
> 


#### Tip #2: Play Improv Games

There are many games you can play to practice improvisation principles, including the following.

##### Game #1: “Yes, And”

This game helps you to practice rule #2 of improvisation. It helps you to expand existing possibilities and create new ones.

Sit in a circle with five or more people to come up with a product or service idea and advertise it together. The first person starts with a pitch, slogan, or explanation, and the next person says, “Yes, and,” and builds upon that previous participant’s information.

##### Game #2: “I’m Curious”

This question exercise enhances clarity, adaptability, and connection.

Partner with someone and choose a contentious topic (for instance, Republicans versus Democrats). Have one partner select an opinion on the topic, and the other takes the opposing opinion. Next, one participant presents their opinion, and the other responds with questions only.

Rules for the questions are:

  * No yes or no questions
  * No questions disguised as statements or opinions
  * All questions must be answered



**Pink contends that improvisation enhances the modern sales approach by creatively inspiring others to connect, collaborate, and identify or expand possibilities.**

> **The Importance of Play**
> 
> Play is valuable for people at any age, and in a sales context, it has numerous benefits.
> 
>   * **Stress relief.** Play releases endorphins, helping you stay positive and relaxed in transactions.
> 
>   * **Enhanced brain function.** Play improves memory and quick thinking.
> 
>   * **Enhanced creativity.** Play engages and expands your imagination, improving your ability to be flexible and find solutions to problems.
> 
>   * **Deeper intimacy and connection with others.** Openness to play and fun improves your ability to connect with others on a deeper level.
> 
>   * **Boosted energy.** Play supports healthy immune function and keeps you feeling energized.
