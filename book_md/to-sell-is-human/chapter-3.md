## Chapter 3: From Profit-Focused Sales to Service-Focused Sales

Pink explains that sales was traditionally built on a transactional, self-serving value system. Salespeople were a necessary information authority, and people were dependent on them for acquiring services or goods. Sales also played a crucial role in an economy dependent on production and consumption. When the 2008 global recession killed many jobs and access to information via the internet expanded, it seemed as if there might no longer be a need for salespeople. Despite that, sales jobs have remained steady or grown.

**What _has_ changed, according to Pink, is the focus of sales.** Specifically, there has been a shift from profit-focused sales, known as _caveat emptor_(buyer beware), to service-focused sales, known as _caveat venditor_(seller beware). Following is a comparison of the two models..

#### Value System #1: Buyer Beware

Under the traditional buyer beware model, a seller with all the information has the upper hand and can take advantage of an uninformed buyer who lets down her guard. So the buyer beware model generally profits the seller, sometimes at the buyer’s expense.

For example, let’s say you’re a used car salesman. Only you know the quality of the vehicle for sale, so while you’re fully informed, your buyer is less informed by default. Not being equally informed creates problems in the seller/buyer dynamic, whether there is ill will or not. At best, the imbalance can cause your buyer to feel suspicious of your motives and consequently less willing to move forward with a transaction. At worst, you can intentionally take advantage of the information gap by failing to tell the buyer about flaws in the product or service, hidden costs, or anything else that might create a negative experience for the buyer.

Pink notes that, thanks to the buyer beware model, the stereotype of a pushy, manipulative car salesman is exactly the image many people have of sales representatives. (Shortform note: This image has contributed to a decline in the number of people interested in sales careers. However, the image is changing and other experts foresee a brighter future for sales.)

> **The Importance of Trust**
> 
> Not only does the system of buyer beware allow sellers to be unethical, but it is also both inefficient and ineffective because a foundational component of any secure relationship (sales or otherwise) is trust. In a personal context, you’re more likely to build intimacy with someone you believe you can trust, and in a sales context, you are more likely to engage in a transaction with a person you trust. In a recent study, 71% of participants said they would prioritize buying from a seller they trusted, even if other sellers offered them the cheapest deal in comparison.

#### Value System #2: Seller Beware

Pink contends that the less effective buyer beware model is giving way to seller beware. With buyers having access to information, there is an increased pressure for sellers to have integrity. Additionally, social media acts as a “checks and balances” system. Consequences for unethical sales tactics are swift and far-reaching (you can go viral and lose your job in the same day).

(Shortform note: not only are these old pressure tactics unethical or unappealing to buyers, but some of them can get you into legal trouble—for example, thanks to the CAN-SPAM Act, emailing people repeatedly without their consent is against the law.)

Sellers in the new economy benefit most from seeing themselves as servicepeople, identifying problems and providing solutions for buyers to choose from.

> **Qualities of a “Service Mentality” in Sales**
> 
> What does it truly mean to act in service of the buyer? Customer service expert Nancy Friedman suggests that beyond simply serving a customer’s best interests, seven qualities characterize a Service Mentality:
> 
>   * **Empathy:** Defined as the ability to connect with the experience of others, empathy shows the customer that you genuinely care about meeting their needs.
> 
>   * **Enthusiasm:** When you bring positive energy to a transaction and demonstrate a genuine interest in serving the needs of your buyer, you automatically become more effective because you are perceived as both capable of and interested in meeting needs.
> 
>   * **Ownership:** Having an obvious willingness to step up and take ownership of creating the best possible solution lets buyers know that they can count on you throughout the transaction.
> 
>   * **Responsibility:** Responsibility is about reliability and keeping your word. Being dependable shows buyers that you have integrity and can be trusted.
> 
>   * **Adaptability:** Being flexible allows you to meet the needs of buyers with all types of personalities and address a variety of circumstances.
> 
>   * **Balance:** Having awareness of and respect for your own resources, needs, and limits, as well as those of your buyers, allows you to create a mutually beneficial transaction for all involved.
> 
>   * **Resilience:** Being resilient allows you to remain grounded and focus on the buyer’s needs in tense or unexpected situations.
>

> **Are You an Ethical Persuader?**
> 
> To ensure you’re approaching sales with a service mindset, apply the TARES test. Ethicists Sherry Baker and David L. Martinson created the five-point test to assess whether an effort to persuade is ethical. To be ethical, persuasion requires:
> 
>   * Truthfulness
> 
>   * Authenticity (of the persuader)
> 
>   * Respect
> 
>   * Equity (both parties benefit)
> 
>   * Social Responsibility (there’s a common good)
> 
> 

> 
> Both the end and means are important. Applied to sales, ethical persuasion serves a moral _end_ (meeting the buyer’s needs) through ethical _means_(the TARES standards). For example, a doctor’s end goal should be matching a patient or “buyer” with the best possible treatment, and the means of achieving that goal is offering them an honest description of their options coupled with an educated opinion on the choice that would best serve them.
> 
> In contrast, unethical persuasion is pursuing a sale for personal gain at others’ expense. The end goal is to benefit the seller, and the means of achieving this goal is deceit (for example, a car salesman knowingly sells a faulty vehicle to a buyer by lying about its quality).
