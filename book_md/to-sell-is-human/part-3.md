## Part 3: New Sales Strategies | Chapter 7: Throw Your Best Pitch

In these final three chapters, Pink discusses three abilities to help you make the most of his new sales model. In this chapter, you’ll learn about the “pitch” and how it has evolved for modern selling. Pitching is the ability to make a quick, persuasive appeal for an idea or product.

### Origin of the Elevator Pitch

The _elevator pitch_ is an old-school method for introducing your ideas to others in a way that is both memorable and intriguing. When you give an elevator pitch, you communicate a complex statement in a quick, simple way.

#### Why the Elevator Pitch Has Lost Relevance

Pink argues that the pitch is outdated for two reasons:

  * Reason #1: It was designed for getting the attention of someone influential on the fly, such as in an elevator or a company break room, but because offices are less formal today, it’s easier to mix with or get appointments with higher-ups than it used to be. 
  * Reason #2: With access to unlimited information, people are overwhelmed and distracted (especially people in positions of power). In Pink’s view, meeting someone at random and pitching them adds to their distraction rather than inspiring them to act.



> **Has the Digital Age Ended the Sales Pitch Entirely?**
> 
> The digital age hasn’t necessarily ended the sales pitch, but calling it a pitch may no longer make sense—especially as selling shifts to a service mentality. The idea of a sales “pitch” implies that the interaction is one-way. A more appropriate term might be “negotiation.” There is still a pitch involved, but now it generally comes after a period of collaboration, in which the seller and buyer connect on a meaningful level, discuss the buyer’s needs, and establish a sense of trust.

### The Solution: Four Pitches for Success

Pink contends we need to clarify our pitches for the age of over-information. We also need to gear them toward serving the buyer. Pink identifies four types of pitches to replace the elevator pitch.

#### Pitch #1: The One-Word Pitch

Ruthlessly distill your ideas to a single word. Doing this creates clarity and develops discipline. It also gets right to the heart of an idea, inspiring movement.

For example, during Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, his one-word pitch was “change.”

> **The Most Persuasive Words in the English Language**
> 
> Presentation skills expert Guila Muir has identified 12 of the most persuasive words in the English language. Consider the following five of those 12 words for your next one-word pitch.
> 
>   * **Results.** This word is powerful because it zeroes in on what the outcome will be for your “buyer” (or whomever you are seeking to persuade).
> 
>   * **Discovery.** This word may cause feelings of excitement in those you pitch it to.
> 
>   * **Free.** This word has many connotations that create a feeling of optimism and expansion, like “no cost to you” and “limitless.”
> 
>   * **Easy.** It is difficult to resist the implications of the word easy, as many are seeking simple solutions to their problems.
> 
>   * **Guarantee.** This word creates a feeling of security, making buyers feel more comfortable taking risks.
> 
> 


#### Pitch #2: The Question Pitch

Take your idea, and craft a question that makes a statement. For example, instead of making the statement, “You will benefit from therapy,” you can ask the question, “How do you want to feel about yourself a year from now?” Research in the 1980s found that questions are more effective than statements when it comes to influencing someone. Statements are passive and prevent collaboration, while questions invite connection, contemplation, and collaboration, which all create movement.

> **Four Types of Questions Every Salesperson Should Utilize**
> 
> Questions are arguably the most valuable tool available to you in a transaction. Cover all your bases by asking the following four types of questions.
> 
>   * **Thoughtful questions.** The questions are designed to expand the perspective of the buyer. They boost clarity and build trust. For example, if you’re selling solar panels, you might ask something like “what do you think are the benefits and drawbacks of solar power?”
> 
>   * **Clarifying questions.** These are often closed questions and serve as check-ins for you to make sure you’re understanding your buyer’s needs correctly. For example, if you have a buyer who wants to buy a family cell phone plan, you might ask them to confirm how many people they want on the plan.
> 
>   * **Assessment questions.** These are questions focused on identifying the goals and/or priorities of buyers. For example, if you’re pitching a tutoring service, you might ask your potential buyer what their learning goals are.
> 
>   * **Informational questions.** These are questions designed to gather practical information that serves as insight into the buyer’s needs. For example, if you’re selling a marketing service, you might ask your buyer questions like, “What is your target audience” and “How much traffic do you want to drive to your site?”
>

#### Pitch #3: The Subject-Line Pitch

If you’re sending a pitch through email, put the core pitch in the subject line. It’s the first thing people scan for when they check their inbox. An intriguing subject line makes someone more likely to invest in opening and reading the email.

Example: “3 Reasons You Should Invest in Cryptocurrency”

> **Four Rules for Crafting a Subject-Line Pitch**
> 
> With email a prominent form of communication in the business world, a good subject-line pitch is critical. According to research, the subject of an email has a 35% influence on whether or not an email is opened. Consider the following rules as you craft your subject-line pitches.
> 
>   * Use active language (rather than passive).
> 
>   * Make it short and sweet.
> 
>   * Refrain from using descriptive language.
> 
>   * Keep it specific.
> 
> 


#### Pitch #4: The Twitter Pitch

Use Twitter and the character count limit on posts to make a pitch for your idea. Successful tweet pitches are engaging and inspire action. A 2011 study on tweets showed that tweets with the lowest engagement are complaining, self-interested, or lack substance. Tweets with the highest engagement ask good questions, are informative, and are self-promotional (a sales pitch tweet that provides useful information or service).

> **Why Twitter Is a Lucrative Modern Sales Environment**
> 
> Twitter is becoming an increasingly popular marketing tool as social media plays a more and more significant role in our daily lives. This provides sellers with a unique environment for consumer engagement. There are three compelling reasons to market your services or products via Twitter.
> 
>   * The platform allows for casual and organic communication.
> 
>   * There’s an equal power dynamic between buyers and sellers.
> 
>   * Twitter is home to a diversity of people.
> 
> 


> **Elements of an Effective Pitch**
> 
>   * **Identify your target audience.** Do this by considering who will benefit most from what you’re offering.
> 
>   * **Identify the environment of your target audience.** If you understand the lifestyle of those you’re intending to serve or inspire, you’ll have a better sense of where to promote your ideas.
> 
>   * **Identify the needs of your target audience.** Make what you’re offering as relevant to them and their needs as possible.
> 
>   * **Get your message across as quickly as possible.** The modern attention span is short, so try to get your message across in roughly three seconds.
> 
>   * **Give them a “call to action.”** Make it easy for them to move forward with you by telling them exactly how to do so and making that process simple.
> 
> 

> 
> In addition, in _Pitch Anything_ , Oren Klaff recommends appealing to the primitive part of the brain, or your target’s emotions—for example, by making your message novel or exciting so it won’t be ignored.
