## Exercise: Shift From Self to Other

Consider how the concepts of buyer beware and seller beware relate to sales and selling in your life.

* * *

Think about the last experience you had with someone trying to sell you something. What strategies did they use to “move” you to buy?

Did these strategies demonstrate buyer beware, seller beware, or both? Write some examples here.

Were the strategies effective? Why or why not?

Now, imagine the positions are reversed, and you are the seller. What strategies would you use to sell the same item or service? How do they demonstrate buyer beware or seller beware?
