## Chapter 1: Credit Cards

Now that you know what a rich life looks like for you, you need to know how to get there. The first step is building healthy credit card habits. You’re probably familiar with the scare tactics other financial writers use to convince you to stay away from credit cards, but credit cards aren’t inherently bad—if you use them responsibly, they’re a great way to proactively improve your credit and get access to useful perks. In this chapter, we’ll learn the pros and cons of credit cards, how to use credit cards responsibly to build your credit, and how to pay off any existing debt you have. 

###  The Pros and Cons of Credit Cards 

Credit cards can be a powerful tool in your wealth-building arsenal, but if you already carry credit card debt, you may see them as more of a menace than a tool. The reality is this: **If you use credit cards responsibly (by always paying your bill on time, in full), they’re essentially free short-term loans that help improve your credit history** , making it easier to get larger loans (like for a mortgage or a car) down the line. On top of that, credit cards offer useful perks, like automatic warranty extensions on purchases you make using the card. 

However, if you _don’t_ manage to completely pay off your credit card bills in full every month, the penalties add up quickly. If you only make the minimum payment one month instead of paying off your balance in full, the balance you carry over to the next month starts to rack up interest at the annual percentage rate (APR), which is usually around 14% or higher. That interest keeps accruing as long as you carry a balance, which means that by the time you pay it off, you’ll often have paid more in interest than the original cost of the purchase! 

###  Using Credit Cards to Build Credit 

Credit cards are a helpful way to build credit, which is the foundation of the rest of your financial life. Your credit is a snapshot of your debt history, and it’s what lenders use to determine whether to loan you money (like for a mortgage or a student loan). If you use your credit card regularly and pay the balance off in full, you’re essentially taking out a mini loan and paying it back on time every month, which shows lenders that you can be trusted to borrow money and pay it back. 

When lenders look at your credit, they’re looking at two main components: your credit report and your credit score. Your **credit report** is a comprehensive account of your credit history—all the loans and credit cards you’ve ever had, and all the payments you made on them. Your **credit score** sums up all that information into a single number between 300 and 850—the higher the number, the better your credit and the more attractive you are to lenders. Credit scores are also sometimes called FICO scores because the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) invented the credit score system. 

A good credit score shows potential lenders that you have a history of paying back your loans, which means there’s less of a risk of them losing money if they give you a loan. As a result, they can offer lower interest rates, which can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Even if you don’t anticipate needing to apply for a loan in the immediate future, building good credit takes time, and investing that time now will set you up for success years down the line when you _do_ decide to apply for a loan. 

To illustrate the importance of having good credit, the table below shows how your credit score changes how much you pay over the life of a 30-year mortgage (based on APRs calculated in 2018). Notice how borrowers with the best credit get the lowest interest rates, meaning they pay significantly less overall than borrowers with poor credit scores. In fact, in this scenario, someone with a score of 620 would pay over _$70,000_ _more_ than someone with a score of 850 over the life of the mortgage. 

**Credit score** |  **APR** |  **Total amount you pay**  
---|---|---  
760-850  |  4.279%  |  $355,420   
700-759  |  4.501%  |  $364,856   
680-699  |  4.678%  |  $372,468   
660-679  |  4.892%  |  $381,773   
640-659  |  5.322%  |  $400,804   
620-639  |  5.868%  |  $425,585   
  
Knowing your credit score is important if you want to build wealth. To check your score, you can use a free website like Credit Karma or pay a small fee for a more accurate, official score from MyFico. To get a more comprehensive picture, you can download your entire credit report for free from AnnualCreditReport.com once a year by law. Establishing good credit is one of the most important things you can do to improve your financial situation, so it’s better to focus your energy on that step than worry about cutting costs elsewhere—in the long run, improving your credit will save you _much_ more money than clipping coupons. 

####  Finding the Right Card for You 

Using a credit card the right way—by paying off your balance in full every month, on time, using automatic payments—is a fast and easy way to boost your credit. If you’re in the market for a new card, Sethi has four guidelines for choosing the best one for you: 

  * **Opt for a rewards card** so that you’ll earn either cash back or travel miles with every dollar you spend on the card. 
  * **Avoid retail store cards.** The 10% you’ll save on your purchase at that store won’t make up for the high interest rates and exorbitant fees these cards usually have. 
  * **Stick to two or three credit cards.** While credit cards are an important part of your credit history, they’re not the only source of credit—and the more cards you have, the easier it is to slip up, miss a payment, and accidentally damage your credit instead of strengthening it. If you already have a few cards, hold off on opening any new ones for now. 
  * **Start with Sethi’s personal recommendations.** As a personal finance guru, Sethi’s done his research on the best credit cards out there. Here are the cards he uses personally: 
    * For everyday purchases: Alliant cash back card 
    * For travel and eating out: Chase Sapphire Reserve 
    * For business: Capital One cash back business card 
    * For extra benefits: Amex Platinum card 



####  Using Credit Cards the Right Way 

Once you have credit cards you’re happy with, you need to learn how to use them the right way—otherwise, it’s all too easy to forfeit the benefits and wind up saddled with debts and fees. Here are the six most important rules for using credit cards the right way: 

**1) Pay your bills on time, preferably in full.** Even just one late payment can lower your credit score, raise your APR, and stick you with a late fee (usually about $35). You can bounce back from the occasional hit to your credit, but it’s best to avoid the issue in the first place by setting up automatic payments. If you _do_ miss a payment, call the credit card company and tell them it was a one-time mistake and you’d like to have the late fee removed (make sure you’re _telling_ them you’d like the fee removed, not _asking_ if they can or will remove it). This works more than half the time. 

**2) If you’re paying any fees, try to get them waived.** Start by calling your credit card company and asking a representative whether you’re paying any annual fees or service charges on your card. If you are, tell them you’d like a no-fee account and ask them to waive any current fees. This works more often than you might expect, but if not, ask if they have a no-fee card that you can switch to. Credit card companies don’t want to lose your business, so they’ll work with you to find a solution. 

**3) Lower your APR.** Again, this involves calling your credit card company. If you’re nervous about the idea of negotiating, keep in mind that credit card APRs are usually between 13-16% and can be much higher. Ideally, you’re paying off your balance in full every month, but if you’re not able to do that yet, your APR determines how much more you’ll end up paying in total. 

  * To make that more concrete: Let’s say you buy a $1000 smartphone on a card with a 14% APR. If you only make the minimum payments each month instead of paying off the balance in full, you’ll end up paying $732.76 in interest by the time you pay off the phone—so that $1000 phone ends up actually costing you $1732.76. You might occasionally need to use your credit card for a legitimate need that you can’t pay off right away, so lowering the APR as much as possible is crucial to limiting how much extra you’ll end up paying for that purchase. 
  * When you call, tell the representative that you want a lower APR. When they ask why, use one of two reasons: If you have no debt, tell them you’ve been paying your bill in full and on time for several months now. If you do have debt, tell them you want to begin paying it down more aggressively. In either case, **make sure to mention that other cards are offering lower APRs** , and that you don’t want to have to switch your business to a different company that offers a low-interest card. Offering you a discount is often cheaper for the company than having to sign a brand new customer, so they may work with you if it means keeping your business. 



**4) Keep your accounts open and active.** Credit history is an important part of determining your credit score—the longer you keep an account open and continue making on-time payments, the better your score. That means that keeping that account open will ultimately benefit you more than switching your main card every time you find a great introductory APR somewhere else. This is especially important if you’re planning to apply for a loan in the next six months because closing an account will slightly reduce your credit score. 

**5) Call your credit card company and get a credit increase—but _only_ if you have no current debt. ** This improves your _credit utilization rate_ , which is responsible for determining 30% of your credit score. Your credit utilization rate is how much of your available credit you’ve actually used, which we can calculate by dividing the balance you currently owe by your total available credit. 

  * For example, if you owe $1,000 and have $1,000 in available credit, you’ve used 100% of your available credit. But if you owe $1,000 and have $5,000 in available credit, you’ve only used 20% of the total available credit. The lower your credit utilization rate, the better your credit score, because you’re less at risk of defaulting on the card. 
  * You should _only_ use this tip if you have no existing credit card debt because increasing your credit limit could tempt you to spend more and ultimately accumulate more debt rather than help you pay it down. 



**6) Take advantage of your card’s perks.** If you have a rewards card, you probably know that you can earn cash back and airline miles on your purchases. However, credit cards offer a host of other benefits, such as: 

  * Automatically extending the warranty on anything you purchase on the card (meaning that even when the manufacturer warranty expires, you can still get repairs and replacements covered) 
  * Trip insurance to reimburse airline change fees 
  * Rental car insurance for damages up to $50,000 
  * Concierge services that can help you get tickets to sold-out events 
  * Disputing charges on your behalf (for example, if your cell phone company charges you a fee even after you’ve negotiated out of it, your credit card company can often get the fee reimbursed for you) 



###  Credit Card Debt 

Most people have at least some debt, whether from credit cards, student loans, or a mortgage. In this chapter, we’ll discuss credit card debt exclusively (we’ll cover student loan debt in Chapter 7). Although we think of it as “normal,” debt can be a crushing weight, both financially and emotionally. Those emotions are so overwhelming that we freeze up and avoid thinking about debt at all costs instead of actively working to pay it down. 

To justify ignoring the problem, we fall back on a host of **invisible money scripts** . This is a term coined by financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz to describe the unconscious beliefs we absorb in childhood about money and debt that end up influencing our financial behavior as adults. Here are the types of invisible scripts people have around credit card debt and what they sound like in practice: 

  * **Comparing ourselves to others.** “Everyone has credit card debt. At least I don’t have as much as my friends do.” 
  * **Using the size of the problem as an excuse not to try at all.** “It doesn’t matter how much I spend now—I have so much debt that I’ll never be able to pay it off, anyway.” 
  * **Normalizing the problem.** “I already pay other fees, so I don’t mind paying interest.” 
  * **Not taking personal responsibility.** “Credit card companies are predatory. It’s their fault that I’m in debt.” 
  * **Ignoring the problem.** “I don’t even know how much debt I have.” 
  * **Giving in to hopelessness.** “I’m doing my best.” 



**When we rely on these invisible scripts, we give up the power to do something about debt.** Becoming aware of these scripts is the first step to taking that power back; the next step is taking responsibility for the problem _and_ the solution. Once you accept that you _can_ do something about the problem, you can make a plan to attack your debt as aggressively as possible. Having a plan turns a scary, overwhelming, emotional topic like debt into a simple, manageable math problem. 

####  Paying Off Debt 

Getting out of debt not only feels good emotionally, but it also boosts your credit score and can save you thousands of dollars in interest. Instead of thinking of debt as a looming monster you’ll have to deal with “someday,” think about how much money you’re losing every day by carrying a balance that’s racking up interest. To illustrate this, imagine you have $5,000 in credit card debt at 14% APR. You could approach this in a few different ways. 

  * You could pay only the monthly minimum (usually 2% of your balance). In this case, your first payment would be $100 (2% of $5,000). However, because the payment is a percentage of the balance, it will decrease as your balance decreases (so when your balance gets down to $4,000, your payment will go down to $80 per month). With this strategy, you’re making smaller and smaller payments each month, which stretches out the repayment period for years. 
  * Alternatively, you could pay a fixed amount each month—let’s say $100. This starts out the same as the situation above, but because it’s a fixed amount and not a variable percentage, you’re paying the balance down _more_ aggressively as time goes on, not less. At the start, you’ll pay $100, which is 2% of your $5,000 balance; when your balance gets down to $4,000, you’ll still pay $100, which is now 2.5% of the balance. By the time your balance is $1,000, your fixed payments will be a full 10% of the balance. 



To see how much time and interest money you’d save by paying more than the monthly minimum on that $5,000 debt at 14% APR, look at the chart below. Notice how doubling your fixed monthly payment from $100 to $200 would save you roughly four years of payments and $1,600 in interest. 

**Monthly payment** |  **Years to fully pay off** |  **Total interest paid**  
---|---|---  
$100 (variable monthly minimum)  |  25 years  |  $6,322.22   
$100 (fixed payment)  |  6.3 years  |  $2,547.85   
$200 (fixed payment)  |  2.5 years  |  $946.20   
  
#####  Five Steps to Paying Off Debt 

It’s time to get proactive about paying off debt. This process can take time, but with every payment, you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you’re actually _doing_ something about your debt. Remember, little steps can add up to big financial wins. 

**Step 1: Total up your debt.** Many people have no idea how much debt they actually have, which makes it impossible to make a solid plan (because the process of paying off $1,000 of debt might look a lot different than paying off $12,000). To get a sense of your current situation, call your credit card companies using the phone number on the back of your cards and find out your total debt, the APR, and current minimum monthly payment. Keep track of all the information using a chart like this one: 

**Card name** |  **Total debt** |  **APR** |  **Minimum payment**  
---|---|---|---  
Card 1  |  $1000  |  14%  |  $20   
Card 2  |  $2000  |  18%  |  $40   
  
**Step Two: Decide where to start.** You’ll want to focus on fully paying off one card at a time instead of increasing your payments on all of them. You can do this in two ways: 

  * **Start with the highest APR** (in the chart above, that’s Card 2). This is the most financially efficient way to pay off debt because the card with the highest APR is costing you the most in interest for each month you stay in debt. 
  * **Start with the lowest balance** (in the chart above, that’s Card 1). This is financial guru Dave Ramsey’s “snowball method.” It’s slightly less efficient in terms of pure financial math, but it has the psychological advantage: If you start with the lowest balance, you should be able to pay it off pretty quickly, and paying off an entire card’s debt is a huge win that will motivate you to keep going. 



These are both solid options for paying off debt, so don’t get hung up on choosing where to start—pick one, commit to it, and move on. Remember, getting started on paying off debt is more important than doing it perfectly. 

**Step 3: Negotiate a lower APR.** This is something _everyone_ should be doing, whether or not they have credit card debt. Remember, the key is to let the credit card representative know that other cards are offering lower APRs, and you’d hate to have to transfer your balance to another company with a better interest rate. Credit card companies want to keep your business—use this to your advantage. 

**Step 4: Figure out how you can afford more aggressive monthly payments.** You don’t necessarily need to bring in more money every month, you just need to reprioritize and divert money that you’re already spending elsewhere into your debt. Take a look at your spending habits—where can you afford to cut costs? If you’re not sure, keep that question in mind as you read the rest of this summary—you’ll find tips for saving money that you can use toward paying down your debts. Remember, the financial and emotional benefits of paying off debt will be worth any temporary sacrifices you make. 

  * There are other, less effective ways to fund your debt payoff—namely, balance transfers (essentially, using a credit card with a lower APR to pay off the current debt on a card with a higher APR) and taking money from your 401(k) or home equity line of credit (HELOC). Sethi cautions against these methods because they don’t address the root problem of your spending behavior. Instead, focus on building good financial habits by reducing spending and prioritizing building credit by getting out of debt. 



**Step 5: Get started.** Remember that it’s better to get started on a plan that’s good enough than to spin your wheels trying to come up with a plan that’s 100% perfect. 

###  Credit Card Action Items 

Now that you’re a credit card expert, it’s time to apply that knowledge. Here are your concrete action steps to make your credit cards work for you: 

  * **Log onto your credit card’s website and set up automatic payments.** That way, you’ll pay on time every month without having to worry about it at all. Each month, you’ll get a statement before the automatic payment goes through, so if you don’t have enough in your checking account to make your usual payment that month, you can log in and change the amount of the scheduled payment. 
  * **Call your credit card company** (you’ll find their phone number on the back of your card). Ask them to: 
    * Waive the fees on your card 
    * Lower your APR 
    * Send you a list of all their available perks 
  * **Use your main credit cards to set up automatic payments on your other bills.** For example, if you set up autopay on a streaming service using one of your credit cards, that card automatically stays active and continues building a solid payment history—and because you’ve already set it up so your checking account automatically pays your credit card balance every month, you can reap the benefits of using a credit card without any worry about missing payments. 
  * **Make a plan to pay off your debt.** When it comes to debt, half the battle is accepting the situation and actually taking action instead of ignoring it and hoping it’ll go away. Figure out how much you owe and make a plan for how to pay it down more aggressively (you can use financial calculators online to see how your repayment date and the total amount paid will change depending on how much you increase your monthly payments). Then, set up automatic payments so you can attack your debt without having to think about it each month.
