## Exercise: Find Your “Why”

Before you make a plan to grow your wealth even further, take a moment to think about the specific way you plan to use that money to live a Rich Life.

* * *

What high-level ideals (like freedom or security) do you associate with wealth? How could you turn those abstract ideas into concrete goals? (For example, if you associate money with freedom, a concrete goal might be earning enough money to be able to travel wherever you like, whenever you like.)

Imagine you’re earning an extra $1,000 per year by following the advice in this chapter. If all your basic financial needs were already met, how would you use that money to create your Rich Life? Be as specific as possible. (For example, maybe you’d feel free to order appetizers whenever you eat out, or take your spouse on a lavish weekend getaway).

Now, dream even bigger: Imagine you’re earning an extra $10,000 per year. How would you use that money to create your Rich Life? (For example, maybe you’d move into your dream neighborhood or start a new business.)
