## Exercise: Decide What a “Rich Life” Means to You

Being “rich” means something different to everyone. Take a moment to think about what a rich life would look like for you.

* * *

In general, what are the most important reasons you want to accumulate wealth? (For example, maybe you want to retire early, have more career flexibility, or eliminate the constant stress of making ends meet.)

Now, list three more specific financial goals by completing the phrase, “I’ll think of myself as rich when I can…” These can be big or small—think anywhere from “order appetizers before a restaurant meal” to “charter my own private yacht”—but try to be as specific as possible. (Remember, these goals should align with your values. They’re less about making money for money’s sake and more about having the freedom to spend time and money on things that are important to you.)

How is your vision of a Rich Life different from what you thought it meant to be “rich” or “successful” growing up? Why is your vision a better fit for you personally than that default definition?
