## Exercise: Identify Your High-Impact Financial Changes

Want to optimize your finances and create your rich life? Start by identifying the few areas where you can make the biggest impact on your financial life.

* * *

Let’s start with the “fixed costs” category (remember, these are basic necessities like rent and transportation). What one fixed expense can you reduce, and how will you do it?

Now, look at your “guilt-free spending” category. Off the top of your head, what non-essential things (like eating out or renting movies) do you think you spend too much on each month? How can you reduce that spending?

Remember, you’re most likely to meet your goals if they’re realistic. How can you gradually reduce your spending on one of these areas over the course of the next few weeks? (For example, if eating out is one of your areas to focus on and you currently eat out four times a week, you could map out a plan to eat out three times next week, and only twice the week after that.)
