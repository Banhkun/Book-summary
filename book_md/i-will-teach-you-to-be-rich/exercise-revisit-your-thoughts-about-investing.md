## Exercise: Revisit Your Thoughts About Investing

If you’re new to investing, this chapter may have been a lot of information to take in all at once. Let’s take a moment to apply that information to your own situation.

* * *

Before reading this chapter, how familiar were you with the basics of investing? (For example, maybe you’d heard of 401(k) accounts but didn’t know about Roth IRAs—or maybe you already have a few investment accounts, but weren’t clear on the difference between investing pre-tax versus post-tax money.)

Did you recognize yourself in any of the invisible investing scripts listed in this chapter? If so, how did those scripts change after reading more?

Based on your familiarity with investing and your invisible scripts, what is your main takeaway from this chapter? (For example, if you were afraid to invest because you didn’t know where to start, your main takeaway might be that investing isn’t as intimidating as you thought; or, if you’ve been trying to invest by buying individual stocks, your main takeaway might be to refocus on funding your 401(k).)
