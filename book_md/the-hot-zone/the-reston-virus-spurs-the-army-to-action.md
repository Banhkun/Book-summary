## The Reston Virus Spurs the Army to Action

Jahrling’s tests showed that the monkey samples reacted to Ebola Zaire, meaning that the blood sample of an Ebola Zaire victim glowed under ultraviolet light when it mixed with virus cultures made from the monkeys. The glow signaled that the virus in the culture was the same or similar to the virus in the victim’s blood sample.

The tests weren’t proof positive that the virus _was_ Ebola Zaire. This virus could be something closely related—something new and unknown.

**The prospect of a new filovirus was even more terrifying than Ebola Zaire because that would mean they knew nothing about how deadly it was or how it was transmitted.** If this virus was anything like the other filoviruses, they’d be facing a potent killer without knowing how to protect themselves or prevent an outbreak.

The news quickly spread up the chain of command:

  * Jahrling alerted Peters. 
  * Jahrling and Peters alerted Colonel David Huxsoll, the commander of USAMRIID. 
  * Huxsoll immediately set up a meeting with Major General Philip K. Russell, the commander of the Army’s Medical Research and Development Command. 
  * Huxsoll and Peters called in Nancy Jaax, who had been appointed chief of pathology at USAMRIID. 



### Army Officials Formulate a Plan

When Russell, Peters, Huxsoll, Jahrling, and Jaax met, they tried to get a grasp of what they were dealing with and what they were going to do about it. **Russell was alarmed at the possibility of an Ebola outbreak in a suburb of Washington, DC.**

Worse yet, Jaax told him about two incidents that suggested the virus could be airborne:

  1. The two control monkeys in the Ebola experiment she’d helped with had died from the virus, despite having no contact with infected monkeys. 
  2. Johnson subsequently conducted an experiment in which he had monkeys inhale fairly small amounts of the virus, and they became infected. 



The group considered the options. **There are three ways to stop a virus** :

  1. Vaccines, but none existed for Ebola
  2. Drug treatments, but none existed for Ebola
  3. **Biocontainment, which would be their only option**



One way to achieve biocontainment would be to cut off the Reston facility from the world, allow the virus to spread and kill the monkeys, and potentially quarantine all the employees who’d been exposed. But Option 1 would mean allowing the monkeys to suffer as they died off, and it wouldn’t give the researchers an opportunity to collect samples to study.

Option 2 was to enter the facility—a Level 4 hot zone. **They would kill, collect samples from, and incinerate the monkeys, and then sterilize the entire building with chemicals.**

### The Army Informs Dalgard

Peters called Hazleton veterinarian Dalgard to let him know what they were dealing with. Dalgard was relieved to find out the virus wasn’t Marburg, which is well known and feared among professionals who work with monkeys. Dalgard had never heard of Ebola, but when Peters told him Ebola’s kill rate, he understood he was dealing with something even _worse_ than Marburg.

Dalgard needed to loop in his superiors at Hazleton, who were unaware that a monkey-killing virus was spreading through the Reston facility.**Dalgard worried that he’d made a mistake by involving the Army in the first place, who now wanted to visit the monkey house and view samples from the dead monkeys** —he didn’t want his decision to anger company leaders or hurt business. Dalgard hesitated to give them permission, and instead he suggested they talk again in the morning.

As Dalgard considered the situation, he was more concerned by the prospect of the Army muscling its way into Reston than by the threat of Ebola. He knew Ebola’s kill rate, but he’d been exposed to the infected monkeys’ blood and still felt fine.

#### The Threat of Ebola Intensifies

The next morning, Dalgard spoke to Peters and agreed to let Johnson, Jaax, and Peters inspect the tissues of the monkey carcasses—but Dalgard was still hesitant to let them into the monkey house.

Then Dalgard called Volt, the monkey colony manager, to tell him about the Army’s findings. Volt told Dalgard that one of the animal caretakers in the monkey house—who is identified as Jarvis Purdy—had suffered a heart attack. Purdy was at the hospital, and he might be dying. **Suddenly, the threat became real to Dalgard: Purdy could be infected with Ebola, and the virus could infect and kill others, as well.**

Dalgard instructed Volt to suspend all activity in the monkey rooms besides feeding, cleaning, and observation—and those tasks had to be done in full biohazard gear.

#### Infected Monkey Samples Cause More Confusion

Soon after, Johnson, Jaax, and Peters arrived at Dalgard’s office. **Jaax viewed a sample from one of the dead monkeys under a microscope, and she saw that the cells looked like bricks that were bursting with replicated virus particles, a signature sign of Ebola.**

The Army officials wanted more samples, so Dalgard had Volt give them the carcasses of several monkeys that had died the night before.

Jaax, Johnson, and Peters transported the infected carcasses to USAMRIID, where Jaax took them into the Level 4 hot zone to dissect. When she cut into the first one, she found:

  * Eyes that were _not_ red (red eyes would have been a telling symptom of a filovirus)
  * An enlarged, leathery spleen
  * Some bleeding spots where the stomach met the small intestine 



**Some of the characteristics looked like Ebola, but it was far from a dead ringer—** the organs hadn’t liquified and there was little to no hemorrhaging. Jaax couldn’t confirm that they were dealing with Ebola based on this carcass. She’d need more samples.

### A Power Struggle Between the Army and CDC

While the Army researchers and leaders were forming their plan, they came upon the issue of politics. Congress charged the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)—not the Army—with protecting the country from disease. However, **while the CDC had the authority to respond to this threat, the Army had the manpower.**

The group felt that they had to move forward with their plan to contain this virus, regardless of the repercussions. **They would assemble a biohazard SWAT team and sterilize the Reston monkey house.**

The following day, General Russell met with members of the USAMRIID team and a couple CDC officials, including Joe McCormick, the chief of the CDC’s Special Pathogens Branch. Dalgard, Virginia Department of Health officials, and officials from Fairfax County (where Reston is located) also attended.

McCormick had a history of tension with the Army, having publicly criticized Eugene Johnson for neglecting to publish the results of his Kitum Cave expedition after Peter Cardinal’s death. McCormick also had more field experience with Ebola than anyone in the room, and he was the only person there who’d worked with infected people.

McCormick had worked for days in a quarantine hut full of Ebola victims in Sudan, and—despite a close call—he hadn’t caught the virus. As a result, McCormick felt sure that Ebola was difficult to transmit and most likely _not_ airborne, despite what Army officials were suggesting.

As the meeting went on, tensions rose. Russell finally proposed a compromise: **The CDC would be in charge of human-related concerns, and the Army would be in charge of the monkeys and the Reston facility.** Everyone agreed.

### Army Officials Prepare for the Reston Sterilization Mission

Dalgard decided to allow the Army into the monkey house to clear out one of the rooms.

Peters tapped Nancy Jaax’s husband, Colonel Jerry Jaax, to lead the mission into the Reston facility. Jerry Jaax was the chief of USAMRIID’s veterinary division. Although he had no experience with extreme biohazard agents, he and his team knew well how to handle monkeys.

Jerry Jaax conferred with Johnson about how to approach the mission. **They’d have to be extremely careful while sterilizing Reston to prevent the virus from escaping and spreading.**

The priorities of the mission were threefold:

  1. Prevent the virus from infecting humans. 
  2. Euthanize the monkeys as quickly and painlessly as possible. 
  3. Collect samples for research on the virus and its transmission.
