## Part 1: Deadly Viruses Emerge in Africa

In the 1960s, the export of primates for medical research became a big business in Africa. Inevitably, some of the monkeys were sick when they were caught from the wild. As different monkey species were held in close quarters and shipped to industrialized countries around the world, it created prime conditions for viruses to jump species and then cross borders.

**Some experts believe the monkey export business led to the international spread of AIDS and other viruses, including the deadly Ebola virus and its sister virus, Marburg.**

Scientists still don’t know what the filoviruses’ hosts are—whether insects or animals—but the viruses can be transmitted to primates or duikers, a type of antelope.

(Shortform note: To this day, scientists don’t know the hosts of filoviruses, but evidence points to fruit- and insect-eating bats as major carriers—though that doesn’t rule out the possibility that an insect or rat is the original host and simply infected the bats through a bite. Scientists also suspect there could be multiple hosts.)

Scientists don’t know where the viruses’ unknown hosts live, but **most cases of Ebola trace back to the region around Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano on the border of Kenya and Uganda, not far from Sudan.** The mountain is an ecological rarity: It houses a rainforest amid arid African savannas.

Specifically, a few cases have traced back to Kitum Cave, a massive cave 8,000 feet up the eastern side of the mountain. Kitum Cave is a perfect environment for Ebola to develop for a few reasons.

First, **Kitum Cave is unusually dry and dusty, which are ideal conditions for viruses.** Viruses generally don’t last long in sunny or moist environments, but in dry, dark places they can lie dormant for long periods of time, waiting to find a host.

Most caves are carved by water, and they would be too damp for viruses to thrive. But scientists believe the elephants who visit the cave in search of salt carved Kitum Cave through thousands of years of incessant scratching at the rocks with their tusks.

Second, myriad animals, big and small—including monkeys, leopards, rats, and shrews—frequent the cave. The inter-species traffic and the enclosed space create prime conditions for a virus to jump species.

Most of the time, Ebola and its related viruses remain in hiding. But when the viruses have emerged, they’ve devastated local villages and, occasionally, distant cities in other countries and continents. **In this summary, we’ll talk about what happened during these outbreaks and the potential for future outbreaks.**

But first, let’s discuss what the virus is and how it affects humans.

### The Filovirus Family

Ebola belongs to a family of viruses named filoviruses, meaning “thread viruses,” because they look like threads or ropes under a microscope.

There are four viruses in the filovirus family:

  1. Marburg, the mildest strain, with a kill rate of 1 in 4
  2. Ebola Sudan, with a kill rate of about 1 in 2
  3. Ebola Zaire, the deadliest strain, with a kill rate of 9 in 10 
  4. Ebola Reston, which we’ll discuss in Part 2 



(Shortform note: Since the book’s publication, three more filoviruses have been identified, all of which are strains of Ebola: Bundibugyo, Taï Forest, and Bombali.)

With the exception of Ebola Reston, **filoviruses don’t appear to discriminate between people and animals, and can jump from one to the other.**

### Marburg Virus

Marburg’s kill rate among patients treated in hospitals is about 1 in 4, which makes Marburg an extremely lethal virus. By comparison, yellow fever’s kill rate is about 1 in 20, and it is considered highly lethal.

**Marburg virus attacks organs, intestines, skin, and connective tissue throughout the body.** Its symptoms include:

  * Extensive bruising
  * Blood clots throughout the body, from organs to extremities
  * Hemorrhages from every orifice
  * Black vomit, a mixture of arterial blood and black specks that indicate hemorrhage
  * Impaired central nervous system
  * Destroyed brain, leading to personality changes, memory loss, and an expressionless face
  * Swollen testicles in male victims
  * Peeling skin on survivors’ faces, hands, feet, and genitals during recovery 



The virus is extremely virulent and highly infective, and it can live in corpses’ eyeballs for months after death.

(Shortform note: Besides the kill rate, there are no major identifiable differences between Marburg and Ebola. Scientists don’t know why Ebola is deadlier than Marburg.)

### Ebola Virus

Ebola virus particles are composed of seven different proteins—each of which scientists know little to nothing about—and a strand of RNA, which contains the virus’s genetic information and instructions for the virus’s replication.

Viruses are parasites. They lie dormant until they can use their sticky surface to latch onto another cell. The cell envelopes the virus, at which point the virus uses the cell’s materials to create copies of itself. **The virus continues replicating until the cell either bursts or is exhausted and destroyed.**

The Ebola virus targets the immune system, preventing victims’ bodies from fighting off the disease. However, Ebola’s lethality doesn’t benefit the virus: **When a virus’s host dies, it must jump to another host, or else it will also die.** The only two “jobs” of a virus are to survive and replicate.

Scientists believe Ebola is transmitted through the blood and bodily fluids of infected victims and corpses. But **if the virus mutated to become airborne, it would have the potential to snowball into a pandemic—and with a 50-90% kill rate, the effects would be devastating.**

Although Ebola belongs to the filovirus family, it’s distantly related to other diseases, including:

  * Rabies 
  * Measles
  * Mumps
  * Parainfluenza virus, which causes the common cold in children 
  * Respiratory syncytial virus, which causes potentially fatal pneumonia in AIDS patients



Ebola’s connections to these diseases are evident in certain symptoms, including rashes (like measles) and psychosis (like rabies).

#### Ebola Zaire

Ebola Zaire shares many symptoms with other filoviruses, but **Ebola Zaire is the most aggressive of the filoviruses, digesting all the organs and tissues in victims’ bodies until they liquefy into a slime of replicated virus particles.**

This is how Ebola Zaire affects different parts of victims’ bodies:

**Blood**

  * Blood clots start to clog the bloodstream, getting stuck on the walls of blood vessels and in capillaries, which cuts off blood supply to different areas of the body. 
  * Sections of brain, breast tissue, intestines, kidneys, liver, lungs, skin, and testicles begin to die from lack of blood supply. 
  * All the body’s coagulation factors (proteins that allow blood to clot) are used up internally—causing the excessive blood clots—while the blood that leaves the body can’t clot, simply bleeding incessantly. 
  * Victims bleed from the mouth, including around the teeth and salivary glands. 
  * The eyeballs fill with blood, sometimes causing blood to run from them like tears, and potentially causing blindness. 



**Skin**

  * Hemorrhages under the skin create visible red spots, which quickly spread to become large bruises. 
  * Skin collagen breaks down, causing the layers beneath the skin to liquefy, causing tiny white blisters to appear on the skin. 
  * The skin becomes fragile, easily tearing off and ripping. The surfaces and linings of the tongue, back of the throat, and windpipe also shed.



**Organs**

  * The heart hemorrhages, filling the heart chambers and chest cavity with blood. 
  * The intestines fill with blood, while their lining sheds and is excreted. 
  * Blood clots cause the kidneys to fail, at which point the blood becomes contaminated with urine. 
  * The liver becomes swollen and yellow, then liquefies, and finally dies and rots while the victim is still alive. 
  * The spleen hardens into a massive blood clot. 
  * **Many of the organs begin dying and dissolving before the victim is dead.**



**Brain**

  * Dead blood cells clog the brain. Some victims suffer hemispherical strokes, paralyzing one side of the body. 
  * Victims often suffer grand mal seizures, during which their entire body convulses. The seizures cause the blood that is hemorrhaging from every orifice to splatter around the area. **Seizures typically happen in the final stages, and the blood splatter gives the virus a chance to jump to a new host before its current host dies.**



After death, the body continues to liquefy, oozing fluids that are packed with virus particles.

Now that we’ve introduced the filoviruses, we’ll explore the outbreaks of each and how local, national, and global organizations have attempted to stop their spread.
