## 1983: U.S. Army Ebola Experiments

In 1983, a U.S. Army civilian scientist and Ebola expert named Eugene Johnson led research on the Ebola and Marburg viruses. **Johnson and his team infected monkeys with Ebola Zaire, then gave them various drugs in hope of finding one that either treated or cured the virus.**

Johnson conducted his experiments at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The work at USAMRIID focused on fighting viruses and bacteria—whether weaponized or naturally occurring—by developing vaccines and studying how to contain outbreaks.

### USAMRIID Level 4 Hot Zones

USAMRIID researchers studied Biosafety Levels 0, 2, 3, and 4 agents (there is no Level 1). Ebola was a Level 4 hot agent, which are lethal viruses that have no vaccines or cures.

Before entering a Level 4 hot zone, researchers went through a multistep safety process, including:

  1. Removing all their jewelry and clothing, including underwear
  2. Putting on sterile surgical pants and shirt
  3. Covering hair with a surgical cap
  4. Getting bathed in ultraviolet light, which impaired viruses from replicating
  5. Putting on latex gloves and taping the edges closed around the cuffs of their shirtsleeves
  6. Taping socks around the ends of their pant legs
  7. **Putting on biological space suits** , which were made of thick plastic and included attached rubber gloves
  8. Wearing a latex glove over the rubber space-suit gloves, **creating three layers of protection for researchers’ hands, which were at the greatest risk as they handled blades and sharp bones**
  9. Donning a plastic helmet and rubber boots
  10. Crossing through a gray area, which provided a margin between the hot zone and the regular world. The gray area also contained the decontamination shower, which sprayed researchers with a combination of water and chemicals as they exited the hot zone.



Any researchers whose suits had been breached and who were exposed to a Level 4 hot agent had to be quarantined in the USAMRIID’s biocontainment hospital, called the Slammer. Those who died were buried in a Level 4 biocontainment morgue, called the Submarine.

**No risk could be overlooked when dealing with such deadly and highly infective agents.**

### Nancy Jaax’s Close Call

One researcher in Johnson’s Ebola experiments was Major Nancy Jaax, an army veterinarian who was training in veterinary pathology. **When monkeys died in the experiment, Jaax’s job was to find out what had killed them—essentially confirming that Ebola was the cause of death.**

One day, Jaax entered the monkey room to find and inspect two monkeys that had crashed and bled out. While working on one of the dead monkeys, Jaax noticed a hole in her glove. She panicked. **Jaax’s glove had been covered in the infected monkey’s blood—and worse, she had a deep cut in the palm of that hand** from a kitchen accident the night before.

Jaax rushed to the decontamination shower, then tore off her suit and carefully inspected the first of her three layers of hand protection, the latex glove that directly covered her skin. She saw blood under the glove, but couldn’t yet tell if it was the monkey’s or her own.

Jaax filled the glove with water and watched for any leaks, but the glove held. She was safe.

### Ebola’s Airborne Potential

Throughout Johnson’s experiments, none of the drugs worked. Every infected monkey died of the disease.

Eventually, **even the two control monkeys who researchers _hadn’t_ infected also caught the virus and died**. They’d been kept in their cages, away from all the other monkeys, which should have kept them healthy because researchers believed the virus only traveled via direct contact with bodily fluids.

However, somehow the monkeys had been infected. Jaax believed that when the monkeys’ cages were cleaned, the moisture mixed with the sick monkeys’ spit and other fluids on the cages’ surfaces and created an aerosol of droplets. **Jaax theorized that the aerosol allowed the virus to become airborne.**
