## Chapter 4: Refine Your Skill Set

So far in our discussion of Waitzkin’s intermediate techniques, we’ve covered how to find your personal style and how to use patterns of error to develop your skills. Now, we’ll look deeper at _how_ to practice those new skills you uncover.

Chapter 4 describes **why** **depth beats breadth** , according to Waitzkin, and**how to learn good form by developing an embodied understanding of your skill**. This “embodied understanding” underpins more advanced skills, like getting into a flow state.

### Deepen Your Fundamentals

As Waitzkin says, **real skill comes from a deep, singular focus**. In terms of skill-building, he argues that you reach excellence by refining a set of fundamental skills, rather than practicing a wide range of techniques. For example, focus on learning a single style of piano, like baroque classical, rather than trying to learn classical, jazz, and ragtime piano all at once.

**When you jump from technique to technique, you neglect to understand any of them beyond the surface level.** According to Waitzkin, this leads to a wide-ranging but technically deficient skill set. Imagine learning five new piano chords daily—likely as not, you won’t grasp any of them deeply.

(Shortform note: In _Range_ , David Epstein offers a counterargument to Waitzkin’s single-minded focus. He says cultivating a variety of skills gives you more flexibility in your career path; that it’s okay to find your path late in life; and that specialists end up siloed, or fixed in a particular way of thinking and acting. Epstein contends the modern world is an “unstable environment.” In other words, we can’t reliably predict what skills will remain useful, since things change so quickly. In contrast, chess and tai chi are stable environments—established games with unchanging rules—so focused practice works fine. But in unstable environments, learning widely can teach you transferable principles of learning that help you adapt to our complex world.)

#### Learn How Correct Form Feels

Waitzkin describes how he learned these fundamental skills from tai chi by slowly practicing one small movement at a time. For example, you might train a simple step forward, going slowly until the form becomes natural, like moving your hand an inch through the air.

He doesn't say explicitly what these “fundamentals” are, but we’ve identified three techniques he uses to learn correct form:

  1. **Deepen your awareness.** Practice becoming present and moving your awareness around your body. Focus on how your body feels, and learn to move that awareness around internally. 
  2. **Relax tensions.** When you’re learning to do something new with your body and mind, Waitzkin implies that there’s usually some resistance. In physical skills, your physiology—muscles, nerves, and so on—need to adapt to the unfamiliar form. In mental skills, you need to strain toward new connections, as we explained in Chapter 2. With both of these, presence helps you ease through the physical and psychological tension that precedes learning.
  3. **Focus intensity.** Once you’ve worked through resistance, the next step is to focus your energy into the new form. For example, you need to _tense_ your muscles to properly develop them, or _concentrate_ your mind on an idea to understand it. 



> **Somatic Awareness**
> 
> Somatic mindfulness means noticing how your body feels: whether you’re physically tense or relaxed, how individual muscles feel, and whether there’s an emotional response rippling through your body. Developing this awareness equips you to experience your body’s sensations without being controlled by them and enables you to develop new behaviors, since you’re able to let go of habitual _reactions_ and _respond_ instead.
> 
> One way of developing somatic awareness is through Focusing, a technique explained by Eugene Gendlin in his 1978 book: Focusing. In short: Find a quiet space and pay attention to your body—often your stomach or chest. Then ask, “What’s most salient to me right now?” and calmly observe the feelings that arise within you. As you do so, you relax inner tension, similarly to what Waitzkin describes.
> 
> While Focusing deals with “felt sense,” or bodily emotional awareness, it uses the same mechanism as Waitzkin’s technique: Become aware of an internal tension point, and gradually move through it with calm, present awareness. The technique is not just for inner relaxation—artists, writers, and scientists report that it’s opened them to positive creative experiences. This is a bit like Waitzkin’s third step: After you relax resistance, there’s room for new expression (whether of mind, body, or heart) to come forth.

Waitzkin implies that you need to **cycle tension and relaxation to deepen your embodied understanding of a technique**. The deeper you take it, the better you’ll be able to wield that technique in competition—it becomes smooth and instinctive.

When you deeply study a single skill, you develop a _feeling_ for proper form. Though he doesn’t say this explicitly, we can infer that this is not mental understanding—it’s physical understanding. Reaching that feeling equips you to take on more advanced techniques.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin’s explanation of this feeling is somewhat fuzzy, but the concept of form is common in physical training. Proper form means placing your body in a strong, well-aligned position, with your bones oriented properly, muscle flexed, and joints supported. You can find form in push-ups, squatting, or even walking—all it takes is patient practice of proper positioning. And as you practice that form, your body will start to find it more naturally, demonstrating again Waitzkin’s idea of _form to leave form._)

To get to the feeling of proper form, rest your awareness in your body and gradually move through any resistance. Then, concentrate energy into the technique you’re practicing to build energy into it. For example, you might relax your shoulders to loosen them up, then practice tensing them to perform a pull-up.

This is like stretching: Gently ease through tension, moving toward what feels right. Gradually, you'll develop that feeling of right form.

(Shortform note: Though Waitzkin doesn’t explicitly identify his method as such, it’s much like deep practice, which we explained in Chapter 2. Unlike earlier, here Waitzkin focuses on how it _feels_ to move through the process, rather than giving concrete steps. This hints at what deep practice is really about—navigating the undulations of effort and release, working through resistance toward good form, and gradually reshaping what your mind and body can do.)

Consider “mountain” pose, a basic yoga posture. You stand with your feet together, flat on the floor; knees flexed but not locked, abs tightened slightly to support a straight spine; your shoulders resting back. You could spend hours deepening your embodied understanding of this pose: Feeling out just the right distribution of weight in your feet, just the right tension through your legs, just the right flex in your core. Eventually, you’ll reach a reliable feeling of “yes, this is _right form._ ”

**Waitzkin argues that once you've reached that feeling once, you can sense whether you’ve reached it with another technique**. For example, a deep understanding of one yoga pose will help you develop any other, or a martial arts stance, push-ups, and so on.

(Shortform note: To grasp this point, you may find it necessary to try it out— _thinking_ about something can only take you so far. Western thought traditionally prefers clear, propositional thinking, but “felt sense” is valid. It has its origins in ancient Greece, where the Greeks had at least four valid ways of knowing. The two relevant here are _episteme_ , or “propositional knowing,” and _techne_ , or “participatory knowing.” The latter corresponds to felt sense, and you can only develop it by experiencing something first hand. For example, you’ll never know what it feels like to fly off a ski jump unless you get out there and do it.)
