## Exercise: Regain Balance After a Mistake

Reflect on how you can regain balance the next time you make a painful mistake.

* * *

Think back to a recent mistake you made, whether in a relationship, at work, or in a competitive arena. How did you react at that time? Describe what happened.

Having read Waitzkinâ€™s advice for dealing with mistakes, how could you better deal with a similar mistake the next time you make one? (Remember that he suggests returning to presence, which can be as simple as splashing your face with cold water.)

Waitzkin also recommends developing your own methods for returning to presence. With the same area of life in mind, what sorts of techniques might work for you? (Remember his rule of thumb: Physical movement can refresh the mind, and periods of restfulness refresh the body.)
