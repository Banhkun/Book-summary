## Chapter 2: Build Your Foundation

Now that we’ve grounded ourselves in the key themes of Waitzkin’s approach, we’ll explore the fundamentals of how to build a skill. This chapter covers **how to create your foundation and how to develop in the direction of what inspires you,** according to Waitzkin.

Specifically, we’ll discuss how to study the individual elements of your skill. Then, we’ll explain how to build elements into memory “chunks”—combinations of multiple elements, like how to shuffle, deal, and count cards—and networks of chunks.

Finally, we’ll discuss how to develop in harmony with your intuition and why Waitzkin believes it’s important to do so.

### Start With the Fundamentals

Waitzkin says to **start with the fundamentals of your skill**. With any skill, there are better and worse ways to begin learning. Waitzkin recommends a patient, step-by-step approach to the fundamentals.

First, avoid beginning with rigid, quick-fix strategies that only work in specific scenarios. For example, Waitzkin explains that many young chess players learn aggressive sequences of moves that aim to overwhelm an unskilled opponent. However, these players don’t understand the inner workings of their strategies. So when they face situations that surpass their knowledge, and their strategies fall apart, they aren't equipped to adapt. This sort of player has a brittle, one-dimensional game plan.

(Shortform note: Many language learning programs, like Duolingo and Rosetta Stone, make the mistake Waitzkin cautions against: They teach you set phrases and sentences that apply only if people speak precisely what you’ve learned. Since people don’t speak so rigidly, this knowledge can quickly fall apart, just as Waitzkin argues. In contrast, Gabriel Wyner explains in _Fluent Forever_ that we should learn languages from the bottom up, starting from the sounds, moving to single words, to grammatical patterns, and interspersing conversation practice to tie it all together.)

The better approach, according to Waitzkin, is to**start by studying the basic elements of your skill**. Any skill is composed of simple, elemental chunks of know-how. For example, you’d learn how to dribble a basketball, how to pass it, how to catch it, and so on.

**Study each element in isolation, one by one,** taking the time to thoroughly understand each one. In chess, Waitzkin first studied king-pawn versus king, a basic situation that teaches the simplest principles. Afterward, he moved on to rook-pawn versus king, and so on, through each basic chess position. In basketball, you might first learn to dribble, then to pass, to set up a shot, to pivot, and so on—giving each your undivided attention.

(Shortform note: Though Waitzkin doesn’t say it explicitly, this approach is much like deep practice, a method of refining one technique at a time through focused practice. In _The Talent Code_ , Daniel Coyle gives a similar explanation, saying that deep practice combines single-element focus with a tight feedback loop, enabling you to adjust and refine one skill at a time. For example, you would learn a piece of music one bar at a time, practicing each repeatedly and correcting your mistakes until you can perform it properly. Focus on refining that element until you’ve got it down—otherwise, you risk sloppy, unrefined execution.)

**Patiently practice each element until it becomes intuitive**. Waitzkin calls this form to leave form, referring to the process whereby a conscious effort gradually becomes unconscious, or automatic. For example, if you drill 10,000 free throws, your form will eventually become second nature.

**Once each element is intuitive, start combining them**. Continue to practice until you can unconsciously coordinate multiple basic elements of your skill. For example, you might train basketball techniques until you can stop on a dime, catch a bounce pass, dribble to the three-point line, and shoot a jump shot. Practice these one at a time, and you’ll build smooth, coordinated skillfulness.

(Shortform note: In _The Talent Code_ , Coyle also discusses how deep practice develops myelin more efficiently than unfocused practice. Myelin is a tissue that wraps around neurons or nerve cells, speeding and smoothing the signals that travel along those cells. The more myelin you’ve grown, the more automatically you can perform a practiced behavior. In other words, myelin makes your skills habit, or _intuitive_. This is the neuroscience of Waitzkin’s “form to leave form”: Dedicated practice of individual skills develops myelin, and well-myelinated skills feel like natural instinct.)

This method has two major benefits:

**Benefit #1:** It builds _resilient_ skillfulness. **Because you’ve trained the basic elements of your skill in isolation, you’ve set yourself up to combine them in new ways when you encounter new situations**. So when the obstacles get tougher, you’ll be able to adapt.

  * For example, understanding a language from the bottom up—basic sounds, to words and grammar patterns, to phrases and sentences—is better than learning a collection of set phrases. In the latter situation, you’re out of luck if people say anything other than what you learned. In the former, you have a shot at adapting because you aren’t limited to a few rigid constructions.



**Benefit #2:** It emphasizes the process. **Learning the basic elements one at a time encourages you to find meaning in the labor of committed practice**. So in addition to a solid technical foundation, you foster appreciation for the journey of growth.

> **Applying Waitzkin’s Method**
> 
> A common critique of _The Art of Learning_ is that Waitzkin doesn’t provide examples from outside of chess or tai chi. While he does explain most of the above principles from his experience with those two disciplines, considering how they’d apply to other skills shows that the principles _do_ make sense—let’s see how:
> 
>   * **In language learning** , you would study a language from the bottom up:
> 
>     * **The basic elements:** Start by learning to pronounce each individual sound.
> 
>     * **Practice until intuitive:** In practicing each individual sound, you’ll need to wrap your tongue around unfamiliar consonants and vowels, repeating until they feel natural.
> 
>     * **Put the elements together:** Now you can combine sounds into words, which are many sounds in tandem. If you try to say “ _Freundschaftsbeziehungen”_ before learning each sound, you’re in for a rough ride.
> 
>     * Continue on to grammar rules, phrases, sentences, and more.
> 
>   * **On piano,** you could learn one note, chord, and scale at a time:
> 
>     * **The basic elements:** Start by learning the 12 notes of the chromatic scale (which contains all 12 notes in Western music).
> 
>     * **Practice until intuitive:** Press one key at a time, refining your form until you can smoothly play each note without thinking.
> 
>     * **Put the elements together** : Pick a basic chord, like a C major, to combine three notes into one technique. Again, practice until it’s natural; and so on with further chords and scales.

### Develop Chunks of Skillfulness

After discussing how to train the basics, Waitzkin uses "chunking" to explain how to further develop your skill. In short, **chunks are the basic elements** (as discussed above) **combined into compound skills**. Learning via chunking enables you to perform more complex skills with intuitive ease, executing multiple elements in tandem.

This, Waitzkin says, is how you build skills: **Increment by increment you forge understanding, integrating the smallest elements into larger chunks, chunks into clusters of chunks** , and so on. For example, a skilled quarterback has numerous chunks that enable him to read the field, judge where to send the football, and perform the right throw to deliver it to his receiver.

(Shortform note: It’s not clear whether we need an explicit understanding of chunks to learn well. Chunking was introduced relatively recently, in 1956, yet humans have been mastering skills for thousands of years. As a child, Waitzkin was likely developing chunks without knowing about the inner workings of his cognition, as do most young chess players. In this sense, knowing about chunks can be _interesting_ , but may not be _essential_ to developing skillfulness. So long as your method effectively builds chunks, you may not need to know that you’re doing so.)

When you chunk, **the mind takes multiple basic elements, finds how they relate according to the principles of your skill, and integrates them into one unit.** Then, you intuitively access and employ that chunk of skills.

For example, the chunk for an A minor 7th piano chord encodes how each note relates to the others, and the player can access it as one intuitive piece of information.

(Shortform note: In _A Mind for Numbers, _Barbara Oakley explains that chunking is a key feature of human memory. As we take in information, our brains work to assemble it into coherent clusters of memory. Three or four pieces of information—like the three notes of a piano chord—becomes one chunk. And like Waitzkin, Oakley argues that deeply chunked or integrated information becomes intuitive, allowing you to access it with little or no conscious effort.)

**As you learn how the elements of your skill relate, each additional chunk** yields instinctual know-how that **builds into a powerful network** of intuitive skillfulness. For example, you've got chunks for the English language—words, grammatical patterns, sentence constructions, and so on—that you are using right now to understand this guide.

Chess is harder to parse than language. But Grandmasters, Waitzkin explains, can look at the board and see all the patterns: How this pawn relates to that bishop, how the bishop relates to that rook, how a cluster of pawns relates to both bishop and rook, and so on. Like you effortlessly read English, the Grandmaster reads a chess board.

(Shortform note: In chess, players use chunking to parse the board. In writing, writers use chunks to write readable pieces. Since working memory can hold two or three chunks at a time, complex sentences are harder to read. They require more cognitive resources to properly process, and by the time the writer gets to their point, we’ve forgotten how all the clauses built up. On the other hand, writing that’s direct and concise helps readers to absorb and retain the information, since brief, succinct sentences are much easier to parse.)

#### Layer Chunks Into a Network of Skills

**Until you make a connection between two bits of information,** Waitzkin says,**it takes more effort to understand how they relate**. He compares this to hacking through dense forest to create a new path between two clearings. The first pass is the hardest, but once you've made the connection it becomes easier. Travel that path frequently enough and you'll clear the way, making passage effortless. This is how you connect two bits of information, creating a small chunk.

(Shortform note: In the brain, thousands of new neurons arise in the adult hippocampus each day. These neurons are initially at risk, but you can retain them by engaging in “effortful learning.” In other words, by concentrating intensely on learning some skill, such as chess or poker. This integrates the new neurons with existing neurons, helping to keep your brain fit and, eventually, creating smooth paths that correspond to skillful grasp of your discipline—similar to the forest-clearing metaphor that Waitzkin uses.)

**As you train, you create layers and layers of chunks in your brain**. For example, when learning English, you first learn the letters of the alphabet and their individual sounds. Then you begin chunking those letters to form new sounds, such as “c” and “h” to make “ch.” You begin forming words, then sentences, paragraphs, and so on. Each time you synthesize elements, you create a new chunk in your mind that eventually becomes intuitive.

(Shortform note: Here Waitzkin isn’t clear about the _how_ of integrating so much information—he simply emphasizes the length and intensity of his own labors. This raises the question of explicit versus implicit strategies: Can you systematize the whole learning experience, or does at least part of it have to happen by “osmosis”? Language learning again exemplifies this dichotomy. Some believe that the right method involves workbooks, formal classes, and at-home study; others insist that learning via immersion is superior. With immersion, you rely on your brain to work out the principles and patterns of your skill without conscious effort, as opposed to learning them explicitly.)
