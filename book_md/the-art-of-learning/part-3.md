## Part 3: Advanced Competitive Strategies | Chapter 6: Create Powerful Techniques

With our discussion of Waitzkin’s intermediate techniques complete, we’ll look now at his **strategies for high-level competitive success**. Chapter 6 builds on our discussion of incremental learning in Chapter 2, detailing how to compress your techniques into compact, powerful forms.

We’ll lay out Waitzkin’s steps for **compressing a technique** , which is a way of packing all the power of a technique into a smaller, more subtle form. We’ll then detail three applications—how **to create “flow state” triggers, how to trigger creative inspiration, and how to develop near-instantaneous recovery time.**

### Compress Routines to Create “Triggers”

**An incremental approach enables you to compress the power of a technique into a compact, refined form**. With Waitzkin’s method, you can create an arsenal of powerful, subtle techniques that align with your creative disposition. In addition, you can learn to cycle between rest and readiness with agility.

To do this, Waitzkin explains, you’ll take the feeling of “right form” and gradually compress it while maintaining your connection to that feeling.

Done right, this makes a physical move (like a roundhouse kick) more efficient _and_ more powerful. Compression reduces the visibility of your move (compressed form means less obvious movement) and can maintain or even increase its power.

(Shortform note: Waitzkin doesn’t clearly explain what he means in this section. He discusses taking the “essence” of a technique, but doesn’t clearly define what he means by that. The one-inch punch, as popularized by Bruce Lee, may demonstrate what Waitzkin means: The martial artist concentrates an immense amount of force into a tiny physical movement. Since the one-inch punch comes from Chinese martial arts, like tai chi, this might be the inspiration for Waitzkin’s technique.)

#### Use “Triggers” to Enter “The Zone”

Waitzkin first **applies compression to create “triggers” that activate peak performance states**. Think of this trigger as an on/off switch that instantly activates your competitive spirit.

**You must be able to enter “the zone” whenever the moment demands it, which you can do by creating a trigger** : A condensed routine that switches you into peak performance mode.

(Shortform note: Using triggers to enter the zone is a common tactic in elite athletics. Sports psychologist Patrick Cohn explains that finding and remaining in the zone requires that you achieve an intense, “pinpoint” focus that fully immerses you in the present experience. Similarly to Waitzkin, he recommends using habitual thoughts and mental images to trigger your peak performance state—for example, many elite athletes visualize their performances to rehearse the experience they desire.)

**To access your peak performance state, create a routine that gradually activates it**. Waitzkin suggests doing this by finding an area of your life where you feel naturally in “the zone” and building a sequence of habits that leads up to it. Say you feel your best after a walk in the woods. Take that state and add a few habits before it, like calmly filling a water bottle, taking a moment to stretch, and slipping on your shoes.

(Shortform note: To use this technique, you’ll need to have an activity that gets you into the zone. Not all of us have one, but there are plenty of ways to create one. In _Flow_ , Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi explains that you can find “flow,” which is often associated with “the zone,” through activities like yoga, dance, shared meals, and spending time in nature. Another method is to push at the edge of your current capacities—for example, a rock climber might challenge herself to scale a more difficult wall than usual.)

Now **practice the habits or activities until they're linked** and your body will begin to associate the routine with the state the walk puts you in. Once you've linked the routine to your state, **you can perform the routine to activate that state** whenever you need it.

(Shortform note: Csikszentmihalyi also discusses finding “flow” throughout your everyday life. He gives several criteria for creating flow-state experiences. Typically, such experiences involve deep concentration, a well-defined goal, a tight feedback loop that allows you to adjust your efforts, and a difficulty level that pushes your abilities without causing you to feel out of control. By intentionally setting up conditions like these, you can consciously create flow experiences instead of hoping that they’ll come along naturally.)

#### Compress Your Routine

Next, **maintain the feeling your routine gives you while gradually compressing the actions you take**. So if you were stretching for 10 minutes, reduce it to eight, then six, and so on, until you achieve the same state-shift with less activity.

Eventually, you’ll create a swift, reliable way to "switch on" your peak performance mode. According to Waitzkin, you can compress this further until a single breath, in and out, switches on that state of deep, relaxed focus.

(Shortform note: Sports psychologist Jim Taylor notes that nearly all elite athletes use pre-competition routines to prime themselves for optimal performance. He explains that routines matter because athletes have no control over the circumstances of competition; routines give them control over their own mental and emotional preparedness.)

#### Systematize Creative States

You can also create triggers for creative states. Since your personal style is the biggest asset you bring to high-level competition, Waitzkin argues,**it’s crucial that you can access your creativity on demand**.

Your emotions will arise in competition no matter what. If you’re prepared to channel them into inspiration, **you can achieve creative performances while regulating emotional turbulence** , like stress or frustration. For example, you might create a trigger that uses frustration as fuel to intensify your efforts.

(Shortform note: Though sports psychologists do recognize the importance of emotions in athletic success, they often stop at teaching athletes to _manage_ their emotions. Waitzkin takes it a step further, recommending that we systematize them. This is similar to Tony Robbins’s recommendations about state shifting: He claims that we can consciously control our moods with techniques like empowering rituals, fixing your posture (much like “power posing”), and smiling intentionally.)

**Each of us** , Waitzkin says,**will discover that particular emotions inspire us more than others**. To find these, sit with all your emotions as they arise, experience them mindfully, and then note them down. Over time, you’ll learn which you draw the most creative energy from.

Once you’ve accessed that creative state through introspection, create a routine as we explained in the previous two sections, and link it to that state. Then, compress the routine until you’ve created an effective trigger.

For example, you might link the tranquility of an early morning walk to some breathing exercises, jumping jacks, and a brief meditation. Then, shorten your walk, breathwork, jumping jacks, and meditation until just a brief walk activates that creative state.

(Shortform note: In _The Emotional Body_ , Laura Bond details a method for consciously feeling, expressing, regulating, and shifting between emotions. She implies that we aren’t in tune with our emotions by default—similar to Waitzkin’s argument that it takes time to understand your emotional life. Bond’s methods involve using posture, facial expressions, and mindfulness-based awareness to activate certain emotional states.)

### Build a Rhythm of Exertion and Relaxation

To excel in the long-term, Waitzkin says to **balance effort and rest**. If you have an unbalanced relationship with your energy, it's easy to fall prey to inconsistency. Instead, **develop a sustainable rhythm of exertion and relaxation**. Relaxation is crucial for maintaining your energy, and it leads to better performance when it’s time to focus.

For example, Waitzkin says as a teenager, he would pour ferocious amounts of energy into challenging singular games. Afterward, he'd be too drained to return to that level of performance and would falter throughout the rest of the competition. Later on, he learned how to manage his energy through tai chi and cardiovascular interval training.

(Shortform note: In a 2019 recent interview with Tim Ferriss, Waitzkin said that it’s better to be able to go from a “relaxed zero” to an “intense 10” than to constantly live around a six. In other words, living with constant, moderate tension will keep you drained. On the other hand, learning to oscillate between deep relaxation and intense performance allows you to experience higher highs and more meaningful relaxation. Without one or the other, you can’t consistently access peak performance _or_ real restfulness.)

Waitzkin argues that even short rests increase performance. Specifically, he found that in chess, concentrating in intervals with short breaks more than doubled how long he could think effectively.

Waitzkin advocates cardiovascular interval training, in which you cycle between bouts of sprinting and brief, slower resting periods. For example, you might sprint on a stationary bike at a pace that raises your heart rate to 175 bpm, then lower your intensity to reach a heart rate of 140 bpm or so, and repeat. Over time you aim to lengthen sprints and shorten rests and, one increment at a time, you train your heart to recover more fully in less time. Waitzkin argues that this practice develops the connection between your mind and body.

(Shortform note: The body is full of natural rhythms, and this may explain why interval training works so well. Managing your circadian rhythm, for example, is key to maintaining stable daily energy. The heartbeat is another familiar rhythm, as is our breathing. In the brain, alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta brainwaves all play different roles from heightening our awareness to taking us into deep, relaxed sleep. Rhythm may be a fundamental feature of our reality, as it shows up everywhere from the cosmos to our cells.)
