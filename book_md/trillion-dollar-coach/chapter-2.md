## Chapter 2: Your Title Makes You a Manager, Your People Make You a Leader

Campbell instructed hundreds of CEOs and executives that leadership is not about you; it's about service to the company and more importantly, service to the team you're leading. He felt strongly that being a skilled manager was important, but it wasn’t enough. **Savvy management is critical, but it's ineffective if you don't combine it with caring people skills.**

Chapter 2 outlines management principles that can help you become a better leader.

### You're Not a Leader Unless Your Employees Say So

**The principle:** Don’t demand respect from your employees; earn their respect. No one likes to work for a dictator, but people actually like being managed if they respect their manager, if they think their manager can teach them something, and if their manager helps the team make decisions.

Bill Campbell developed a manifesto called “It's the People.” It states that a company's success is founded on its employees. **A manager's job is to create an environment in which employees can grow, develop, and flourish.** They can do so by giving their employees the information and training they need, and by respecting and trusting them to do their jobs well. If a manager does this, she will automatically build credibility.

Campbell used to tell the executives he coached that they should go to bed each night not thinking about profit margins or budgets, but rather thinking about their employees and how they could make them more successful.

**Supporting research:** Harvard Business School professor Linda Hill authored a 2007 study that showed that a manager's authority has to emerge. The more talented an employee is, the less likely he or she is to simply follow orders from a manager—unless that manager has taken steps to establish their credibility.

Executives often overlook their company's management culture when searching for ways to improve company performance. **But dozens of studies—including an internal study at Google—have proven that teams who rate their managers highly have lower turnover and higher performance.**

**Example:** Bill Campbell worked closely with Steve Jobs at Apple. For all his genius and charisma, Jobs was a disorganized and often temperamental manager, and his beleaguered employees suffered from low morale. In 1985, Apple's board of directors removed him from the company and replaced him with CEO John Sculley. Twelve years later, Jobs returned to Apple, and Campbell saw that he was a changed man—or rather, a changed manager. Jobs was much more thorough and detailed in every aspect of operational leadership—sales, finances, product development, and so on. He paid close attention to what his teams were doing, and his employees came to admire him. And of course, Apple's greatest successes came during Jobs's second tenure at Apple.

### Build Rapport With Friendly Chit-Chat

**The principle:** Good leaders don't just focus on business; they also work at establishing camaraderie in the workplace. Campbell developed a strategy at Google to help team members get to know each other and make everyone feel comfortable speaking up. Instead of jumping right into a meeting agenda, he insisted that meetings start with “trip reports.” Any team member who had been on vacation or traveling for business would share some interesting details about their trip. People who hadn’t been traveling might talk about their weekend activities or their families.

This low-stakes chit-chat at each meeting's start served as an ice-breaker for later in the meeting when decisions needed to be made. Google's CEO Schmidt wanted to hear input from everyone, and since team members were already comfortable chatting with each other, they were more likely to offer feedback.

In lieu of trip reports, you could also start the meeting with other personal, non-business topics like asking every employee to give an update on their children or pets.

**Example:** Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, started her meetings with each team member thanking another member for their contributions during the previous week. Her staff called it “the family prayer.” The only rule was that you couldn't repeat what someone else had said.

### Hold More Effective Meetings

**The principle:** A manager needs to know what information to discuss and in what forum to discuss it. To disseminate information and get input on company decisions, Campbell believed the staff meeting and the one-on-one meeting were the most important tools a leader had.

**Each type of meeting has its own strict purpose.** Staff meetings are big-picture forums for important company-wide problems, opportunities, and decision-making, while one-on-ones are intimate opportunities to help an employee be more effective in their job.

**Example:** GO's founder Jerry Kaplan wanted to discuss GO's competition with Microsoft in a one-on-one meeting with Campbell, who was GO's CEO at the time. But Campbell refused. He insisted that Microsoft’s competition was a big-picture issue. Because it crossed over many company departments and functions, it should be discussed in a team staff meeting, not a one-on-one.

#### Staff Meetings: Focus on the Big Picture

In a staff meeting, teams learn about what other teams are doing, and leaders try to get everyone on the same page. The focus should be on the company's operations and tactics; i.e. how is the current crisis being managed? What are we working toward?

**The leader's responsibility is to make sure the staff meeting is run well.** That means the meeting's content is relevant, and the agenda is on-task and efficient. Every member should be encouraged to speak openly about the issues at stake.

**Supporting research:** A 2013 study shows that staff and team meetings make employees feel engaged, especially if everyone has a voice in the meeting and the meeting time is managed well. Additionally, some companies are choosing to hold “tech-free” staff meetings. Recent studies have shown that when people aren't distracted by texts or emails, participation and interaction increase.

#### One-on-One Meetings: Focus on Individual Performance

A one-on-one meeting between a manager and an employee is much like an executive coaching session. The focus should be on the growth and development of the employee or the "coachee." In a one-on-one, managers should follow a highly structured framework, focusing on the employee's projects, performance, peer relationships, and innovation.

Campbell ran one-on-one coaching meetings with Google CEO Eric Schmidt under a framework that Schmidt calls “Five Words on a White Board.” Campbell would write a top-five list of items he wanted to discuss (one word for each item). Schmidt also wrote a top-five list of items he wanted to discuss. Both men would then simultaneously write their lists on a whiteboard, and if there were overlapping items, those topics would take priority during the one-on-one meeting.

Campbell had a standard framework for every one-on-one meeting:

1\. Friendly chatter about non-business topics like family news or updates on favorite sports teams (as in staff meetings).

2\. Job performance questions, such as:

  * What are you working on?
  * How’s progress on the XYZ project? 
  * Topics such as sales figures, budget numbers, and product milestones. 



3\. Discussion about peer relationships.

  * Campbell believed that our peer interactions are more important than interactions with higher-ups because they have a bigger impact on company cohesiveness. 



4\. Discussion about hiring and leadership.

  * Are good people being hired? 
  * Are you coaching your employees so they can be their best? 
  * Are you getting rid of employees who aren’t improving or progressing? 



5\. Discussion about progress toward innovation.

  * Was the company moving forward with creating new products and technologies? 
  * Was there evidence that the company was staying ahead of the competition?



### Don't Make Decisions by Consensus

**The principle:** A manager's job is to make the best ideas come to light, which should happen through discussion, not consensus. Democracy doesn't work well in business (and neither does dictatorship). Campbell would not allow teams to make decisions by simple all-in-favor voting. He wanted to make sure that all perspectives were considered and thoroughly analyzed by the team before any decision was finalized.

Campbell recommended an “ensemble” approach to decision-making. All team members should put their ideas on the table. (To ensure the ideas were well-thought-out, Campbell often met with individuals prior to the meeting, allowing them to talk through their ideas before presenting them.) **All perspectives should be heard and considered, and then the team should have an open debate about which idea was best.** Heated discussions should be encouraged because dissenting opinions usually lead to better decisions. The best idea should rise to the top as the debate evolves.

If the team can't decide on a best decision, then the manager has to step up, end the debate, and make a decision. **Failure to make a decision can be worse than making a bad decision.**

When decisions are particularly hard—either for the team or the manager—Campbell recommended that the decision-makers reframe the problem in terms of the company's “first principles.” Every company has its own set of foundational principles that are the reason for the company or product. When faced with a tough decision, the leader or manager should always fall back on the company's founding principles.

**Example:** When Brad Smith became CEO of Intuit, Campbell told him that he should let his teams make decisions through organized discussions. He said that 8 out of 10 times, the team would make a good decision on their own, but when they didn't, Smith would have to make the call. Campbell called this the “King Arthur Round Table” decision-making model. Most of the time, the knights can figure it out. When they can't, the king has to make a ruling.

**Supporting research:** Numerous communication studies have shown that when groups try to achieve consensus or make decisions by majority vote, poor decisions are made. “Groupthink” is a common problem—team members may not want to disrupt the team’s progress toward decision-making, so they won't offer a dissenting opinion. Efforts to keep the peace, or not point out possible downsides to a largely popular solution, result in dysfunctional decision-making.

### Control the Talented Genius

**The principle:** Innovation requires out-of-the-box thinking, but the “geniuses” who excel at that require careful management. The high-tech world is famous for cultivating divas—high-performing innovators who are terrible team players. Campbell had a soft spot for these smart but difficult people, whom he called “aberrant geniuses.” Steve Jobs was a great example—certainly a genius, but not easy to get along with. Campbell wanted Jobs-like characters on his teams, but he knew he had to smooth out their rough edges.

Campbell's approach was to overlook the fact that these high achievers' behavior didn't fit neatly into the workplace culture. **He said that aberrant geniuses should be tolerated as long as their actions don’t cross ethical lines, and as long as their value outweighs their cost to the team.** Managers should give a genius autonomy to do what she does best—think outside the box—but make sure she upholds a team-first attitude. The challenge is to get the most value from the genius while not jeopardizing the health of the team.

### Nurture the Innovators

**The principle:** Creating innovative products or services should be the company's primary goal. Campbell believed since this was the core of the company mission, engineers should take the lead in decision-making. Not every creator is an aberrant genius; some are just hardworking engineers or designers who make daily efforts at innovation, and they need latitude to do so. The people who work in sales, marketing, and finance can supply useful information about what customer problems need to be fixed and what opportunities they see, but they should never tell the product teams what exactly to build. Workers who are developing new products should always be given a certain amount of company clout and freedom to create.

### Pay Employees Well

**The principle:** Campbell encouraged the leaders he coached to make sure their employees were well compensated. It wasn’t for the sake of generosity. Campbell believed that compensation has emotional value that is far greater than its economic value. **Paying people well is a way of recognizing an employee’s worth and showing them respect.** Fair compensation inspires them to remain loyal to the company.

### Make Sure Endings Aren't Ugly

**The principle:** Make layoffs and firings dignified. If you have to let people go, do it gently. For the sake of the person who is leaving and also for the team that remains, endings should always take place in the kindest possible way. The firing or layoff should never come as a total surprise to the departing employee or the remaining team. The manager doing the firing or layoff should be kind and generous, celebrate the departing employee's achievements, and treat them well.

**Supporting research:** In the 2014 book _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , author Ben Horowitz notes that firings and layoffs must be handled carefully to preserve the morale of the remaining team as well as the departing employee. Studies show that laid-off employees are greatly affected by how thoroughly their termination is explained to them, and who delivers the bad news.

(Shortform note: For more of Horowitz’s advice on getting through your company’s inevitable hard times, read our summary of The Hard Thing About Hard Things.)

### Manage Your Board of Directors

**The principle:** The CEO is in charge of the board of directors, not the other way around. Campbell served on a number of boards over the years, and he also coached dozens of CEOs. Over time, he developed a series of guidelines on how CEOs could work successfully with their boards.

**During a board meeting, the CEO should always follow his or her own agenda.** That agenda should start with a frank discussion about how the company is doing—bad news as well as good news. Backup reports and numbers should have been sent to the directors ahead of time, so they don't get bogged down in them during the meeting.

Every board member should care deeply about the company and have good expertise to contribute. Members should always be available and willing to get their hands dirty to help the CEO do his or her job. Board members who don't do their homework before meetings or contribute in any useful way should be fired.

**Example:** When Dick Costolo took over as CEO of Twitter, its board consisted of Twitter's founders and venture capitalists. There was no one with direct management experience. Campbell counseled Costolo to bring in more people who could actually help him run the day-to-day operations. He didn't want a board that merely provided oversight; he wanted a collaborative working relationship between Twitter's board and the CEO.
