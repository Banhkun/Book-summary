## Chapter 5: The Power of Love

Love isn't a word that's usually applied to business relationships. Studies have shown that people often view warm and friendly employees as incompetent and workers who are more rigid and stiff as competent. Employees often learn they are rewarded for behaving more like robots than people. They are taught to separate personal emotions from the business environment.

But Campbell believed that the workplace becomes more joyful and teams become more effective when leaders break down the walls between the human persona and the professional persona. Chapter 5 outlines principles that can help bring empathy and compassion into the workplace:

### Care About People's Lives Outside of Work

**The principle:** Humanize your organization and you'll build a stronger team. Most companies tout the idea that they genuinely care about their employees. But many workplaces are dehumanizing, especially if high-performance expectations create a stressful, competitive environment.

**Campbell encouraged executives to talk to their employees about their personal lives, learn about their families, and care about them as people, not just employees.** Campbell practiced this himself and was known for digging far beyond the superficial. He learned everybody's names, their hobbies, and their interests. Instead of saying, “How are the kids?” Campbell would say, “How was Hannah's last soccer game?” and then “Has she started looking at colleges yet?”

Campbell's caring attitude wasn't just for show. When Steve Jobs was dying from cancer, Campbell visited him at home or in the hospital nearly every day. Even though he and Jobs no longer had a business relationship, Campbell prioritized his days around these important visits to his gravely ill colleague. His loyalty to Jobs didn’t end in the workplace; he cared about him as a whole person.

**Supporting research:** Employees who work at organizations where “companionate love” is common—feelings of compassion and caring for others—have higher job satisfaction and more success working in teams. A 2004 study states that compassion at the individual level—a single manager or leader showing compassion toward employees—often translates into compassion at the organizational level. One executive's generosity can legitimize empathy within the entire company.

Additionally, studies have shown that when teams have leaders that care only about achievements, employee engagement and retention are lower, work quality is poor, and business results decline. On the flip side, feeling emotionally supported by colleagues and higher-ups is a stronger predictor of job satisfaction than the work itself.

**Example:** When Ruth Porat was hired as Google's CFO, she had to commute to Silicon Valley from New York. Campbell constantly asked her how her husband was handling the arrangement. He wanted to make sure that not just his CFO was happy, but also her husband.

Another classic Campbell story occurred when Brad Smith was hired at Intuit in 2003. He attended a meet-and-greet to get to know the other company executives. Campbell introduced himself by giving Smith a giant bear hug and saying words along the lines of “Welcome to the team, you SOB.” Smith had just been introduced to Campbell's signature style, which fell far outside the norms of corporate culture: warm hugs and friendly profanity.

The Google executives who authored _Trillion Dollar Coach_ admit they aren't huggers like Campbell—they're more inclined to shake hands. And they don't go as deep into employees' family lives as Campbell did. But they have adopted many of Campbell's habits, like learning people's names, looking at an employee's family photos and learning about their spouses and children, and asking questions about their lives outside of work.

### Do Favors for Others

**The principle:** Be generous with your time, money, and connections. Campbell was fond of doing favors for others. If he could pull a few strings, he would. Businessman Adam Rifkin calls this kind of generosity the “five-minute favor,” as detailed in Adam Grant’s book _Give and Take.**Five-minute favors require very little of the giver but mean an awful lot to the recipient.**_

(Shortform note: To learn more about the benefits of doing five-minute favors, read our summary of Adam Grant’s Give and Take.)

But most of us think of favors differently depending on who the recipient is. A favor for your best friend? Of course you'd do that. But a favor for a colleague at work? Well, you might need to see if it's okay with your boss, or what the human resources department thinks about it. What if other employees think you're doling out special treatment? That's not fair to everybody, right? And so on.

Campbell would say, just do the favor—regardless of company protocol.

### Revere the Founding Risk-Takers

**The principle:** Always respect and protect the founders, the people with the most vision and passion for the company. Running a company is an operational job, but it requires more than bean-counting. It requires vision. **The founders of the company created the vision—the heart that makes the company beat—and they should always be rewarded for that.** They took the huge risk of starting the company, utilizing their passion and courage. They may not have been the best accountants, salespeople, or marketing gurus—and they had to hire others to take on these important roles—but they had the vision. Campbell believed that a company should always revere its founders and keep them engaged in operations in a meaningful way.

**Example:** Campbell was around when John Sculley came in as CEO of Apple. Sculley eventually forced out Steve Jobs, the company's founder. Many years later, Jobs returned to Apple, and he asked Campbell to help him pull the company out of bankruptcy. Campbell knew that Jobs could be a difficult man and had many limitations as a leader, but he also recognized that **Jobs cared about Apple more than anyone else because he founded it.**

**Example:** When Dick Costolo became CEO of Twitter, Campbell instructed him to collaborate with the company's three founders, to work alongside them and not against them. Campbell gently reminded Costolo that although today Costolo was the CEO and they were the founders, at some future time he would be the ex-CEO and they would still be the founders.

### Practice Your People Skills

**The principle:** Caring for your colleagues takes practice. As noted earlier, Campbell was an extrovert who loved people, but not every team leader or manager is wired this way. If you're an introvert, you'll need a lot of practice to develop the level of “people skills” that Campbell was famous for. It may not seem natural at first, but these skills can be learned. Start with small steps: Take a moment to stop and chat with people in the hallway, elevator, or cafeteria. Ask simple, open-ended questions, like “How's that project going?” or “What are you working on?”

Don’t underestimate the significance of small exchanges, like making eye contact when you walk in the office and genuinely asking a coworker how her day is going. **Daily interactions build relationships, which make up the fabric of a company’s culture.**

### Connect People to Each Other

**The principle:** Don't just build teams at work, build community. Campbell was obviously an extrovert who loved people, but he was also a strategist. His goal: to build community. He believed there was power in making long-lasting connections between people both inside and outside of the workplace.

**Supporting research:** Sociologists call this “creating social capital.” By creating strong emotional bonds between people, a community, institution, or company automatically becomes much stronger.

**Example:** Campbell formed a Super Bowl group, a bunch of friends who would travel together to attend the Super Bowl each year, wherever it was held. Occasionally someone would have to cancel at the last minute and he would wind up with extra tickets. He would always give them away to strangers. Campbell's Super Bowl gatherings mattered so much to him that when he was dying, he created an endowment to keep the trips going. He did the same with other trips he and his friends took each year—a golf trip to Cabo San Lucas, a fishing trip to Montana. He was famous for picking up the tab for both large and small events. He even invested his money in an aging sports bar in Palo Alto, which became a popular Friday afternoon hangout for anybody who walked in. Campbell often paid the bar bill for friends and strangers alike.

### Support People Even When They Leave

**The principle:** The team should be a team for life. The highest achievers often feel the loneliest. By being in a position of power, high achievers often feel a sense of separation from others. They may have a big ego from all their successes and achievements, but that is often coupled with big insecurities and fears. They may want to feel appreciated, but there's no one higher up in the company to thank them for their efforts. They don't always know if people want to be their friends because of their position or because they are genuinely loved. When it's time to retire or step away from their positions, they grapple with loss and uncertainty.

**Example:** In 2017, Eric Schmidt announced he was stepping down from the board of Google. Campbell was no longer alive to be his coach and mentor, and his teammates at Google feared that he would struggle with the transition to a new life outside of Google (after 19 years with the company—first as CEO, later as chairman of the board, and still later as board member). So they rallied around him to help create a plan for the next stage in his career. Schmidt didn't make his final exit until 2020, but his team made sure he didn’t walk that road alone.
