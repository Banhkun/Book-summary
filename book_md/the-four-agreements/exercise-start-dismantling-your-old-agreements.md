## Exercise: Start Dismantling Your Old Agreements

Use this exercise to identify specific steps you can take to wipe out some old agreements holding you back.

* * *

Think of a specific self-limiting, fear-based belief you think is holding your back. (You aren’t good at painting. You’re too clumsy to play a sport. You’re too old to take a challenging new job.) What’s yours?

Think of a way to face this fear. What concrete steps can you take? (Buy some paints and go for it. Join a softball team. Take the job and give it a whirl.)
