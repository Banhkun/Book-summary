## Exercise: Don’t Gossip

Being impeccable with your words means speaking with integrity. Let’s think about how gossip fits into this.

* * *

When is a recent time you’ve gossiped about someone, or said something negative about someone behind their back? What did you say, and what motivated you to share that gossip?

How did you feel about that gossip now? Do you think you should have shared the gossip?

If you don’t think you should have gossiped, how could you have stopped yourself from gossiping that time, even if others were participating? Will this help in the future?
