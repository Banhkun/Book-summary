## Chapter 7: The New Dream

It’s time to take the messages of the Four Agreements forward. You now have the beginning of a new understanding for how you can live your life: a new dream.

You have the tools to create your own version of heaven in your life, using a new set of eyes to visualize a happy life. In this new life:

  * You have no fear of being judged, and you don’t judge others.
  * There’s no fear of being rejected, so you can keep an open heart.
  * You are free to take risks.
  * You are free to find enjoyment in life.
  * There’s no more confusion and “fog” stopping you from seeing your possibilities.
  * You are aware that love is all around you.



We now know that the world is beautiful and wonderful. Life can be easy when you love the way you’re living.

We have a choice: Suffer our destiny, or enjoy our destiny.
