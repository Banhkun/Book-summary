## Exercise: Examining the Fallout From Assumptions

Use this exercise to reflect on how assumptions can hurt you and others.

* * *

Think about a time you made a way-off-base assumption that turned out to be wrong. What was the assumption you made?

What problems resulted because of your assumption? For example, you might have behaved differently or said something you didnâ€™t mean.

If you were to go back to that time, how could you have clarified the situation to find the truth? (Remember: Ask questions and communicate.)
