## Chapter 1: Domestication of Humans

So how did humans get in such a predicament? Toltec wisdom explains how we got stuck conforming to society’s rules and stunting our true selves.

We all have individual, personal dreams. But those who came before us created a bigger dream – the “dream of the planet.” This dream created everything we see as normal in our existence: family, community, city, and the world. It encompasses laws, religion, cultures, and all of society’s rules.

Our parents are the first to teach us about this outside dream. As we grow, school, the media, churches, and other aspects of our environment hook our attention and tell us what proper behavior is.

  * We’re told what is right and wrong. 
  * We’re told how to behave, what is acceptable, and what to believe. 
  * We learn a specific language that wasn’t our choice. 
  * We didn’t choose our own names, yet our name becomes a core part of our identity.



All these rules and understandings of how the world works, everything we accept as true, is an **agreement**. We agree what’s good and what’s bad. We agree to a religion or a set of beliefs. We agree what constitutes proper behavior.

When we accept an agreement, we believe it unconditionally. Our belief systems and our personalities are made up of thousands of these little agreements. We surrender to these beliefs.

We are born into this system of beliefs – this societal dream – through no choice of our own. We’ve been exposed to it for so long that we can’t fathom living or thinking any different way.

**Domestication of Humans**

The process of surrendering to these outside beliefs is called “**the domestication of humans**.”

As children, through this domestication process, we’re trained just like dogs. We’re rewarded for doing what Mom and Dad want us to do. We’re punished when we go against the rules. We fear punishment, but moreso we fear being rejected and not being good enough.

In this process we become someone different from our natural selves. We lose our normal, innate tendencies in this process of domestication. This is why adults behave differently than kids – adults are more efficient and productive perhaps, but also less joyful, inquisitive, and free.

At a certain point we become our own domesticators. We don’t even need an authority to threaten or punish us. Our belief system – the **Book of Law** – rules our minds. The Book of Law consists of all the agreements we’ve accepted as truth.

Despite its limitations, the Book of Law makes us feel safe. It’s our understanding of how the world works, and it represents order in a world of chaos. We may not have chosen these agreements, but we _agreed_ to them. And they don’t change easily – challenging our own beliefs takes courage.

**Judge and Victim**

The agreements we’ve accepted create an inner **Judge** and inner **Victim**.

  * The inner Judge continuously criticizes ourselves – our actions and qualities – based on a belief system we never chose. The Judge is unrelenting and unfair – it continuously creates guilt for mistakes and keeps doling out punishments.
  * The inner Victim receives all this judgment and experiences continuous blame, shame and guilt. 



There is no true justice in this system. True justice would be paying for a mistake once and moving on. But our inner Judge creates guilt, a continuous punisher, so we pay for our failings over and over again.

This inner turmoil is the cause of a lot of inner tension, and it spills into the outside world through our behavior. (For instance, because of some internal conflict, you can lash out at someone who doesn’t deserve it.)

And we too may judge other people – we make our family and colleagues pay for the same mistake over and over when we find them guilty.

**Mitote**

The **outside dream** – the world – is full of unpleasantness, drama, violence, fear, war and injustice. Fear and false beliefs control the outside dream.

Because we’re integrated strongly into this outside dream, our personal dream is also ruled by fear. The agreements and beliefs we store in our heads stop us from seeing the truth – that justice, beauty, joy, and freedom can be our personal dream

This inability to see the truth is a **fog of perception** the Toltecs called a **mitote**. The mitote clouds our vision, so we can’t see who we really are. We can’t see that we’re not free. We create an image of who we should be in order to be liked, loved and good enough. But this image isn’t real.

We even harm ourselves to be accepted by others. (Think of the teenager who takes drugs or starves herself to be accepted, or of someone who stays in an abusive relationship.) When we accept self-abuse, we learn to tolerate abuse from others because of an inner belief: “I deserve it.” A false image of perfection makes us reject ourselves and others.

**Prelude to a New Dream**

We have tons of agreements with the outside world, but the most important are the internal ones we have with ourselves – telling us who we are and what we can do. These internal agreements create and limit our reality.

If we want a life of joy, **we must break these harmful agreements that promote suffering and failure.** We must **adopt four new agreements** to replace the old, harmful ones.

In this book summary we’ll cover each of the new agreements in detail, and then talk about how to dismantle the old agreements.

These four agreements will give us the tools to create a healthy, positive new dream.
