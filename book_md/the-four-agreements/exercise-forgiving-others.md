## Exercise: Forgiving Others

Let go of old resentments

* * *

Think of a person who has wronged you. What did this person do or say that is still sticking with you today?

How does your anger toward this person affect you today? (Does it stop you from doing what you want to do? Does it affect your other relationships?)

Think about how youâ€™d feel if you forgave this person. (Reflect on the Second Agreement: it was about them, not about you). How would letting go of your hurt and anger change you?
