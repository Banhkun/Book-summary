## Chapter 3: At Your Meeting—Selling Techniques

Once you’ve gotten an appointment, the next step is the actual sales meeting. In this chapter, we’ll discuss techniques to make your presentation as effective as possible.

  1. We’ll begin by examining the **different buyer types** you’ll encounter so you can adjust your presentation to each. 
  2. We’ll discuss a few ways you can **open your presentation** that will set you up for a successful closing.
  3. We’ll examine the **“show, tell, ask” presentation format** that will make your sales meetings more effective.
  4. We’ll discuss how you can have a **meaningful conversation** to draw out your customer’s needs.
  5. We’ll discuss a few **additional presentation methods** that will increase your prospect’s desire to buy. 
  6. Finally, we’ll explore several different ways you can **close a sale**. 



### 1\. Know Your Buyer

To really nail a presentation, you’ll have to tailor it to each particular prospect you speak with. Everyone responds differently to information and questions, and if you can figure out how to best engage each person, answering their particular needs, you’ll have a much higher success rate.

There are six common types of customers, with an approximate percentage of the buyers in each category. (You’ll note these numbers don’t add up to 100 percent, but keep in mind these are approximate numbers just to give you a rough idea):

  1. **The Reluctant Customer:** About 5 percent of customers are suspicious, cynical, and chronically uninterested. This type of buyer will generally focus on the aspect of a pitch that she finds negative and will never move off of that topic; she’s unlikely to ever say “yes” to a proposal, so don’t spend a lot of time with her. Extricate yourself as politely as you can, and look for someone else more open to your message.
  2. **The Certain Customer:** About 5 percent of your buyers will be the exact opposite of the reluctant buyer: They’ll know exactly what features and benefits they need and what price they’re prepared to pay. When meeting with a _certain_ _customer_ , sell her exactly what she’s looking for—if you try to oversell her when she’s not interested, she’s going to be put off, and you may lose the sale entirely. You can give her additional information, but expect her to know her limits and stick to them.
  3. **The Analytical Customer:** About 25 percent of your buyers will fall into this category. These buyers move slowly to be sure they make the right decision. They love details and want you to prove everything you claim on paper. Don’t rush this buyer. Be methodical, go over details thoroughly, and take time to fully answer each question. 
  4. **The Relationship Customer:** Another 25 percent of your buyers will prioritize being liked and getting along with people. This type of buyer wants to build a relationship with you before committing to a purchase. She needs time to make a decision and values the opinions of others highly when evaluating products or services. When dealing with a relationship customer, slow down and ask a lot of questions. Talk about other customers who have been happy with your products or services. You may need more than one meeting to close the sale. 
  5. **The Directive Customer:** Another 25 percent of your buyers will be directive customers, who are task-oriented. This buyer is busy, businesslike, and practical. She is laser-focused on the benefits your product can provide and doesn't care about building a warm relationship with you personally. When dealing with a directive customer, don’t bother with small talk, and don’t go into details on background information, like how your product was developed. Focus on the bottom line: exactly how your product can help her. Get right to the point so she doesn’t feel you’re wasting her time. 
  6. **The Social Customer:** About 25 percent of your customers will be social customers, who are gregarious and extroverted. You’ll often find this type of buyer in fields that involve a high degree of integration between teams of people—supervisors, project managers, orchestra conductors, and senior executives of large firms. When dealing with a social buyer, expect her to be talkative and friendly, and be positive and open in return. If she agrees to a purchase, be sure to get it in writing immediately—this type of buyer is prone to forgetting commitments soon after she makes them.



You may benefit from having several versions of your presentation that you’ve practiced and can switch into at the drop of a hat, so that when you detect you’re dealing with a certain type of buyer, you can immediately pivot to using a presentation suited to their personality style.

### 2\. Open Strongly

No matter which type of customer you’re dealing with, you need to have a strong opening to your presentation. An ideal opening will plant the seeds for a strong closing, giving you a much higher percentage of successful sales. We’ll look at two techniques in particular.

  * The “fair exchange” opening
  * The “qualifier” opening



Each of these gets your customer to agree to give you an answer at the end of your presentation, preventing her from putting you off with a vague “I’ll have to think about it.”

#### The Fair Exchange Opening

With this opening, you propose a _fair exchange_ : “The only thing I’d like to do today is show you why so many others in your industry have purchased this product and rave about it. **All I ask is that you take a look at what I’m going to show you, think it over with an open mind, and at the end of our conversation, let me know if you think it applies to your situation.** Does that sound fair?”

This technique does two things: First, it hints that other people have high opinions of your product, which appeals to the prospect’s desire for social approval that we discussed earlier.

Second, it allows you to remind your prospect at the end of the presentation that she agreed to give you an answer. If she says, “I have to think about it,” you can say, “I appreciate that, but you did promise to tell me if my product would or wouldn’t help your situation.”

You can further follow up by saying, “After what we discussed, it seems that my product answers your needs perfectly—unless there’s something I’m not understanding properly.” This kind of a statement will snap your customer out of her vagueness, and compel her to give you a reason for her hesitation. Once you have a specific objection, you can discuss it.

#### The Qualifier Opening

With the _qualifier_ opening, you begin the meeting with a question that both emphasizes the primary benefit of your product and also _qualifies_ your prospect, or evaluates whether or not she’s able to make a purchase. For example, “If I show you the smartest investment on the market, are you able to invest $10,000?” If your prospect replies that she is not able to invest that much right now, you can follow up with a lower number: “Would you be able to invest $6,000?”

**This question changes the focus from, “Let me show you something” to “Are you capable of reaping these benefits?”** It makes her try to qualify herself, and it gives you the ability to force your prospect to make a decision at the end of your meeting. She can’t say she has to discuss your proposal with someone else because she’s already admitted she can commit.

You can also use this opening to weed out non-serious buyers. For example, if you ask your prospect if she is able to commit to purchasing a car after she’s test driven a few, and she tells you that she just bought a new car that she’s happy with, then you know not to spend any more time on trying to convince her of your product.

### 3\. Show, Tell, Ask

Another technique to keep your prospect engaged is the _show-tell-ask_ structure. This is a simple but effective format for a presentation. **Essentially, you _show_ the prospect a feature, _tell_ her how she would benefit, and _ask_ follow-up questions.** For example, if you were selling software, you could show her one of the programs loaded onto a computer, tell her how her sales will go up because of it, and ask, “How could you see this being helpful in your business?”

#### Show

Within the “show” piece of this structure, be sure to introduce features one at a time. This is the difference between top salespeople and bottom salespeople: Top salespeople will go through features one at a time and make sure that the customer understands each one and has a chance to ask questions along the way. Mediocre salespeople will excitedly run through a string of features and will end up overwhelming their prospect. When this happens, a prospect has no choice but to say, “I’ll have to think it over,” which means you've lost the deal.

#### Tell

Within the “tell” piece of this structure, you can use this additional three-part structure: **“Because of (feature)… You can (benefit)… Which means (relevance)…”** With this structure, you link the product _feature_ to its _benefit,_ and then make it _relevant_ to the customer. For example, if you were selling a flat-screen television, you might say, “Because of the pixel technology (feature), you can view the screen from any angle (benefit), which means when you have a party, everyone can enjoy the game (relevance).

#### Ask

Within the “ask” piece of this structure, **use logic to press your case.** While customers make decisions emotionally, as we’ve previously discussed, they also like to feel their rational needs are being addressed. Ask a series of questions that build upon one another to lead your prospect to the logical conclusion that buying your product is the right choice. For example, if you’re selling sales training programs, you might ask:

  * “Are your most motivated salespeople the highest-performing ones or the lowest-performing ones?” 
  * “Wouldn’t you agree that people are most motivated when they feel competent and confident they can get the results they want?”
  * “We’ve found that when we train a sales team with our techniques, their sales immediately go up, and once they see the results, they become even more motivated to work harder. Does that make sense to you?” 



#### Questions Hold Your Customer’s Attention

One powerful benefit of the show-tell-ask technique is that it keeps your prospect’s attention. Research shows that an average adult has an attention span that lasts for only about three sentences before her focus starts to wander. If you’re peppering your prospect with a string of statements, she’ll start to think about something else. If you break up your statements with frequent questions, her focus will be continually drawn back to you.

### 4\. Have a Conversation With Your Customer

During your meeting, you’ll need to engage in a conversation that allows your customer to open up and tell you what she’s looking for. In doing so, you’ll need to:

  * Position yourself as trustworthy.
  * Ask questions.
  * Emphasize your product or service’s key benefits.



We’ll explore each of these concepts in the following sections.

#### Position Yourself as Trustworthy

To encourage a conversation in which your customer feels comfortable discussing her needs and listening to your solutions, you’ll need to come across as trustworthy. **The best way to seem trustworthy is to position yourself as a friend or advisor rather than a salesperson.** Focus on _helping_ her rather than _selling_ your product. This makes her feel your meeting is about her, not you, and dramatically reduces the likelihood of rejection.

It’s also crucial that you come across as honest, or your customer will reject you immediately. Therefore, don’t oversell the benefits of your product, but instead explain simply and truthfully how your product or service can help her.

#### Ask Questions

**To encourage an open conversation, ask questions.** People love to talk about themselves, so let them. More often than not, if you let a customer talk, she’ll reveal to you what would convince her to make a sale. Asking questions has several advantages:

  * **Asking questions puts the spotlight on the customer,** which is where it should be. Again, people like to be the center of attention, and keeping the focus of the conversation on your customer rather than on you or your products keeps her happy and makes her feel her needs are central. It increases the likelihood of a sale. 
  * **Asking questions puts you in the driver’s seat**. In general, in any dynamic between two people, the person who asks the questions is in control of the conversation, directing the topics and the flow, and the person responding is in the less dominant position. If your customer asks a question of you, you can regain control of the conversation by saying, “That’s a great question. Can I ask you something first?” 



Three guidelines for asking questions are:

  * **Ask open-ended questions:** questions beginning with words like _what, when, how, where_ , and _why_ , that can’t be answered with a simple _yes_ or _no_. Examples of good questions might be:
    * “How have you been managing this procedure up to now?”
    * “How has that been working out?”
    * “What would you like to see happen in the future?”
    * “What’s one thing you’d need to know in order to move ahead with our product?”
  * **Allow for pauses:** This might seem awkward at first (most people are uncomfortable with silences in conversation), but giving your customer space to digest and reflect will convey a pressure-free interaction, making the customer feel more in command and therefore more likely to say yes to your sale—nobody likes to feel pressured into a sale, so the more you can create a relaxed atmosphere, the more likely you are to be successful. 
  * **Make your customer feel heard:** Lean forward, nod, and smile. Don’t interrupt. Make her feel comfortable and safe opening up to you.



#### Emphasize Your Offering’s Key Benefits

When a customer buys a product or a service, she’s actually buying a benefit—a solution to a problem or a need—and not a specific item. She cares only about how your product will help her or her business. Accordingly, **when opening a conversation with a potential customer, state your idea’s benefit up front.** Anything else—a description of your product, or an endorsement of your service—makes your presentation about _you_ , not _her_ , and will put her off.

It’s critical that you focus your presentation on the benefits she values _most,_ and minimize your focus on benefits she doesn’t care as much about. The 80/20 rule we referred to earlier applies to benefits as well as to sales success: 80 percent of sales will be based on the 20 percent of benefits that are most important to a customer; the rest of the benefits won’t matter to her. If you spend too much time talking about benefits that are lower on her priority list, you may lose the sale, as she may end up feeling that you don’t fully understand her.

In addition to identifying the key benefits your customer is looking for, **identify the key objection that will make her hesitate.** Every customer has one primary reason that will prevent her from buying. Your job is to direct her focus to the key benefits and make her feel they outweigh her key objection.

##### Focus on What It _Does_ , Not on What It _Is_

A benefit is how a product or service meets a need. Therefore, **underscore what your product _does_ rather than what it _is_. **Your customer won’t care that, for example, your payroll system is built with XYZ software—she wants to know how it will make her payroll process easier and therefore save her time and money: what it will _do_.

Keep in mind that companies are most concerned with profits, so show how your product or service can increase profits either by increasing revenues or cutting costs—or both. Within that overall guideline, there are slight differences in what might matter most to certain types of businesspeople. Consider what type of customer you’re dealing with when framing your offer’s benefits.

  * Entrepreneurs and small businesses are interested in sales, cash flow, communicating to customers, and the logistics of delivering their products efficiently. They’re not as interested in the nitty-gritty internal details of their operations.
  * Retail businesses are generally only concerned with net profits. 
  * Larger businesses are interested in products that help boost productivity, cut costs, or increase cash flow. 



Overall, a business customer of any size wants to know three things:

  1. Will this product or service pay for itself?
  2. How long will it take to pay for itself?
  3. How can I be sure that it will?



##### Don’t Focus on Quality

Many salespeople devote a lot of time convincing a customer of the _quality_ of their product. However, most people assume products work properly or they wouldn’t make it to market, and therefore, they are often not impressed with boasts about quality.

Usually, quality is less important to a customer than basic utility. For example, if she’s looking for a car that will get her reliably to work every day with decent fuel efficiency, she won’t be interested in the exceedingly high quality of a Ferrari.

You should focus on quality only in two situations:

  1. Your product is of higher quality than a competitor’s _and yours has a lower price._
  2. Your product’s quality has direct benefits that will matter. If this is the case, directly link your product’s quality to the benefit your customer will get from it. For example, if someone needs a snowmobile that won’t break down in Alaska and leave them stranded in the frozen tundra, quality clearly matters in this case, and you should emphasize the benefit of it. 



##### Position It as an Advancement

**Position your idea as an improvement over something already known.** Most people are wary of something completely new and different, as it’s a risk: It might not work, and the customer might find she’s wasted her money. It’s usually better to show how your product is an advancement of existing technology or ideas, so your customer feels secure that it will do what it promises.

### 5\. Additional Presentation Methods

As you make your presentation, some additional techniques will continually grab your prospect’s attention and increase her desire to buy:

  * **Get your prospect involved:** When you make your prospect actively involved in your meeting, she’ll be more naturally invested. A person who simply sits passively and unresponsively is unlikely to buy your product. In addition to drawing her in with questions, get her physically involved by handing her materials and then taking them back or asking her to calculate a number. 
  * **Use visual aids:** People respond to visual cues. They’re more likely to pay attention to something you show them than to something you tell them. Make your materials colorful and interesting. 
  * **Create mental pictures:** Again, people respond to visual cues, and you can appeal to this tendency by painting mental pictures for them, which can place your customer in an appealing psychological state. For example, when selling a car, you might say, “You’ll love how this car handles the mountains.” Your customer will instantly be transported mentally to the mountains and will imagine driving past forests and lakes. The emotion she’ll feel because of this mental picture will bring her closer to a sale. 
  * **Talk past the sale:** When you _talk past the sale_ , you talk as if the customer already owns the product you’re selling. This taps her subconscious and gets her to visualize owning the product. This is a great method to use in conjunction with the previous method, creating a mental picture. For example, when showing a prospect a house, you might say, “You’re going to love this neighborhood. Quiet and peaceful but walking distance to downtown. It’s a great choice!”



### 6\. Close Effectively

By the time you arrive at the close of your presentation, you should have prepared your prospect to be receptive to your request for the sale by setting up her expectations with a strong opening and by increasing her desire with a focus on benefits.

It’s important to close as soon as your prospect is ready. Watch for this readiness as you go through your presentation. Often, a salesperson will actually delay—and sometimes lose—a sale because she doesn't ask for it soon enough based on her customer’s cues.

#### Close With a Hot-Button Issue

Now that you’ve had an open conversation, you should have identified the _hot-button issue_ : the issue that your customer cares about over every other issue. If your previous questions haven’t revealed the hot-button issue by this point, you can very often discover it by asking a hypothetical question along the lines of, “If you were going to buy this product now or at any time in the future, what would cause you to do so?” Making it hypothetical often inspires the customer to reveal what would convince her to move forward with the sale.

Once you know her hot-button issue, continue to press it, over and over. Make the entire decision revolve around that issue.

#### Assume the Sale

As soon as you’ve identified your prospect’s hot-button issue and gotten her to agree that your product addresses it, assume she agrees to the sale and act accordingly. In other words, **force your customer to stop the sale from going through rather than wait for her to ask for the sale to happen.** For example, after she agrees that your product can help her double her sales, take out an order sheet and start filling it out. Often, a prospect will not stop you: They agree with your assessment and just need a little push to keep the momentum going.

#### Use a Trial Close

With the _trial close_ method, check in with your prospect at several points in your presentation to make sure you are on the right track and to test for your prospect’s readiness to close. For example, you might ask, “Does this make sense so far?” or “Would this improve your current system?” You can refer to a specific benefit to make it even stronger: “This copy machine will make 140 copies a minute. Would this be important to you?”

The benefit of the trial close is that it allows you to adjust your presentation in real time if your prospect indicates she isn’t connecting to the particular feature you’re discussing. For example, if you ask, “Would producing 140 copies a minute be important to you?” and she tells you that it wouldn’t because her department never makes that many copies at a time, then you can pivot to highlight a different feature with a different benefit.

#### Differentiate Between Tangible and Intangible Sales

You will need different closing methods depending on the type of product or service you’re selling. In general, tangible products require different closes than intangible products, and each type of product works on a different closing schedule.

Tangible products, like clothing or furniture, are faster sales, and you can expect in many cases to close a sale after your first meeting. At the end of a meeting about a tangible product, you are well within your rights to (politely) point out to your prospect that by now she knows everything there is to know about the product and there’s no reason to delay making a decision. This works in your favor because when a customer asks for more time to “think it over,” she typically forgets about the sale fairly quickly, loses her desire to make the purchase, and you’ve generally lost the opportunity.

On the other hand, intangible products, like investment opportunities, often involve more of a long-term commitment from the prospect and may require several meetings—the first to establish a relationship and gather information as to what your prospect needs, and the next to come back with additional information and even a specific proposal.
