## Exercise: Educate Yourself

Before you can tap into the full potential of your creativity, you need as much information as possible about your _product_ , your _market_ , and your _competition_. Get specific and do a full analysis:

* * *

What are the five to 10 best features of your product, the ones that most customers prioritize? What might be some that your customers are overlooking that you might be able to feature as well?

What qualities do most of your customers share? Are there any shared qualities you never noticed before? How could you appeal to those qualities when discussing your product’s benefits?

Why does a customer buy your product from a competitor? What benefits do competitors offer that you don’t? How might you approach that difference and frame it for your customers?
