## Exercise: Set Personal Goals

Your sales goals ultimately serve your personal goals; the reason you sell is to earn money to fund your life outside of work—your family, your hobbies, and your vacations. Having greater clarity on what you want to do with your earnings helps motivate you. The longer your list, the more motivated you’ll be.

* * *

Start making a list of everything you’d like to purchase and everything you’d like to experience in the next week, month, year, and decade. Start by naming 15-20 things.

Examine your list. Which items are the most important to you? How much would it cost to buy or do that thing? How much would you have to sell to be able to afford it?
