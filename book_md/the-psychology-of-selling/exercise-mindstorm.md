## Exercise: Mindstorm

After you’ve fully educated yourself and thought through every aspect of your product and market, you can _mindstorm_ to spark your creativity and inspire ideas.

* * *

Write down your biggest goal or most challenging sales problem, in the form of a question.

Write out 20 answers to that question. Write them in first person, present tense: “I call five more people every day.”

Choose one idea that you can implement immediately. How can you start working on this right away?
