## August-December 1943

In the second part of 1943, the war continued approaching the hidden families, and tensions continued rising in the annex.

### August-September 1943

**Outside of the Annex, the air raids over Amsterdam grew more frequent. The gunfire was constant and jarring.** While Anne tried not to let them affect her, not everyone was quite as strong. For example, Mrs. van Daan would run into her husband’s arms and sob as the sirens went off.

**In addition to the stresses of occupation, some of the residents’ helpers continued to experience serious health issues.** Mr. Voskuijl’s cancer caused his health to deteriorate quickly, and Mr. Kleiman’s intestinal issues continued to intensify. Even Bep, a relatively healthy young woman, felt overwhelmed at the number of errands she had to run while avoiding detection and had a nervous breakdown as a result.

In the warehouse, some of the employees began to grow curious about the Annex and its contents. The helpers would constantly make excuses to keep people from investigating and were extra cautious when visiting the residents. For example, Mr. Kugler once snuck up to the Annex through a set of back stairs after telling his employees he was going to the drugstore. He tried to leave through the main door, but an employee was hanging around the office space. He ended up having to sneak down the back stairs in his socks to avoid detection because his shoes made too much noise.

**Inside of the Annex, Dussel’s rapport with his fellow residents continued deteriorating.** From throwing a fit over losing their radio to stating that the English were idiots for not destroying Italy in its entirety, people began to grow tired of his attitude. Though he would apologize and swear to be “better,” the residents no longer believed his hollow promises.

Anne began to stop speaking as frequently as she had in the past. She recognized that the more she kept to herself, the less annoyed she would get with other people and vice versa. **However, despite trying to stay away from the fighting, Anne developed severe anxiety and depression.** She used valerian drops to try to ease her mental woes, but they didn’t do much. She said that laughter would be the best medicine, but that there wasn’t much to laugh and smile about in the Annex.

#### A Typical Day

**At 6:45 AM, an alarm clock would ring through the Annex.** The residents would quickly bathe and use the restroom before the office staff arrived. They could use the water before anyone had shown up for work. However, once the first employee had arrived, they’d have to wait until a number of people had started, as the noise of the running water would arouse suspicion if there were only one or two employees in the warehouse. From 8:30 AM to 9:00 AM, the residents would sit silently and read or study. At 9:00 AM, breakfast was served. After breakfast, the residents would get to the task of peeling potatoes as a group in preparation for the rest of the meals for the day. After this, they’d return to their separate corners until lunch.

**At 12:30 PM, employees would leave for lunch.** At this time, the residents would get to work doing louder tasks such as vacuuming. At 12:45 PM, the residents would be joined by some of their helpers, and they would all listen to the BBC broadcast for the mid-day news. At 1:15 PM, food was served, and the residents and helpers would eat until 1:45 PM. After lunch, the residents would return to silence until about 5:30 PM.

**At 5:30 PM, Bep would come into the Annex to let the residents know that the workers had gone home for the evening.** At this time, the residents (Mrs. van Daan, in particular) would begin to ask Bep to bring them a variety of things from the outside world. At 5:45 PM, Bep would leave, and the residents would venture down to the offices. Mr. van Daan would comb through the mail, Peter would play with the warehouse cat, Otto would take the typewriter from the office, and Margot would look for a quiet place to work.

**Once dinner was ready, the residents would sit down to eat.** Anne described the typical dinner experience:

  * Mr. van Daan was always served first and would readily give his opinions on whatever was being discussed. He was always up for a debate and would give competent arguments.
  * Mrs. van Daan would often complain that she wasn’t given enough food, but she was able to have her pick of the best or tastiest food on the table. When talking, she’d offer advice to her fellow residents (though this advice was rarely wanted).
  * Peter would eat as much as he possibly could and would rarely speak. He never seemed completely satiated but didn’t complain about his hunger.
  * Margot would pick at her food and didn’t talk. She’d eat very little and only ate fruits and vegetables.
  * Edith would eat a substantial amount and enjoyed contributing to the conversation at the table.
  * Otto made sure that everyone else was served before he was and would put his own needs aside for the other residents.
  * Dussel would take large portions, stare at his food, and stay silent. He believed that the only thing people should talk about at the dinner table is food. He wouldn’t engage with social or political conversations during dinner. 
  * Bep would often eat with the residents. She would always finish everything on her plate and was a cheerful presence at the table. 



**At 9:00 PM, the residents would begin preparing for bed by pulling out beds and adjusting the furniture.** Once the beds were set, Anne would bathe in the bathroom and go through her nightly hygiene routine. At 10:00 PM, Anne would set up the blackout curtains and lie down for bed. At 11:30 PM, Dussel would come to bed after finishing up his nightly studies. At around 3 AM, Anne would often get up to use the restroom using the can under her bed.

While this routine was followed Monday-Saturday,**the residents’ Sunday routine was a bit different.** Most of the residents slept in until 9:30 AM (with the exception of Dussel, who got up at 8 AM). At 10:15 AM, everyone began emerging from their quarters. Because no one worked in the warehouse or neighboring buildings on Sunday, the residents enjoyed the freedom to make noise and use the restroom without consequence.

(Shortform note: The information regarding the residents’ Sunday routine is from Anne’s entry on February 20, 1944. It has been included here for the sake of cohesion.)

#### Shortform Note: The War

**Following Mussolini’s removal, Italy banned the Fascist Party and issued a full surrender to the Allied forces.** The Allies landed in mainland Italy and used the region as a foothold to push against the German forces. Though the Italian government had officially surrendered, the Germans still occupied much of Northern Italy. They helped Mussolini escape and pushed against the Allied front.

The German forces began to run low on resources. In Amsterdam, they began to take down monuments and church bells to melt down into raw materials for tanks, guns, and other wartime necessities.

### October-December 1943

As the year came to an end, the residents of the Annex prepared for their second winter. **Though illness and constant fighting plagued morale, the holidays provided a brief reprieve from the stress of isolation and hiding.** This glimmer of hope prompted the residents to be more relaxed with their rules and restrictions. While this gave them a taste of “normal” life again, it also put them at risk of possible detection.

#### Mental and Physical Wellbeing

**As the winter months began, Anne’s depression and anxiety got worse.** She desperately wanted to go outside and live a normal life. Her surroundings felt suffocating, but she knew there was no alternative to their current living conditions. She also knew that they could be found or killed at any moment. The combination of constant fear and crippling loneliness led Anne to lose her appetite and sleep for significant periods of time. She said that sleep made the days go by faster and the fear less impactful.

**However, as she began to sleep more, she started having nightmares.** In one recurring dream, Anne would see her classmate, Hanneli, dressed in rags and crying out in desperation. She’d ask Anne to save her, but Anne never could. She could only stand by and watch Hanneli and others suffer horrific deaths. Anne felt immense guilt at the way she’d treated Hanneli while they were in school and prayed to God to save her former classmate from her torment. In later dreams, Hanneli was joined by Anne’s grandmother.

As the residents began celebrating the holidays, Anne compared their life to the non-Jews outside of the Annex. Anne longed to see other people her age and play outside in the fresh air. While she tried to suppress her emotions, her sadness and desperation rose to the surface and fueled her depression.

**In addition to her mental and emotional stresses, Anne also fell ill with the flu.** She was in bed for days and couldn’t stop coughing. She had a fever and had to rely on a variety of home remedies. Fortunately, she made a full recovery.

On top of her illness, Anne also lost a cherished possession: her fountain pen. She had been given the fountain pen as a gift when she was nine and had used it to write her diary entries and do her schoolwork. However, in November, the pen went missing. After searching for a while, Anne determined that it fell into the stove and burned away.

#### Fighting in the Annex

**In October, the van Daans ran out of funds and could no longer afford to give their helpers money to pay for supplies.** Mr. and Mrs. van Daan had constant fights about their financial state and often disagreed on how to handle their lack of funds. Mrs. van Daan believed that the company should cover all of their expenses. Mr. van Daan, on the other hand, knew this wasn’t reasonable and suggested they start selling valuable belongings such as Mrs. van Daan’s fur coat. Their fights were frequent and aggressive but always ended with reconciliation and terms of endearment.

In addition to financial arguments, **the van Daans constantly fought with Dussel.** Dussel would often insult Mrs. van Daan by attacking her sense and intelligence, and Mr. van Daan would step in to protect his wife. The conflicts got so bad that Dussel and the van Daans refused to speak to one another for a period of time.

**Anne and her family also fought more frequently as their time in isolation continued.** She longed for her father’s approval and became more critical of her mother’s behavior. She respected her father and wanted him to respect her back. On the other hand, she knew that she and her mother were opposites and wanted to distance herself from the constant friction.

Anne became jealous of the relationship Margot had with their parents because they treated Margot like an adult while they treated Anne like a child. This led to more frequent fights with Margot, whom she didn’t often clash with prior to their time in the Annex. Her insecurities rose to the surface in many of these fights, and she began to blame herself for the arguments.

One day, Margot was reading a book that Anne was interested in. When Margot put it down for a while, Anne picked it up and began to read. When Margot asked for it back, Anne said that she wanted to read it for a while. Both Edith and Otto scolded Anne for taking her sister’s book and demanded that she give it back. Anne saw this as an attack as no one took her side in the disagreement. She expected that from her mother, but she was upset that her father didn’t come to her aid.

**On top of everything, the distribution of food became problematic.** The Franks accused the van Daans of keeping food from the rest of the residents. They were frying fewer potatoes for the group and weren’t giving out oils and meat fairly. Fortunately, around the holidays, the conflicts calmed down. The residents celebrated both St. Nicholas Day and Hanukkah. They gave each other presents and managed to get some additional food and treats for the celebrations.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**During this time, the war was at a standstill.** While some operations were carried out, neither side made significant advances. Because of this, many in hiding started to lose hope for a quick resolution to the global conflict.
