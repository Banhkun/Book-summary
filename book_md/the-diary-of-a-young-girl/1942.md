## 1942

**_The Diary of a Young Girl_ is one of the most acclaimed works of the 20th century.** Written by Anne Frank from 1942 to 1944, the diary reveals the humanity of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis during their occupation of the Netherlands. The diary was preserved by Anne’s friend, Miep Gies, and shared for publication by her father, Otto Frank, after the war.

**In 1942, Anne Frank described the Nazi’s occupation of Amsterdam, the life she lived before hiding, her family’s move into a secret Annex, and her feelings about her new environment.** Anne received a diary as a gift for her 13th birthday. She loved the gift and began to confide in it almost immediately.

She believed that her diary had more patience than her friends, and that she would be able to share her deepest secrets without fear of judgment or abandonment. Because she saw the diary as a “friend,” she decided to give it a name: Kitty. She addressed most of her entries as if she was writing to “Kitty” and wrote as though she was speaking to a close friend.

(Shortform note: To give context to the events described in the diary, we’ve included some historical information about WWII at the end of each chapter.)

### June-August 1942

Anne was the daughter of Otto and Edith Frank and had a 15-year old sister named Margot. Anne was born in 1929 and lived in Frankfurt, Germany until she was four. As anti-Semitism grew in Germany, the Franks moved to Holland to escape persecution. She was enrolled in a Montessori school and moved to the Jewish Lyceum after 6th grade.

**In 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands. In 1942, they implemented strict anti-Jewish restrictions, including:**

  * Jews must wear a yellow star at all times.
  * Jews can’t be on the streets between 8 PM and 6 AM.
  * Jews can’t go to theaters or any other form of entertainment.
  * Jews can’t use bicycles, cars, or streetcars.
  * Jews can only go shopping between 3-5 PM.
  * Jews can’t take part in public athletic activities.
  * Jews can’t visit Christians in their homes.



**Despite these overwhelming restrictions, Anne lived a relatively normal life before going into hiding.** She went to school and had friends. In her diary, she talks about her ever-changing relationships with her classmates and the youthful frustrations of an average 13-year old girl. These frustrations included deciding who her best friend was and figuring out which boys liked her. Her restrictions impeded her at times (she couldn’t go to the movies with her friends and had to walk everywhere), but she kept her focus on her schoolwork and classmates.

As the summer progressed, a boy named Hello began to take an interest in Anne, and he would talk with her on her walk to school. Though the pair began to talk more frequently, Hello’s grandmother thought that Anne was too young for him and tried to get him to date another girl. Hello didn’t like this idea and went behind his grandparents’ backs to see Anne and meet her family. However, Anne wasn’t interested in a romantic relationship with Hello. While she was flattered by the attention, she was in love with a boy named Peter Schiff. Though she and Peter had never talked about loving each other, Anne was convinced that she was going to marry him.

Having taken their final exams, she and her classmates were anxiously waiting to hear who got promoted to the next grade level, and who would have to stay back. As she waited for the results, Anne reflected on her past year in class. She and her teachers got along pretty well, though Anne had a tendency to talk too much in class. She was once given multiple assignments by a teacher as a direct result of her constant chatter.

In the beginning of July, Anne got her final results back. She had done alright, but she was disappointed with some of her final grades. Though she was promoted, she wanted to be an excellent student, not just an average one. Her desire to excel came from insecurities that stemmed from the fact that she had been accepted to the Jewish Lyceum because the Nazis required Jewish students to attend Jewish schools, not because of her own educational merits. She felt the need to prove that she belonged there.

#### Moving Into the Annex

**A few days after receiving her final marks, Anne’s life turned upside down.** Her sister, Margot, told her that their father had received a call-up from the SS, a Nazi paramilitary force. Receiving a call-up almost always meant being sent to a concentration camp. Margot told Anne that they were figuring out if they could move into a hiding space they’d been preparing and that another family (the van Daans) would be joining them.

Throughout the day, Anne and Margot were on edge as preparations began. **At this time, Margot revealed that the SS call-up was meant for her, not for her father.** Anne was shocked at the revelation that the Germans were separating 16-year old girls from their families. The pair began to pack as they waited for their parents to tell them the next step.

The family slept in their home one last time that night, then woke up early the next morning to move to their hiding place. They wore multiple layers of clothing as they couldn’t carry suitcases without arousing suspicion and left in a hurry. As they walked to their new home, Anne’s parents began to slowly reveal the plan to their daughters. They explained that they had been preparing to hide in a secret Annex located in Otto’s office, but hadn’t planned to have to do so for another ten days.

**Fortunately, Mr. Kleiman and Mr. Kugler (Otto’s business associates) were able to bring them in early.** In addition to the two businessmen, a few family friends were informed of their move into hiding: Jan, Miep, Bep, and Mr. Voskuijl. These people were going to help the Franks and van Daans during their time in the hiding.

The Annex had previously been used as a laboratory for Mr. Kugler. It was originally hidden away behind a series of doors and offices. After a few weeks, a bookshelf was installed in front of the door to further hide it from workers and police. The Annex was three stories and contained multiple small bedrooms, a kitchen/dining area, and a bathroom. Though the space wasn’t large enough to ensure total privacy, the residents had enough space to be on their own if they needed to be. The residents also used a private office in the building, but that office could only be used after hours as it wasn’t directly connected to the Annex and could be accessed by Mr. Kleiman and Mr. Kugler’s employees.

After arriving in the Annex, the Franks immediately began unpacking boxes they had sent in advance and got to work covering windows to avoid detection. They had to move quietly as the Annex shared walls with two other companies, and any sound could lead to dire consequences. Margot and Edith had to take significant breaks because they were overwhelmed by their new environment, but Anne and Otto worked consistently.

**Even within the first few days, tensions inside the Annex began to rise**. Anne was frustrated because she felt her mother treated Margot better than she treated her. For example, Margot broke the vacuum and was immediately forgiven, but Anne asked to simply write down something on a shopping list and was yelled at for it. This caused Anne to cry and question whether anyone would ever truly understand her. She felt the closest to her father, but she felt that even he would usually side with Margot and her mother.

The van Daans arrived about a week after the Franks. They told the Franks that they had helped spread the lie that the Franks had fled the country to ensure that no one was looking for them. The family consisted of three people: Mr. van Daan, Mrs. van Daan, and their son Peter van Daan. Anne didn’t like them at first. She constantly fought with Mr. and Mrs. van Daan, who thought Anne had a bad attitude, and she thought that Peter was obnoxious.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**The Dutch forces surrendered to Nazi forces following the Battle of Rotterdam in 1940.** The Dutch Royal Family and high-ranking government officials fled to London while the Germans put their own governing body in place. Throughout the beginning of the occupation, the Dutch people didn’t fight back. In fact, they experienced an economic boom as they exported weapons and supplies to Germany.

However, in 1941, this changed when the Russians began to defeat the Nazis in the East. Desperate for resources, the Germans began to force Dutch citizens to work for them and demanded supplies be sent back to Germany for free. In addition to the persecution of all Dutch citizens,**the Nazis upped their efforts to find and remove Jewish citizens through increased anti-Semitic legislation and increased deportation rates to concentration camps.**

### September-October 1942

**To keep busy while in hiding, each resident focused on education and/or hobbies.** Almost everyone read and looked forward to receiving new books from their outside helpers. The children all received educational material and were required to study. The courses the children worked on included math, history, and languages.

In their daily lives, certain tasks had to be addressed creatively. For instance, bathing became difficult because they didn’t have a bathtub. When it was someone’s turn to bathe, they’d fill a washtub with hot water from the office, then carry the tub to a location in the Annex based on their comfortability and modesty. For example, Peter would bathe in the office after the employees had left despite the glass windows and door. He would just inform the other residents not to walk by for half an hour. Mr. van Daan, on the other hand, would fill the tub and carry it all the way up to his room to protect his privacy.

**Anne constantly dreamed of freedom.** She wanted to go outside and be around people again. In one example, she imagined herself and her father escaping to Switzerland and going shopping. She listed all of the things that she would buy and even set a budget for herself.

#### Rising Tensions

**A variety of conflicts and scenarios led to immediate tension within the Annex.** Some were personality-related, while others were isolated incidents. Regardless, the close quarters and the inability to escape led to constant frustration and arguments.

**For Anne, her mother was one person she constantly found herself in conflict with.** She believed that her mother didn’t understand her and thought that she went out of her way to shame her. Anne’s mother would often tell her that she was foolish and arrogant. For example, one time, they were talking about the proper term to refer to maids and domestic helpers. When Anne disagreed with her mother, her mother proceeded to tell Anne that she wasn’t a lady and that she spent too much time thinking about the future. The only time Anne believed that her mother was on her side was when they fought with Mrs. van Daan.

**Mrs. van Daan was a constant source of conflict for everyone in the Annex.** She and her husband would have intense screaming matches, she would try to flirt with Otto, and she and Edith constantly disagreed about how the makeshift home should be run. Mrs. van Daan also took it upon herself to constantly criticize Anne’s assertive and “un-ladylike” behavior. These constant critiques began to make Anne feel insecure.

According to Anne, Mrs. van Daan was melodramatic and always had to be the center of attention but wasn’t the best at defending her statements. She would sometimes leave conversations if she wasn’t getting her way. She constantly complained and committed petty actions that hindered the rest of the residents. For example, she would sometimes leave food to spoil on dishes instead of cleaning it to call people out for leaving messes.

In an example of an isolated incident, Peter found a book the adults had kept away from the children. The book had to do with women, and the adults didn’t want the children reading books written for an adult audience. However, Peter’s curiosity got the best of him. He went behind his parents’ backs to read the book. Mr. and Mrs. van Daan caught him and punished him for his disobedience. Initially, Peter refused to apologize and stayed in his room in the loft. However, after a few days of sulking, things returned to normal. At the time, Anne didn’t like Peter’s behavior and often referred to him as awkward and insolent.

**While Anne had issues with many of the other residents in the Annex, she always turned to her father for support.** She believed that he understood her, even if he felt obligated to side with the adults on certain matters. She couldn’t envision a world without him and loved him more than she loved her mother. She felt like he would actually listen to her despite her age.

#### External Threats

**In addition to the constant disagreements inside of the Annex, the residents in hiding constantly worried about being discovered.** Whenever someone was in the office or warehouse, the residents had to remain silent and calculate every action. Sometimes, these were expected visits such as a plumber coming to fix pipes in the office building. Other times, however, these were unexpected scares that caused fear to spike.

For example, Mr. Kleiman and Mr. Kugler once had a worker come in to fill the fire extinguishers, but he failed to tell the Annex residents. When the man started working, tensions rose and no one moved. A few minutes after the noise began, everything went silent. After a few minutes, someone began yanking and knocking on the bookshelf leading to the Annex. The residents thought that they had been discovered, but it turned out that it was just Mr. Kleiman. He told them that the hook holding the door had gotten stuck, which was why he had been unable to get in to warn them about the worker.

**A combination of the internal conflicts and the fear of discovery took its toll on Anne’s emotional well-being.** With the constant criticism, she began wondering if she actually was as terrible as all of the adults in the Annex said that she was. She felt torn because she knew that she was supposed to smile and take the abuse, but she wanted nothing more than to defend herself and speak out.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**As 1942 continued, the Nazis began intensifying their search for Jewish citizens.** Jews were being herded into cattle cars and sent away to concentration camps by the thousands. They would often be given nothing to eat or drink and would have their heads shaved, regardless of gender. The living conditions were miserable, and many were being sent to the gas chambers to die.

Even non-Jewish citizens were feeling the impact of war. Dutch men were being sent to Germany to work for the Nazis in factories. If they tried to escape, they’d be killed. In addition, if the Germans were searching for an anti-Nazi saboteur, they’d pull random citizens from the street and threaten to kill them if one of them didn’t give them information. They’d line them up against the wall and kill them one by. The German media called these “fatal accidents.”

### November-December 1942

**In the Annex, food supply was a crucial part of survival.** The residents received bread from a friend of Mr. Klieman and purchased ration books on the black market. They also canned food and purchased 300 pounds of beans to ensure they had food that wouldn’t spoil. In a close call turned humorous moment, Peter was moving a sack of beans when the seams tore and the beans fell everywhere. The noise was deafening, and, for a moment, Anne worried about the noise it made. Once they knew they were safe, they all shared a good laugh and got to cleaning the floor.

The residents of the Annex celebrated their first Hanukkah and St. Nicholas Day in hiding. They were given small presents such as dolls, ashtrays, and bookends courtesy of their helpers. In addition to the gifts, they received extra portions of food, including meat and butter. Mr. van Daan, who had been in the meat business, got to work preparing the meat to make bratwursts and sausages. This activity intrigued all of the residents of the Annex, and they hypnotically watched him work.

#### Mr. Dussel

**In early November, the residents of the Annex decided to bring in a new member.** As reports of persecution grew more intense, Mr. Kugler and Mr. Kleiman agreed to bring in Albert Dussel, a local dentist. Dussel moved in in mid-November. The residents of the Annex welcomed him with coffee and cognac. He was stunned to see the Franks as he had heard word of their escape. They explained their ruse and brought him up to speed with the rules of the Annex.

Once they talked him through the rules, they began to ask Dussel for updates on the outside world. He revealed that many of their friends had been taken to concentration camps. He told them that the Nazis had intensified their efforts to find Jewish people and began taking entire families out of their homes. As Anne heard these stories, she began to feel guilty for her own security in the Annex. She questioned why she should be able to hide in safety while so many others were suffering at the hands of the Germans.

In addition to news, Dussel also brought along his dental tools. He agreed to remove cavities and help with dental hygiene. His first patient, Mrs. van Daan, didn’t take well to his operation and began flailing around as he worked. This led to one of the tools getting stuck in her tooth and Dussel having to forcibly remove the tool to continue the operation.

At first, Anne took a liking to Dussel. She thought he was nice and selfless. He was a bit slow to learn the rules, but she thought this was because he needed time to adapt to the new environment. **However, her opinion of him quickly began to change as he turned out to be more selfish and strict than Anne originally thought.**

Because she had to share a room with him, she was the first to see his true personality. He’d constantly correct Anne and admonish her for her behavior. He also kept a rigid schedule and would get angry if anyone bothered him when he tried to go about his day. While Anne thought about acting out in revenge, she figured it would only end with more trouble for her.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**The Nazi’s violence towards the Jews continued to escalate.** They began going door-to-door searching for Jewish families and offered bounties to anyone who gave up the locations of Jewish citizens. Military vehicles patrolled the streets at night and Jewish citizens (including women and children) were beaten and forced to march to the trains to be transported to camps.

In November, the British forces had a few successful campaigns in Africa while the Russian forces managed to hold Stalingrad against German attacks. These victories gave the Dutch people hope for eventual liberation.
