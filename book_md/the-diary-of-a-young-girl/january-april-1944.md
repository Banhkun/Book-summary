## January-April 1944

1944 marked a change for Anne. **In her diary entries, she began discussing changes in her body as she hit puberty, as well as new perspectives on life in the Annex, the relationships with her fellow residents, and her future after the war.** Though fights and conflicts continued in the Annex, Anne tried not to focus on them. She recognized that she was already feeling lonely and depressed and that putting energy into the fights just made her more upset.

### January-February 1944

**As Anne entered a new year, she yearned to return to normal life.** She received movie magazines as a way to connect to the world outside of the Annex and began to practice dancing for when the war was over. She also began to take an interest in her family’s heritage and studied it when she wasn’t working on schoolwork.

She spent time reflecting on her life before the Annex. Before going into hiding, Anne didn’t think about “serious things” very often. She fought much harder for the approval of her family and allowed her emotions to dictate her behavior. While she recognized that she still had a lot of growing up to do, she noted the ways in which she had matured and the ways in which life in the Annex had impacted her development.

#### New Perspectives and Thoughts

**Anne’s perspective on her parents began to change.** In January, she went through old diary entries and admitted that she had been harsh in her depiction of her mother. She believed that she lacked respect for her mother because she treated Anne and Margot more like friends than children. For example, when Anne would be upset or cry, her mother tended to poke fun at her emotions rather than provide support and guidance. Once, when Anne was younger, her mother had laughed at her when she got upset about not being able to join her and Margot for a trip to the store. Though the incident was relatively trivial, it left a mark on Anne.

Anne believed that her parents had married out of convenience. She didn’t believe that her father loved her mother initially. In fact, she believed that he asked her to marry him because he thought that she’d make a good wife. While she did maintain the “wifely duties” expected of women at the time, Anne believed that her mother was never truly happy because she knew that she’d never have all of her husband’s affection. Anne tried to have sympathy for her mother but had a hard time because of her mother’s critical views of Anne and her behavior.

**Anne’s perspective of Mrs. van Daan also changed.** While Anne initially had a lot of problems with Mrs. van Daan, she began to appreciate and respect her as she got older. She realized that a lot of the issues she had with Mrs. van Daan came from her family’s biased perspective. Where she used to take her family’s side during arguments, she wanted to start coming to her own conclusions by trying to see things from the other side. While she recognized that Mrs. van Daan was far from perfect, Anne wasn’t as frustrated with her behavior as she started to realize that the Franks had their part to play in many of the quarrels with the van Daans.

**With all of these new ideas and perspectives, Anne quickly grew bored with the stories her fellow residents would tell.** She wanted to have new experiences and hear different perspectives. Instead, she was stuck hearing the same jokes and tales from the past over and over again. The only people that gave her some reprieve from the repetition were the helpers of the Annex. They’d report back about their experiences outside of the Annex. These stories ranged from casual run-ins with old friends to watching Nazi soldiers brutalize citizens. Though the stories could be morbid, they reminded Anne that there was a world outside of the Annex walls.

#### Puberty and Boys

**In the early months of the year, Anne began to notice changes in her body and emotions.** She had her first period and began to take an interest in sex and love. She expressed interest in both men and women, saying that female nudes made her excited and that she desired to be in a relationship with a man. She read books about puberty and talked about her desire to explore her body as well as others’. In one example, she talked about an experience she had with another female student before going into hiding. The two kissed and Anne asked to touch her breasts. She expressed her desire to have an intimate connection again.

**As she continued to reflect on her desire for intimacy, she thought back to her first love: Peter Schiff (Peter S.).** Peter S. was a bit older than Anne and spent time with her for a summer. However, after summer vacation, Peter S. stopped hanging around Anne and began to spend time with girls his own age. This hurt Anne, and, though she thought she had gotten over him, she discovered that she still had intense feelings for him. She dreamed about him and wished that he were with her.

##### Confiding in Peter

**As her loneliness grew, Anne decided to confide in Peter van Daan.** Though initially he was an outlet for Anne to vent to, she began to take an actual liking to him. She described the warm feeling she got looking into his eyes and making him blush. Initially, she insisted that she wasn’t in love with him, but her affections grew the more time she spent with him.

Anne was able to talk to Peter about more “sensitive” topics such as male and female anatomy. For example, Anne wanted to know the sex of the cat in the warehouse. Peter insisted that it was a boy as he had seen the cat’s genitalia. Out of curiosity, Anne asked Peter to show her. They went to the warehouse, and Peter pointed out the cat’s genitals. This prompted Anne to ask Peter some questions about the German terminology for the male genitals. She never thought she could discuss anatomy with a boy, but Peter seemed non-judgmental and comfortable.

**Soon, Peter started to confide in Anne.** She appreciated his honesty and was glad that someone trusted her. For example, after a fight with Dussel, he expressed his frustration at struggling to find the right words when talking to people and his jealousy at Anne’s ability to come up with quick responses. In addition to his frustrations, he also talked to Anne about his dreams and insecurities. He told her that he wanted to go to the Dutch East Indies to work and that he wished he weren’t Jewish because life seemed to be so much easier for non-Jewish people. He suffered from a serious inferiority complex and longed for affection.

As Anne and Peter started to spend significant time together, **Anne started to develop romantic feelings for him.** She talked about him constantly and was upset on days they didn’t speak much. She tried to find excuses to go to his room to talk and began referring to Peter as “him” in her diary. Even his smallest actions had a profound impact on her. For example, she once said that she started glowing after he merely looked at her. She thought about him all of the time and began to dream about him.

**These feelings also brought some insecurity.** These insecurities included:

  * Questioning if he cared about her if he didn’t talk to her much that day 
  * Wondering if Margot had feelings for Peter and vice versa
  * Fearing he was going to stop talking to her one day



Anne tried to stay positive by looking out of a window in the attic and seeing nature. She believed that the best way to keep hope was to be alone in nature and God. For her, the beauty of the sky brought her comfort and joy. She shared these thoughts with Peter and insisted that he should try enjoying nature whenever he was sad or afraid.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**As 1944 began, resistance groups such as Free Netherlands began to expand and offer resources to those in hiding.** In addition to direct attacks on German forces, they’d also provide forged documents, financial support, and hiding spaces for those forced into isolation. This helped persecuted pockets of the population to either escape the country or avoid being sent to concentration camps.

**As the Allies began to make advances towards Holland, underground newspapers began publishing news of potential liberation.** They analyzed different scenarios and how the people could stay safe if the Allied and Axis powers began to battle in Holland. One such scenario included the Germans flooding Amsterdam to slow the approaching forces. The newspapers marked different flood points and suggested that citizens begin to make preparations in the event they needed to swim or row to safety. Anne and her fellow residents discussed a variety of these scenarios and plans to survive should liberation occur.

### March 1944

**In early March, a strange break-in occurred at the warehouse.** Items were missing, but there were no signs of forced entry. The residents concluded that someone had a duplicate key, and the thought of a stranger having access to the offices at all times put those in hiding on edge.

In addition to the increased fear of discovery, **Anne became annoyed with the behavior of the adults in the Annex.** She believed they were behaving selfishly and didn’t consider other people’s feelings when they spoke. For example, Bep once told Edith and Mrs. van Daan that she was having a tough time balancing her life. They responded by telling her that she should think about all of the other people in the world suffering to keep some perspective. Anne thought this behavior was counterproductive and rude.

Anne wanted to be free of her parents’ oversight. She grew more distant from them because they didn’t treat her like an adult or respect her emotions. Whether it was about the books she read or the time she spent with Peter, they constantly asked her questions and challenged her choices.

She believed that she was older mentally and emotionally than other girls her age because of the extreme circumstances she had been through, and she wanted to be treated as an equal rather than a child. Instead, her parents still monitored the books she was allowed to read and expected small affections such as little kisses throughout the day. Anne talked about these issues with Margot, who related to Anne’s frustrations.

**In mid-March, the people who had been supplying food and ration coupons to the residents were arrested.** While the arrested parties were eventually released, the residents were forced to eat rotten food for a while. The stench was so bad that they had to cover their noses with rags to deal with the rancid smell. Each of the adults had a different response to the situation:

  * Mrs. van Daan complained that she now had the near-impossible task of making edible meals with spoiled food and without the use of oils or fats.
  * Mr. van Daan ignored the problems with the food by smoking more frequently and disregarding his wife’s complaints.
  * Edith tried to stay positive. She focused on the fact that everyone was still alive, and that the war was progressing in their favor.
  * Otto wanted everyone to stay calm and optimistic. He didn’t let the food shortage bother him and even set aside some of his rations to donate to Bep.
  * Dussel focused on himself and his problems. He complained frequently and was frustrated the war wasn’t further along.



**As food shortages and arguments plagued the residents, the helpers of the Annex had struggles of their own.** Mr. Kleiman’s stomach issues continued to be a problem, Miep had a nasty case of the flu, and Bep had to take a few days off because of a cold. In addition to the illnesses of the other helpers, Mr. Kugler was called up by the Germans for a work detail and had to visit a doctor to get a medical certificate that excused him from the order. Eventually, Miep and Bep both recovered and returned to their regular roles, but Mr. Kleiman’s health concerns never completely relented.

#### Reflection and Thoughts

**Anne spent a lot of time reflecting on her life before the Annex and the ways in which her experiences in hiding had changed her:**

  * **Prior to hiding, Anne had a carefree childhood and enjoyed the attention of her many admirers.** She got along with her friends and teachers and was spoiled by her parents. She believed that the constant affection made her a bit overconfident, but that she had managed to keep herself grounded.
  * **In the beginning of 1942, Anne was focused on making friends.** She wanted people to have meaningful conversations with. She didn’t think about politics or global events. She was focused on her education and friendships. This changed midway through the year when the family entered hiding. The first few months in the Annex were tumultuous for Anne, as the constant fighting and lack of freedom began to feel suffocating.
  * **The feelings of loneliness continued into the beginning of 1943.** Anne became aware of her faults and shortcomings and felt ignored by her fellow residents. She worked to improve her behavior so that she’d be able to get close to people without them scolding her. This made the second half of 1943 a bit more bearable. The adults in the Annex began to treat her like an adult, and she used writing to work through her feelings instead of acting out. She discovered that she was in control of her own happiness and didn’t have to rely on others for validation. 
  * **Finally, as 1944 began, puberty and a desire for love changed Anne’s perspective on one resident in particular: Peter.** Where she once viewed him as too quiet and shy, she now longed for his attention. She placed a lot of her hope for the future in Peter’s affections and cherished the time she got to spend with him. In addition to her newfound love for Peter, she developed a newfound love for nature. Looking at the natural world made her feel at peace and happy. It allowed her to think about the beauty within herself as well as her place in the grand design of the world. 



**As she got older, Anne thought about sex and the female body more frequently.** She believed that sex shouldn’t be a taboo topic, and that waiting until marriage was a pointless practice. She had figured out the process of sex and menstruation before her parents had “the talk” with her. This annoyed her because she believed that parents should tell their children everything about sex to prevent them from hearing incorrect information from other people. She wondered if Peter knew anything about the female anatomy, and thought about educating him on the topic.

#### Falling in Love

**Peter appreciated Anne’s company.** The van Daans would fight with one another constantly, and these fights had a negative effect on Peter. He was frustrated with his parents' constant bickering. He wanted to be close with his parents, but he didn’t feel like he could trust them. He expressed his feelings to Anne. She appreciated his willingness to share and suggested he talk to Otto for guidance. She felt responsible for his well-being and wanted to protect him from his parents’ quarrels.

He said that her support and optimism helped him when he was struggling. While he did confess that she annoyed him when they first went into hiding, he now enjoyed her company and looked forward to their talks. They talked about their shared distrust of their parents and the ways in which they hid their true emotions from the other residents. Where he would stay silent in uncomfortable situations, she would talk back or use sarcasm.

**Her affections for Peter only continued to grow as he opened up to her.** She finally admitted to herself that she was in love with Peter and continued to pine for his affection. She wanted him to think about her as much as she thought about him, but she feared that she’d push him away if she spent too much time with him.

Her insecurities manifested themselves in dreams in which he’d tell her that he didn’t care about her. These insecurities fueled Anne’s anxiety and sadness. She’d try to hide it around other people, but she felt conflicted and nervous about her relationship with Peter. She was in love with him and wanted to be more than just good friends. She even said that she could see herself marrying him in the future.

Eventually, Peter and Anne became close enough to openly discuss taboo topics such as sex. Anne admitted that she and Margot hadn’t been told much about sex. Peter, on the other hand, knew quite a bit. He told Anne about contraceptives and the process of puberty for boys. Anne never thought that she could have these conversations with someone of the opposite sex.

**As Peter and Anne grew closer, Margot started to become jealous of their relationship.** In a letter, Margot explained that she was upset that she didn’t have a person that she could talk to in the way that Peter and Anne could talk to one another. While she was glad that Anne had found someone to talk to, Margot felt lonely and left out. Anne felt sorry for her sister and assured her that she cared about her. She wanted to be there for Margot and told her to come to her with anything she’d want to discuss.

**Near the end of March, the adults started commenting on the relationship between Peter and Anne.** The van Daans nicknamed Peter’s room “Anne’s second home” and made jokes about an Annex wedding. Edith and Otto worried about Anne going into Peter’s room alone. This concern led Edith to forbid Anne from going into his room to talk because she was afraid that they would act inappropriately. Anne wasn’t willing to give up on Peter easily, and she tried to figure out a way to get around her mother’s restrictions.

#### Shortform Note: The War

**As their occupation continued, desperation took hold of the Dutch people.** Lines for food stretched around city blocks, doctors couldn’t take house calls for fear of being mugged, and thieves took every opportunity to break into homes. Most citizens refused to leave their homes out of fear. These tensions led to increased resistance activity and acts of sabotage against the Germans.

In addition to the BBC and Wehrmacht news broadcasts, air raid announcements began to play through the radio. The residents would sit around their illegal radio for hours and listen to the various programs to gain as much knowledge of the outside world as possible. They’d debate politics and give predictions about the looming invasion of the Allied forces.

**On the war front, the Allies continued to bomb German-occupied cities in the Netherlands.** Anne recalled one such bombing in the city of IJmuiden. The British bombed the city so fiercely, those in Amsterdam could feel the rumbles almost 20 miles away. In addition to pressure from the East, the Russians began to make advances toward the West as they reached the Polish border. Unfortunately, the Nazis didn’t stop their advances. They moved into and occupied Hungary near the end of March. The country housed about a million Jewish people.

### April 1944

**As food became more scarce, the residents began eating in “food cycles.”** A food cycle was a period of time in which they would only eat one type of food. For example, the residents could only get their hands on endives for a while, so they’d eat it at every meal. While they would supplement the dishes with potatoes and beans, the residents grew tired of the lack of variety.

**On April 11, another break-in occurred at the warehouse.** While the residents had grown accustomed to burglaries, this break-in led to the closest call they had experienced to this point. The men of the Annex heard a loud noise and left the Annex to investigate. When they got to the warehouse, they saw the thieves robbing the shop.

Mr. van Daan startled them by crying out, “Police!” The burglars ran and broke down a panel leading outside as they escaped. Mr. van Daan and Peter went down to replace the panel and were seen by two people outside of the warehouse. Afraid that they’d be mistaken for the thieves, Mr. van Daan and Peter ran back to their hiding place and prayed the people outside hadn’t called the police.

For the next few days, the residents sat in silence and hoped the police wouldn’t come to investigate. At one point, they heard the police rattling at the bookshelf. Anne thought that they were about to be dragged out of the Annex by the Gestapo. The shaking stopped, but the residents didn’t dare move or make a sound. When they thought it was safe enough, they called Mr. Kleiman to let him know about what had happened.

Later, Jan and Miep came to the Annex to share information with the residents. They had patched the hole that the burglars had made and shared some information with the police about the break-in. Fortunately, the couple who saw Mr. van Daan and Peter through the hole in the wall were the people providing Mr. Kugler with the potatoes to give to the residents. While they hadn’t been informed of the people in hiding, they’d had their suspicions and decided not to call the police to keep them safe.

**In another close call, Peter forgot to unbolt the front door of the building.** The bolt couldn’t be unlocked from the outside. This forced Mr. Kugler to break into the office through a window and raised some suspicion within the employees. On top of the locked door, many of the residents had opened their windows and the neighboring shops had noticed. Mr. Kugler scolded them for their carelessness and demanded that they be more cautious.

**Following these encounters, the residents enacted some changes in the Annex:**

  * Dussel, who had been using the office at night, could no longer use the office to work. 
  * Peter would patrol the warehouse from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM. 
  * The residents couldn’t open their windows anymore.
  * The bathroom couldn’t be used after rounds were made.
  * A carpenter from the underground resistance made a barricade for the residents.



Dussel hated the new security measures. He wanted the freedom to use the office to do his work and the ability to use the bathroom after a certain time. He threatened to go to Mr. Kugler about the restrictions and often ignored the rules altogether. This led to frequent fights with Mr. van Daan and Otto.

**These close calls reminded Anne of the constant oppression of the Jewish people.** She lamented their persecution and questioned God for allowing them to be attacked. Despite this, she maintained pride in her Jewish heritage and kept faith that God would lift them up one day. In addition to her Jewish identity, Anne expressed interest in becoming Dutch following the war because she had respect for the country and the citizens.

#### Education, Hobbies, and Dreams

In the early months of 1944, Anne had lost interest in education because there was no end to the war in sight. She didn’t see the point in continuing her academic pursuits if she wasn’t going to be in a classroom any time soon. **However, as her anxiety and depression continued to weigh on her, she decided to jump back into her schoolwork.** To her, focusing on schoolwork kept her hopeful for the future and allowed her to ignore the desperation of her current situation. It gave her purpose and helped her dream of a future after the war.

**She discovered that she wanted to be a journalist and writer.** To hone her skills, she wrote short stories and detailed descriptions of the Annex. She wanted to have a career after the war and didn’t want to be just a housewife.

In addition to her schoolwork and writing, Anne also occupied herself with other hobbies. These hobbies included:

  * Researching her family’s heritage
  * Looking through family photographs
  * Studying history and mythology
  * Reading about movie stars



#### Getting Closer to Peter

**Peter and Anne became closer both emotionally and physically.** One day, Peter and Anne shared a kiss and cuddled in the attic. Anne was exhilarated by the development in their relationship. However, she wondered what her parents would think and worried about the scandal that her actions could cause.

As their physical relationship continued to develop, Anne became more comfortable talking to Peter about taboo topics such as female anatomy. She told him about a woman’s breasts and sexual organs. Peter hadn’t known much about a woman’s body and appreciated the lesson.

**Though they grew closer every day, Anne still felt insecure about Peter’s feelings towards her.** She felt as though she always had to chase after him, but she wanted to be desired and pursued. This insecurity made her feel as though she was two different people: one who was confident and brash, and another who was gentle and wanted love. Fortunately, Peter was also feeling tender and enjoyed his time with Anne.

#### Shortform Note: The War

By mid-April, the Russians had taken more than half of the Crimea. The British had reached the city of Cassino but struggled to advance any further. In addition to the advancing ground forces, the Allied forces upped their bombing efforts in German-occupied cities. In Amsterdam, they destroyed the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, and, consequently, all citizens had to get new registration cards to get rations.
