## Exercise: Get Ready to Manage Yourself

Laloux asserts that employee self-management will be an essential part of the next stage of organizational development.

Compare self-management as described in this book to jobs in which you’ve worked under direct supervision.

Do you feel more comfortable managing yourself or receiving direction from others? Describe a situation in which making a crucial decision about your job either caused you stress, made you feel empowered, or both at the same time.

If you were to be completely in charge of your schedule, how would you plan your typical work day? Would you coordinate any of your activities with others?
