## Exercise: Determine Your Businessâ€™s Overriding Purpose

Laloux says that visionary organizations have a defining purpose beyond making profits and providing value for shareholders. This may be true of many organizations that have not yet adopted a visionary mindset.

* * *

Consider an organization that you contribute time to, either as an employee or volunteer. Outside of financial gain, what does that organization hope to accomplish? What tangible effect on the world does it hope to achieve?

Imagine that you founded an organization of your own. What purpose would you hope for it to accomplish? What personal values would you want the organization to embody?
