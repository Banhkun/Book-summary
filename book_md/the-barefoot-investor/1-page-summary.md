## 1-Page Summary

Many people feel helpless when it comes to managing their money. They’re consumed by debt or worry that they'll never be financially secure.

In _The Barefoot Investor_ , Scott Pape offers guidance and a 10-step plan for how to manage your money so that you eliminate debt and build wealth. Though the plan is written for an Australian audience, the basic principles are universally applicable. Pape estimates that in just one year of following the steps in this book, you’ll have your finances in order, and in six years, you’ll have some financial wins under your belt.

### Step 1: Plan a Monthly Date Night to Discuss Finances

For the next five weeks, schedule one night per week as a date night with your spouse to work toward financial improvement. If you’re single, work with a family member or friend or go it alone. For each date, go out to eat at a restaurant—don’t worry about the cost because the steps you’re taking will save you thousands of dollars over time. After the first five weeks, select just one night per month for date night.

#### Date Night #1: Open New Bank Accounts

On this first date night, you’ll open new bank accounts that allow you to avoid banking fees and start directing money toward five different purposes:

  * **Day-to-Day:** basic expenses
  * **Treat:** nonessentials that you enjoy
  * **Happy:** long-term purchases that take time to save for
  * **Fire:** pressing needs, like paying off debt or saving for a home
  * **Backstop:** in case of emergency



You’ll learn more about the purpose of each of these accounts in Step 2.

##### Take Action

  1. **Set up two checking accounts with banks that offer online interfaces and don’t charge fees, including for ATM transactions.** Nickname one account “Day-to-Day” and the other “Treat.” You’ll learn how to use these in Step 2.
  2. **Set up two high-interest savings accounts.** Label one “Happy” and one “Fire.”
  3. **Set up an account at a separate bank that you won’t be tempted to use, called your Backstop account.** Choose a savings account with a high interest rate, and deposit $2,000 in it to start with. 



#### Date Night #2: Get a Better Deal on Your “Super” Fund

On this date, you’ll ensure you’re regularly directing money into a “super” account (Australia’s retirement savings plan) or an equivalent U.S. employer-sponsored plan that isn’t skimming off a large percentage of your deposits.

The Australian government encourages saving for retirement by having employers divert 9.5 percent of an employee’s wages toward their super account. Employees are typically offered a specific super account when they’re hired; U.S. employers offer similar retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s. But if you’re like most employees, you probably haven’t read the fine print—however, you should because you may be losing significant money to fees.

##### Take Action

Opt for a low-cost super or similar retirement savings account. For example, an account that charges 0.02 percent annually versus 1 percent annually can save Australians $226,484 (AUD) over 30 years.

Investigate the annual fee on super(s) by googling the name of the super and “PDS,” or “Product Disclosure Statement.” If you’re being charged more than 0.85 percent per year, choose another super to invest in.

#### Date Night #3: Choose Insurance Wisely

On this date, you’ll scrutinize your insurance choices and take action to support your financial well-being and your family’s.

Here are two pieces of advice to follow when choosing and managing insurance:

  1. **If losing it won’t affect your financial situation, don’t insure it.** For example, if you damage your phone beyond repair, you’ll be able to get a new one without putting yourself at a financial disadvantage, so don’t insure it. 
  2. **Negotiate your annual insurance premiums down.** Companies want to retain your business. If you call them and tell them you’re thinking about switching, they’ll likely be willing to negotiate a better deal for you. 



Australians can purchase insurance for income protection, life, and disability through their super fund. Parents with young children should aim to insure 10 to 12 times their annual income. In Australia, you can do this by calling your super fund and asking for three pieces of information:

  1. A quote on 12 times your annual income for combined life and total permanent disability insurance.
  2. A quote on 75 percent of your annual income until the age you plan to retire.
  3. How much additional money you’ll need to put into your super to cover these new insurances.



### Step 2: Create Your Napkin Plan

In this step, you’ll learn the purpose of each bank account you created in Step 1 and what to do on Date Night #4: Direct money from your take-home pay into each account. Pape calls this the “serviette” or napkin plan because it’s simple enough to write on a paper napkin you might encounter on the date.

#### Date Night #4: Allocate Your Income

Under the napkin plan, you’ll put money from your take-home pay into three main categories:

  * Blow: general spending money
  * Grow: long-term savings
  * Backstop: emergencies



##### Blow

This category consists of money that you’ll spend on a daily basis, as well as savings you’ll put away for longer-term purchases. Each month, you’ll have your take-home pay deposited to your Day-to-Day account. Then, you’ll redirect some of it into your other accounts.

**In general, spend no more than 60 percent of your take-home pay on essentials, like bills, shelter, food, transportation, and insurance.** This will leave you 40 percent to put toward other purposes.

Here’s how it’ll work—set up your Day-to-Day account to automatically direct:

  * **10 percent to your Treat account.** You’ll use your Treat account for treating yourself regularly to whatever you like to buy, from pumpkin spice lattes to clothes.
  * **10 percent to your Happy account.** The money directed to your Happy account (a savings account) allows you to save for bigger expenses that you can’t buy with one paycheck, such as a vacation.
  * **20 percent to your Fire account.** You’ll use the money in this account to deal with “financial fires”—any expenses you want to concentrate a good chunk of money on paying, such as credit card debt or saving for a home. You’ll learn how to prioritize what to focus on throughout this book.



##### Grow

This category consists of your long-term savings: your money for your super, as well as any investments you own, like rental properties or shares. In Steps 6 and 9, you’ll learn more about how to manage this category of savings.

##### Backstop

Backstop is a bank account that holds money separately from the Blow and Grow categories. It is also its own spending category (like Blow and Grow). In Step 1, you created your Backstop account and deposited $2,000 in it, but if you didn’t, find some creative ways to get that money in there, like working overtime or selling some belongings.

#### Take Action

  1. Draw a large circle for each of your categories: Blow, Grow, and Backstop.
  2. Calculate 60 percent of your take-home pay. 
  3. **Calculate your essential costs each month.** If your essential costs total to more than 60 percent of your take-home pay, devise ways to lower your costs.
  4. **Decide what percent of your take-home pay you’ll divert from your Day-to-Day account to your Treat, Happy, and Fire accounts.** Write each account and the money going there inside the Blow circle—for example, “Happy: 10% = $210.”



### Step 3: Get Rid of Debt

In Step 3, you’ll learn how to systematically eliminate your debts, freeing yourself to spend on other things.

#### Date Night #5: Make a Plan to Eliminate Your Debt

Having debt can take an emotional toll. You might feel as though you’ll never be good with money, and climbing out of debt can feel impossible. To regain self-esteem and financial security, Pape advocates systematically paying off your debts and getting rid of your credit cards.

##### Take Action

Follow these steps to pay off your debts one by one:

  1. **List your debts.** List your debts from smallest to greatest.
  2. **Renegotiate your interest rates.** Tell your bank that you’re considering transferring your credit balance to another bank that won’t charge you fees for 18 months. Ask them to renegotiate your interest rate and waive your annual fee.
  3. **Get rid of your credit cards.** Cut them up and post a photo on Barefoot Investor’s Facebook page.
  4. **Pay off your debts one at a time, starting with the smallest.** Use the money from your Fire account to pay off this debt as quickly as possible, while making the minimum payments on your other debts.
  5. **When you pay off a debt, celebrate.** Pape suggests burning your credit card bills with a lighter. Apply the money you _were_ paying on the now paid-off debt toward paying off the next debt on your list.
  6. **Repeat until you’ve paid off all of your debts.**



### Step 4: Increase Your Income

To fill each of your spending buckets—Blow, Grow, and Backstop—quickly, work to increase your income. In this step, you’ll learn three strategies to approach this.

#### Strategy #1: Ace Your Performance Review

Acing your performance review could help you get a raise by showing you have the skills to achieve results. To ace your performance review, take on work you haven’t done before and deliver on it. Set goals for yourself for the next year and ask your bosses for their input at the review session. At your next review, ask for a raise or a promotion into a higher-paid role, aiming for a raise of $5,000 per year.

#### Strategy #2: Transition to Another Career or Freelance

Consider changing careers to do something you’re more passionate about. It takes time to build the skills necessary to change careers or become self-employed as a contractor or freelancer. Here are some tips:

  * **Don’t quit your job outright.** Instead, take on work for free in the field that you’d like to enter, and build up your paid work over time.
  * **Network with people in your new field.** Schedule meetings with them to learn how to succeed and connect with paid work opportunities.



### Step 5: Save Up to Buy a Home

Buying a home is one of the best investments you can make, despite fluctuations in pricing and shifts in the economy. In this step, you’ll learn how to escape common home-buying mistakes and save for a 20 percent downpayment in as little as 20 months.

#### Home Buying Mistakes

Beware of these common mistakes when preparing to buy a home:

  1. **You rent, but don’t save for a downpayment.** Renting often costs less than owning a home due to a lack of maintenance costs, but people often don’t put the difference into savings. Instead, while you rent, save the money that you would put toward maintenance for a downpayment.
  2. **You have a rigid vision of where you want to live.** You might think it’s impossible to own a home because the cost of living in your ideal place of residence is too great. Consider an alternative: living somewhere where you can afford a home, even if it’s not exactly where you’d envisioned. 
  3. **You buy more house than you can afford.** Buying more house than you can afford hampers your ability to pay it off in the long run. For example, this could happen when you save enough for a downpayment, but can’t pay the monthly cost in the long term because you don’t earn enough monthly income. To avoid this, save for a 20 percent downpayment at minimum, and take a smaller loan than the bank offers you.



#### Take Action

In Step 3, you used your Fire account to rid yourself of debts. Now, you’ll use the money you continue to direct there to save for a home.

Ideally, you’re aiming for a 20 percent downpayment so you won’t have to pay for lender’s mortgage insurance, or LMI, which protects the lender against your defaulting. (Shortform note: This is called private mortgage insurance, or PMI, in the U.S.)

Here are the steps:

1\. **Calculate how long it will take you to save for a downpayment.** If you’ve followed the steps, you’re already directing 20 percent of your monthly income toward your Fire account.

Assuming you and your partner each earn the average wage for Australia ($83,445 gross per person) your take-home pay is $5,250 per person, or $10,500 per month together. If you set aside 20 percent of your income toward saving for a home, you’ll have enough for a $100,000 downpayment in four years.

But it’s possible to save a downpayment faster if you save more. For example, if you live off of one person’s wages and put the other person’s wages toward a downpayment, you could save nearly a $100,000 deposit in just 19 months.

2\. **Devise additional ways to save.** Try cutting your rent expenses by living somewhere cheaper, or earn extra income through freelancing, as discussed in Step 4.

3\. **When it’s time to buy, aim for a home where the monthly payment is less than 30 percent of your take-home pay.** Any more, and you run the risk it will be hard to pay off.

### Step 6: Cultivate Your Long-Term Investments

At this point, you’ve gotten rid of your debt and bought a home. Now, you’ll learn how to boost savings for retirement, as well as strategies to invest in stocks and bonds. Without your debts weighing on you, you can now afford to boost your contribution to your super. This money will come from your pre-tax earnings from your employer.

In Australia, as previously explained, the government mandates saving for retirement by requiring employers to divert 9.5 percent of each employee’s pay toward their super fund, but this isn’t sufficient to retire on. The cost of living keeps rising due to inflation, so you’ll need more money to cover the cost of basic expenses in the future. For example, a loaf of bread will cost more when you’re 90 than it does now.

#### Take Action

In Australia, call your super to direct more of your income there, boosting your savings rate to 15 percent. There are three approaches, depending on your income situation:

  1. **If you earn more than $52,697, call your super and arrange to pay additional pre-tax money.** If you’re under 75 years of age, you can claim a tax deduction for contributing additional funds to your super.
  2. **If you earn less than $52,697, call your super and ask to contribute some of your after-tax money.** The Australian government will pay 50 cents for every after-tax dollar you invest in your super. 
  3. **If you’re self-employed, call your super and arrange to pay 15 percent of your pre-tax dollars.**



(Shortform note: In U.S. employer-sponsored plans, you can set or adjust your contribution rate by logging in to the plan’s website. Some employers will match your contribution up to a certain amount.)

#### Invest in Shares

Investing in shares (stocks) is one of the simplest ways to let your money grow for you with little management. The stock market and superannuations (retirement plans) use compound interest—in which your investments earn interest that you then reinvest—to grow your wealth. One of the hardest parts of investing is starting, but compound interest makes it worth it.

##### Take Action

Australians have two options when it comes to investing in shares:

  1. **Invest within super.** Consider a fund that allows you to choose the shares you invest in without having to pay much in maintenance costs.
  2. **Invest outside of super.** You’ll have to use after-tax money. Though investing in shares through super offers a better option from a tax perspective, investing outside of it makes sense if:
     * You want access to the money before you retire.
     * You want to invest in companies that you can’t invest in through super, such as smaller companies



(Shortform note: In the U.S., you can invest in the stock market through your 401(k) or a similar retirement account. If your employer offers the account, you can direct your pre-tax earnings there. Otherwise, you’ll have to use after-tax money.)

### Steps 7-8: Increase Your Financial Security

In Steps 7 and 8, you’ll do two things: Save up three times your monthly living expenses and pay off your monthly mortgage early.

#### Step 7: Save Three Months of Living Expenses

You put $2,000 in your Backstop account in Step 1. Follow these steps to save three months of living expenses:

  1. **Calculate the take-home pay coming into your Day-to-Day account each month.** You’re aiming for a total of triple this amount in your Backstop account.
  2. **Direct the money you put toward Fire into your Backstop account.** Set up a transfer from your Fire account to your Backstop account. If you're already putting 20 percent of your monthly income into your Fire account, you should be able to save triple your living expenses in 15 months, or less if you factor in the $2,000+ that’s already in your Backstop account.



#### Step 8: Pay Off Your Mortgage Early

Due to interest payments, you’ll pay more than the cost of your home over the lifetime of your loan. To limit how much interest you pay over the life of your mortgage, work to pay down your loan faster. Besides saving on interest, you’ll be able to direct the money that was going toward your mortgage elsewhere.

Follow these two steps to pay off your mortgage faster:

  1. **Call your bank and negotiate a lower rate.** Tell the bank that you’re planning to switch to another bank with a lower interest rate unless they give you a 0.5 percent discount. This step is best attempted when you already own 20 percent of your home.
  2. **Direct the money from your Fire account toward your home loan.** You’ll now use the funds from your Fire account to make extra payments toward your mortgage. Use a calculator like the ASIC MoneySmart Mortgage Calculator to calculate how long it’ll take you to pay down your mortgage using the extra payments from your Fire account. People are often able to pay off their mortgage seven years early.



### Steps 9-10: Plan for Retirement

As you approach retirement, you’ll want enough money to retire comfortably, and you may also want to give back to your community in a meaningful way.

The Australian government estimates that people need the following amount of money per year to be able to retire comfortably:

  * Singles: $43,317
  * Couples: $60,997



Here’s how to reach these figures:

1\. **Own your home.** Your mortgage will be completely paid off and you won’t have any debts.

2\. **Save enough money in super:**

  * Singles: $170,000
  * Couples: $250,000



In Australia, when you retire, you’ll be expected to withdraw 5 percent of your super per year, or $12,500 for couples, to start. This amount will increase slightly as you age because the government doesn’t want you hoarding your money.

The previous figures also represent the maximum amount you’re allowed to have in assets— excluding a paid-off home—to qualify for the highest annual government pension, which is:

  * $24,081.20 for singles
  * $36,301.20 for couples



3\. **Continue working.** Just working a day or so per week is plenty to bring in some extra cash. Plus, studies indicate that retirees who continue doing some kind of work have better mental health than their non-working counterparts.

But you don’t need to earn nearly that much to be comfortable. For couples, if each of you only worked one day per week, you’d earn about $300 combined per day of work, for a total of $15,600 per year.

In Australia, if you follow these three steps, you’ll have roughly this amount per year of your retirement:

  * Part-time work: $15,600
  * Super: $12,500
  * Pension: $36,301.20
  * **Total:$64,401.20**



That’s about $3,400 more a year than the government recommends for a comfortable retirement.
