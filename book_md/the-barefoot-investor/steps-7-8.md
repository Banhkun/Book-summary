## Steps 7-8: Increase Your Financial Security

As you learned in Step 1, creating an Backstop account with a different banking institution allows you to save money that you can use in an emergency but that isn’t readily accessible to you most of the time. **In Steps 7 and 8, you’ll greatly increase that amount by saving up three times your monthly living expenses. Also, you’ll pay off your monthly mortgage early.**

These steps will provide you with further financial security by helping you save plenty of money for an emergency and freeing up some of your earnings to be paid toward other expenses or savings.

### Step 7: Save Up Three Times Your Monthly Income

Research shows that having savings is a stronger predictor of happiness than how much money someone earns. Building up the money in your Backstop account will provide financial security to you and your family. For example, if a relative gets sick and you need to travel to see them, or your car breaks down and you need to get it fixed, the money in this account can help you cover the cost without having to dig into your other accounts.

#### Take Action

You put $2,000 in this account in Step 1. Follow these steps to save three months of living expenses:

  1. **Calculate the take-home pay coming into your Day-to-Day account each month.** You’re aiming for a total of triple this amount in your Backstop account.
  2. **Direct the money you put toward Fire into your Backstop account.** Set up an automatic transfer from your Fire account to your Backstop account each payday. If you're already putting 20 percent of your monthly income into your Fire account, you should be able to save triple your living expenses in 15 months, or less if you factor in the $2,000+ that’s already in your Backstop account.



### Step 8: Pay Off Your Mortgage Early

Due to interest payments, you’ll pay more than the cost of your home over the lifetime of your loan. **To limit how much interest you pay over the life of your mortgage, work to pay it off faster. Besides saving on interest, you’ll be able to direct the money that was going toward your mortgage elsewhere.**

The first step is ensuring you don’t get sucked into constantly upgrading your home and remaining perpetually in debt.

#### Avoid the Desire for Another House

Many people yearn to buy things that they think will bring them great enjoyment. When people do this with houses, no house is ever good enough. People may buy one house, and then buy and move to another, and then another, thinking that they’ll land in the perfect home and perfect neighborhood someday. They may take on more debt than they can afford, which can cause stress because money becomes tight and they have to carefully consider every spending opportunity. They may think this is simply the reality of homeownership and wealth-building.

But this isn’t everyone’s reality. **People who successfully build wealth tend to save money, invest in the share market, avoid buying things they can’t afford, and live in modest neighborhoods rather than affluent suburbs.** Instead of constantly pining for the next thing and taking on debts you can’t afford, following the steps in this book will position you to buy a home within your means and, ideally, feel satisfied enough to stay there instead of chasing the next best thing.

#### Take Action

Follow these two steps to pay off your mortgage faster:

  1. **Call your bank and negotiate a lower rate.** Tell the bank that you’re planning to switch to another bank with a lower interest rate unless they give you a 0.5 percent discount. If it doesn’t work, try calling them back a few times. However, this step is best attempted when you already own 20 percent of your home.
  2. **Direct the money from your Fire account toward your home loan.** You’ll now use the funds from this account to put extra payments toward your mortgage. Use a calculator like the ASIC MoneySmart Mortgage Calculator to calculate how long it’ll take you to pay off your mortgage using the extra payments from your Fire account. People are often able to pay their mortgages off seven years early.



> **Dream Home: Mark Gittins’s Story**
> 
> Mark Gittins knew he wanted to live in a home adjacent to a golf course, but in his 20s, he had a poor credit rating and little savings to invest in a home. After he married, he and his wife, Donna, were able to save enough money to buy land for a home adjacent to a golf course. To finance the home building, they took a modest mortgage of $300,000, and worked to keep building costs low. Then, by putting as much money as they could toward the payments, they were able to pay off the home in under nine years.
