## Steps 9-10: Plan for Retirement and Your Legacy

As you live your life, you may wonder about two things:

  1. How to retire comfortably
  2. How to give back to the world in a meaningful way



By following steps of this program, you’re already ahead in preparing for retirement. In Step 9, you'll learn:

  * How much you need to retire and where the money will come from
  * How to save three to five years of living expenses
  * Where to seek financial advice



Then, in Step 10, you’ll consider how you’d like to give back to the world in a meaningful way.

### Step 9: Plan for a Comfortable Retirement

The Australian government estimates that its citizens need the following amount of money each year of retirement to be able to live comfortably:

  * Singles: $43,317
  * Couples: $60,997



Here are the steps to reach those figures:

1\. **Own your home.** When your mortgage is completely paid off and you have no debts, you can direct your money toward other expenses.

2\. **Save enough money in super:**

  * Singles: $170,000
  * Couples: $250,000



In Australia, when you retire, you’re required to withdraw 5 percent of your super per year, or $12,500 for couples, to start. This amount increases slightly as you age because the government doesn’t want you hoarding your money.

These previous figures represent the maximum amount you’re allowed to have in assets—excluding a paid-off home—to qualify for the highest annual pension, which is:

  * $24,081.20 for singles
  * $36,301.20 for couples



(Shortform note: Australian pensions are similar to Social Security in the U.S., except how much an individual receives depends on assets rather than on earnings in their lifetime.)

However, it’s okay if you have more assets than this and don’t qualify for the largest pension. If you follow the book’s steps, before you turn 50, you’ll have a plan in place so that you won’t need to rely on a pension.

3\. **Continue working.** Just working a day or so per week is plenty to bring in some extra cash. Plus, studies indicate that retirees who continue doing some kind of work have better mental health than their non-working counterparts.

The Australian government provides a special perk to encourage you to continue working once you retire—you can earn up to a certain amount without paying income tax:

  * Singles: $32,279
  * Couples: $57,948



But you don’t need to earn nearly that much to be comfortable.**For a couple, if each of you only worked one day per week, you’d earn about $300 per couple per day of work, for a total of $15,600 per year.**

If you follow these three steps, you’ll have roughly this amount per year of your retirement:

  * Part-time work: $15,600
  * Super: $12,500
  * Pension: $36,301.20
  * **Total: $64,401.20**



That’s about $3,400 more than the government recommends for a comfortable retirement.

#### Move Your Backstop Account

In Step 7, you saved three months’ worth of living expenses. But as you approach retirement, you’ll want a bigger safety net. Saving up years’ worth of living expenses will give you financial security once you retire in case the market goes south or other unexpected expenses pop up. **You’ll work to save _three to five years_ of living expenses.** Australians can do this by moving the money from their Backstop account into their super.

Three years before you’re planning to retire, follow these steps to save up:

  1. Call your super and ask them to open a cash account within your fund. 
  2. Move your Backstop money into this account.
  3. Direct the cash going toward your Fire account into this account.
  4. Direct dividends from your super shares into this cash account to replenish your Backstop.



#### Choose Financial Advisors Specific to Your Needs

Though finances can be challenging to understand and manage, Pape doesn’t recommend using a personal financial planner. Financial planners generally skim a fixed percent of your assets, no matter how much money you have. **This is unfair because you’re being charged more for the same service as someone with less in assets.**

If you need financial advice, look to lower-cost options based on your specific needs. Here are some common options:

  1. **Reduce your debt** by working with a nonprofit financial counselor or by calling the Australian National Debt Helpline, 1-800-007-007.
  2. **Plan for your retirement** by calling your super fund and working with one of their financial counselors. After the first appointment, you’ll be charged by the hour rather than an annual fee. 
  3. **Explore long-term care** with Centrelink. Their advisors can help you understand how much it will cost and how it might affect your pension.



#### Leave Directions for Your Family

The passing of a family member is a stressful experience. The family will likely have many tasks at hand, like planning a memorial and following the will of the deceased. **Leaving a folder for your loved ones with helpful resources about your life and finances will spare them some of the stress.**

Create a folder that includes:

  * Your will
  * Banking details, such as account numbers and passwords
  * Insurance details
  * Birth certificates and marriage license
  * List of financial advisors and their contact info
  * Investment account information
  * Account information for social media and email accounts (to be able to close the accounts)
  * Details about what you’d like in your memorial service
  * A letter to your family members (to tell them how much you love them one last time)



Store the folder in a safe deposit box rather than at home. That way, it’s not at risk of getting damaged in an accident.

### Step 10: Plan How You’ll Give Back

When you’re gone, people aren’t going to remember you for the material things you had or the money you made (and beyond $70,000 per year, a higher income won’t make you happier, either). People will remember you for your contribution to the world around you. Deciding how you want to give back will help you cultivate a sense of purpose in your life, which is part of where true happiness comes from.

**Create a plan for how you’ll give back to the world.** Some examples of giving back include:

  * Creating an organization that helps those less fortunate
  * Providing a product or service to the community
  * Donating money to organizations or causes you care about
