## Step 4: Increase Your Income

To fill each of your spending buckets—Blow, Grow, and Backstop—work to increase your income as quickly as possible. In this step, you’ll learn some strategies to do so.

### Strategy #1: Ace Your Performance Review

Acing your performance review could help you get a raise by showing you have the skills to achieve results. It could also help you move into roles that pay more. The best-paying roles tend to involve managing people or selling products.

To ace your performance review, take on work you haven’t done before and deliver on it. Here’s how:

  1. Make notes of the main tasks involved in your job. 
  2. Set ambitious goals for each one.
  3. During your performance review, ask your boss for feedback about your goals.
  4. Over the next year, schedule time to work on your goals a little bit each day. This could include increasing your sales, or facilitating quarterly training sessions for your teammates.
  5. Before your next performance review, prepare new goals and practice showcasing what you’ve achieved in the past year.
  6. At the review, ask for a raise or a promotion into a higher-paid role. Ideally, aim to make an additional $5,000 each year.



### Strategy #2: Transition to Another Career

Getting promoted or getting a raise are great ways to earn income, but they aren’t possible for everyone. You might not feel invested in your company, or even in the type of work you’re doing. Instead, consider changing careers to do something that you’re more passionate about.

It takes time to build the skills necessary to change careers or become self-employed as a contractor or freelancer. Here are some tips:

  * **Don’t quit your job outright.** Instead, take on a side job or work for free in the field that you’d like to enter, and work to build up your paid work over time.
  * **Network with people in your new field.** Schedule meetings with them to learn how to succeed and connect with paid work opportunities.



### Strategy #3: Freelance

Freelancing is a great way to earn extra money. There are two ways to do this:

  1. **Use your existing skills.** For example, if you’re a teacher, you could tutor on the side.
  2. **Or don’t.** If you’re simply interested in a certain line of work, volunteering is a great way to learn the skills associated with that work.



### The Takeaway

No matter which strategy or combination of strategies you choose, doing this will take hard work. You have to be willing to put in the time to see results.

For example, Pape wanted to start a financial advising business, but he didn’t have the writing skills he needed to advise people. For years, he worked 80-hour weeks to practice the skills he needed to shift careers.

> **Recovering from Divorce: Matt Ledger’s Story**
> 
> Matt Ledger got a divorce when he was 54, leaving him with few savings. What little he had left, he put toward helping his daughter finish her last two years of school, which left him with even fewer savings. He also didn’t own a home or have much money saved in super, despite being just a few years away from retirement age.
> 
> Ledger wanted to earn more money so that he could save more. He realized that his job as a real estate agent brought inconsistent income, and he decided to go back to driving road trains. In just a year, he saved $5,700, put $15,000 in Backstop, increased his super contribution, and built a small house. He’s on track to putting $35,000 in savings, $75,000 in Backstop, and having $1 million in super in just five years.
