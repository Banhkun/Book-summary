## Introduction

Many people feel helpless when it comes to managing their money. They’re consumed by debt or worry that they'll never be financially secure.

In _The Barefoot Investor_ , Scott Pape offers 10 steps to manage your money so that you eliminate debt and build wealth. (Shortform note: This book was written for an Australian audience, but some tips are universally applicable. This summary includes comparisons to the U.S. where possible.)

Pape’s process is similar to planting a vegetable garden. First, you’ll plant the seeds for your financial future. Then, you’ll cultivate the plants and make adjustments to help your plants (your finances) grow big and strong. Finally, you’ll reap the rewards (your investments), which will become bigger over time, helping you to provide for yourself and those you care about.

The basic 10 steps are:

1.**Plan a date night once a week for five weeks, then once per month.** You’ll use these to regularly manage your finances.

2.**Create your “napkin” plan.** Write out your basic financial plan on the back of a napkin to keep it simple.

3.**Get rid of debt.** Pay off all of your outstanding debts.

4.**Increase your income.** Bring home additional money to put toward your financial goals.

5\. **Save up to buy a home.** Learn why saving for a home is an important step for your financial future and save for a downpayment.

6.**Cultivate your long-term investments.** Make a plan for investing in your financial future through stocks.

7-8.**Increase your financial security.** Grow savings you can use in case of an emergency and pay off your monthly mortgage early.

9-10**. Plan for retirement and plan your legacy.** Learn how you’ll earn enough to thrive in retirement, and plan how you’ll contribute your time and resources to the world.

(Shortform note: We’ve added an extra step: Step 4, Increase your income. Increasing your income is mentioned in the book in between Step 3 (Get rid of debt) and Step 4 (Save up to buy a home) because earning additional money can help you save and work toward your financial goals faster.)

### Alpacas Versus Groundhogs

When it comes to finances, there are two types of people: groundhogs and alpacas. Groundhogs shy away from the work it takes to make real change in their lives, looking for shortcuts or quick fixes.

Alpacas act purposefully to get what they need and protect their assets, putting in the hard work it takes to see results. The author, who works part-time as a farmer and owned two alpacas, witnessed this behavior in action when his two alpacas protected his flock of sheep from authorities trying to round them up after a brush fire. The author calls this the _alpaca attitude_.

You’ll want to cultivate an alpaca attitude to take control of your finances. To do so, address the insecurities and excuses you harbor about money. Here are some examples:

  * **You feel as though you don’t earn enough money to become wealthy.** It’s not about how much money you earn, but how you save it. This book offers tips to save for a more secure financial future.
  * **You doubt your knowledge about money.** No one is born with knowledge of money. This book will help you learn the basics.
  * **You worry you’re too old to save money or change your financial circumstances.** Though this may feel true, think about how old you are and when you expect to die. Then, calculate how many years left you have to live. Pape estimates that it will take a year to improve your control of your finances and then another five years until you become “financially successful.” Chances are, you have the time necessary to follow the steps and improve your financial future.
  * **You’re concerned that the economy isn’t doing well.** While you may feel trapped by financial circumstances out of your control, entrepreneur and author Peter Diamandis points out that we are living longer, earning more, and paying less for goods and services than ever before. This means we have as good a chance of succeeding financially now as we’ve ever had. 



By cultivating an alpaca attitude and following each of the book’s steps in turn, you’ll set yourself up for financial success.
