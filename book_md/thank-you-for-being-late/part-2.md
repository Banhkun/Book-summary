## Part 2: Three Forces Shaping the World | Chapters 2-3: Moore's Law

According to the author, there are three major forces that shape the world: technology, globalization, and climate change. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 will cover technology, and subsequent chapters in Part 2 will cover globalization and climate change.

**These three forces all interact, and growth in one drives growth in the others, which is part of why the world feels so unstable today—everything’s changing at once.** For example, technology and climate change interacted when the invention of the gas-burning engine contributed to climate change.

### How Did We Get Here?

The author starts his history of technological acceleration with the microchip, the part of a computer that runs the programs and is responsible for memory. Microchips are made of wires and switches called transistors, and the more transistors a microchip has, and the faster electrons move through the transistors to turn them on and off, the more powerful the chip is.

In 1965, _Electronics_ magazine asked Gordon Moore, R&D director of Fairchild Semiconductor (later Intel) to predict what was going to happen in the microchip industry over the next decade. Moore looked at what had happened in the preceding years and noticed **that every year, his company had doubled the processing power of microchips without increasing their cost.**

Gordon predicted that this trend would continue for the next 10 years. He was right—though the industry hit barriers, someone always came up with a new solution in time to meet his deadline.

At the end of the decade, Moore predicted that the doubling would slow to every two years. He was right again. Over the past 50 years, each year, either of two possible ways to double processing occurred:

  * It became possible to halve the size of transistors for the same costs, which resulted in fitting twice as many transistors on the same chip.
  * It became possible to halve the cost while maintaining the same number of transistors.



This phenomenon became known as **Moore’s law, which states that computational processing power will double every two years with only small increases in price.**

While this law was created to address microchips specifically, it can be more broadly applied to technology in general to state that **technological capabilities grow at an exponential rate.** Today, technology is in a place where each doubling is so large, the changes are massive. For example, instead of increasing the space on a floppy disk from 256MB to 512MB, we have self-driving cars.

**When it comes to microchips, though, Moore’s law will eventually hit a wall** because wires and transistors can only get so small. However, there’s still a long way to go until we hit that wall—currently, microchips are the size of fingernails and can hold a billion 14-nanometer transistors, and people already have a pretty good idea for how to manage seven and five nanometers. While microchips aren’t close to their limit yet, the rate of change is slowing—the last two doublings each took two and a half years instead of two years.

Moore’s law applies to all five of the parts that make up computers:

### Part #1: Sensors

**Sensors are devices that recognize environmental factors such as light, pressure, oxygen concentration** —almost any of the things humans recognize using their senses—**and then report this information to a computer via a signal.**

For example, Bigbelly garbage cans are fitted with sensors that can determine when they’re full. Once at capacity, they send a signal to garbage collectors. This saves collectors a lot of time—they never have to guess if a trip to a garbage can will be necessary.

#### Improving Sensors

**Sensors, like microchips, have gotten smaller, more efficient, and cheaper over the years as materials and nanotechnology improved.** According to Bill Ruh, the chief digital officer at GE, smartphones are responsible for much of this progress. Smartphones are full of sensors—cameras, microphones, and so on—and to fit on phones, people had to find ways to make these sensors small, durable, and cheap. Once phone-appropriate sensors were developed, they could be used for other machines.

#### The Internet of Things

**The “Internet of Things,” or “industrial internet,” refers to the idea that eventually, every object will be “smart”—equipped with sensors.** This will allow objects to report on their condition or the surrounding conditions and then be adjusted remotely.

For example, in the past, washing machine maintenance was _conditional_ —if something looked wrong, you fixed it—or _preventive_ —you serviced machines on a schedule, regardless of whether the machine needed attention or not. GE engineers used their understanding of physics to model washing machines and predict when something would break, and experienced repair people used their intuition and experience to diagnose problems.

Today, thanks to sensors, we have _predictive_ and _prescriptive_ maintenance. Sensors can sort through so much data and find patterns that are so weak that even experienced humans would never notice them. Today, a brand-new employee could figure out what was wrong with a washing machine just from looking at sensor data.

**Sensors, combined with people, make problem-solving much more efficient, and bolstering the industrial internet is one of the ways people might adapt to keep up with the curve of change.**

### Part #2: Storage

Sensors and their ability to collect large amounts of data wouldn’t be any use if we had no way to keep the information around long enough to analyze. **Storage is technology that retains data,** and storage, like microchips and sensors, also develops in accordance with Moore’s law.

Before major advances in storage technologies in recent years, companies had to delete data because there wasn’t enough space to keep everything.

#### Improving Storage

There are two methods for increasing storage:

**Method #1: Improve memory chips.** Memory chips, like microchips, follow Moore’s law, and they can be made more powerful by using new materials or making the parts smaller.

**Method #2: Use software** that allows multiple computers to work together and combine their processing and storage power. (Storing data on a single computer has limitations—you can only store as much data as that one computer’s hard drive has space for, and you can only process as much data as that one computer’s processor can handle.)

Combining computers requires two types of software: one to link the computers, and another to make the data searchable. Google came up with the software for both and wrote papers about their software and shared them with the public. They only shared the ideas, not the exact code, but this was enough information for computer experts to start recreating the programs.

A man named Doug Cutting came up with a storage idea he called Hadoop. **Like Google’s programs, Hadoop would harness the processing power and storage of hundreds of computers and link them.**

Hadoop is “open-source,” which refers to a community-based way of developing software code. Anyone can use and edit the code as long as they share their edits and improvements with the rest of the community. It’s a fast and effective way of developing software because the talent pool is huge—anyone with an internet connection who’s interested can help with development.

Hadoop was a breakthrough—before it came into being around 2007, companies with large amounts of data such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, had no way to analyze their data.

#### Speed, Scale, and Cost

In the past, there was a tradeoff between speed and scale. You could analyze small amounts of data quickly, but that didn’t give you a lot of information. Or, you could analyze large amounts of data and get meaningful stats, but it would take a long time. **Today, however, thanks to programs such as Hadoop, you can get detailed information on your data at any scale.**

Additionally, these days, collecting, storing, and sharing information is almost free. The last time there was such a major change in cost was in the 15th century when the printing press was invented and books became affordable to the average person.

### Part #3: Software

**Software is a program that tells a computer what to do.** Like microchips, sensors, and storage, software capabilities are increasing in accordance with Moore’s law.

**Software removes complexity.** For example, imagine you want to find a photo of a ski trip in Montana you took with your neighbor. Pre-software, to find this photo, you’d sort through your hard copy prints and photo albums. Now, if your photos are stored in Google Photos, all you have to do is search a keyword or give a voice command. Google Photos does plenty of complex operations behind the scenes—it uses recognition software to identify people’s faces and certain landscapes—but all you see on your end is Google turning up the photo you want.

#### Improving Software

In the 20th century, hardware was the limitation of what technology could do. In the 21st century, software is the limiting factor, because software makes hardware work in different, more efficient ways.

Software capabilities can advance in two ways:

  * Improving software-writing tools.
  * Increasing collaborative tools and open-source development. The more great minds that work on a project, the more impressive the results of the project will be. 



#### GitHub

As we learned in the previous section, **open-source is a method of community-based software development. Much of this development is done on a platform called GitHub** , which is essentially a version control system that allows people to share, edit, and discuss code.

To use GitHub, you navigate to the GitHub library, find the software you need or want to work on, and download the code. You adapt the program and/or customize it to meet your needs, and finally upload your adaptation back to GitHub. The original developer can choose whether or not to accept your changes. If she accepts them, the new code is posted and anyone else can use and build on it. If she doesn’t accept your edits, there are tools for discussing the changes line-by-line.

(Shortform example: If you need a credit card processing system that could process a niche type of card, you could go find a general processing system on GitHub and then add functionality for that particular card you need. Then, you would upload your changes.)

GitHub makes money by charging companies for private business accounts, which allows them to choose who they want contributing to their software. **Many companies have both private and public code on GitHub.** Microsoft is one example. Microsoft originally only ran on Windows, and when the company made the decision that they wanted it to run on the operating systems Linux and Mac too, they released the code on GitHub. Impressively, the GitHub community created the Mac version overnight.

**There’s no financial reward for contributing—people on GitHub work for free because they’re passionate about the work and want recognition.**

### Part #4: Networking

**Networking is the system of cables and wireless networks that connect computers and smartphones all over the world.** Via these cables and networks, people can share anything that can be digitized. Networking is crucial to the acceleration of the other three computer components above because it allows new advances to be shared all over the world.

There are two main types of networks: wired and wireless.

#### Wired

_Thank You for Being Late_ covers one way to improve wired networks: Improve the wires.

In the early days, a transmission was sent using a digital radio frequency over a copper cable. In the 1980s and 1990s, scientists began transforming transmissions into light and sending them through long, flexible glass tubes called fiber-optic cables. Initially, the transmissions weakened after traveling a certain distance, so they had to pass through electronic amplifier boxes periodically.

**As time went on, scientists figured out how to make the cables longer and increase their capacity, and how to create signals that never weakened.** Once the amplifiers were no longer needed, the speed of transmission increased a lot—scientists no longer had to contend with the properties of electricity, only the properties of light. Scientists figured out how to increase the speed and capacity of transmission further by pulsing the light and using different colors, or by doing both at the same time. They’re currently working on trying to shape the light differently, which allows transmission speeds of more than a hundred trillion bits per second.

Today, it’s possible and very inexpensive to transmit huge amounts of data quickly. For example, in 2013, the internet in Chattanooga was fast enough that T Bone Burnett (in LA) and Chuck Mead (in Chattanooga) were able to perform a duet of “The Wild Side of Life” without any lag.

#### Wireless

There are three ways to improve wireless networking: Improve the hardware (Moore’s law), software, or standards.

##### Improving the Software—AT&T

In 2006, AT&T became the exclusive service provider for the iPhone. The iPhone was far more popular than AT&T had anticipated and they had to increase their capacity quickly—Apple wouldn’t be happy if their customers were having their calls dropped.

It would take Moore’s law some time to produce a new advance, and it would also take time to physically install that new advance. AT&T couldn’t wait, so they had to come up with a solution using the lines and infrastructure they already had.

Software-enabled networking was their solution. **Software-enabled networking is a way of making existing networking hardware work more efficiently.** For example, imagine a telephone wire as a freeway. If the vehicles on the freeway are left to their own devices, they’ll move in inefficient ways and sometimes crash. However, if you could control the behavior of every single vehicle on the freeway—imagine they’re self-driving cars—you could pack them in more tightly. The cars could all drive at high speeds very close to each and there would never be a problem. This is essentially what AT&T did—they manipulated the electric energy of calls and data to create extra capacity.

##### Improving the Standard—Qualcomm

Mobile phones first emerged in the 1980s. The first generation (1G) of mobile phones used FM radio for transmission. 2G used digital cellular networks, specifically the Global System for Mobile (GSM), and included voice, data, and texting, but without using the internet.

**GSM used the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) standard** for communication, which can transmit multiple conversations over one radio wave. Europe chose to standardize GSM across the continent so that if you crossed a border, your phone would still work in the new country. The EU tried to get the rest of the world to use TDMA too.

However, **Irwin Jacobs of the brand-new start-up Qualcomm thought that Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) would be more effective than TDMA** because it would increase wireless capacity. Like TDMA, CDMA could send multiple conversations over one radio wave, but CDMA allowed for more conversations because it took advantage of silences in conversations. It did this by using “spread spectrum,” a process in which calls are split up into multiple frequencies as they travel and then put back together at the receiving end. CDMA wouldn’t overload as fast as TDMA.

However, many people didn’t think CDMA was worth exploring—TDMA was working just fine and no one could imagine how much traffic there would be in the future or that anyone would want to use the internet on their phone. As a result, no one would make Qualcomm a CDMA phone, so they had to make one themselves. In 1995 Qualcomm was able to get Hutchison Telecom on board, and **once CDMA was out there competing in the world, it won out over TDMA, especially once 3G came along. 3G allowed access to the internet, though it was slow and awkward** —think dial-up.

**Today, 4G is the current standard. On a 4G network, wireless internet is as reliable as wired** and it’s perfectly possible to watch videos, which requires a good connection.

5G, according to Qualcomm, will be your phone anticipating what you want to do with it.
