## 1-Page Summary

Finding your “Why” or purpose can help you make better choices in your work and life that lead to greater fulfillment, according to best-selling author Simon Sinek. That’s what he discovered when finding his purpose helped him overcome depression. He then began helping others find their purpose through his popular 2009 TED Talk and by working with individuals and organizations.

Sinek shared his ideas about the centrality of purpose in his best-selling book, _Start With Why, _in 2009, which focused on organizations. He outlined his theory that the most successful organizations have a clear purpose and stick to it as they grow. To provide practical help to more people, he later co-wrote _Find Your Why_ with David Mead and Peter Docker: a follow-up book that lays out a step-by-step process for discovering your purpose.

(Shortform note: Sinek’s concept of a Why or purpose isn’t new. In 1946, psychologist Viktor Frankl argued that the driving force in our lives is meaning, not pleasure or power, as other schools of thought at the time suggested. Frankl also argued that the meaning of life isn’t universal, but rather something each person must find for themselves, just as Sinek believes everyone has a unique purpose they must discover.)

### What Is Your Purpose?

According to Sinek, “finding your Why” means finding your purpose: the single core belief that inspires you to do the work you choose to do and be the kind of person you want to be in all spheres of your life. Sinek believes every individual and organization has a purpose, though not everyone has discovered theirs or put it into words. He argues that your purpose is fixed by your twenties. Some people argue that your purpose changes throughout your lifetime; however, Sinek contends that while life events can temporarily divert you from your purpose, or make you reassess it, they don’t change your purpose.

(Shortform note: Sinek’s belief that everyone has a single purpose that remains true throughout their lifetime doesn’t match findings from research on purpose. According to studies, people’s search for and engagement with their purpose evolves throughout different stages of life. During our teenage years, we take an exploratory approach to purpose that becomes more urgent as we become adults and feel the pressure to have certainty on what our purpose is. Finally, during our senior years, we again take an exploratory approach after the things that gave us purpose during adulthood, including raising a family and having a career, become past accomplishments.)

### The Benefits of Discovering Your Purpose

Sinek discusses three benefits of knowing your purpose:

**1\. When you know your purpose,** **you can seek out work that fulfills you** —that is, work that matters and makes you feel that you're part of something bigger. Sinek believes everyone, no matter their role or status, deserves to find fulfillment at work. (Shortform note: Sinek draws a distinction between fulfillment and happiness, unlike traditional career advice that often conflates the two or sees them as operating in tandem. Fulfillment is lasting while happiness fluctuates. Additionally, Sinek’s understanding of fulfillment as a human need is in line with long-standing theories from psychology. Psychologist Abraham Maslow theorized that humans have five basic needs, including self-actualization, or fulfillment of our potential.)

**2\. Finding your purpose helps you** **make more persuasive appeals to people**. Your energy and commitment to your purpose are contagious, so having clarity on it helps you pitch your ideas in a way that’s more authentic and enticing to others. (Shortform note: Jack Canfield, author of _The Success Principles_ , agrees with Sinek's belief that having a clear purpose will inspire others to join you. Canfield adds that communicating your purpose in a compelling way is one of the main skills of great leaders.)

**3\. Knowing your purpose helps you** **make better decisions** because you can measure each choice against your purpose and make the decision that best aligns with it. (Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown suggests practical ways to filter out nonessential pursuits using your purpose: Learn to set boundaries and say “no” gracefully, learn to say “no more” to time or money investments that no longer serve you, and have an editor’s mindset to eliminate everything except what’s essential.)

### Your Purpose Is at the Core of Everything You Do

We’ve discussed what your Why, or purpose, is and what its benefits are. Now, we’ll explore how to use your purpose to guide your life and work. We'll look at a three-part model Sinek first introduced in _Start With Why_ , which illustrates that your central purpose determines the actions you take (your “How” or methods) and, in turn, your results (“What” you accomplish).

#### Sinek’s “Golden Circle”

Sinek calls his model “The Golden Circle”: It consists of three concentric circles, each representing one of the core concepts in his theory.

**1\. The inner circle is the Why:** the _purpose_ that orients everything you do. It’s the core belief that motivates you to get out of bed in the morning. In terms of an organization, it’s the mission you stand for and the reason you’re in business. An organization’s Why might be to provide accessible health care to its community. An individual’s Why might be to create spaces for learning.

**2\. The middle circle is the How:** the _methods and practices_ that characterize you and which other people consider your strengths. Individuals and organizations can have multiple “Hows” because they are practical, operational knowledge that brings the Why to life. An organization’s How might be to empower the voices of team members. An individual’s How might be to forge meaningful connections.

**3\. The outer circle is the What:** the _outputs_ you generate. It’s the tangible part of your organization or life and the easiest to identify. An organization's What includes its products, services, policies, and strategies. An individual's What might be their family, job, and projects.

(Shortform note: Critics point out that Sinek’s model is missing a critical question: Who? They argue that organizations that begin with Why overlook the most important element in a business: the customers. An organization might have a compelling Why, driving its How and What. But if the organization can’t find a customer interested in its product or service (the What), it won’t succeed. Thus, you could complement Sinek’s model by asking yourself who you’re serving and what they need before considering Why you do what you do.)

##### Lead With Your Purpose

Sinek believes most organizations and individuals work from the outside of the model in, because it’s easier to explain your What and How (results and methods) than your Why.

But Sinek believes _great_ companies **start with the core (Why) and work their way outward.** He advocates not only focusing on your purpose, but also sharing it upfront with the people you do business with, because revealing what’s driving you fosters long-term relationships. Here’s how the three methods of presenting yourself (leading with What, How, or Why) compare:

**Leading with What, or outcomes:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about your product or service. Some people decide to buy from you, hire you, or join you—but only for as long as you’re the most convenient option available.

**Leading with How, or methods:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about the methods or practices that set you apart from the competition. Some people choose you—until your way of doing things catches on, and you become one of many similar options with the same How.

**Leading with Why, or purpose:** You introduce yourself or your organization by talking about your mission, the problem you’re trying to solve, or a fundamental belief you have about the future. More people choose you because they understand that supporting you means supporting that purpose. Other competitors might offer similar outcomes or methods in the future, and maybe even with more convenient terms, but you will always have the advantage of the emotional connection you forged.

(Shortform note: The concept of leading with your purpose isn’t new to sales. In _To Sell Is Human_ , Daniel Pink recommends a model based on trust, an interest in serving the customer, plus purpose. His two rules for service-oriented selling are to make it personal and to make it purposeful. He says you’ll be most successful when serving a purpose that improves society.)

### Your Purpose Statement

We’ve discussed Sinek’s model. Now we'll look at how to write a purpose statement. **Your purpose statement is a single sentence that declares your ultimate goal and vision.** According to Sinek, it has two parts: The first part should spell out _the core action_ your Why compels you to take. The second part should state what you’re ultimately striving to achieve: the _impact_ you want to have.

An older version of Airbnb’s mission statement is a great example of a purpose statement: To connect millions of people in real life all over the world, through a community marketplace (core action)—so that you can Belong Anywhere (impact).

(Shortform note: In _First Things First, _Stephen Covey also suggests writing a statement of what matters most to you and what you hope to achieve, but he approaches it with more flexibility. While Sinek’s purpose statement succinctly states the core action you take and the key impact you seek in one sentence, Covey’s mission statement more broadly defines your life’s goals and the principles that guide you toward them.)

#### Characteristics of a Purpose Statement

According to Sinek, an effective purpose statement has four characteristics:

##### Characteristic #1: Short and User-Friendly

The purpose statement should be easy to understand and clear about how you’ll put it into action. By keeping it short, you help yourself remember your Why and keep it in mind when you take action. Additionally, Sinek argues that limiting it to one sentence helps ensure that it’s truthful because it forces you to state only what matters _most_.

##### Characteristic #2: Impact-Focused

The second part of the statement focuses on the impact of your work and your positive effect on others. Sinek stresses that having a positive impact feeds our sense of fulfillment, because fulfillment comes from serving others rather than seeking our own satisfaction.

##### Characteristic #3: Meaningful and Declarative

Your statement should inspire you or your team to reach within for your best version. This is a _meaningful, truthful_ version of yourself, not an aspirational—or worse, doctored—version.

##### Characteristic #4: Constant

Your purpose is a constant in all aspects of your life and work. Sinek notes that your desired effect doesn’t change over time or in different situations. But while you have only one purpose statement, you’ll find different ways to _express_ your purpose in different contexts.

> **An Alternative Approach to the Purpose Statement**
> 
> In _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey recommends gaining clarity on your purpose by writing what he calls a mission statement. He outlines the characteristics of an effective mission statement, some of which are similar to Sinek’s suggestions. But Covey’s flexible and holistic approach to the mission statement considers characteristics that Sinek doesn’t:
> 
>   * While Sinek believes you need a brief statement that doesn’t embellish your purpose, Covey is more flexible and encourages creative self-expression.
> 
>   * Covey suggests that your personal mission statement should address your four basic human needs: survival, connection, learning, and giving back. Given Sinek’s focus on impact, he would argue that a purpose statement should mostly be about giving back.
> 
>   * Covey is more specific than Sinek in emphasizing that your mission statement defines the universal principles you will apply to achieve your purpose.
> 
>   * Finally, while Sinek believes a purpose statement is a constant in your life, Covey gives more guidance on how to make the mission statement relevant to all the spheres of your life by ensuring it includes all the different roles you play.

### Preparing for a Purpose Discussion

We’ve discussed the Why or purpose statement. Now, we’ll dive into the process Sinek created with co-authors David Mead and Peter Docker to identify your purpose.

To determine your Why in the first place, Sinek and his co-authors created a step-by-step process that individuals and groups can follow in a group discussion or workshop. Sinek’s process to find your purpose helps you or your team explore past experiences for insight into what moves you.

In this process, you’ll identify important stories in your personal or company experience, share them with a partner or group facilitator, and pull out themes. You’ll then distill these themes to write your purpose statement. (Shortform note: While Sinek argues that you can find your purpose by looking inward, Viktor Frankl argues the opposite in _Man’s Search for Meaning_. He contends that you can only find meaning out in the world—in other people or causes—not in your own mind.)

We’ll start by discussing four preliminary steps to Sinek’s process of finding your purpose. Since they look much the same for individuals and teams, we'll present the individual and team processes together, then mention their slight differences.

#### Select and Prepare Your Partner or Facilitator

In this step, you’ll **choose a partner or facilitator to help you** identify themes in your life or organization that suggest a purpose. Sinek recommends choosing someone who has emotional distance from the process and can be objective. They should also be curious and perceptive, so they can ask the right follow-up questions to get to the core of each story.

After choosing your partner or facilitator, explain that after listening to each story, they should ask follow-up questions to uncover why it matters. According to Sinek, **the best questions** **follow the trail of emotional cues, they aren’t yes or no questions, and they start with “what” rather than “why.”**

On the other hand, partners or facilitators shouldn’t offer solutions or advice, or let their preconceptions bias the process. (Shortform note: One way to remain objective as a facilitator is to simply _observe_ emotional cues to ask follow-up questions, instead of judging or naming the emotions you notice.)

#### Gather Input for the Discussion

The third step in preparing for the purpose discussion is input, or determining what you'll bring to the discussion. The input needed is different for teams and individuals. For individuals, input refers to the life stories you gather. For teams, it refers to the participants you invite.

##### Individuals: Gather Your Stories

Before the session, **come up with 10 stories that shed light on who you are**. Sinek suggests looking for meaningful anecdotes, lessons, and people who shaped you. (Shortform note: To identify meaningful stories, consider times you experienced a defining moment. In _The Power of Moments_ , Chip and Dan Heath describe defining moments as those that generate insight, pride, and connection, and are different from everyday experiences.)

##### Teams: Gather the Right People

**The stories that will help you discover your organization’s purpose are the ones team members have experienced and are able to share.** To capture those stories, first find 10 to 30 people to participate: enough to generate diverse perspectives and experiences, but not so many that the process becomes disorganized.

According to Sinek, participants should:

  * **Represent different positions and tasks on the team** , vertically and horizontally.
  * **Be enthusiastic about the team** , since they’re likely already living the team’s purpose.
  * **Have been part of the team for enough time** that they’ve seen its highs and lows.



(Shortform note: Sinek's ideas align closely with guidelines for team building that John Maxwell shares in _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, _but Maxwell adds something Sinek doesn’t consider: Besides selecting for diversity, enthusiasm, and experience, Maxwell suggests you build a team with influential people who have good chemistry with you and other team members, and are morally upstanding. These traits will be useful to ensure the process goes smoothly, and that they later help promote the Why companywide.)

### Conducting a Purpose Discussion

Now that we’ve laid the groundwork for a purpose discussion, we’ll explore how to conduct it. While the goal is the same for both individuals and teams, the process for each is different. Therefore, we’ll first go through the process for individuals and then explore how finding your purpose works for teams.

#### The Purpose Discussion for Individuals

##### Stage 1: Tell Your Stories

To begin, share the stories you came up with with your partner. While you share, they should: 1) **Take notes on the main ideas** and feelings behind the stories, and capture the core action you took and the effect you had or aimed for, and 2) **Highlight recurring words or concepts.** Sinek emphasizes that these are the themes you’ll use in the next steps.

(Shortform note: As a partner, you can determine what main ideas and recurring concepts you should make note of by following these four steps for getting to the core of a story: First, identify the facts of the story. Then, identify the emotions behind the story through the person’s words and body language. Stay silent as you observe what ideas and emotions the story sparks in _you_. Finally, once you’ve identified an emotion or idea, share it with them to see if it resonates. If it does, continue asking questions about it to see what else they can uncover. If it doesn’t, repeat the process to explore other possibilities.)

##### Stage 2: Identify Your Themes

Now, have your partner look through their notes and identify _themes_. According to the authors, themes are ideas that come up in at least two stories. Together, read through the list of themes and identify the _two_ that you feel a stronger connection to and that convey: 1) **Your unique participation in the stories** —the action you took. 2) **Your effect on others** —how they benefited from your participation.

Put the other themes aside. You’ll come back to them later when you determine your How.

(Shortform note: Like many people, you might be telling your stories with some _responsibility bias_ , causing you to overemphasize your participation. Adam Grant explains in _Give and Take _that responsibility bias results from having more information about actions you’ve taken versus the contributions others have made. Your partner can help you avoid this bias by asking you about the contributions of other people involved in the stories you’re telling.)

##### Stage 3: Draft Your Purpose Statement

At this stage, Sinek recommends that you and your partner each write an initial draft of your purpose statement separately. Using the two themes you selected, first write **the core action** your purpose compels you to take. Then, write **the ultimate impact** you want to have. For example: “To build strong foundations (action) so that future generations can thrive (impact).”

The authors caution against spending too much time writing—just capture what _feels right_. Share your drafts with each other. Decide whether to keep one or combine them. Once your draft has the right ideas, leave it for a while. Come back to it later with a fresh eye, and rework the phrasing until you feel it captures your essence.

(Shortform note: If you don’t have a partner with whom you can draft your purpose statement, consider writing a personal mission statement. This process also arrives at a succinct expression of your core action and impact without needing to collaborate with a partner. In addition, the personal mission statement allows for revisions in a way that is more flexible than Sinek’s process, because you’re meant to revise and improve it throughout your lifetime.)

#### The Purpose Discussion for Teams

##### Stage 1: Mine Their Stories

The goal is to extract **two key insights** from stories participants will share:**the core action the team consistently takes, and the effect the action has on others.** To do so, the authors suggest dividing participants into groups that represent the diversity in the room. Avoid teaming people up with the colleagues they work with every day. (Shortform note: As David Epstein argues in _Range, _people from diverse backgrounds bring different ideas and values to the table, which results in new insights.)

To extract the first insight, begin by asking participants to **share with their small groups stories of when they took pride in being part of the team**. Then, ask each small group to share their three most emotionally impactful stories with the rest of the team. **Ask follow-up questions** after each story to uncover its significance. (Shortform note: If a team is struggling to come up with examples, help reframe their thoughts by considering proud moments that they may overlook. In _The Power of Moments_ , Chip and Dan Heath __ suggest paying attention to small wins and focusing on progress instead of results.)

Ask participants to **choose an _action verb or phrase_ for each story** they have shared. The verbs should capture the _core actions_ the team took. Finally, ask each group to share what they’ve written while you take notes, highlighting repeated phrases or expressions. (Shortform note: If the team isn't sure how to translate stories into action verbs or phrases, remind them of another process in which they use verbs and phrases to solidify ideas: writing objectives in action-oriented language. The logic behind both processes is the same. Attaching action words to stories makes the stories more concrete—similar to how action verbs help make objectives actionable, as John Doerr instructs in _Measure What Matters_.)

To extract the second insight, ask the small groups to **share stories of people whose lives changed for the better thanks to the team**. Then, ask each group to share their responses with the full group while you write down a phrase from each response that captures the essence of the team’s effect on others; note repeated phrases. (Shortform note: Since the authors encourage participants to focus on the feelings the team generates, rather than the product or services they provide, this could unintentionally make an organization seem more virtuous than it is. Since customers are savvy—and as Sinek argues in _Start With Why, _they can detect manipulation—you shouldn’t overlook the less sanitized parts of the work you do. This will help ensure your purpose statement is truthful.)

##### Stage 2: Draft the Purpose Statement

To begin, show participants a sample purpose statement and explain where each part of the statement will come from: The team’s core actions will shape the first part of the statement; the team’s effects on others will shape the second part.

Ask small groups to draft a purpose statement using the notes from the previous conversations, particularly the repeated phrases and ideas. Each small group should do their own draft. Finally, ask small groups to share their drafts out loud so that all the participants together can decide whether to keep one of the drafts or combine them.

Save all the notes you didn’t use in the final draft of the purpose statement. These are the themes you will use to determine your “How,” or methods.

(Shortform note: To help the team collaborate effectively, facilitators can follow Kim Scott’s advice in _Radical Candor_ : Make sure everyone listens to each other and builds on each other’s ideas. Help small groups refine their ideas before sharing them so others will assess them fairly. Stop a conversation if it becomes about “winning” rather than debating. After some debate, transition to decision-making. Remember to leave the decision in the participants’ hands.)

### After You’ve Found Your Why

We’ve walked through the process of finding your Why, or purpose, and putting it in writing. Now, we’ll discuss what to do next. Sinek identifies two key actions to take after the process of discovering your Why. First, determine your How: the methods or practices that characterize you and help you live your purpose. Then, _share_ your purpose statement.

#### 1\. Determine Your “How”

Sinek says **your How comes from the list of themes you set aside** when you**** drafted your purpose statement.

##### The Importance of Determining Your How

Your How is the way you operate when you’re at your best or when using your strengths. While your Why guides you to opportunities that will bring you fulfillment, your How helps you identify which will allow you to use your best qualities. Although many opportunities, including potential jobs, may be related to your purpose, they won’t all be right for you.

(Shortform note: While determining your How can help you understand why some situations help you thrive while others work against you, in _Designing Your Life_ Bill Burnett and Dave Evans offer a way to pinpoint which situations have either a positive or negative effect on you: a wayfinding journal. The journal works like a mood tracker where you list all the activities you do throughout a period of time, and rate how involved, energized, and joyful you felt during each of them. You can then analyze the tracker to find where your involvement, energy, and joy lag or rise—and use your How to understand why.)

##### The Process of Determining Your How

The process of identifying your How, or methods, is the same for individuals and teams:

**First, group similar themes until you’re left with no more than five.** (Remember not to use the themes you already wrote into your purpose declaration) Each of these remaining themes is one of your “Hows,” so you will have around five practices that characterize you, and together describe _how_ you put your purpose into action. Sinek recommends stating your How in actionable language that is easy to understand. **Then, elaborate on each How to make it more concrete** by adding clarifying statements.

For instance, if a How states “we build safe communities,” you could add the following clarifying statements:

  * “We look out for our community members.”
  * “We create safe spaces where everyone belongs.”
  * “We seek opportunities for connection.”



(Shortform note: Besides helping you understand which situations bring out the best in you, writing down your How is an opportunity to identify myths you might be holding about yourself. Among the themes you identified, you might have included myths about your personality—traits you believe you have and that even shape the way you tell stories about yourself but turn out to be inaccurate. Thinking through your identified strengths and elaborating on them to make them more specific is an opportunity to shine a light on these myths and root them out.)

#### 2\. Share Your Purpose

The final stage of the process of finding your purpose is to share it so you can validate your ideas with people who know you, or your organization, well. The sharing process is different for individuals versus teams.

##### Individuals: Share Your Insights With Others

Sinek suggests **talking with friends to check whether your purpose statement is an honest expression of your best self**. Ask them what they specifically value in you as a friend. Their answer should echo your purpose statement. If it doesn’t, go back to your discussion partner, and discuss whether your friends have raised any themes worth exploring. (Shortform note: The authors’ suggestion of a collaborative approach applies beyond sharing your purpose. In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans argue that you should design your life collaboratively. One way to do that is to create a team of close allies and influential people in your life that you share your life project design with, and who give you feedback and support.)

Additionally, **talk to the people you interact with often** **about both your Why and How**. This will help you collaborate more effectively with them because they’ll know where you’re coming from (your Why) and what strengths you can contribute (your How). (Shortform note: Sharing your Why and How with colleagues can contribute to a culture of _Radical Candor, _a management style that focuses on supporting people through personal and professional problems. If you’re a leader, you can encourage your employees to share their Why and How with you. Then you can follow Kim Scott’s advice to support their growth by giving them the feedback and challenges they need.)

Finally, **lead with your purpose** instead of your How or What when you introduce yourself to strangers. (Shortform note: Introducing yourself to strangers can be nerve-wracking, especially if you’re sharing something personal like your purpose. To overcome nerves when talking to strangers, follow the tips Keith Ferrazzi outlines in _Never Eat Alone_ , including emulating an extroverted role model in social situations and setting small targets for yourself, like introducing yourself to one new person every week.)

##### Teams: Share Your Insights With the Rest of the Team

As with the individual process, the team process of sharing your purpose involves validating your insights. However, this works on a much bigger scale and thus requires more steps.

To begin, leaders should invite people who didn’t participate in the team’s purpose discussion to a meeting. The authors suggest that you invite team members who are _enthusiastic_ about participating because they’ll share that enthusiasm with others after the meeting. (Shortform note: In _The Tipping Point, _Malcolm Gladwell explains that enthusiasm makes some people persuasive. Their enthusiasm makes others _want_ to listen to their ideas.)

1\. **Introduce your purpose** Explain that the purpose statement came from the stories team members shared during the previous discussion. Recount some of the stories. Then, **share the purpose statement** , reminding participants that the phrasing might not be perfect, but **the meaning behind it and the action it invites them to take should resonate**. Be alert to _disagreement_ —if most participants feel unsure, you might need to repeat the purpose discussion.

(Shortform note: At this stage, you’re encouraging ownership of the purpose from people who didn’t participate in discovering it and therefore might be hesitant to adopt it. To help them get there, practice _Extreme Ownership_ —embody the team’s purpose and model it. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin recommend two practices to ensure you model the kind of ownership you expect from your team: 1) Make sure the purpose statement resonates with you and that you believe that it makes sense given the team’s strategy and history, and 2) keep an open mind to the disagreements people might have and listen to any concerns.)

**2.** Connect with the purpose and look ahead At this stage, the authors suggest splitting participants into smaller groups. Ask them to share stories of when they felt proud to be a part of the team and how those moments reflected the organization’s purpose, as well as identify team members who personify the purpose. Bring the full group together to share their insights. (Shortform note: Speaking about moments of pride and their alignment with your purpose inspires others to act in alignment with the Why. In _The Power of Moments_ , Chip and Dan Heath __ argue that, when you take a courageous action, like living true to your organization’s purpose, that becomes a defining moment of pride. For people who witness your courage, it becomes a defining moment of inspiration.)

Next, ask the full group to **brainstorm ways to use the purpose to propel the team forward**. They should consider _internal management_ and the _products or services_ the team or company offers. (Shortform note: Beyond this session, you can encourage team members to pitch creative ideas by applying the tools Ed Catmull shares in _Creativity, Inc.,_ like promoting candor, embracing failure, and being protective of new ideas._)_

To close, Sinek advises asking for volunteers to share the purpose with peers, be living examples of it, and bring one of the brainstorming ideas to life. (Shortform note: In _The Tipping Point_ , Malcolm Gladwell offers guidelines on how to choose the right messengers. When people volunteer, keep an eye out for connectors (people with strong social networks), mavens (people who are adept at gathering and retaining information), and persuaders (people who are great at getting other people on board) and encourage them to take on some of the volunteer roles.)
