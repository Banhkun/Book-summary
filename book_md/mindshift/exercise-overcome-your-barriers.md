## Exercise: Overcome Your Barriers

Perceived barriers can discourage people from having a mindshift. Be more aware of your barriers and come up with a plan to overcome them.

* * *

Recall the four barriers: being a slow learner, advanced age, imposter syndrome, and lack of time or money. Which of these is getting in the way of your mindshift?

Whatâ€™s one thing you can do right away to help you get over this barrier? For example, if your barrier is advanced age, make an exercise plan. If your barrier is a lack of money, look for MOOCs that are free or within your budget.
