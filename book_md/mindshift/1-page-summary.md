## 1-Page Summary

Whether you’re unhappy at work, interested in another field, or worried that your job is in danger of becoming obsolete, it’s never too late to make a career change. Barbara Oakley asserts that whatever your age or occupation, **you can have a mindshift, which means expanding your skill set—and, consequently, your opportunities—through transformative learning**. In _Mindshift_ , she writes that it’s possible to overcome perceived barriers (such as age, imposter syndrome, or a lack of money) and gain new skills so you can reinvent yourself.

Oakley is proof that it’s possible to make a big change and flourish despite presumed weaknesses. She says that growing up, she believed she wasn’t good at math or science, so she avoided those subjects in college and got a degree in languages. After graduating, she worked for the US Army as a signal officer, which required her to use complicated communications equipment; this job ignited in her such a strong interest in math and science that she later earned a second degree (and eventually a Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering. She is currently a Professor of Engineering at Oakland University.

Oakley’s experience led her to write books such as _A Mind for Numbers_ , which aims to help the numbers-averse get more comfortable with math, and _Learning How to Learn_ , which outlines study tactics to help readers master any subject. Oakley also has a number of popular online courses with millions of enrollees on Coursera. _Mindshift_ was published in 2017 and is also the title of one of her online courses.

In this guide, we’ll explain why it’s important to have a mindshift in the modern world. Then we’ll share Oakley’s strategies for having a mindshift and overcoming perceived limitations so you can open up new opportunities. We’ll also supplement Oakley’s ideas with those of other experts to help you supercharge your learning and maximize your potential.

### The Importance of Mindshifts

Mindshifts are important for two reasons. First, Oakley asserts that**they allow us to reach our full potential**. Often, we’re forced to choose a career path at an early age, when we still don’t have a real sense of who we are or what we want to do. Having a mindshift allows us to diverge from a path we set as teenagers and become more than we thought we could be.

(Shortform note: It’s normal to be wistful about career paths not taken. In one survey, 21% of respondents said they often thought about other careers they could have explored, which prevented them from staying engaged at work. If a career change isn’t currently an option, you can stop ruminating on the “what ifs” by reminding yourself why you chose the path you’re on and reflecting on the good things about it.)

Second, Oakley argues that **mindshifts allow us to enhance or gain skills so we can keep up with a fast-changing world**. With technology developing at breakneck speed, our roles at work are constantly evolving and requiring us to adapt. Mindshifts give us more versatility and enable us to provide more value to employers, future-proofing our careers. For example, as more companies use chatbots and voicebots to field customer inquiries, human customer service agents who are worried about job security would benefit from having a mindshift.

(Shortform note: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to fears of a “jobs apocalypse.” However, some experts say that we’re still a long way from mass-replacing humans with robots. This is because companies tend to be slow to adopt new “smart” equipment, preferring to stick to old but reliable machines and cheap outsourced labor. If you’re still concerned about job security, consider a job in AI—there’s a rising demand for workers in fields such as machine learning, data science, process re-engineering, and data ethics. In other words, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.)

Oakley cites Singapore as a prime example of a country that recognizes the importance of giving its workforce career flexibility. Under the SkillsFuture program, the Singapore government gives a S$500 credit (roughly US$375 as of May 2023) to citizens who are 25 years old and above, with the amount going toward any training they wish to pursue. This enables the workforce to enhance existing skills to help them move forward in their careers or acquire new skills that will prepare them for a new field.

(Shortform note: The SkillsFuture program aids not just citizens 25 and above but everyone from students to early- and mid-career workers—and it does so with great success. In a 2019 survey by the Singapore Ministry of Education, nearly 80% of employers said that SkillsFuture training enabled employees to progress in their careers and helped companies retain valuable employees.)

However, not everyone lives in a place with readily available support for their professional and personal development. If you don’t have access to government- or employer-subsidized training, you can take charge of your own learning. In the next section, we’ll discuss Oakley’s tips for having a mindshift so you can broaden your options.

### How to Have a Mindshift

Oakley’s three main tips for having a mindshift are: Change your perspective, determine what you want to do next, and learn how to learn. We’ll discuss each in detail.

#### Change Your Perspective

Oakley says that to have a mindshift, you first need to adjust your _mindset_. In particular, you should **realize the value of your experience** and **be humble**.

##### Realize the Value of Your Experience

Oakley writes that shifting to something new may seem intimidating because you feel like others in your desired field have a head start, but she argues that starting later than your peers doesn’t necessarily put you at a disadvantage. In fact, she asserts that **your experience in one field gives you unique, transferable skills** that you can use in unexpected ways in another field. She gives the example of a Juilliard-trained musician who later became a doctor; his musically trained ear gave him the unique ability to detect irregular heart sounds.

(Shortform note: Oakley’s example of a musician-turned-physician isn’t all that unusual. Recognizing the value of musicians’ training, Canada’s Memorial University of Newfoundland recruits many of its music students to study medicine. Aside from having a heightened sense of hearing, musicians (such as pianists) have other transferable skills like manual dexterity, an essential skill for surgery. Musicians who’ve trained for years also have the same kind of discipline and work ethic that studying medicine requires.)

Further, Oakley says that your experiences don’t even have to be related to your career and can instead come from your hobbies. For example, if you’ve built a respectable following by making cooking videos on your personal TikTok account, you might parlay this experience into helping your employer generate more engaging Instagram reels on the company account.

(Shortform note: Job interviews are a good opportunity to let potential employers know how your hobbies can be an asset. Prepare for the “What are your hobbies and interests?” question by listing your hobbies and thinking about the skills you gained from them. These skills can include teamwork, patience, and creativity. Then, during your interview, mention how you can use those skills on the job.)

##### Be Humble

While it’s important to know the value you bring to a new field, it’s equally important to **embrace being a beginner**. It may be difficult to find yourself back at square one, especially if you’re already highly accomplished in another field, but acknowledging your newbie status can make you more open to learning new things because you accept that you don’t know it all.

(Shortform note: Modern Stoic Ryan Holiday agrees with Oakley that humility is essential for learning. In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , Holiday writes that your ego, which he defines as a sense of superiority, can impede your growth by making you feel like you have nothing else to learn. He emphasizes that learning is a lifelong process that requires you to seek and listen to feedback, continuously look for new challenges, and ask successful people to share their knowledge with you—all hallmarks of humility.)

#### Determine What’s Next

Once you’ve reframed your thinking and opened your mind to the possibility of learning new skills, reflect on your desired career path.

There are two ways to go about making a career change. The first is to **shift to another field entirely, which requires persistence and a healthy dose of the humility** Oakley prescribes. You might need to immerse yourself in an environment where you’ll get plenty of guidance and exposure to your target field. For example, if you want to become a pastry chef, you might leave a cushy office job so you can work as a server at a restaurant and closely observe a patissier in action.

(Shortform note: Making a big career change can be risky, so Scott Pape, “The Barefoot Investor,” gives two tips in his eponymous book: First, make the transition gradual. Keep your current job, and dip your toe into the field you’re interested in by working a side job. And second, connect with people in your desired field. Ask them about their success strategies and any leads for work opportunities.)

The second way to make a career change is to**shift to something that’s still within your current field**. Oakley says this is an especially viable option for those who’ve already spent years of study and practice in a demanding field such as medicine or law—you can explore another specialization instead of starting from scratch and putting in more years of exhaustive study. For example, if you’re an accountant, you can go from being an auditor who inspects companies to a financial consultant who helps individuals prepare for retirement.

(Shortform note: If you can’t decide which path to take next, experts recommend putting two career options side by side—if you had to pick one, which would it be? Then replace the career you didn’t pick with another career and choose again. Keep going until you have no more options and are left with The One. If, in the end, you find that two options are equally enticing, pick the one that’s easier for you to shift to, maybe because you have someone in your network who can help you get established in the field.)

#### Learn How to Learn

Once you determine what you want to learn, come up with a plan to learn it. The kind of learning you did in school, which may have focused on rote memorization, may not be the best route to achieving your goals. Oakley says that **to learn more effectively, you should use both modes of your brain—focused mode and diffuse mode**.

(Shortform note: Psychologist Edward de Bono has a description of the brain’s two modes that’s similar to Oakley’s. Focused mode corresponds to de Bono’s idea of “vertical” thinking while diffuse mode corresponds to his idea of “lateral” thinking. He differs from Oakley in that he says lateral thinking leads to new insights while vertical thinking allows us to analyze and select from a range of possibilities.)

Focused mode is when you concentrate fully on the material you’re learning. **Oakley recommends “chunking” to help you master challenging concepts and skills.** Chunking means breaking down a skill or concept into smaller parts (or chunks) and practicing each part over and over. Oakley explains that this repeated practice of small parts not only makes learning more manageable but also forms and strengthens the connections between brain cells. This leads to mastery of a skill.

You can apply chunking to both mental and physical skills. For example, if you’re learning something numbers-intensive, solve the same challenging math problem again and again over a few days until it becomes easy for you. If you’re learning to be a yoga instructor, you can practice a sequence of five poses at a time instead of trying to memorize an entire class’s worth of poses. Aside from being easier to master, chunking poses in this way also allows you to rearrange chunks and come up with various sequences of poses.

(Shortform note: Chunking and repeated practice can help you refine a skill, but true mastery is when you understand something well enough that you’re able to apply it to different contexts. In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young gives the example of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who went beyond memorizing theorems and formulas and developed a strong grasp of underlying principles, which enabled him to solve problems at impressive speeds. Young writes that you can gain a deeper understanding of what you’re trying to learn by allowing yourself to struggle through problems, challenging what you know about a concept, and connecting abstract ideas to concrete examples.)

On the other hand, **diffuse mode is when you allow your brain to relax**. Research suggests that this mode is a necessary part of learning, giving your brain time to process what you’ve learned, store it, and connect it with other information, leading to new insights. One example of diffuse mode at work is Archimedes’s eureka moment: When the Greek polymath was struggling to figure out how to prove that a crown was made of pure gold, he had a sudden insight while he was taking a bath and his brain was in relaxation mode.

(Shortform note: In the past, scientists believed that all the brain did while a person was relaxing was to support lung and heart function. It wasn’t until the 1990s—with the introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRIs—that scientists found that the brain is highly active (and more interactive) when people lie still or daydream. It is in this mind-wandering state that the diffuse mode kicks in, allowing our brains to consolidate memories and recharge, ready to engage in more focused thinking.)

Oakley says the Pomodoro technique—a method that entails 25 minutes of work interspersed with short breaks—is one way to tap into the powers of your brain’s two modes. During the 25 minutes of work, you use focused mode to concentrate on, say, solving a math problem. During the short break, you go into diffuse mode, allowing your brain to connect what you just learned with other knowledge you have stored in your brain.

(Shortform note: The Pomodoro technique isn’t always the best way to learn. Some people feel that 25 minutes is too short and keeps them from reaching a “flow” state, while others feel the time is too long for the tasks they have to complete. You may want to save the Pomodoro technique for tasks that you tend to avoid or that aren’t mentally demanding; otherwise, explore other options like the less rigorous “flowtime.” With flowtime, you focus on a single task for as long as you can—without the added pressure of working against a clock—and take a break only once you start to get distracted.)

### Overcoming Perceived Barriers

In addition to her general tips for having a mindshift, Oakley has specific advice for overcoming common perceived barriers to learning new skills: being a slow learner, thinking you’re too old, feeling like an imposter, and not having enough time or money.

#### Barrier #1: Being a Slow Learner

This barrier can manifest in two ways: You might grasp concepts more slowly than your peers, or you might _believe_ you’re a slow learner because your way of learning differs from schools’ traditional methods of teaching.

If you’re a slow learner who takes more time to understand concepts compared to your peers, the following tips can help you manage:

**1\. Be prepared.** Find out what you’ll be learning in class in advance so you can get familiar with the material and get a headstart on understanding it. (Shortform note: If you’re learning outside a classroom setting through a mentor, prepare for your mentorship meetings so that you don’t waste your mentor’s time. Be proactive by telling your mentor what your objectives are so that they can tailor their support to your needs, and come up with a list of topics or questions and send them to your mentor ahead of your meeting.)

**2\. Use idle time to learn.** Keep your books or notes with you at all times so you can go through them during pockets of free time, like while you’re waiting in line at the coffee shop or on your train ride home from work. (Shortform note: Modern society seems to prize busyness and filling every spare second with activity and associates idleness with laziness. But some argue that allowing yourself to be bored can be a good thing because it can improve your creativity.)

**3\. Improve your memory.** Memorization is a key component of understanding and applying ideas—being able to retain several concepts in your head enables you to solve problems more quickly and connect ideas in creative ways. Oakley thus recommends improving your memory with memory practice. (Shortform note: Scott Young has three strategies for improving your memory in _Ultralearning_ : 1) Test yourself right after you read something by putting the material away and writing down everything you can remember, 2) _overlearn_ something by practicing it repeatedly until it becomes automatic, and 3) use _spaced repetition_ , which means spreading out practice sessions over a period of time.)

If, on the other hand, you just believe you’re a slow learner because you have trouble keeping up with lectures and textbooks, try **using visual tools** to help you better understand concepts. Oakley gives the example of an unconventional learner who would sketch mind maps to help him retain information.

(Shortform note: Visual tools like mind maps aid in learning because the human brain is naturally better at remembering images and places than it is at remembering lists of numbers and words. In _Moonwalking With Einstein_ , Joshua Foer gives guidelines for creating a kind of mind map called a memory palace: Turn information into images and mentally put each image into a place you’re intimately familiar with (your palace)—this can be your home, your dog-walking route, or any other place that has a sequential progression. For example, if you want to remember a to-do list that has “pick up dry cleaning, balance checkbook, call mom,” you can picture your clothes in your foyer, a checkbook on your sofa, and your mom in the kitchen.)

#### Barrier #2: Advanced Age

As we age, our brains deteriorate, with neurons (brain cells) naturally dying off and synapses (the connections between neurons that lead to memory formation) decreasing. This decrease in neurons and synapses makes it harder for us to remember things and learn new information. However, Oakley says there are research-backed ways to help generate new neurons and synapses to facilitate learning, no matter how old you are.

(Shortform note: Though Oakley says that neurogenesis is possible in adults, there’s still a lot of debate about this among neuroscientists. For example, one study suggests that adults well past middle age continue to generate new neurons, but some scientists dispute this, arguing that these neurons have been around since childhood.)

In particular, Oakley recommends two methods:

**1\. Exercise.** While it isn’t a panacea for brain aging,**** exercise leads to the production of a powerful protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Oakley explains that BDNF protects neurons and synapses (preventing them from deteriorating) and boosts our cognitive functions, including our ability to retain long-term memories. (Shortform note: Exercise doesn’t just supercharge your brain by producing BDNF. It also makes you more alert and attentive, which primes you for learning, and helps you manage mental health issues such as stress and anxiety that can derail your learning.)

**2.** **Give your mind a regular workout too.** Oakley writes that when you challenge your brain by doing or learning something new each day, you encourage neurons to grow and fortify their connections to one another. You can challenge your brain by taking up a hobby, learning a new language, or even performing a simple task like using your non-dominant hand when you brush your teeth. Such challenges create a virtuous learning cycle: They keep your brain from deteriorating, which then allows you to learn even more new things, which further keeps your brain from deteriorating.

(Shortform note: Oakley writes that giving your brain both big and small daily challenges can keep it in peak condition. In particular, she suggests learning a new language, which experts agree is beneficial to the brain—people who speak more than one language tend to be more cognitively agile, have better memories, and may even have bigger brains. Oakley’s other suggestion to brush your teeth using your non-dominant hand may strengthen synapses, but some experts warn that forcing children to switch to their non-dominant hand may lead to an increased risk of schizotypy, a condition that keeps them from forming close relationships.)

#### Barrier #3: Imposter Syndrome

The third barrier to learning new skills is imposter syndrome—**doubting your abilities, feeling like a fraud, and attributing your accomplishments to factors other than your skills and hard work.** Imposter syndrome makes you anxious about taking risks and trying something new. (Shortform note: One expert says imposter syndrome manifests in a number of ways: believing you have to make up for a lack in skill by working extra hard, feeling undeserving of your accomplishments, being afraid that others will find out that you don’t know what you’re doing—which prevents you from asking for help when you need it.)

Oakley says that those who feel imposter syndrome tend to be high achievers or women, many of whom are brought up to think that being modest about their accomplishments is a desirable trait. (Shortform note: In _Lean In_ , Sheryl Sandberg presents proof of Oakley’s assertion, citing studies wherein women rated their performances lower than men rated themselves. Sandberg writes that one reason this happens is because women tend to take negative feedback harder, which affects their self-confidence.)

When you question whether you’re capable of doing something—like making a big career change—think objectively about where that self-doubt is coming from. Reflect on your experiences and assess the strengths that led to your successes. Once you realize that you’re responsible for your achievements, you’ll gain the confidence that will help you tune out negative self-talk and propel you forward in your next phase.

(Shortform note: Aside from being more self-aware and avoiding negative self-talk, you can also manage imposter syndrome with some tips from the American Psychological Association. First, talk about your feelings with supportive, trustworthy people, preferably outside of work. Second, talk about your failures—others are more likely to open up about their struggles if you discuss yours. And third, accept praise from others and display physical reminders of your accomplishments (such as awards) where you can constantly see them.)

#### Barrier #4: Lack of Time or Money

Going back to school to earn a degree (or another one) can open new doors, but for many, the time and financial commitment may be prohibitive.

(Shortform note: One major consideration is whether you would be a part-time or full-time student, both of which have their pros and cons. But even if you can manage your time well enough, is it worth the expense? If you’re thinking of earning a degree in the hopes of getting a higher-paying job, consider the numbers: One report states that most people get their college investment back within 10 years or less after graduation, but around 25% don’t earn it back even after 20 years. To give you a rough idea of your potential return on investment, compute a degree’s Price-to-Earnings Premium. If you’re aiming for an advanced degree, you can get an estimate of your debt-to-income ratio two years after graduation here.)

Oakley has the following tips to get around this obstacle:

**1\. Get a mentor.** According to Oakley, mentors can bring value to both your work and your personal life. You can benefit from having two mentors: One to serve as a cheerleader who encourages you to keep going, and one to give you constructive feedback and keep you accountable. Oakley adds that a person doesn’t have to be an official mentor for you to learn from them. However, if you do ask someone to be your mentor, consider what you bring to the table so that your mentor benefits from the relationship as well.

> **More About Mentors**
> 
> While Oakley says you can benefit from having two mentors, other experts recommend having multiple mentors. This enables you to get different perspectives, gain more insights, and apply what works for you at different stages in your career.
> 
> To find multiple mentors, think about where you want to be five years from now, list down what you’ll need to get there (skills, connections, technical know-how), and reflect on whether there are people in your life who can provide you with the support you need. If you’re coming up blank in some areas, you’ll need to form and nurture new relationships. Once you have a clear picture of what you need and who might be able to provide it, ask each would-be mentor if they would guide you in a specific area such as networking or career goal-setting—by narrowing the scope, you’ll reduce the likelihood that they’ll feel overburdened and increase the chances that they’ll say yes.
> 
> Once you have your mentors lined up, make sure that you have a mutually beneficial relationship, as Oakley suggests. In _Never Eat Alone_ , Keith Ferrazzi says you can give back to your mentor by being loyal to them and letting them know they can rely on you if they need support and by working hard (particularly if your mentor is a higher-up at the same company). You can also give them a thank-you gift or donate to a cause they care about.

**2\. Sign up for a MOOC.** MOOCs, or massive online open courses, are classes you can access through the internet. Oakley writes that there’s a MOOC for virtually anything you want to learn, and some are even offered by prestigious universities. (Shortform note: Since _Mindshift_ was published in 2017, there has been increased interest in MOOCs, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic restricted in-person learning. MOOC providers saw a spike in new users; for instance, Coursera, the top MOOC provider, more than doubled their new users, going from 8 million in 2019 to 20 million in 2020.)

One advantage of taking online classes is they’re free or significantly cheaper than enrolling in an in-person course. Other advantages include flexibility, since you can watch the recorded lessons on your own time, and networking, since you take classes with students from around the world. You also don’t have to limit yourself to one area of study—Oakley says some people take a dozen or more MOOCs at a time to obtain the equivalent of an advanced degree.

(Shortform note: You can customize the MOOCs you take so that you can get the equivalent of a degree, but some employers may still give more weight to an actual degree. If you’ve beefed up your skills using MOOCs instead of traditional schooling, one way to get employers’ attention is through social media: Connect with potential employers (keeping in mind that you might have better luck with smaller companies) and impress them by having a professional profile, sharing certifications, and posting your analysis of the latest industry issues.)

Oakley cautions that there are also disadvantages to MOOCs: Being fully in control of your learning means you might waste time taking classes you don’t need. You should be disciplined enough to make time for the classes and the coursework—no one else is going to push you to do so. Additionally, MOOCs typically don’t give you a recognized degree, even if you do gain the equivalent knowledge. And while MOOCs allow you to connect with fellow students, the online environment doesn’t give you the same kind of interaction you would get from an in-person classroom experience.

(Shortform note: If, after weighing the pros and cons, you decide you’re ready to give MOOCs a try, there are numerous platforms offering a seemingly endless array of classes. Coursera is the biggest platform with over 100 million users, thousands of courses, and hundreds of partners (as of 2023). Udacity works with technology companies and offers training for jobs in tech. Skillshare leans toward courses in creative fields like photography and animation. Even Ivy League universities like Harvard and Yale offer courses online—some for free!)

##### How to Make the Most of MOOCs

Oakley has some advice to help you manage the downsides and maximize your MOOC experience. She says you should first **be clear about your learning goals** , then consider which online courses will help you meet those goals. Do your due diligence and get a full picture of what each course offers, the prerequisites and time commitment it requires, and what reviewers say about it.

One major factor to consider is the instructor. They should be an expert in what you want to learn, use tools (such as powerful visuals, editing, and music) to enhance the online learning experience, and inject humor into the course. Oakley explains that humor not only makes learning more enjoyable but also releases dopamine, which gives your brain a break and thus prevents it from becoming overloaded.

Additionally, Oakley recommends looking for MOOCs that go beyond lectures, offering games, quizzes, and a final project that requires you to apply what you’ve learned. Also check if you’ll have access to discussion forums so you can connect with fellow learners.

> **Increase Your Chances of Completing Your Online Course**
> 
> While being clear about your learning goals, having an engaging instructor, and signing up for innovative classes can make MOOCs more rewarding, there’s a big possibility that you might not finish your chosen course. Data suggests that the completion rates for self-paced courses are anywhere from just three to 15%. (It’s worth noting that this data is from 2019, prior to the MOOC boom during the pandemic.)
> 
> One way to increase your chances of completing a course is to **choose a more structured cohort-based program** , meaning one that you take with a group of people at the same time. Such courses have a much higher completion rate, at 85-90%. This may be because of direct access to instructors and fellow learners as well as typically higher costs, which make learners more invested.
> 
> Another way to help you finish an online course is to **choose one that’s optimized for your smartphone** —learners tend to finish courses faster on smartphones compared to desktop computers, possibly because phones offer more flexibility for learning on the go.

Since signing up for a MOOC is meant to help you manage your time, Oakley asserts that **you** **shouldn’t waste your time finishing a course that doesn’t meet your needs**. She recommends that you try a course for a week and move on if it isn’t a good fit. (Shortform note: Though persistence is an important quality for mindshifters, it’s equally important to know when to quit. One way to determine if you should drop a course is to ask yourself, “Why do I want to quit now?” Reflecting on this will help you recognize if it’s a fleeting urge you should ignore or something more persistent.)

Finally, don’t overwhelm yourself by signing up for too many MOOCs at once—most courses run regularly so you’ll have a chance to take them later on. (Shortform note: Taking too many MOOCs at once could result in cognitive overload, a situation wherein too much information overwhelms your brain. By trying to be hyper-productive and taking too many classes at once, you run the risk of _decreasing_ your thinking capacity. Aside from managing the number of courses you take, you can preserve your mental energy by getting rid of distractions—by muting notifications on apps, for example—and by limiting the decisions you have to make every day. For example, have a salad for lunch every day instead of thinking about what to eat each time.)
