## Exercise: Practice Acknowledging Feelings

Instead of denying a child’s feelings, the authors recommend that parents accept whatever emotions a child expresses, and help the child label them. Here’s some practice diagnosing and responding to negative feelings.

* * *

If your child says, “I played the wrong note on my recorder in music class, and everyone looked at me and laughed. I hate everyone in my class!,” how might they be feeling? What could you say to acknowledge that feeling?

If your child says, “My swim teacher told me I couldn’t move on to the next level, and I have to be a guppy again. I’m so bad at swimming?” how might they be feeling? What could you say to acknowledge that feeling?

How about, “I don’t know whether to be friends with Michael any more. We’ve been friends since kindergarten, but these days he hangs out with some mean kids and isn’t always nice to me. But he asked me to come over to his house tomorrow”?

Now let’s reflect on an experience from your own life. Describe a time recently when your child said something that you found difficult to respond to with empathy. What did you say?

The next time your child says something that makes you upset—like telling you they hate you, or that your family trip to the zoo was stupid—what could you say to acknowledge their feelings? (Remember, the authors emphasize the importance of being open to how your child feels and giving them words to describe their emotions.)
