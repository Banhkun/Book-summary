## Chapter 3: Heartbreak and Mixed Emotions

While her first serious relationship started in a strong place, it deteriorated over the years. She stayed in the relationship for a while because she believed they could solve their differences. When the strains of her relationship began to surface, Kaur’s mother told her that she could do better. Kaur jumped to her lover’s defense. **She believed that their love would be able to endure the issues they were facing.** She thought that she would never experience love with anyone else in the way that she experienced it with him.

However, they ultimately couldn’t salvage their relationship. This resulted in a nasty breakup that caused a variety of emotions to surface.**** He said that if the universe wanted them to be together, they would get back together. Kaur rejected this premise. She knew that relationships could only thrive if both parties wanted them to. Immediately following the split,**she grappled with her mixed feelings and tried to hold onto the self-worth she’d begun to build.**

### Seeing the Toxicity

**After they broke up, Kaur noticed the red flags she had ignored throughout their relationship.** Her partner had sometimes claimed to have to stay at work for a few extra hours but wasn’t at the office when Kaur checked. He grew more distant and even said another woman’s name in bed. Her love for him blinded her to the less desirable qualities he had.

She realized that he didn’t have a lot of respect for women. He would degrade other women in private and would only say “I love you” when he wanted to have sex. She had become a sex object to him rather than a human being. She gave him all of her love and energy. In return, he used her for what he wanted, then ignored her as he slept with other people. His love for her was gone. He was just afraid of being alone.

Ultimately, she realized that her ex was a selfish lover. **He wanted her to fulfill his needs, but he never had any regard for hers.** Whereas she had begun to feel like an independent woman at the beginning of their relationship, she began to feel less than whole being around him. The distance he kept and the way that he used her started to take a toll on her self-worth. He didn’t intend to commit to her. Instead, he threw her aside when the relationship wasn’t convenient for him.

### The Mixed Emotions

**Part of Kaur wanted nothing to do with her ex after the breakup.** She claimed she didn’t need him anymore. She was done with his lying and disrespect. This side of her emotions led her to claim that her ex would regret losing her. She said that she had so much to offer him, but he refused to take it. She said that he would struggle to love another woman because he would long for the one he lost.

**However, another part of her desperately wanted him back.** When she had romantic or sexual encounters following their breakup, her mind would race back to him. Even when she tried to remove him from her life, her thoughts would always come back to him. She longed for him to return to her bed and be a part of her life. While she would wake up some mornings feeling as though she had moved on, the loneliness she would experience at night made her want him to return.

She implies that he came back once or twice, but the result was more heartache and pain. He asked to be friends, but she couldn’t come to terms with that. **She wanted all of him or nothing at all.** Every time he returned, she felt the heartbreak all over again because she wanted something from him that he was not prepared to give: commitment.

### Holding Onto Self-Worth

**Despite the intense emotions she felt following the breakup, Kaur worked to maintain the self-worth she had built.** By the end, he had treated her like she was a commodity to be used and left instead of a partner to care for and support. She knew that she was worth more than that. She didn’t want to be something he just wanted to fool around with. She wanted a relationship where he needed to be with her and gave her the respect she deserved.

While she felt mixed emotions about the breakup, she didn’t regret it ending.**** She knew the longer she was with him, the less she would love herself. She was giving too much of herself trying to make the relationship work. **She accepted that if he didn’t want her, then nothing she did was going to change that.** She stopped questioning what else she could have done to keep him and accepted that he was simply not able to handle everything that she was giving to him.

**She realized that the only person that could make her feel whole was herself.** She stopped trying to build her life around another person and started focusing on building a life around herself. When she stepped back, she noticed that many of the qualities she loved about her ex were actually just reflections of her own actions and affections. She had taught him how to love her by loving herself. When she realized that, she once again felt whole.
