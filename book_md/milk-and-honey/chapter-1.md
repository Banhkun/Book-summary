## Chapter 1: Abuse and Oppression

When asked about her tendency to show kindness, Kaur explains that people weren’t kind to her growing up and she doesn’t want to make anyone else feel the way she felt. She believes everyone is capable of love, yet many choose to be toxic.

She compares her journey through childhood to someone pinning her legs to the ground then demanding she stand. She felt as though people expected a lot from her while actively working against her instead of supporting her. **Throughout her childhood, she experienced the fallout of a distant father, gender oppression, and sexual assault.**

### A Distant Father

**Kaur states that your father is supposed to be the first man you love, but that she didn’t have that experience because she never connected to her father.** Kaur’s father was an alcoholic. She explains that there’s no such thing as an alcoholic parent. Instead, there are just alcoholics who fail to parent. When they would speak, her father often screamed at her. He claimed this was out of love, but this confused Kaur. She began to associate love with aggression. In fact, she began to develop angry tendencies like those of her father.

While Kaur had to beg her father to have a relationship, her mother showered her with love and affection. This difference in their approach to attention and affection caused her parents to fight. **All at once, she was the thing that kept them together, and the thing that split them apart.** Because of their constant fighting, she couldn’t tell if her mother was scared of her father or in love with him. To Kaur, it all looked the same.

**She related to her father through their shared inability to share their feelings with one another.** When she got older, she would try to talk with her father over the phone, but their conversations would usually just consist of small talk. She always wanted to tell him that she didn’t blame him for his distance but never could. She knew that his behavior was a product of his upbringing and hardships in life. His attempts at small talk were his way of saying “I love you.” Kaur knew this because she used small talk in the same way.

### Gender Oppression

**Growing up, Kaur and her mother were told to be silent.** Any time Kaur would try to speak up, her father and other men in her life would shut her down. Her father was afraid of her voice, so she grew to be afraid of it too. This may have been because her father taught her that women having an opinion made them less desirable to the rest of society.

**Because she was told to stay silent, Kaur began to view herself as unimportant.** She would look at herself in the mirror and tell herself that she was nothing. When she tried to convince herself that she was allowed to exist and have an opinion, her insecurities would silence her. She submitted to the demands of the men in her life and remained silent and unseen throughout her childhood.

### Sexual Assault

It’s through this demand for submission that Kaur asserts that women have been taught that sex is similar to a pit stop for men.**** They may come and go as they please, but they never have to stay for long. In her own experiences, she couldn’t draw the connection between sex and love for a long time.

The first boy Kaur kissed held her down and forced himself on her. She was five years old at the time. **After this, Kaur believed that her body wasn’t her own. Instead, her body was meant to be given to those who wanted it.** She explains that the boy was a product of the household he was living in. His father’s sexual demands towards his mother taught him that sex was a man’s right and a woman’s obligation. Kaur relates to the boy’s mother through the emptiness Kaur felt after the forced encounter.

**As a child, Kaur was raped by her uncle.** She recalls her assault in graphic detail. In one therapy session, her therapist asked her to point to the area her uncle touched her. She noticed that the doll was about the same size as the girls her uncle liked to abuse. After she explained her uncle’s actions, her therapist asked how she was feeling. She said that she felt numb.

**For a while, her trauma led her to feel unsafe in sexual or physical situations, even when they were safe and consensual.** She would sometimes flinch when someone touched her because she was afraid it was her abuser. Though it took time, she did overcome her trauma. It significantly impacted her life, but she didn’t let it destroy her.
