## Exercise: Love Yourself

Kaur asserts that the only way to feel fulfilled in life is to love yourself.

* * *

Describe a recent relationship or close friendship in which you felt you gave more love than you got.

Now, think of your personal emotional state during that relationship. Did you feel like a complete person or were you relying on someone else to validate or fulfill you? Did you feel as though you deserved a significant amount of love?

Finally, take a moment to think about the ways that loving yourself could have helped you in that relationship. Think about discovering self-worth, accepting that you deserve love that doesnâ€™t hurt, and embracing your own identity (gender, cultural, racial, and so on).
