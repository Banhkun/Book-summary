## Chapter 4: America’s Advantages

America has a lot of natural advantages when it comes to the possibility of revolution. **There will never be a greater chance of success than there is right now, and if Americans do not seize the opportunity, they leave themselves open to more oppression from England or violent takeover from somewhere else.**

In this chapter, we’ll examine these advantages and discuss America’s future and potential.

### Arguments for Immediate Revolution

America has never been in a better place than it is right now to commit to revolution because:

  * **The people are united.**
  * **There are enough citizens to hold off any army against them and not so many that there are too many towns to defend.**
    * If there were more Americans, the colonies might also be less united. Each colony, were it to expand, would be governed by increasingly unique interests. 
  * America has no navy, but England would never allow it to build one, so this would not change no matter how long it waits to declare independence.



America is also in a great position to start building a navy once it does declare independence, with ample resources and capital available. America will eventually lead the world in ship building, because no power in Europe has the coastline or the internal materials. Furthermore, America does not need to have nearly as many ships as England to establish naval dominance because they don’t have an empire to rule over—they are not stretched so thin. Americans should begin the process of building up their naval fleet now, so as to be protected long into the future.

  * America has no debts and as such is in a position where it can incur some in the war effort.
    * All nations should eventually have some debt so long as it doesn’t bear too much interest, because a national debt creates a shared bond and commitment.
    * As opposed to America, Britain has significant debts on which it pays significant interest.
  * The fewer Americans there are, the more land remains unoccupied. This is important because it can, after the war and independence, be both used to service America’s debt and expanded into to support America’s government. 
  * **England is governed by fear; they have a lot to lose. America only has potential gain.**



When other nations did not seize upon their opportunities to form a government, they left themselves open for conquerors and lost the potential to have freedom. America should learn from those mistakes.

### A Declaration of Independence

A declaration of independence is needed, which should keep in mind these four points:

  1. When any two nations are at war sometimes others will step in and mediate, but for as long as America is a colony of Britain’s, no mediation can occur. Custom dictates that European powers won’t interfere with colonial battles for independence like this one.
  2. France or Spain can’t be expected to help America either, for the same reason as point number one.
  3. It is likely that some other nations will consider America rebels because America will be dangerous to their own peace.
  4. A manifesto should thus be published and sent to foreign courts that details the abuses that America has received at the hands of Britain and all of the peaceful attempts that America has made to get to a resolution. Unfortunately, the custom will maintain that all courts will be against America until America is declared a sovereign nation. 



While other nations may be wary of supporting the American revolutionaries based on their own interests, **a free America will be unlikely to engage in too much armed conflict, especially with other republics** that will hopefully use the forthcoming model of American governance as a model.

  * (Shortform note: This concept is an early example of what would come to be known as the “Democratic Peace Theory”: that democracies are unlikely to engage in armed conflict with other democracies due to the mutual understanding that war is a draining proposition and the lack of interest in conquest without monarchs or dictators involved. Other early adopters of this concept were philosopher Immanuel Kant in _Perpetual Peace_ and Alexis de Tocqueville in _Democracy in America._)
