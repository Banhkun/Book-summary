## Addendum: Message to the Quakers

(Shortform note: Paine writes a message to the Quakers in an attempt to gain their support for the revolution and explain the guiding principles of peace, despite the necessity of war. He also chastises them for their lack of support. Thomas Paine himself was born into a Quaker family. Most Quakers eventually remained pacifist during the war and refused to support any efforts.)

**The Quakers should support the war effort despite their stated pacifism, because it will lead to eternal peace.** Quakers aren’t committed to peace just because of their religion, it’s also natural, and the wish of people of all religions. The goal of the pamphlet and of the revolution is peace forever, and this will be impossible without a full break from England. There are multiple reasons why the Quakers should join the war effort:

  * The fighting is not for revenge, conquest, plundering, or anything but peace—in fact, America is already being attacked on American land by the British. 
  * The Quakers’ scruples with the independence effort aren’t rooted in any scripture—conscience should be what Quakers lead with, rather than an anti-conflict stance no matter the situation. 



The principles of Quakerism make the Quakers inoffensive to everyone, including governments that are tyrannical. This makes them helpful to tyrants and makes their statements about wishing to live in a free and fair society not line up with their actions, in which Paine accuses them of choosing profit over their country. America as it is constituted under the tyranny of England does not allow for civil and religious rights.
