## Exercise: Improve Your Response to Danger

Think about how you recently reacted to danger and how you can react more appropriately to such danger in the future.

* * *

Think of a time when you faced immediate danger or a threat to your well-being. What was your reaction? Did you fight, run away, or freeze?

In hindsight, was your response appropriate to the danger? Why or why not?

What could you do next time youâ€™re in a dangerous situation or under threat to ensure you make the best decision? Recall that Poumpouras recommends thinking about fears rationally and questioning the appropriateness of your typical fear response in the moment.
