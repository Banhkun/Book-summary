## Chapter 3: Engaged Employees Do Better

Once again, **engagement is an intrinsic, deep-rooted commitment** to the job, organization, team, manager, and customer. Engaged employees work hard for the sake of the organization and because they feel fulfilled. Engagement buffers against short-term changes in motivation, like time pressure and equipment failures.

To picture the difference between engagement and motivation, imagine that a team is working to meet a deadline. An equipment failure makes it impossible to meet the goal. Do they keep soldiering on trying to achieve the most, or do they give up?

Engaged people do the first, motivated the second.

### How Engaged Employees Do Better

Engaged employees tend to do the following:

  * Bring new ideas to work and suggest improvements
  * Take initiative
  * Exceed goals and expectations
  * Are growth-oriented, seeking to improve the self and people around them
  * Encourage and support team members
  * Overcome obstacles
  * Show high levels of discretionary effort
  * Speak with pride about the organization
  * Act as though they have ownership in the business



The benefits extend beyond the employee to the organization as well. Studies show that higher engagement associates with increased profitability, higher customer satisfaction, lower turnover, reduced fraud, and reduced absenteeism.

Unfortunately, studies of employers nationwide show that the **majority of American workers are disengaged from their work**. They don’t embody the desired qualities above. Clearly, more employers need to find ways to re-engage their employees with their work.

### What Increases Engagement

So you know that engagement is important. But how do you increase engagement?

Surveys of engaged employees show **these factors improve engagement in the workplace** :

  * Mutual respect with employer and supervisor
  * Trust from supervisor and lack of micromanagement
  * Feeling of impact within the company and outside
  * Positive recognition for work and a sense that the company values their work
  * Potential for growth
  * Clear objectives



In contrast, **these factors lower engagement in the workplace** :

  * A selfish, untrustworthy manager that takes credit for work
  * Unrealistic expectations
  * Lack of coaching and feedback
  * Managers that don’t deserve respect
  * Lack of value signaling, from not saying hello to compliments
  * Doing work that doesn’t seem to add value
  * Lack of vision of company direction



Surprisingly, less than 2% of people mentioned money as a reason for disengagement!
