## Chapter 10: Consideration

Consideration is giving careful thought to a person. Acknowledging that the person is human and not just a cog develops loyalty, not just in the recipient but also in teammates who witness considerate behavior. This inspires people to show up for work other than to receive a paycheck.

In contrast, acts of selfishness by the company promote tit for tat behavior. The employee has little faith the company cares. **If the company doesn’t care about the employee, why should the employee care about the company?**

**Building a personal connection with employees is important to pave the way for consideration opportunities.** The more connected an employee feels to her supervisor, the more she’ll open about personal issues, which will create opportunities for consideration by the supervisor. This creates a virtuous cycle.

### Actionables for Consideration

  * Ask specific questions about the employee’s life to demonstrate interest and learn more. This provides more opportunities to be considerate, since they feel more comfortable brining personal issues to you (within reason).
  * Notice when employees are not themselves and tell them you’re concerned.
  * Show proactive consideration by connecting the employee to things she would like.
  * Ask employees for input before big decisions that affect their jobs.
  * Reinforce team members who act considerately.
  * Encourage employees to go home when sick.
  * Be empathetic and flexible during personal or family issues. Trust the person to make the right decision for the job, and don’t treat her like a slacker.
  * **Benefit more than just the employee** , like the company that gave Turkey dinners to all employees.
  * Deliver bad news personally.
  * Support employees’ goals outside of work, like the company that gave each employee $10 for every pound lost, and paid for discounts off memberships to Weight Watchers.
  * Shut off your phone when talking with employees.
  * Begin meetings on time and end early if possible.
  * Ask staff how to shorten meetings or limit attendance.
  * Celebrate birthdays and work anniversaries.
  * Support creature comforts – make the work environment comfortable, not noisy, and give food when they’re pushing extra hard.
  * Set up flexible work times so the employee can schedule work at her convenience.
  * Let people personalize their workspace, bringing in photos.
