## Chapter 11: Trust

Trust is confidence in a person and absence of questioning of the person’s motives.

Trust engenders engagement by giving the employee more ownership over her work and not wanting to let the supervisor down. Trusted employees feel more comfortable pitching risky ideas, and they’re more receptive to change as they believe the employer has the employees’ best interests at heart.

In a culture of distrust, ideas are not shared for fear of others exploiting or disparaging them. Motives are constantly questioned – “what is this person up to now?” Untrusting people assume the worst. It crowds out productive thinking.

Some people start out trusting by default, but for others, trust takes years to build. A single mistrustful step can shatter trust like pottery.

### Actionables for Trust

  * Provide autonomy and decision-making authority (see Empowerment above).
  * Keep your word on promises and commitments.
  * Give bad news directly to an employee without sugarcoating; don’t let gossip spread.
  * Let employees spend company money within certain limits.
  * Reassure anxious employees that you trust them to do the work.
  * Avoid signaling mistrust through micromanagement or intense monitoring programs. Posing constraints makes people look for ways to circumvent them.
  * Give credit where credit is due; don’t misattribute credit.
  * **Explain thoroughly when you override someone else’s decision** , or they won’t trust you to uphold their decisions in the future.
  * Probe when you feel an employee suddenly starts treating you differently, like withholding information – she may not trust you enough to confide.
  * Admit mistakes when you make them, and accept responsibility when your team fails.
  * If you’ve messed up, admit that you were wrong, apologize, and ask for another chance. Take personal responsibility rather than finger pointing.
  * If you’re starting with a negative reputation, address this upfront and get back to neutral ASAP.

**Conclusion**

Leaders earn RESPECT by practicing it everyday. Leaders tend to overestimate how much respect they give, especially since they rarely receive direct feedback about their interpersonal problems.

If you have a problem, the first step is to be aware of the problem and admit that it exists.
