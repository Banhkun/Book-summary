## 1-Page Summary

Everyone dreams of achieving extraordinary things. However, Matthew Dicks argues that most of us end up being mediocre because we see our goals as _abstract_ and _distant_ —things we _might_ be able to achieve _at some point_ , but not right now. This mindset makes us delay taking action toward our goals, and consequently, we never reach them. In _Someday Is Today_ , Dicks argues that achieving your dreams and overcoming mediocrity _is_ possible, but only if you learn to maximize your time, efficiency, productivity, and creativity, and start acting _now_.

Dicks works in many fields, but first and foremost, he’s a productivity expert. He had a challenging childhood and learned how to be highly productive while working two full-time jobs and simultaneously completing two full-time university programs. Currently, he works full time as an elementary school teacher while also pursuing numerous creative outlets. He’s a best-selling author of non-fiction books like _Storyworthy _(about the art of storytelling)__ and novels like _Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend, Something Missing, and Unexpectedly Milo_. He’s also an accomplished teller of Moth stories (true stories from your life recited from memory within five minutes), having won 48 StorySLAMS and six GrandSLAMS storytelling championships. Further, he’s a playwright, blogger, columnist, and DJ.

In this guide, we’ll explore Dicks’s tips for accomplishing extraordinary things. In Part 1, we’ll explore his recommendations for maximizing your time and efficiency so you can spend less time on mundane tasks and more time on things that really matter to you. In Part 2, we’ll discuss his tips for maximizing your productivity and creative potential so you can become as successful as possible, as soon as possible. In our commentary, we’ll supplement Dicks’s recommendations with input from other productivity and creativity experts like Brené Brown (_Daring Greatly) _and Tiago Forte (_Building a Second Brain)._

### Part 1: Maximize Your Time and Efficiency

**To reach your full potential and accomplish extraordinary things, Dicks says you must first learn how to make the most of your time**. Stop wasting time on _unnecessary_ tasks, accomplish _necessary_ tasks as quickly as possible, and reap the most benefits from the tasks you spend time on. In this section, we’ll explore Dicks’s five main principles for doing so.

#### Principle #1: Differentiate Between Important and Irrelevant Tasks

First, Dicks recommends **disregarding irrelevant tasks and focusing on things that are truly important to _you_** —not to your boss, your friends, or any other outside entity. He explains that we waste time on irrelevant tasks because we make decisions based on our current thoughts and feelings, which are largely influenced by our environments (like the people around us), not what we truly want or what’s best for us long term.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism, _Greg McKeown also recommends eliminating nonessential tasks to make more time for things that are truly important to _you_ —not someone else. However, his explanation for why people struggle to do this differs from Dicks’s. First, he attributes this struggle to the societal pressure to always say “yes”—saying “no” makes us feel like we're breaking the rules. Further, he notes that many people have the flawed view that _everything_ is important and that they’re _obligated_ to do everything—in reality, most things are _nonessential,_ and you can always _choose_ what you do or don’t do.)

**To avoid wasting time on tasks that _feel_ important but are actually irrelevant, Dicks recommends only performing tasks that would matter to your future self.** This will ensure you’re spending time on things that truly matter to _you_ (not someone else) and benefit you in the _long term_. To enlarge your perspective ask yourself: Would the task at hand be important to your 100-year-old self? Would they _want_ you to do it? Or, would they recommend that you spend that time doing something else?

For example, consider the task of repainting your house with your family. If your 100-year-old self values _constructive_ family time, this is likely something they’d want you to do—you won’t have your family around forever, so make the most of time with them while you can and do something productive in the process. However, if your 100-year-old self values family _leisure_ time over doing _constructive_ tasks, they’d likely see the painting element of the plan as irrelevant and advise you to spend the time hiking (a leisure activity) with your family instead.

> **Visualize Your Future Self to Guide Your Current Actions**
> 
> In _Be Your Future Self Now, _Benjamin Hardy suggests determining the importance of a task  by imagining who you want to be in the future. In Hardy’s view, a task is only important if it helps you become your ideal, most successful future self.
> 
> Before __ using your future self to guide your actions, Hardy recommends performing a visualization exercise to clearly identify _who_ your future self is, what’s _important_ to them, and what they’ve _accomplished_ in life (their goals and achievements). This preliminary step is crucial because Hardy explains that your future self won’t be the same person that you _currently_ are—they’ll be the better version of you. So to make accurate decisions that benefit your future self (and not just your current self), you must first get a clear idea of who they are and what they want.
> 
> To visualize this person, Hardy first recommends picturing the happiest, most productive and successful future version of yourself (which could be your 100-year-old self, as Dicks recommends). Figure out what kind of life you want this future you to have and what will be important to them (their values), so you can use these elements to guide your current actions.
> 
> Next, Hardy says to identify the _big, life-changing goals_ that your future self has accomplished that led to success and happiness. These are the goals you should strive to meet going forward. For example, maybe your future self worked for a prestigious newspaper, made lots of money, and retired early so they could spend time with their family—these are the accomplishments that allowed them to live the life you envisioned.
> 
> Identifying both the values _and_ accomplishments of your future self will provide you with the clearest framework to guide your current actions and accurately judge what’s important to you and what’s irrelevant. For example, only considering your future self’s _values_ might lead you to skip a work conference for a family vacation because your future self values family time. However, also considering your future self’s ideal life and _accomplishments_ (such as making enough money to retire early) could make you realize that attending the conference advances your career so you can retire early and spend more family time in the long term. Therefore, attending it is the best choice.

##### Tip #1: Recruit Others to Handle Necessary But Unimportant Tasks

Dicks recognizes that certain tasks must get done even if they’re _not_ important to you. For example, repainting the house might not be important, but it must be done to prevent home damage. **To manage necessary but unimportant tasks, recruit others to help you**. You can do this in one of three ways:

  * Pay someone to do the task for you.
  * Assign the tasks to a subordinate or willing party—for example, an employee, apprentice, or friend.
  * Ask someone to help you complete the task so you accomplish it faster.



> **Delegate Tasks by Crowdsourcing**
> 
> Dicks’s methods to delegate necessary but unimportant tasks may be inaccessible to some people—you may not have the money to hire local workers with high wage expectations, you may not have subordinates to delegate to, and your friends might eventually get tired of doing work for or with you. However, if your task can be completed digitally, _crowdsourcing_ offers a low-cost, effective solution to these issues. Rather than hiring local people _at their desired rate_ or relying on subordinates and friends to delegate work to, crowdsourcing allows you to post jobs online _at your desired rate_ and recruit people from around the world.
> 
> In _Bold, _Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler argue that crowdsourcing is a good form of task delegation because it’s cost-effective. You can hire people for low rates because online, you can recruit workers from less developed countries where the cost of living, and therefore desired wages, are lower. Further, crowdsourcing provides you with easy access to experts experienced in your specific task—something that can be challenging when recruiting help in person.

#### Principle #2: Minimize the Duration of Routine Tasks

Second, Dicks recommends **_minimizing_ the amount of time you spend on recurring, routine tasks**—such as doing laundry or cleaning the dishes—regardless of whether they’re subjectively important or not. Dicks explains that since you perform these tasks repeatedly, they could take up large portions of your life. Getting them done faster will create more free time that you can devote to pursuing your goals.

> **Minimize Tasks by Monitoring the Time Spent on Them**
> 
> In _The Effective Executive, _Peter Drucker reiterates the importance of minimizing time spent on routine tasks to increase your overall productivity. However, he notes that _before_ you can truly optimize your efficiency in completing routine tasks, you must first track how much time you currently spend doing them. This is because our sense of time is often distorted—we under or overestimate how long we actually spent on a task, and we have a skewed view of what we were _actually_ doing during that time frame. This can cause us to overlook tasks that should be optimized because we think we’re already efficient enough at them.
> 
> For example, you might _think_ you spent 10 minutes doing laundry, but you actually spent 15 minutes on this task. Further, while you _think_ you were doing laundry the entire time, you actually spent three of the 15 minutes texting. You won’t optimize doing the laundry unless you figure out the discrepancy between your assumptions and reality.

Dicks presents three main tips to minimize the time you spend on routine tasks:

##### Tip #1: Create Efficient Systems and Routines for Completing Tasks

**Dicks notes that using systems and routines to complete tasks will help you streamline the process and save time**. For example, reduce the time it takes to dress your child in the morning by creating an organization system for their clothing—that way, you won’t have to waste time looking for certain items. Further, create a dressing routine that streamlines the process and ensures you don’t forget anything—brush their teeth, comb their hair, put on their socks, underwear, pants, and shirt, and then put on their shoes.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown also recommends using systems and routines to boost your efficiency, and he gives a few additional recommendations to ensure that they’re effective. Complete the hardest parts of the system or routine first so you keep your momentum and don’t dread completing hard tasks at the end of the day. Further, alter your routine slightly each day of the week to avoid boredom. Finally, implement one new system or routine at a time so you don’t get overwhelmed.)

##### Tip #2: Minimize Decision-Making

**Minimize time-consuming decision-making by planning choices in advance and limiting your options, Dicks recommends.** For example, you might currently spend 30 minutes every night rummaging through the cabinets and deciding what to make for dinner. Instead, pick three starches, three vegetables, and three proteins for the week and eat them in different combinations so you don't spend time coming up with and preparing complex meals.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Thinking Clearly, _Rolf Dobelli agrees that having too many options —and therefore having to make more decisions—can waste time. He explains that having too many options paralyzes you with the fear of making the wrong choice, which leads to inaction. It can also cause you to lower your standards—you might get overwhelmed and prioritize making quick decisions blindly rather than taking the time to choose the best option.)

##### Tip #3: Multitask When Possible

**Dicks notes that multitasking will help you get more things done at once so you have more free time to dedicate toward your goals**. For example, instead of taking 10 minutes to eat dinner and then another 10 minutes to review tomorrow's schedule, review the schedule _while_ you eat dinner.

(Shortform note: While Dicks recommends multitasking to save time, Gary Keller warns in _The One Thing _that multitasking can actually waste time _._ He argues that multitasking decreases your effectiveness by splitting your focus. It also skews your perception of time and can trigger mistakes and bad decisions. For example, if you review your schedule during your 10-minute dinnertime, you might end up taking more time to finish your meal, making you late for an appointment; overeating because you’re not paying attention to how much you’re consuming; or missing that you double-booked an appointment for the next day because you were focused on your meal.)

#### Principle #3: Focus on the Macro Rather Than the Micro

Third, Dicks suggests **focusing on the big picture rather than a task’s details.** He explains that people waste time by focusing on small details that they _think_ are important but that don’t really matter. They do so because they desire perfection—they think every small detail needs to be immaculate _._ However, this wastes time because most tasks and projects _don't_ need to be perfect—they just need to get done.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree that perfectionism can cause people to waste time by focusing on unimportant, small-scale details rather than essential, big-picture aspects. However, they note that being a perfectionist and focusing on the micro-details has benefits as well. For example, it helps people avoid making silly mistakes and increases curiosity which, by default, increases knowledge.)

To avoid the trap of perfectionism and micro-analyzing, Dicks offers two tips:

##### Tip #1: Stop Worrying About What Others Think

Dicks explains that people often focus on unimportant details—like whether they should wear red lipstick or clear lip gloss—because they’re concerned about how others will perceive them based on their appearance, level of effort, and so on. Realistically, this is a waste of time because people don't pay attention to these things.

(Shortform note: In _Daring Greatly, _Brené Brown agrees that overcoming concerns about others’ opinions is critical to eliminating perfectionism, and she presents three ways to do so. First, be kind and supportive of yourself instead of criticizing yourself or imagining others’ criticism. Second, remember that you’re not alone—everyone has experienced feelings of inadequacy, even people you might view as “perfect.” Third, stay focused on the present to avoid getting sucked into negative thoughts that trigger perfectionism.)

##### Tip #2: Consider the Impact of the Task

**Second, Dicks recommends, consider whether doing something will _actually_ impact the end result—**if it wouldn’t, don’t do it. For example, adding a fancy border to your work report might make it look nice, but it won’t change the content of the report or whether your boss will understand it. Spending time on this detail is wasteful—disregard it and move on to something that actually matters.

(Shortform note: Even if completing a task would improve your project, it still might not be worth pursuing if doing so would have other negative outcomes—for instance, if it has a high financial cost for only minimal gain. For example, spending $100 to get your report professionally edited might make its content slightly easier to understand, but it’s likely your report would have been “good enough” even without this expensive intervention.)

#### Principle #4: Optimize Sleep

Next, Dicks advises **minimizing the time you spend sleeping while maximizing the amount of rest you get**. Sleeping takes up more time than any other routine task—therefore, optimizing your sleep will save you the most time.

Unoptimized sleep wastes time in two ways:

  1. We spend more time in bed than necessary—either because we sleep for too long or spend time in bed doing things other than sleeping, like using our phones.
  2. We do things that disrupt our sleep schedule, and therefore, our sleep quality—like going to bed and waking up at different times every day. This wastes time by making us sleepy and causing brain fog at times when we _should_ be awake and productive.



Dicks recommends two tips to ensure you get the most rest in the least amount of time:

##### Tip #1: Create a Sleep Schedule and Stick to It

**Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day without fail.** Sleeping and waking at different times each day confuses your body and reduces your sleep quality. If there are times when you have to go to sleep later or wake up earlier, Dicks says to stick to your schedule as much as you can—even if you go to bed late, wake up at your designated time, and if you need to wake up early, go to bed at your designated time.

(Shortform note: In _Why We Sleep, _Matthew Walker reiterates the importance of following a schedule to optimize sleep. He explains that our bodies have a natural sleep schedule called a circadian rhythm, which makes some people predisposed to falling asleep later while others fall asleep earlier. Other experts explain that changing these natural patterns is hard and attempting to do so can decrease sleep quality (and cause many of the negative side effects Dicks discusses). So, rather than _creating_ a schedule and _training_ your body to follow it, as Dicks recommends, it may be more beneficial to identify your natural circadian rhythm and structure your sleep schedule around it.)

##### Tip #2: Take Precautions to Get Good Sleep

**Second, Dicks recommends engaging in behaviors that promote good sleep—** exercise during the day to release energy, create a wind-down routine before bed to prepare your body for rest, sleep with white noise, and make sure the room’s a comfortable temperature at 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Your body and mind will be ready to fall asleep as soon as you get into bed, so you won’t waste any time.

> **Building on Dicks’s Sleep Strategies**
> 
> Many of Dicks’s recommendations for how to get good sleep are shared by sleep experts, who provide additional details to ensure you get the _best_ sleep possible.
> 
> First, some sleep scientists argue that certain exercises are more effective at promoting sleep than others. Cardio, resistance exercises (like weightlifting), and yoga may be most effective for improving sleep quality. Cardio and resistance exercises also improve blood pressure and reduce stress and anxiety, while yoga reduces pain in the neck and back.
> 
> Second, some experts specify that your wind-down routine should start one to two hours before your bedtime for maximum effect.
> 
> Finally, some sleep scientists note that while 65 degrees Fahrenheit is generally a good temperature for sleep, the “ideal” temperature may vary from person to person. Ultimately, keeping the thermostat set between 60 and 67 degrees should be fine.
> 
> Note that some experts _don’t agree that white noise increases sleep quality_. Instead, it may _disrupt_ sleep quality by preventing the brain from fully switching off.

##### Tip #3: Sleep Less

Dicks contends that many people think they need more sleep than they actually do. After following the aforementioned suggestions to ensure your sleep is productive, he suggests reducing the time you spend sleeping to see if you wake up well-rested. For example, cut your sleep time by 30 minutes one week, then an hour the next—you might even be able to sleep as little as five and a half hours per night, as Dicks does.

(Shortform note: Dicks recommends sleeping less, but he doesn’t specify what your ultimate sleep time goal should be. Experts elaborate that the amount of sleep you require mostly depends on your age—teenagers (14 to 17 years) need eight to 10 hours per night, adults (18 to 64 years) need seven to nine hours per night, and older adults (65 years and over) need seven to eight hours per night. Further, they explain that getting six hours of sleep or less per night (as Dicks does) can be detrimental, causing a poor mood, lower quality of life, impaired physical performance, and health problems like obesity and heart issues.)

#### Principle #5: Stop Spending Time on Negative People

Finally, **minimize the time you spend engaging with and thinking about negative people,** Dicks recommends.**** When you _do_ spend time with them, you waste time thinking about things that don’t matter, like what caused their harmful behavior or whether you deserved it. Further, their negative behavior can rub off on you and cause _you_ to be more negative—more self-doubting, more unmotivated, and so on—which sabotages your productivity.

(Shortform note: In _Be Your Future Self Now,_ Benjamin Hardy agrees that the people you spend time with impact your ability to succeed. However, rather than focusing on managing the negative people in your life, Hardy emphasizes building new connections with people who are _better than you_ or embody your ideal self. When you spend time with these people, their positive behaviors will rub off on you, and you’ll learn how to become successful from watching their strategies.)

Dicks presents three main tips for managing negative people so you don't waste time thinking about them.

##### Tip #1: Try To Understand Them

Dicks explains that **understanding _why_ someone acted negatively will make it easier for you to forgive them** and stop thinking about the situation. Further, even if you can’t forgive them, understanding them will put the issue to rest in your mind. This technique is most helpful when the offender is someone you have to remain in contact with.

##### Tip #2: Avoid Them

**If you can’t understand the other person, Dicks recommends avoiding them**.**** Do this by either removing them from your life or creating boundaries to minimize your exposure to them. For example, if your parents frequently invite themselves over for dinner just to criticize your home and your cooking, create a boundary where they can’t come over any more—you’ll go to them. This will prevent further criticisms that will plague your thoughts.

(Shortform note: Some experts reiterate Dicks’s recommendations here. However, they argue that before blaming negativity on others and taking action against them, it’s important to understand yourself and your emotions: Consider whether _you_ might be the underlying problem. For example, you might label tardy people as “negative” and forgive or avoid them to protect your peace. However, _their_ _tardiness_ isn’t the real issue—everyone is tardy sometimes, and you can’t realistically remove every tardy person from your life. Instead, the underlying issue is _your_ _negative response_ —you don’t need to get angry whenever someone’s late. A more sustainable solution in this case is to address _your_ negative reaction.)

##### Tip #3: Add Them to an Adversaries List

If someone did something so horrible to you that you can’t understand them and avoiding them doesn’t prevent you from thinking about them, Dicks recommends adding them to a list of adversaries. This will help you put your thoughts about them aside for now. In the future, you can try again to understand them, or you can plan your revenge.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree that setting an issue aside for a while is a good idea because it helps you develop new perspectives on the situation, which can foster mutual understanding. However, saving an issue for later with the intention of _getting revenge_ isn’t recommended. While revenge can provide catharsis in the moment, it doesn’t rid you of negative feelings. Instead, it starts an endless cycle of retribution, causing you to waste _more time_ on negative feelings.)

### Part 2: Maximize Your Productivity and Reach Your Full Potential

Now that you’ve eliminated time-wasters and increased your efficiency on necessary tasks, Dicks argues **you must learn how to maximize your productivity and reach your full potential** so you can become as successful as possible, as soon as possible. In the following sections, we’ll discuss Dicks’s top six principles for doing so.

#### Principle #1: Use Every Spare Moment to Do Something Productive

First, Dicks suggests **using _every spare moment_ to make progress toward your goals. **He explains that most people struggle to make progress because they feel like they don’t have time to be productive, or they’re waiting for the right conditions—for example, a quiet space, an hour’s time block, the “right” hour of the day, and so on. However, these are just excuses to delay taking action. You don’t need perfect conditions to get started: All you need is a few minutes of free time.

For example, if you’re waiting for your professor to start her lesson, pull out your notebook and start brainstorming your next creative project—even if you only have a few minutes, you’ll be a few minutes closer to reaching your goal.

(Shortform note: Using _every spare moment_ to do something productive might be counterproductive because it leaves no time for breaks. In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey explains that rest—not just sleep, but restful breaks throughout the day—is essential to productivity because it increases your working memory capacity and your ability to focus on and perform tasks effectively. Consequently, Bailey recommends taking a 15-minute break every 90 minutes or so. During this time, don’t perform any tasks (even menial ones like scrolling on social media)—just let your brain wander.)

#### Principle #2: Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket

Second, **avoid** **putting all your eggs in one basket,** Dicks suggests.**** He explains that people who dedicate themselves solely to _one_ goal, discipline, or area of interest won’t reach their full potential and achieve extraordinary things. They’re blind to additional areas in which they might thrive because they’ve never considered pursuing them.

To overcome this self-limiting behavior, Dicks offers two tips.

##### Tip #1: Take Every Opportunity

Dicks argues that**you should take every opportunity you’re presented with, even if it doesn’t necessarily contribute to your current goal**. Saying yes is always better than saying no because the benefits outweigh the costs. If you say yes, you might discover a new passion or avenue for success that you were blind to before. However, if you say no, you might miss out, and you’ll likely never receive the same opportunity again. If you decide an opportunity isn’t for you after trying it, just say no next time—it’s OK to change your mind.

(Shortform note: While Dicks promotes taking every opportunity and exploring different paths, Robert Greene disagrees. In _The 48 Laws of Power_ , Greene’s 23rd Law is to concentrate your energy and resources (like time and effort) on the areas where you’ll gain the most. Not only will you make faster progress, but you’ll also build connections with powerful people in your areas of interest who can help you progress faster. On the other hand, accepting every opportunity and exploring different paths disperses your energy in too many directions, meaning you’ll progress slowly in all areas.)

##### Tip #2: Branch Out

**Second, pursue multiple goals, disciplines, or areas of interest at the same time, Dicks notes.** This is important for two main reasons:

**1\. You’ll solve problems and remain productive in the meantime.** If you get stuck on one project, you can continue being productive by working on something else rather than sitting idly until a solution comes to you. When you think of a solution, you can return to the original project having made progress toward another goal in the meantime.

(Shortform note: While Dicks recommends switching to another project to remain productive while brainstorming solutions, Barbara Oakley suggests that giving yourself a break instead might be more effective. This is because your brain will naturally switch between two modes of thinking—from focused mode (high concentration) to diffuse mode (letting your brain wander). When you encounter a problem, switching to diffuse mode helps you take a broader view of the issue and come up with creative solutions you might not have thought of while in focused mode. If you neglect to give your brain the diffuse time it needs, you may become too hyper-focused to see solutions that might otherwise become obvious.)

**2\. You’ll increase your creativity.** Dicks explains that gaining experience in different areas will help you expand your knowledge and draw connections between seemingly different ideas or disciplines. This improves your ability to come up with unique insights.

(Shortform note: Some education experts agree that engaging in numerous disciplines or areas of interest increases creativity. This concept has led to the rise of “interdisciplinary study” at universities: Students choose numerous disciplines to focus on, and they apply knowledge learned in one discipline to others to deepen their learning. In addition to boosting creativity (unique ideas and connections), interdisciplinary study also increases motivation, depth of learning, critical thinking skills, and the desire for life-long learning.)

#### Principle #3: Fail Often

Next, Dicks recommends pushing yourself and failing often.**** He argues that to progress, you must fail first—the more you fail, the closer you’ll get to success. **Failing makes you realize what you’re doing wrong, and every attempt from that point on will be better as you correct your mistakes**.

> **Analyze Your Failures Using the ‘Five Whys’ Technique**
> 
> Some experts agree that pushing yourself and learning from your failures is crucial to reaching your goals. They add to Dicks’s argument by specifying how _exactly_ you can use your failures to your advantage: Objectively analyze your failures to determine what went wrong. You could use the ‘Five Whys’ technique: First, ask yourself _why_ things didn't go as planned at the most surface level. Then, ask yourself _why_ your answer was the case. Finally, repeat the process three more times until you’ve asked “why” a total of five times. You’ll uncover the fundamental reason for your failure so you can learn from and avoid it in the future.
> 
> For example, imagine you failed to get a graphic design job you applied for. Your five whys would be (1) Why did I fail to get the job? Because my style didn’t match the company’s needs. (2) Why didn’t my style match? Likely because my designs are fairly simple compared to the intricate designs featured on their website. (3) Why are my designs too simple? Probably because I’m used to designing for local businesses rather than big corporations. (4) Why do I always design for local companies? Because I tend to apply for smaller jobs that I feel confident I’ll receive. (5) Why do I only apply for these types of jobs? Because I fear rejection.
> 
> Ultimately, your fear of rejection led to your failure in this situation because it prevented you from pushing yourself outside your comfort zone and adapting your graphic design style.

#### Principle #4: Motivate and Inspire Yourself

Dicks also advocates **learning how to motivate and inspire yourself.** He believes this is crucial to implementing his previous recommendation to fail often—you’ll only be resilient and persistent enough to learn from your disappointing failures and keep pursuing success if you can motivate yourself. Further, aside from failure, you’ll encounter many obstacles on the path to success that require motivation to overcome—disrupted plans, rejections, and more.

(Shortform note: In _Grit, _Angela Duckworth reiterates Dicks’s point that the ability to motivate yourself and persevere through adversity (what she calls having “grit”) is crucial to achieving success. Duckworth elaborates that this ability develops through three main stages: First, you develop _interest_ in your goal—a desire to learn more about your goal and explore it playfully. Second, you _practice_ —transition from playfully exploring your goal into intentionally improving your skills. Third, you develop a _purpose_ —a deeper meaning for reaching your goal, such as helping others. Finally, Duckworth notes that for each of these stages to result in grit, they must be accompanied by _hope_ that you’ll succeed or improve.)

Dicks offers three tips for building internal motivation and inspiration.

##### Tip #1: Find Your Why

**Remembering the underlying reasons why you’re pursuing your goals will inspire and motivate you to continue**. To identify these reasons, reflect on your life experiences and determine what influenced your choice of goals. Dicks explains that the more reasons you have for pursuing your goals, and the deeper these reasons are, the more motivated you’ll be to persist.

For example, you might think you want __ to be an actress because you love entertaining people. However, when you dig deep, you realize that this passion stems from a desire to empathize with and understand other people—becoming different characters allows you to accomplish this.

(Shortform note: Dicks’s recommendation to motivate yourself by identifying the underlying reasons _why_ you’re pursuing your goals is commonly referred to as finding _intrinsic motivation_ —a drive that originates _inside you_. Alongside considering your purpose, other ways to develop intrinsic motivation include retaining _full control_ over your actions; _deepening your bonds_ with people who share your goal (for instance, your colleagues); and ensuring you have the _skills needed_ to fulfill your goal.)__

##### Tip #2: Reflect On Your Struggles and Successes

Dicks notes that it’s easy to get worn down and feel like giving up when you face barriers or fail to see results from your work. **To persist through these challenges, remind yourself of all the hardships you’ve faced in the past and how you overcame them** —you’ll develop the pride and motivation needed to continue. If you struggled and persisted once, you can do it again.

(Shortform note: While Dicks recommends reflecting on both your struggles and successes, it can be particularly difficult to recall your accomplishments and positive experiences due to the “negativity bias”—the human tendency to focus more on negative situations than positive ones. To challenge this bias and better equip yourself to follow Dicks’s recommendation, start keeping a tally of all the positive things you’ve accomplished%20Challenge%20the%20Negativity%20Bias). For example, each night before bed, record three positive things that happened during your day.)

##### Tip #3: Celebrate Your Achievements

**Celebrate your achievements, big and small, as you progress toward your goals, Dicks suggests**. You’ll remember that you’re making progress and feel inspired to keep going. Don’t wait until you’ve reached some lofty level of success—celebrate every small achievement along the way. For example, don’t wait until you’ve won an Emmy Award to celebrate your success as an actress—celebrate when you get an agent, complete your first audition, get your first role, and so on.

> **Celebration Motivates You by Altering Your Brain Networks**
> 
> In _Tiny Habits, _BJ Fogg explains that celebrating small successes helps you progress toward your goals not only by inspiring you but also by _altering your brain networks_ —the connectors in your brain that link experiences with thoughts and emotions. If you do something challenging, your brain might link that experience with negative thoughts and emotions due to your struggle to complete the task, discouraging you from repeating the experience. However, if you _celebrate_ after this hard work, you’ll feel good, and your brain will reinforce the behavioral patterns that led to your celebration. This encourages you to repeat the behavior.
> 
> For example, imagine you’re auditioning for 20 different acting roles. Celebrating each time you complete an audition by treating yourself to your favorite bagel for lunch will encourage you to keep auditioning even if you don’t succeed because your brain will know that this behavior results in good feelings (celebrating and eating a great bagel). If you _don’t_ celebrate, you might just associate the hard work of auditioning with struggle and exhaustion (negative thoughts and feelings).

#### Principle #5: Maximize Your Creative Potential

**Dicks also recommends boosting your creativity** by implementing the following tips:

##### Tip #1: Consume Varied Content

**First, consume a wide variety of content as often as you can, Dicks suggests.** You’ll expand your knowledge in new directions and come up with new, unique ideas. For example, if you’re a painter, listen to a podcast about music theory during dinner. This might help you draw connections between painting and music that will inspire your next piece. Or, you might come up with a ground-breaking idea for an improv show where you and a musician perform (paint and play live) simultaneously, being influenced by each other's art.

(Shortform note: In _Building a Second Brain,_ Tiago Forte agrees on the importance of engaging with a variety of content to boost creativity. He explains that this practice is one of the best ways to maximize creativity because at its core, creativity is about drawing connections between ideas, especially ideas that don’t seem to be connected at first glance. Further, research suggests that people who excel at _recognizing relationships_ and _drawing new connections_ between concepts are the most creative.)

##### Tip #2: Reuse Your Old Work

**Second, Dicks recommends making the most of the work you've already created by reusing it for future projects**. You can do this in three ways:

  1. Repurpose a project that didn't work out for a different, future venture. For example, turn a painting that didn’t get accepted for an art show into an NFT that you can sell online.
  2. Use components of past projects for future projects. For example, cut the failed art-show painting into pieces and use it to make an abstract collage.
  3. Use past projects to inspire your work on future projects. For example, if one of your paintings was successful, use it to inspire a collection of similarly styled paintings.



> **Store and Manage Past Work With a ‘Second Brain’**
> 
> In _Building a Second Brain, _Forte provides an organizational system to streamline the process of storing past work to reuse later—what he calls a ‘Second Brain’. The Second Brain is a digital storage system for saving important information. It has themed folders for categorizing each new piece of information you add—for instance, a folder for information relating to current goals, a folder for information you want to save for the future, and so on.
> 
> According to Forte’s system, you’d store past work in the “archive” folder of your Second Brain and reuse it by visiting the folder each time you start a new project—either to get inspiration, repurpose old projects, or reuse pieces of past work.

#### Principle #6: Create a Support Group

Finally, Dicks recommends **finding a group of people to support you.** They’ll help you progress toward your goals by holding you accountable and providing encouragement and feedback.

Dicks explains that having a support group is important for a few reasons. First, **it’s much easier to give up on your goals when you’re the only one holding yourself accountable**. On the other hand, sharing your goals with others makes you more motivated to reach them because you want to meet others' expectations of you and avoid seeming like a failure.

Second, Dicks explains that **creative projects are meant to be shared with the world: Therefore, it's important to get feedback from others as soon as possible**. However, sharing incomplete versions of projects with just _anyone_ can be difficult because you don’t want the world to judge you based on half-baked iterations. This is why having a support group is important—you can trust them to give you constructive feedback without judging you.

**Finally, sharing your work with your support group will help you solve problems faster than you would on your own.** Dicks notes that each member of your support group will likely have a unique knowledge base, and they’ll bring perspectives and solutions to the table that you wouldn't have come up with alone.

To create your support group, **choose the people who love and support you** —avoid people who might envy your success, as they might undermine you. Further, share your work, goals, and deadlines with these people so they can give you constructive feedback and hold you accountable for completing goals.

> **How to Create Effective Support Groups**
> 
> In _Never Eat Alone, _Keith Ferrazzi reiterates the importance of recruiting people to help you succeed. He specifically recommends connecting with four different archetypes of people, each for a specific purpose. Here’s how they compare to Dicks’s recommendations, and how to recruit them:
> 
> **1)People to help you reach your goals.** This archetype’s purpose is to help you identify your goals, create plans to reach them, and hold you accountable for following through. It fulfills Dicks’s first reason for creating a support group: to hold you accountable and give you the motivation that comes from knowing someone’s checking up on you. Recruit people in this archetype by picking two or three people you trust—for example, friends, family, or coworkers.
> 
> **2)Mentors.** These people should have expertise in the discipline you’re pursuing, and their role is to provide professional advice, skill-development techniques, insider information, contacts, emotional support, and inspiration. This archetype fulfills Dicks’s second and third reasons for creating a support group: to provide you with constructive feedback from a safe, trusted person, and to help you overcome problems using their unique knowledge base. Recruit mentors by looking for official mentoring programs, asking friends and family for mentor suggestions, or approaching strangers who you think might be a good match.
> 
> **3)Super-connectors.** These are people who have dozens to hundreds of contacts they can introduce to you to help you progress. Dicks doesn't discuss recruiting people for this purpose, but Ferrazzi argues that having good connections is crucial for achieving success. Recruit people in this archetype by looking for high-profile people like headhunters, politicians, high-class restaurateurs, or journalists who are bound to have numerous connections. Convince them to help you out by offering them something in return, like an introduction to someone else in your network (such as introducing the journalist to the politician) or help toward their cause.
> 
> **4)Prominent industry leaders.** This archetype’s purpose is to help you gain credibility in your discipline or industry. For example, if you want to be a comedian, make friends with a popular comedian and people will flock to your shows assuming you’re just as funny as your counterpart. While Dicks doesn’t mention using your supporters in this way, Ferrazzi asserts that you _must_ boost your credibility to succeed. Meet and recruit these people by engaging with organizations they support, like charities, and hobbies they enjoy, like golf.
