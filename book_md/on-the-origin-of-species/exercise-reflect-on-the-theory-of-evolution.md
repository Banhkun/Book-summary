## Exercise: Reflect on the Theory of Evolution

This exercise will give you a chance to reflect on the theory of evolution and its broader implications for our world.

* * *

Darwin states that all life on earth descended from a single common ancestor. This means that all other organisms—including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria—are related to you. Does this change the way you understand the natural world and your place in it? Why or why not?

Darwin explains that natural barriers such as oceans, mountains, and deserts isolate populations and lead to the creation of different species. Now organisms can cross these barriers because humans are moving vehicles and cargo around the globe. How might this impact the course of evolution? Explain your reasoning.

Imagine that humans continue evolving into the deep future. How do you see us evolving and why?
