## 1-Page Summary

_On the Origin of Species_ revolutionized the way people look at life on Earth. This scientific classic was originally published in 1859 by the naturalist Charles Darwin and went through six editions in Darwin’s lifetime as he continually revised and clarified his ideas. The work explains and argues for the theory of evolution—that organisms weren’t created separately in their current forms, but that each species evolved gradually from other species over the course of millions of years. **This theory argues that biology is constantly in flux and that all organisms are related through a deep genealogy of species.**

Darwin developed his theory through years of cataloging plants and animals. He also drew insights from his voyage to the Galapagos Islands aboard the H.M.S. Beagle and from his experience breeding pigeons. Darwin's theories were controversial at the time, as they contradicted traditional Christian teachings. Prior to his work, most people believed that organisms had been created independently and were incapable of changing over time. Since then, however, his ideas have gained widespread acceptance. Darwin’s discoveries not only transformed the field of biology, but other scientific disciplines including psychology, ecology, and medicine.

Our guide covers Darwin's ideas in three parts.

  * **Part 1: The Theory of Evolution** explains the natural processes behind evolution and how they've shaped the organisms we see today.
  * **Part 2: The Genealogy of Species** explores the natural history of species and the evidence that modern organisms are all related through a family tree.
  * **Part 3: Arguments Over the Theory of Evolution** discusses the objections raised to Darwin's theories and how he responded to them in _On the Origin of Species_. 



Throughout this guide, our commentary will build on Darwin's theories with updates from contemporary scientific research.

### Part 1: The Theory of Evolution

Darwin explains that **species gradually develop through a natural process called _evolution_.** In this section, we'll first explore the mechanisms behind that process. Then we’ll take a closer look at how this process shapes the natural world.

(Shortform note: Darwin didn't develop this theory in isolation. Instead, he drew inspiration from many leading thinkers and scientists of his day such as the naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was the first to propose that species change over time. Darwin also collaborated with naturalist Alfred Wallace, who independently developed the idea of natural selection and even collaborated with Darwin by pooling his data with Darwin’s. Darwin also drew inspiration from geologist Charles Lyell, a geologist who proposed the theory of _uniformitarianism_. This theory maintains that natural processes have remained consistent throughout time and that we can therefore understand the origins of the world around us by looking at processes happening in the present.)

#### The Mechanisms of Evolution

Darwin explains evolution as a process with four key mechanisms: variation within a species, heritability of variations, natural selection, and gradual accumulation.

##### 1) Variation Within Species

**Organisms in every species vary slightly.** Darwin observes that,**** when examined closely, no two creatures are identical. Their body parts all have slightly different shapes, sizes, textures, and colors. Even vital organs like hearts, kidneys, and spinal cords vary slightly in size and shape from creature to creature. Among humans, for example, you'll find minor differences in height, bone structure, fingernail density, tongue flexibility, thumb shape, and so on.

> **The Origin of Variations: DNA Mutations**
> 
> While Darwin recognized that species exhibit variations, the biologists of his time couldn't explain the origin of these variations or how new variations arose. These knowledge gaps have since been filled by the discovery of DNA and its mutations.
> 
> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was first discovered in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher, but its purpose wasn't clear until the mid-twentieth century. Now we know that DNA provides a set of instructions for growing an organism: what proteins to produce and how to assemble them. However, these instructions can change every now and then through a process called _mutation_ that creates minor variations in the sequence. Mutations are caused by errors in replicating and repairing DNA sequences or by exposure to mutagens—substances with the power to damage or alter DNA—such as radiation or ultraviolet light.

##### 2) Heritability of Variations

**Furthermore, Darwin explains that these variations are _heritable_ :** They can pass from parent to child through reproduction. For example, if your parents have red hair, you’re more likely to have red hair as well. This means that the variations in a given species were likely passed down from parents who also had these variations.

> **Heritability and the Discovery of Genetics**
> 
> While Darwin understood that heritable traits could be passed on from parents to their offspring, he didn't yet understand how. This is because the field of genetics was just beginning. Geneticists attribute the foundation of their field to Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), a biologist and monk who discovered laws of heritability by breeding pea plants.
> 
> As Siddhartha Mukherjee writes in _The Gene_, Mendel's key insight lay in discovering that heritable traits could be passed complete and intact from parent to offspring. For example, a parent with green eyes and a parent with brown eyes could have a child with brown eyes instead of mixed greenish-brown eyes. This overturned previous theories that traits would blend together during inheritance. Mendel argued that there must be a unit of inheritance, which scientists would later call a gene. He published the results of his experiments in 1866, six years after the original publication of _On The Origin of Species_. It seems that while Mendel was acutely aware of Darwin’s work, Darwin was unaware of Mendel’s.

##### 3) Natural Selection

**However, not all variations stand an equal chance of being passed along to the next generation.** Darwin asserts that any heritable variation that provides one member of a species with an advantage in survival and reproduction over another, no matter how slight, will gradually allow members with that variation to survive and reproduce more than those without it. Over successive generations, natural selection will favor the most useful variations while eliminating the least useful.

(Shortform note: While Charles Darwin didn’t come up with the phrase “survival of the fittest,” he adopted it after other writers used it to describe his findings. Biologists have since tested how much of a difference in "fitness" between organisms of the same species is needed to trigger natural selection. Researchers made tiny detrimental adjustments to the genes in the microorganism salmonella. They found that reducing the bacterium’s fitness by just 0.01% was enough to create noticeable differences in rates of reproduction, suggesting that evolution will select for even the slightest variations over time.)

Darwin explains that natural selection happens constantly because many organisms in nature aren’t able to reproduce and survive. Problems such as scarcity of food, competition between species, predators, and disease all limit the number of organisms in a species that will successfully pass on their heritable variations. This pressure ensures that variations that enable survival and reproduction are strongly selected for, while those that don’t confer an advantage are selected against.

> **The Influence of Malthusian Economics on Darwin's Theory**
> 
> In his analysis of scarce resources and population pressure in nature, Darwin was heavily influenced by the controversial 18th-century economist Thomas Malthus. Malthus argued that human populations would grow faster than food production, leading to inevitable famines unless population growth could be controlled. This influenced Darwin's view of the evolutionary pressures imposed on populations by scarce resources.
> 
> Today, Malthus's theories have been heavily discredited. He failed to anticipate how technological advancements in agriculture would support larger populations. His theories have also been associated with controversial and immoral social policies. Malthus argued vehemently against welfare for the poor, as this would encourage them to reproduce, and he played an instrumental role in overturning Britain's "Poor Laws." His theories were also used to justify government inaction in the face of the Irish potato famine and the disastrous famines in British colonial India, as some argued that these disasters were simply the result of overpopulation instead of economic mismanagement or agricultural failure.
> 
> However, his influence on Darwin led the naturalist to an important insight: Many organisms never survive long enough to reproduce—in fact, many organisms produce far more offspring than will survive as a reproductive strategy—and therefore any small advantage would be naturally selected for in the face of enormous pressure to survive.

##### 4) Gradual Accumulation

Finally, Darwin argues that **this slow accumulation of useful variations _changes a species over time_. **As some traits are selected for and others selected against, the species gradually shifts as more of the population inherits the most useful traits.

For example, a deer with slightly longer legs than other members of its species can run faster than the others, allowing it to escape more easily from predators. Not only is this deer more likely to survive long enough to reproduce, but its offspring are also more likely to survive long enough to reproduce because they’ll inherit this useful trait. This means that after many successive generations, more deer will inherit the trait of longer legs than the trait of shorter legs. Eventually, you’ll have an entire population of faster, lankier deer.

> **Evolution in Action: Superbugs**
> 
> While evolution takes a long time for larger organisms like deer, we’re able to observe this process happening during our lifetimes in microorganisms, which reproduce much faster and have shorter lifespans. In fact, this process creates a significant challenge to modern medicine, as infectious microorganisms evolve the ability to resist our antibiotics. This process has even given rise to new "superbugs" that have evolved an immunity to conventional antibiotics.
> 
> The rise of superbugs reveals Darwin's theory in action. The presence of antibiotics kills off the microorganisms that can't resist them, leaving only the microorganisms that can. As soon as a microorganism develops a mutation that enables it to resist the antibiotic, this organism will easily out-reproduce those without the mutation. Soon you have an entire population of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

#### How Evolution Shapes Organisms

Darwin argues that this process has shaped the natural world around us. In this section, we'll explore how evolution shapes organisms by adapting them to their environments and ecosystems. Finally, we’ll discuss how evolutionary pressures shape adaptive traits.

##### 1) Organisms Adapt to Their Environments

Darwin explains that **the process of evolution synchronizes creatures with their environments.** While evolution selects for useful traits and against detrimental ones, traits are only useful or detrimental _in the context of a particular environment._ For example, polar bears insulate themselves from the cold with a thick layer of fat called blubber. This adaptation is perfect for an animal living in the Arctic, but it’d cause a desert creature to overheat. Therefore, blubber is advantageous for polar creatures but not desert-dwelling ones.

Along with physical traits, organisms adapt behaviors that allow them to survive in a particular environment. Polar bears, for example, have acquired the survival strategy of hunting seals to get the calories they need. The necessity of hunting then continues to shape their evolution: Traits such as powerful jaws, sharp teeth, and claws then become adaptive as well, as these all increase the chances that a polar bear will survive long enough to pass on its genes.

(Shortform note: Research has largely supported Darwin's theory that organisms will evolve to suit their environment. For example, researchers have found that moving stick bugs from one environment to another creates selection pressure in favor of one coloration. Biologists have also found that organisms at the edge of one habitat will begin adapting new traits to colonize and spread out into a greater range. Researchers built an artificial habitat to test this hypothesis with the rapidly reproducing species red flour beetles. They found that trait selection at the boundaries of the artificial habitat allowed for a greater spread of beetles when compared to a control population.)

##### 2) Organisms Adapt to Their Ecosystems

In addition to adapting to their physical environment, **organisms adapt to the presence of other organisms.** Darwin explains that because organisms have evolved alongside each other, they have developed a deep interdependence. For example, many caterpillars are camouflaged to look like leaves, twigs, bark, and even flowers. These adaptations would only have been useful if the insects already lived around plants with these features. Thus, evolution has synchronized these organisms to each other's presence to create tightly interdependent ecosystems.

> **What Is Coevolution?**
> 
> Researchers have adopted the term "coevolution" to describe the process by which organisms evolve in relation to each other in a continuous and cyclical process. This happens when species live in close interaction with each other. Biologists have identified several important relationships shaped by coevolution.
> 
> **Predator/prey relationships** coevolve as prey organisms evolve new tactics to evade their predators while predators evolve new tactics to hunt them. For instance, caterpillars’ camouflaged appearances allow them to escape detection—this is an example of “background matching.” Some predators overcome background matching by evolving stronger sensing abilities.
> 
> **Herbivore/plant relationships** coevolve**** as plants adapt to being eaten by growing extra shoots and seeds or producing defenses like thorns and toxins. The herbivores that eat them then evolve adaptations in response.
> 
> **Parasite/host relationships** coevolve as parasites adapt to new environments in their host organisms while hosts adapt new defenses against them.
> 
> **Competitive coevolution** occurs when two species rely on the same scarce resources, such as food or nesting sites. They each evolve adaptations to try to gain a competitive advantage over the other.
> 
> **Mutualistic coevolution** occurs when organisms that benefit each other continue evolving to provide mutual benefit. For example, flowers evolve means of attracting butterflies to pollinate them, while butterflies evolve a stronger attraction to the nectar of certain types of flowers.

##### 3) Evolutionary Pressures Shape Adaptive Traits

**Darwin also argues that evolution produces similar features in unrelated organisms—what biologists call convergent evolution.** Features that are essential for survival or locomotion in a particular environment often take similar shapes. For example, fish, whales, and sea turtles all independently developed similar fin shapes for swimming because these are the most useful appendages for moving through water.

(Shortform note: Darwin asserts that convergent evolution often selects the optimal design for a given purpose. Therefore, convergent forms have important implications for biomimicry, a field of engineering that draws inspiration from nature. In particular, if natural selection repeatedly chooses one design for fins, this design can then be adapted for use in submarines or other aquatic vehicles.)

However, characteristics that aren’t constrained by the environment—like those shaped purely through mate selection—tend to vary. Biologists call this divergent evolution. For example, many species of fish select mates through complicated displays of color and movement. Darwin explains that these displays vary wildly because they’re not pressured into conformity through the same environmental constraints that produce similar fin shapes in aquatic animals.

(Shortform note: Studies have shown that mate selection by itself may have the power to isolate populations and create new species. Researchers have found, for example, that female strawberry poison frogs prefer to mate with males whose coloration matches that of the female’s mother. Since these frogs come in several colors, researchers believe that, in enough time, this preference could isolate breeding populations by color, leading to the emergence of separate species.)

### Part 2: The Genealogy of Species

Darwin's theory of evolution maintains that**all of our current species descended from older, less developed species.** If organisms are shaped by the slow accumulation of adaptive traits passed on through reproduction, it follows that each organism has a history of evolving through different forms. Furthermore, the offspring of a particular species could evolve in different directions, into separate reproductive populations. This would indicate that modern species are in fact distant relatives of each other, descended from common ancestors.

(Shortform note: Darwin theorized that all life on Earth is descended from a single common ancestor—but some researchers have suggested the possibility that life on Earth could have had multiple origins. If simple life arose once, could it have happened two or three times on the same planet? However, research supports Darwin's hypothesis of universal ancestry: All life on earth shares certain basic building blocks, including universal proteins and amino acids. Statistical analysis of the possible courses of evolution supports the view that these similarities likely originated in a universal common ancestor.)

In this section, we’ll first explore Darwin's arguments that species have descended from earlier species. Then, we’ll discuss his evidence that modern species are related through shared ancestry.

#### The Descent of Species

Darwin advances four kinds of evidence that species have descended from earlier species: changes in domesticated species, leftover characteristics, intermediate species found in the fossil record, and the role of natural barriers.

##### Evidence Type 1) Changes in Domesticated Species

To support his argument that species change over time, **Darwin highlights the ways humans have changed domesticated plants and animals through selective breeding.** He observes that many domesticated organisms have become highly specialized to provide more value to humans. For example, domesticated strains of berry vines grow much larger fruits than their wild counterparts. This occurs because humans select for these desirable traits when breeding domesticated species. Based on this evidence, Darwin concludes that trait selection has the power to gradually change the characteristics of a species.

(Shortform note: Researchers have tried to understand what happens in the evolution of domesticated animals that return to the wild. Do feral organisms simply revert to their earlier forms in a kind of “reverse evolution”? Or do they retain characteristics selected for by humans? Some research reveals that they keep evolving from their domesticated forms, but they evolve in new directions as they face different pressures of selection in the wild. Studies of feral chickens in Hawaii reveal they’re distinct from both domesticated and wild chickens—the feral chickens are a new kind of hybrid with a mix of domesticated and wild characteristics. This supports Darwin's broader view that organisms are shaped by their entire histories of selection, regardless of the conditions for selection.)

##### Evidence Type 2) Leftover Characteristics

Darwin explains that**organisms have taken on multiple forms over the course of their evolution.** He argues that we can find evidence for this by looking at structures that’ve been modified from earlier forms. He identifies two types: vestigial characteristics and repurposed characteristics.

**Vestigial characteristics** are features that served a purpose in earlier versions of a species but are slowly disappearing due to disuse. For example, some species of blind cavefish still have eyes, even though they no longer work, and whales have pelvises and femurs even though they have no legs. These characteristics suggest that their ancestors once used these features. Darwin argues that these characteristics wouldn’t exist unless species had evolved from older species.

**Repurposed characteristics** are features that evolved to serve one purpose and then became adapted to a second. For example, many insects communicate by rubbing their legs or wings together to make noise. These body parts likely evolved for movement before the insects started using them for communication. The fact that some body parts have taken on secondary purposes suggests that they evolved to fulfill one need and were then adapted for another, supporting the view that organisms developed in stages.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that organisms retain characteristics from previous versions due to a tendency toward "irreversibility." Once an organism has evolved a structure or characteristic, it can't simply revert back to earlier forms. This principle—named Dollo's law of irreversibility—was first put forward in 1890. Research has revealed some exceptions to Dollo's law: Lizards have lost and regained toes, insects have lost and regained wings, and bacteria have gained and lost resistance to antibiotic compounds. However, these exceptions are extremely rare. In general, researchers have found that the more complex an organic structure is, the harder it becomes to "un-evolve.")

##### Evidence Type 3) Intermediate Species in the Fossil Record

Darwin asserts that the **fossil record provides examples of transitional species.** These ancient ancestors provide links that show one species transitioning into another.

For example, biologists believe that birds evolved from reptiles because fossil evidence shows hollow-boned dinosaurs like _Coelophysis_ ,__ which were likely ancestors to modern birds. Biologists also believe that whales descended from land-dwelling mammals because there are fossils of transitional species like _Ambulocetus_ , a whale-like mammal with webbed feet that could still walk on land.

(Shortform note: Paleontologists caution that transitional fossils can only provide us with a rough outline of evolutionary development—they don’t necessarily prove direct ancestry from any one particular species. This is because transitional fossils may represent members of a larger family of organisms, some of which became the ancestors of modern species and some of which died out. For example, the Archeopteryx is a prehistoric animal that shares characteristics of both birds and reptiles, supporting the view that birds evolved from reptiles. However, we don't know whether birds evolved from Archaeopteryx or from a relative that hasn't been preserved through fossilization.)

##### Evidence Type 4) The Role of Natural Barriers

Darwin also argues for the descent of species by **highlighting the role of natural barriers in shaping populations and ecosystems.** He points out that species look very different from each other on opposite sides of natural barriers like oceans and mountain ranges. Darwin explains that this occurs because natural barriers isolate breeding populations from each other _:_ Organisms that live on either side of a natural barrier evolve to become distinct from each other because they no longer interbreed.

For example, lemurs—a long-tailed, tree-dwelling primate—diverged from other early primates over 60 million years ago by becoming isolated on the island of Madagascar. The natural barrier of water between Madagascar and the African mainland allowed lemurs to evolve separately from the ancestors of modern monkeys.

> **What Evolution Teaches Us About Ancient Geography**
> 
> Biologists have discovered that the pattern of organisms evolving in areas with natural barriers is consistent enough to teach us about barriers that existed in the ancient past.
> 
> One of the most famous examples of wildlife emerging on opposite sides of a natural barrier is found in the Wallace Line. Recall that Alfred Wallace was a contemporary of Darwin who independently came up with a similar theory of evolution. He discovered an invisible line running through the Malay Archipelago: All of the flora and fauna on one side of the line consisted of Asian species and their descendants, while the organisms on the other side were all Australian species and their descendants.
> 
> Scientists have since discovered that this boundary was caused by plate tectonics. The islands on each side of Wallace's line had been connected to the ancient continents of Sunda and Sahul, which were slowly pushed together to form the Malay Archipelago.

#### The Relatedness of Modern Species

Darwin's theory of evolution **maintains that organisms are related to each other through a family tree of descent.** This happens because _one_ highly successful ancestor species is capable of seeding _multiple_ descendant species _._

Recall that the individuals in every species carry inherited traits from their ancestors (heritable variations). That means a single population may have multiple traits that are useful for particular purposes. These traits can accumulate in distinct groups within the species. Over enough time, the groups become distinct from each other, turning into two different species.

For example, a species of wolf has a variation that allows for one of two types of foot pads. One type of pad allows the wolves to move more silently, perfect for stalking small prey. The other type of pad helps the wolves run faster, making it easier to chase down large prey. Over time, these variations accumulated in two different groups that split off from each other, leading to two new species of wolves.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that speciation—the process of one species seeding multiple new species—is largely influenced by population size and geography. One study of Anolis lizards on the Caribbean Islands found a consistent relationship between the size of an island and the number of different lizard species. Larger islands had more species because they could support larger populations and allowed lizards to spread across a greater area. As the lizards spread out, they had more opportunities to become isolated and form new independent species. Therefore, the number of distinct lizard species is proportionate to the area of the island.)

Darwin argues that all species today have ancient ancestors in common. He draws on two major types of evidence: similarity of traits and hybridization.

##### Evidence Type 1) Similarity of Traits Between Related Organisms

Darwin argues that **shared traits between organisms reveal their relatedness.** For example, all mammals have four limbs, warm blood, and three inner ear bones. These shared traits suggest that all mammals are descended from a common ancestor which had these traits.

Some of the most striking similarities between organisms reveal themselves through embryos (when the organism is in its earliest stages of prenatal development). For example, many land-dwelling vertebrates—including humans—develop gill slits and tails in the embryo stage. This trait not only suggests descent from fish but also suggests a common ancestry for all land vertebrates.

> **The Role of Genes in Embryonic Similarities and Differences**
> 
> Biologists have ample evidence that embryonic similarity results from shared genes. The basic DNA instructions for how to make features like eyes, backbones, and legs may be the exact same genes across many organisms. But what then accounts for the differences in development between organisms?
> 
> Researchers believe the differences in how organisms develop may have less to do with having completely different genes and more to do with the timing and duration of those genes’ activity during embryonic development. The instructions for producing a particular type of cell will be active or inactive for different durations depending on how many cells of that particular type an organism needs.
> 
> That means an organism with large eyes may have the same instructions for growing eye cells as an organism with small eyes, but it develops bigger eyes by simply repeating those instructions more times. Researchers have even discovered molecular “counters” which accumulate or deplete proteins to trigger the next stage in embryonic development.

##### Evidence Type 2) The Breeding Characteristics of Hybrids

**The breeding characteristics of _hybrids_ reveal relatedness between certain species. **Darwin explains that breeders of plants and animals have found that individuals from similar species can sometimes reproduce with each other, but with mixed results. Some hybrids only rarely produce offspring, some produce infertile offspring, while still others can sometimes produce fertile offspring and yield new hybrid varieties.

Darwin argues that the range of outcomes refutes the idea of sharp delineations between species. Organisms that can produce hybrid offspring together are distant relatives whose reproductive systems are gradually evolving to become incompatible with each other. This further supports the view that these organisms all had ancestors with a common reproductive system.

> **What Causes Hybrid Incompatibility?**
> 
> Researchers have attempted to identify the exact source of reproductive incompatibility between hybrids to better pinpoint how and when species diverge. Research on fruit flies suggests a variety of factors.
> 
>   * One experiment identified two genes that conflict with each other, resulting in the death of male offspring. When these genes are "turned off," the male offspring survive.
> 
>   * Other researchers have identified a divergence in gene function that dooms hybrid offspring: A gene will serve one purpose in one species and a second purpose in another. The offspring then struggle to survive because the same gene can't perform two functions at once.
> 
>   * Further research has identified an imbalance in proteins, rather than genes, that prevents successful reproduction.
>

### Part 3: Arguments Over the Theory of Evolution

Darwin's theory of evolution was controversial in its time, even among scientists. In the final edition of _On the Origin of Species_ , released in 1872, Darwin responds to the three main objections raised by skeptics of his theory of evolution. Here, we’ll review these objections and Darwin's rebuttals in defense of his theory.

#### Objection #1: “Lower” Organisms Continue to Exist

Darwin cites critics who argue that **the continued existence of simple creatures challenges the claim that sophisticated organisms evolved from simpler ones.** If some simple organisms evolved into more complex ones, why didn't all of them evolve that way? Darwin provides two explanations.

##### Rebuttal 1) Natural Selection Doesn’t Always Favor Complexity

First, Darwin argues that **natural selection isn’t biased __ in favor of sophistication.** Instead, species accumulate adaptations that allow them to continue reproducing. Therefore, a "simple" organism may still be well suited to its environment. For example, biologists have estimated that the earth contains about 2.5 million times as many ants as it does humans. Even though their bodies are simple, ants are still highly successful at surviving and reproducing.

(Shortform note: Some organisms, like goblin sharks, horseshoe crabs, and chambered nautiluses have earned the nickname "living fossils'' for staying relatively the same for millions if not hundreds of millions of years. Why, when most organisms change, do some stay the same? Some evolutionary biologists attribute this to "stabilizing selection," a form of natural selection that selects against extremes and in favor of an average characteristic. For example, snails with excessively thin shells are vulnerable to predators, but snails with excessively thick shells are less mobile. Therefore, evolution selects for shells of medium thickness. Thus, competing evolutionary pressures can stabilize each other, keeping traits consistent, sometimes for millions of years.)

##### Rebuttal 2) Evolution Is a Work in Progress

Second, Darwin reminds critics that **evolution is never completed** and every moment in natural history is a snapshot of a work in progress.**** In the future, organisms may evolve to become even more sophisticated. For example, chimpanzees aren't as intelligent as humans now, but that doesn't mean they couldn't reach our current level in a few million years—a relatively short time in the scale of natural history.

> **Are Humans Still Evolving?**
> 
> Researchers have tried to answer the question of whether humans are continuing to evolve. Some have theorized that humans have stopped evolving in the traditional sense: That is, low child mortality rates and effective birth control have made it so that individual choice, culture, and socioeconomics play a much larger role in reproduction than a person's genes. Therefore, genes are no longer selected for or against through natural selection, and our species' gene pool no longer changes in response to evolutionary pressure.
> 
> However, some research suggests that humans _are_ continuing to adapt to the conditions of civilization. For example, one study found that the cultivation of dairy has led to natural selection for genes that aid in digesting lactose. This change has taken place only within the last 5,000 to 10,000 years.

#### Objection #2: Complex Features Are Difficult to Create Through Small Increments

Darwin explains that **some naturalists found it difficult to believe that very sophisticated structures could arise through small increments.** Organisms today have such highly developed structures and behaviors that it's hard to imagine a rudimentary version of them providing much value.

For example, bats hunt using echolocation. They emit high-pitched sound waves that bounce off insects and then they judge the distance and direction of the prey by listening to the echo. They do this fast enough to intercept insects in flight. That means echolocation needs to work at a high level of sophistication if it’s to work at all _._ It's hard to imagine a primitive bat just making noises and then trying to follow the direction of the echo.

Darwin provides two rebuttals to this argument.

##### Rebuttal 1) Evolution Repurposes Older Structures

Darwin argues that **highly sophisticated structures and instincts can evolve incrementally, but they’re often r _epurposed from earlier structures_.** An earlier version of a species may evolve a structure for one purpose. Then, the organism finds a new use that allows the structure to continue evolving into greater complexity and sophistication.

Let’s return to the echolocation example. To echolocate, bats need highly sensitive directional hearing and the ability to make high-frequency sounds. These could’ve developed independently of each other before being repurposed into an echolocation system.

Bats may have started off like other nocturnal predators, such as owls, that hunt using highly sensitive directional hearing. They may also have communicated with each other using ultra-high-frequency squeaks that predators can’t hear, as many small rodents do today. Once early bats derived even a small advantage from using these abilities together in echolocation, evolution could then incrementally improve on this new usage.

> **The Mechanisms of Evolving Complex Organs**
> 
> Researchers have named the process of repurposing structures _exaptation_. However, exaptation is only one of several processes that enable complex organs to evolve. Evolutionary biologists have identified several more key mechanisms for evolving complex structures.
> 
>   * **Duplication** creates copies of genes and repurposes them. A complex structure may begin as a crude copy of another structure before adapting to a new function.
> 
>   * **Scaffolding** allows structures to support the development of other structures before losing their functions—much like the scaffold in a construction project.
> 
>   * **Gene sharing** allows one set of genes to take on multiple functions. This increases the complexity and range of organic structures that can be supported by an organism’s genetic code.
> 
> 


##### Rebuttal 2) The Natural World Shows Incremental Development of Complex Structures

Furthermore, Darwin argues that **when we look at simpler organisms, we often find earlier versions of rudimentary structures that developed into much more complex structures over time.** For example, the human brain is so complex that scientists are still discovering how it works. However, by understanding that the brain is a centralized collection of nerve cells in communication with each other, we can find the simplest examples of this structure in nature to reveal how it may have developed over time.

One of the simplest nerve cell structures belongs to jellyfish, whose nerve cells connect in a "net" that senses and processes information. One step up from this we find hydras, small freshwater relatives of sea anemones. These creatures also have a nerve net, but their nerve cells are more specialized, giving them something closer to a brain. Finally, in flatworms, these specialized nerve cells cluster together, forming a simple brain that can make decisions and even remember previous actions. By looking at these simple organisms, we can infer the origins of something as complex as a human brain.

> **Does Evolution Naturally Produce Complexity?**
> 
> Some evolutionary biologists have theorized that evolution has a natural tendency to produce greater complexity, even without natural selection. They make their argument mathematically: Mutation is random, and randomness increases complexity. Therefore, mutation trends toward complexity.
> 
> For example, imagine a very simple organism that’s made up entirely of one kind of cell. Any mutation at all—whether beneficial, detrimental, or neutral—could result in the organism having at least two kinds of cells, and therefore becoming more complex. The more mutations occur, the greater the cell diversity and subsequent complexity. Thus, evolution inevitably leads to complexity.
> 
> However, this theory remains controversial. Critics argue that organisms are always living under natural selection, and therefore it's difficult to prove that this (or any) force is truly independent of natural selection.

#### Objection #3: Why Aren’t There More Transitional Species?

Lastly, Darwin's critics argued that **if species evolved from other species, then there should be more transitional species alive, or at least more evidence of them in the geological record.** Darwin provides three rebuttals.

##### Rebuttal 1) Competition Destroys Transitional Species

Darwin argues that we don't see many transitional species alive today because **competition between species would select against them.** Recall that scarcity of food, habitat, and other resources puts species in competition with each other. Those that have evolved the best adaptations outcompete those that are less adapted. Therefore, transitional species are likely to die out.

For example, let's say there's a fish that eats two kinds of food: algae and smaller fish. Some of the fish in this population develop a mutation that gives them teeth that can scrape algae off coral, which allows them to eat algae faster. Others develop long, sharp teeth that allow them to catch small fish better. The optimized algae eaters eat most of the available algae, while the optimized fish hunters catch most of the available small fish. Now there’s less to eat for the parent population, which is optimized for neither algae nor small fish. They’ll likely die off, leaving two new species of fish.

(Shortform note: Studies of ovenbirds in South America have confirmed that closely related "sister species'' compete with each other by occupying similar niches. Researchers found that closely related species of ovenbirds that relied on similar food sources didn't live in overlapping territories due to "competitive exclusion." However, they found that once related species had evolved into distinctive ecological niches—some developed curved beaks for prying insects out of bamboo stems, for instance—then they no longer competed with each other and could share territory.)

##### Rebuttal 2) The Fossil Record Is Scarce

Darwin also explains that **we don't find every example of a transitional species in the fossil record because the fossil record is very sparse.** Most organisms never become fossils because fossilization is a rare process that requires very specific conditions. Our knowledge of the natural world before our time is very limited. Therefore, Darwin argues, the lack of transitional species in the fossil record poses little challenge to the theory of evolution.

(Shortform note: Paleontologists agree that the fossil record is extremely sparse. Some have estimated that less than 0.1% of species that have ever lived became fossils. Furthermore, the fossil record presents a biased sample because some organisms are more likely to fossilize than others. Organisms with bones or hard shells are more likely candidates for preservation. Creatures living in or near water are also overrepresented because water plays a vital role in the process of fossilization. Roughly 99% of all fossils discovered are the remains of marine organisms.)

##### Rebuttal 3) Transitional Adaptations Still Appear in Modern Species

Finally, Darwin argues that**even though examples of transitional species may be sparse, we can still infer the course of evolution by studying the incremental adaptations in today’s natural world.** Let's say we want to understand how whales evolved to swim, even though their ancestors walked on land. You could infer this evolutionary path by looking at the behavior of current aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals.

For example, raccoons and bears spend most of their time on land, but they occasionally venture into rivers to catch food. Muskrats and beavers spend even more time in water. Seals and walruses spend most of their time underwater, but they occasionally pass time on the shore. Finally, whales and dolphins spend all of their time in the sea. You could easily imagine the ancestors of modern whales progressively occupying each of these niches before finally leaving land. While we may never discover every intermediate species, Darwin argues that the natural world as it currently is furnishes more than enough evidence to support the evolution of one species into another.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that modern organisms can tell us much more about evolutionary pathways than Darwin ever realized. By mapping genomes (complete sets of genes), biologists have identified similarities and shared clusters of genes that could imply common ancestry between organisms. Furthermore, researchers in an emerging field called phylogenetics are attempting to create hypothetical "family trees'' of organisms through DNA sequencing and mathematical models.)
