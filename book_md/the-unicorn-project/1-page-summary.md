## 1-Page Summary

A modern company lives or dies by the efforts of the people it employs, and even a successful, long-lasting business can be undone by a toxic workplace culture. In _The Unicorn Project_ , published in 2019, Gene Kim argues that an organization is doomed if it fails to trust and empower its employees, focuses on assigning blame rather than solving problems, and stops anything from being accomplished by drowning every action in a mound of red tape. Once a business develops this kind of culture, it can either turn itself around or fade into irrelevance as rival companies outstrip it in the market.

_The Unicorn Project_ presents a fictional case study of Parts Unlimited, a once-mighty auto parts manufacturer that’s fallen behind the times and its competitors, mainly because of the soul-crushing work conditions it’s allowed to develop in its IT department. When a technological initiative that’s crucial to the company’s success turns into a disaster, Parts Unlimited almost collapses until a band of rebellious programmers figure out a new, more productive way of working and put it into motion behind their executives’ backs.

Kim is the founder of the digital security company Tripwire, cofounder of the IT Process Institute, and a vocal proponent of the DevOps software development model. In 2013’s _The Phoenix Project_ , written with coauthors Kevin Behr and George Spafford, Kim told the story of Parts Unlimited from the perspective of a company executive as he rescued its faltering IT department by better managing its production workflow. In _The Unicorn Project_ , Kim tells the same story from a software developer’s point of view to highlight the characteristics of a healthy, creative workplace and what can be done to shift a company’s culture.

(Shortform note: In _The Phoenix Project_ , the authors argued that businesses should merge software development and IT operations into one cohesive unit, a structure referred to as “DevOps.” Adopting a top-down approach to their case study—as opposed to _The Unicorn Project’_ s bottom-up view—the authors identify the principal causes of workflow stoppage and prescribe a three-pronged strategy to improve productivity—establish a faster workflow, provide quick feedback, and foster constant improvement. As we’ll see in this guide, there’s substantial overlap in the ideas shared by the two books, but The Unicorn Project brings a perspective that’s not limited to that of upper management.)

In this guide, we’ll describe the toxic workplace culture within Parts Unlimited and how it’s salvaged by a rebellion of workers who are frustrated with the old status quo. We’ll look at Kim’s diagnosis of the problems that plague many IT departments and compare them to workplace characteristics that foster creativity and productivity. These include an emphasis on simple, customer-focused projects; an atmosphere in which it’s safe to give and receive candid feedback; a company-wide drive toward nonstop improvement; and a culture that encourages employees to find happiness and a state of flow in their work.

Because Kim tells his story entirely in the language of a software development department, we’ll also provide explanations of computer terms and concepts that the author assumes the reader already knows. We’ll discuss how Kim’s themes align with those of other business management experts, and because Kim demonstrates his ideas by example, we’ll direct you to other Shortform guides in which the same concepts are expounded upon in a nonfictional setting.

(Shortform note: Fictional scenarios like the one presented in _The Unicorn Project_ have become a popular tool for management writers. Fiction can illustrate business ideas in a way that emotionally connects with readers. Examples include _Who Moved My Cheese? _by Spencer Johnson and _The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive_ by Patrick Lencioni. Critics argue that the “business fable” genre often falls flat due to unsubtle storytelling and shallow characters, but reviewers have praised _The Unicorn Project_ for showing the importance of team collaboration and presenting its ideas in a more potent way than a simple recitation of facts.)

### The Impossible Project

Kim’s narrative follows the story of Maxine Chambers, a lead developer in Parts Unlimited’s software development department within IT. Through Maxine’s eyes, Kim illustrates the characteristics of both unproductive and healthy workplace cultures, with an emphasis on how the former can be turned into the latter. In the story, Maxine goes from the frustration of being part of an ineffective department to joining a group of company rebels who secretly work to institute better practices, eventually setting an example for the rest of the company to follow.

Our story begins as Maxine finds out she’s been unjustly blamed for a payroll system failure. As punishment, she’s exiled to work on an online sales tool called the Phoenix Project that everyone in IT despises. Though management considers the Phoenix Project essential to dragging Parts Unlimited into the digital age, it’s been stuck in development hell for years. When Maxine arrives at her new workplace, the situation is even worse than she’d imagined.

(Shortform note: In _The Unicorn Project_ , Kim doesn’t explain the Phoenix Project’s actual purpose. In the novel _The Phoenix Project_ , it’s described as an enormous software system that will unite online and in-store sales, collect customer data, speed up product delivery, and enable targeted promotions. Since its inception, Phoenix has grown thanks to demands from the retail, marketing, and security departments. By the time _The Unicorn Project_ begins, the Phoenix Project’s software has become so complex that no one understands it enough to make it work.)

**The Phoenix Project office is a dismal cube farm where developers work in isolation from each other.** The culture is one in which there’s no feedback, no visible progress, and no risks taken to foster innovation because people fear they’ll be punished if something goes wrong. While programmers develop separate Phoenix features, there’s no standard environment for developers to work in, no way to test the code they write, and no Phoenix documentation to help newcomers begin. Maxine’s initial task is to write that documentation, but she finds it impossible to even install a pre-release version of Phoenix on her laptop.

(Shortform note: In layman’s terms, a software development environment is made up of the computer hardware, operating systems, and other applications within which software is designed before implementation. Such environments are used to create software, test it, and model how it will be implemented into end-users’ devices. The version Maxine tries to install on her laptop is referred to as a “build”—an executable version of the current work in progress that should run as it would if used by consumers. A build can either be created all at once, as when you install a new program on your computer, or incrementally added to a previous build, as when you update software to a newer version.)

At a company meeting, the CEO announces that there will be no further delays in rolling the Phoenix Project out for the public—despite the fact that there hasn’t been a single successful test of the system. Everyone in IT knows that in its current state, Phoenix can’t possibly work, but rather than working toward a viable solution, IT’s development and operations divisions are at each other’s throats. Meanwhile, Maxine meets a sympathetic colleague named Kurt from quality assurance. He invites her to an after-hours meeting of coworkers who routinely bend and break company rules to actually get things done.

(Shortform note: As depicted by Kim, Parts Unlimited’s IT department is split into four competing groups: development (Dev), operations (Ops), quality assurance (QA), and security. The Dev group is responsible for generating new software, databases, and online interfaces, whereas Ops is responsible for maintaining the company’s existing hardware and software while installing and implementing new products from Dev. QA is responsible for testing Dev’s software to make sure it works as intended on any system it’s meant to run on, whereas IT security protects company and user data from unauthorized access as well as making sure that a company’s data management systems stay in compliance with government regulations.)

#### An Underground Movement

Through the secret group that Maxine joins, Kim gives the first glimpse of what a productive IT department looks like. **Kurt’s rebels include people from Dev, Ops, and QA who willingly work together.** In reaching out to help colleagues like Maxine, their collective mission is to undermine Parts Unlmited’s culture of division in which its departments compete for resources, protect their own interests, and lose sight of the needs of the business as a whole. Kim argues that the growth of a toxic company culture is self-inflicted—**a company’s production workflow bogs down because management and workers allow it to happen.**

(Shortform note: In _The Phoenix Project_ , Kim, Behr, and Spafford go into more detail about two types of hurdles that slow work down. The first is unplanned work such as emergency repairs to systems that halt production when they fail. Unplanned work generates _more_ unplanned work because it takes time away from maintenance and improvements that would prevent similar emergencies in the future. The second type of stoppage is a bottleneck—the one link in the chain that limits the speed of the entire production process. A bottleneck could be a specific workstation, a cumbersome procedure, an approval committee, or even one person.)

At the moment, the rebel group is small, and there’s nothing they can do to save the Phoenix Project. Its deployment goes even worse than expected. Databases are corrupted, orders get lost, and even the company’s internal networks crash. The company executives who lobbied for the rollout try to fix the blame on IT while the departmental managers focus on self-protection instead of problem-solving. Meanwhile, IT can’t get anything done because every system change and bug fix has to go through a Kafkaesque approval process.

(Shortform note: As Kim shows with the Phoenix Project crash, blame and bureaucracy can halt meaningful progress at the worst possible time. In _Factfulness_ , Hans Rosling argues that blame arises from a desire to avoid pain and simplify bad situations by not digging into their systemic causes. Bureaucracy, on the other hand, acts as a barrier to communication. In _Hit Refresh_ , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recounts how he had to bypass his company’s bureaucratic structure to hear from front-line workers and break through departmental walls that were preventing effective collaboration.)

#### The Rebels Strike Back

The disruption caused by the Phoenix Project meltdown creates an opening for the rebels to expand their operations. By formalizing their behind-the-scenes network, Kurt and Maxine merge the functions of different departments to create a cycle of feedback and progress. They do this by self-organizing into a new team, tackling a system bottleneck that’s slowing Phoenix down, and eventually detaching that bottleneck from the Phoenix software altogether.

While IT scrambles to keep Phoenix working, Kurt lobbies for Maxine and the rebels to become a new product development team that incorporates testing into the development process instead of waiting to do it after the fact. This bypasses the complicated ticketing system that ostensibly lets IT track progress but, in practice, prevents work by segregating the steps of software creation between multiple departments. It’s a risky move to short-circuit Parts Unlimited’s bureaucracy that, if it fails, could get them all fired.

(Shortform note: While Kim presents the rebels’ actions as a daring step in the right direction, there are dangers inherent to circumventing a system’s hierarchical structure. In _Thinking in Systems_ , Donella H. Meadows warns that if a subgroup such as Kurt’s rebellion optimizes work for its own needs and neglects the larger organization—such as by taking resources away from other teams—the organization as a whole could fail. In a healthy system, Meadows suggests that the hierarchy should be structured to improve the work of smaller teams and help them coordinate instead of pitting them against each other as in the case of Parts Unlimited.)

Maxine’s first mission is to salvage Data Hub, a patched-together legacy system that Phoenix relies on to pull customer and product information from separate databases spread throughout the network. Data Hub is slow and antiquated, but so many of the company’s systems run through it that replacing it would be a logistical nightmare. Though its deficiencies are a major bottleneck preventing Phoenix from working, Kim writes that upgrading and maintaining Data Hub has never received support from on high because **management gives apps and features higher value than the underlying systems that support them.**

(Shortform note: A “legacy system” such as Data Hub is an outdated hardware or software platform that’s still used by an organization because of the cost and difficulty of changing to something new. For example, if a retail company’s sales software was designed to run solely on Windows NT, and if the software’s vendor went out of business without designing an upgrade, the retail company may find itself trapped into maintaining an old Windows NT server to keep its sales operations running. Businesses often retain legacy systems because of the prohibitive cost in time, money, and planning required to upgrade across an entire organization.)

Kurt’s rebels make it a priority to create a working environment that developers can use to test their changes to Data Hub. This new, slimmed-down test environment spreads through the rest of Dev and QA, whose members start working in conjunction with each other. They even rearrange their cubicles so developers and testers can work side by side, providing rapid feedback and speeding up their progress. Kim illustrates that it’s not just efficiency that improves—**team members start taking joy in their work**.

(Shortform note: Self-organization, such as with Kurt’s rebels, may be more than just a useful team structure. According to business expert Frederic Laloux, self-organizing teams represent a fundamental change in how businesses and society itself may organize in the future. In _Reinventing Organizations_ , he argues that by replacing the rules of hierarchical structure with the assumption that individuals and teams can make good decisions on their own, a business can unlock its workers’ full potential for creativity and problem-solving, especially if they’re invested in a culture that promotes the well-being of the business as a whole.)

##### Unicorn Is Born

While she untangles the Data Hub’s problems, **Maxine starts to wonder which Data Hub activities are most important for the business itself.** She discovers a backlog of expired tickets to create seasonal sales promotions. The slow Data Hub has been the bottleneck for these promotions, which took months to implement in the old system and were meant to be a feature in Phoenix. Using the rebels’ new workflow, Maxine and her colleagues can detach some Data Hub functions from Phoenix and create the seasonal promotions independently.

(Shortform note: In _The Goal_ , Eliyahu M. Goldratt writes that bottlenecks like Data Hub negate improvements made elsewhere along the production line. If an improvement is made to a station or process somewhere ahead of the bottleneck, it’ll merely result in a larger pileup of work at the bottleneck, whereas any improvements downstream of the bottleneck will simply result in workers sitting idle. Goldratt’s solutions to the bottleneck problem include improving the functionality of the bottleneck, optimizing the whole system to make the best use of the bottleneck’s capacity, or diverting work around the bottleneck altogether, which Maxine accomplishes by detaching Data Hub’s functions from Phoenix.)

There’s one catch. To deploy the promotions in time for the Christmas shopping season, Maxine and Kurt need executive approval. In the past, this would have required a review board that would have taken months to discuss it. Instead, the rebels appeal directly to the CEO. Since the company’s profits are on the line, he approves their request to design and deploy software outside the regular channels. Maxine’s seasonal promotions project is given the codename Unicorn, and Kim writes that the CEO will use Unicorn’s success to judge the rebels’ new model of work.

(Shortform note: When Parts Unlimited’s CEO gives the go-ahead to Maxine’s project, he’s recognizing the value of _autonomy_ and _flexibility_ espoused by Aaron Dignan in _Brave New Work_. Granting autonomy requires that leaders trust their employees to make reasonable decisions for their business, and granting that trust inspires workers to rise to the challenge set by their leader’s expectations. Allowing flexibility in the organization enables it to change with the times, experiment with new strategies, and do away with old procedures and routines that no longer serve the company’s greater good.)

#### The Unicorn Revolution

Now that the rebels have an official assignment, it’s time to put their ideas to the test. By using quick feedback, error correction, and rapid deployment, the Unicorn team is able to achieve a solid, measurable business outcome—increased customer engagement and sales. They do this by keeping their project small and focused, incorporating testing as part of development and deployment, and turning every failure into a lesson for improvement.

Kim is clear that **Unicorn isn’t meant to be a giant, monolithic project like Phoenix** —the name simply refers to the seasonal promotions project. The point is to address a specific business goal where Phoenix failed and to do so as efficiently as possible. Once the Unicorn team shows off their new software, they’re energized by seeing how their work will have a direct impact on the business and their customers. A successful demonstration earns the project a green light to deploy before Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean Unicorn’s work is done.

(Shortform note: Why does the Unicorn team feel so motivated when their previous work on the Phoenix project had felt like endless drudgery? The answer may be the _autonomy_ they’re given to design and set the Unicorn project into motion. In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink argues that autonomy motivates team members by empowering them to choose the direction of their work. This creates a direct link between a person’s output and their internal values. Autonomy gives employees free rein to be creative and come up with solutions that top-down management often overlooks. Rather than hampering efficiency, autonomy lets employees come up with better ways to achieve business goals than a manager would think of.)

The Unicorn team sends a trial run of promotional emails to 1% of Parts Unlimited’s customers. This already differs from Kim’s depiction of the Phoenix rollout, which was attempted with no pretesting whatsoever. When customers start to place promotional orders, glitches occur, but each problem is fixed by a group of programmers whose changes are uploaded to the system immediately. Despite the hiccups, the test is successful, though Maxine warns that the volume of promotions—and their associated glitches—will be much higher when the full rollout happens.

(Shortform note: Maxine’s advice has roots far back in the early days of computer programming. In 1975’s _The Mythical Man-Month_ , Frederick P. Brooks points out that not only does every piece of software have errors, but fixing those problems creates even more errors that will show up further down the road. Brooks says that you should expect errors to crop up—as Maxine does in the story—and recognize that endless debugging leads to diminishing returns. Eventually, you _have_ to deploy your software, whether or not it’s 100% perfect.)

##### Unicorn’s Success

Unicorn promotional offers are sent to all customers as the Christmas shopping season opens. Though a few more errors crop up, the result is the single biggest sales day in Parts Unlimited’s history. It couldn’t have happened without the risks, experiments, and employee engagement encouraged by Kurt’s rebels, nor without Maxine’s focus on business goals and customer needs. Kim writes that though the Unicorn team has won their first victory, **their next battle is to prove to upper management that the company’s culture needs to change.**

The CEO agrees that the Unicorn model should become the standard for software development and implementation, but the process of shifting gears isn’t painless. By eliminating internal dependencies and bottlenecks, Unicorn revealed that many workers’ jobs would soon be made redundant. Maxine is dismayed to be part of the process of deciding which team members must be let go, but downsizing reshapes the IT department into how it will operate going forward. **For some workers, retraining is necessary to find more useful roles in the department.**

> **Change on a Company Level**
> 
> In both _The Unicorn Project_ and _The Phoenix Project_ , Parts Unlimited’s IT department goes through an overhaul in their entire work culture within the space of a handful of months, but in reality, such change takes preparation, leadership, and participation from all corners. In _Leading Change_ , Harvard professor John P. Kotter lays out the steps that business leaders must take to adapt their companies to an ever-changing market while acknowledging that change is a collective effort undertaken by everyone in the company.
> 
> Kotter’s first step is for leaders to create a sense of urgency that change is needed for the company to survive. While the Phoenix project’s failure creates urgency at Parts Unlimited, it isn’t coupled with strong leadership with a positive vision for the future. Kotter’s next steps for business leaders are to get buy-in from internal and external stakeholders and articulate a clear vision for the company’s future. After communicating that vision and setting measurable goals to mark the organization’s progress, _only then can a company’s culture be changed_. A culture is usually deeply entrenched, and only when other changes are self-sustaining can a new way of doing business fully replace what came before.

Once the holiday season is over, Kurt and Maxine’s rebels are triumphant. Parts Unlimited has exceeded all sales expectations, thanks in no small part to Unicorn, and Maxine is given the task of identifying innovations for the future, culled from suggestions that can be offered by any department in the company. Using the Unicorn model of initiating projects and putting them into production quickly, Parts Unlimited will be able to explore markets and opportunities on a wider horizon than their old culture could ever have accomplished.

(Shortform note: While Kim ends _The Unicorn Project_ by implying that future innovations will continue to propel Parts Unlimited ahead of its competitors, the sad truth is that most innovation projects fail. In Shortform’s _The Master Guides: Business Innovation_ , we’ve collected insights from many business experts who suggest that successful innovation projects must be different enough from other products to stand out to customers, they need to overcome the market’s resistance to adopting new technologies, and above all, they must be managed correctly.)

### Symptoms of a Toxic Workplace

Throughout his story, Kim paints a picture of an IT department that fails to function on every level, to the detriment of the company and its workers. All of the problems Kim describes are self-inflicted—none can be blamed on forces outside the business. The specific negative features he highlights are a culture of fear and blame, a production process stunted by a lack of trust and feedback, and systems that have grown so complicated that it’s nearly impossible to change anything for the better.

Kim says that **the root of workplace toxicity is a culture of fear and blame.** At Parts Unlimited, mistakes are punished, and so is calling attention to errors. This creates a climate in which people are encouraged to hide their mistakes and avoid taking risks that might lead to innovation. A climate of fear isn’t just bad for business—it’s bad for workers’ mental and physical health. For example, long hours and lack of sleep during the multi-day Phoenix Project rollout results in every IT worker having to call in sick at some point.

(Shortform note: Fear is at its root an evolutionary response that’s helped our species survive through the ages, but continual exposure to fear can have a negative, compounding effect. In _Radical Acceptance_ , psychologist Tara Brach explains that when fear is the norm, you spend your life in a defensive mindset rather than living your full potential. Fear can lead to a trance-like state in which constant worries stop you from living in the present. In addition to the body’s physical response to fear, your mind can get trapped in self-destructive habits, such as withdrawing from others and obsessing over harmful internal narratives that perpetuate a cycle of blame like the one Kim depicts within Parts Unlimited.)

On top of their fear, **employees are frustrated when they can’t do anything because of bureaucratic rules.** In the story, when Maxine devises a fix to an error in the Data Hub, the rules prevent her from uploading it herself. She has to submit her fix to QA, where it might wait two weeks before it’s tested and passed along to the waiting line at Ops, where it might take another month to be deployed. Every roadblock was instituted in the past with the best of intentions, but they’ve calcified into a bureaucratic maze that reinforces the message that the company doesn’t trust its employees to be competent at their jobs.

(Shortform note: Like Kim, management expert Peter F. Drucker, author of _The Effective Executive_ , critiqued bureaucracies for their focus on rules over outcomes. He suggested that as in-house monopolies, bureaucratic support systems such as Human Resources departments have no motive to increase productivity and should therefore be outsourced when possible, reducing their administrative drag on a business. However, other authors point out that bureaucracy does have advantages: When it works, it establishes a structure by which leaders can steer an organization. It also helps enforce rules by which company resources can be allocated fairly, from sick leave to departmental budgets.)

Kim describes every step along this path where work must wait on someone’s time or approval as a _dependency_ that bogs down production. Dependencies do more than just slow a system down—they make simple processes more complicated. Every layer of dependency in a system creates a mounting level of inertia that makes even simple corrections needlessly hard to apply. What this means is that **employees waste their time and resources wading through bureaucracy instead of working toward business goals.** Navigating the dependency maze is a full-time job in itself, and it comes at a very high cost for the company.

(Shortform note: L. David Marquet’s _Turn the Ship Around_ describes a real-life example of dependencies crippling an organization. When Marquet became captain of the USS _Santa Fe_ , the worst-performing submarine in the US Navy, the crew was hamstrung by their rigid dependence on old routines and mandatory authorizations. Department heads couldn’t get approval for changes, meetings were delayed because of one person’s absence, and even requests for leave were ignored because of the long chain of command they had to go through. To correct conditions on the _Santa Fe_ , Marquet had to change the sub’s culture entirely.)

### The Essentials of Productivity

The dysfunctional model of Parts Unlimited isn’t the only one that businesses can follow. Kim’s recipe for a productive software development department contains elements that are applicable in any organizational setting. These include a focus on simplicity and the needs of the customer, an environment in which candor is rewarded, a culture dedicated to nonstop improvement, and management that enables its employees to find a sense of flow and pleasure in their work. Because Kim demonstrates these values through fictional examples, we’ll dive into the literature of nonfiction business management to back up and expand upon Kim’s underlying message.

(Shortform note: Since _The Unicorn Project_ is a work of fiction, Kim follows the fiction writer’s rule of “show, don’t tell” to get his message across. This rule says that instead of explaining an idea, an author should imply the idea through action, dialogue, and sensory details. For example, rather than stating that a character is frightened, an author might describe how their hands shake as they frantically try to dial for help. The “show, don’t tell” technique has power because it immerses the reader in the story. In the case of a book like _The Unicorn Project_ that’s meant to convey a specific message, this technique allows readers to draw their own conclusions, which leads to a deeper emotional understanding of the book’s material.)

#### Simplicity and Focus on the Customer

The first of Kim’s essential components can be summed up by the ancient words of wisdom, “Keep it simple, stupid.” Not only does this refer to small, tightly focused projects directed toward singular goals, but it also means always keeping an eye on _the needs of the customer_ as a guiding star. As this guide steps beyond Kim’s narrative to explore the literature on simplicity and customer orientation, we find that while other authors agree that simplicity is an important goal, they suggest that complexity can’t be done away with, innovation should only be applied in moderation, and that simplicity is most important as it's perceived by a product’s end user.

In Kim’s story, the Phoenix Project went off the rails when its original purpose—to provide an online ordering system—became lost under a growing mountain of added functionality and demands for new features from other business departments. This created a nonstop growth of scope and complexity that became so untenable the project couldn’t move forward. Kim argues that **part of the job of project management should be to reduce complexity** and not to let projects grow out of control. While that can be true of any business project, in the world of software, Kim recommends _functional programming_ as a means to achieve simplicity in design.

(Shortform note: Functional programming is a technique for writing software that builds computer programs out of units of code that exist independently of the data they process. Common functional programming languages include Haskell, Erlang, and Clojure. The most popular alternative to functional programming is object-oriented programming, which primarily structures software around bundles of data, characteristics, and code. Object-oriented programming languages include C++, Python, and Java.)

Kim also reminds us that any project within a business has to serve the goals of the business, which inevitably amounts to meeting the needs of the customer. This serves as a test of any new project or added software feature—will it further the business and give customers what they want? In the name of simplicity, Kim recommends that any single project shouldn’t try to accomplish too much at once. Instead, a new, simple project should be created to meet new customer demands rather than adding to and complicating an existing project.

> **The Challenge of Complexity**
> 
> In _The Mythical Man-Month_ , IBM’s Frederick Brooks discusses complexity in Kim’s context of software development, but with implications for any organization. The primary obstacle Brooks found was the number of people and software components that had to coordinate with each other. (In the place of software components, you can theoretically substitute any business tool or operation.) Furthermore, each new person or component _multiplies_ a project’s complexity instead of merely adding to it. Brooks argues that **complexity can’t be done away with, but it can be managed and reduced.** His solutions include limiting the size and scope of teams and setting realistic expectations for the schedule regarding a project’s completion.
> 
> In Kim’s story, Unicorn differs from Phoenix in that it’s a small project instead of a huge one. In _Great by Choice_ , Jim Collins and Morten T. Hansen show that **companies who _successfully_ innovate do so in small doses,** adopting a “bullets before cannonballs” approach. Before attempting a large-scale project, they experiment with a smaller version of the concept which can later be scaled up if it produces positive results. The characteristics of a good, simple test project are that it’s low-cost, low-risk, and doesn’t disrupt the company’s regular operations.
> 
> Kim’s litmus test for pursuing a project is customer orientation—how will it benefit the product’s end user? In _User Friendly_ , Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant explain why **customer focus and simplicity of design are becoming crucial in the age of information.** Hard-to-use technologies create complications on the consumer side, ranging from annoyance to maddening frustration. Since technology is so embedded in every aspect of contemporary life, tech innovations should simplify some aspect of the customer’s life and provide clear feedback as to whether the product works, which dovetails into Kim’s next principle.

#### Candor and Safety

The next vital step toward productivity is to create an environment of intellectual and emotional safety and trust in the entire organization. Employees need this to feel safe and encouraged to give and receive honest feedback, and also to alert their teams and supervisors when problems arise. Here, we’ll turn to books by other management experts who agree with Kim about openness in the workplace, but they make it clear that creating a culture of safe, honest feedback requires leaders to demonstrate caring, trust, and vulnerability.

When errors were discovered during the Unicorn team’s first test run of promotional emails, **the team held a meeting to diagnose and solve problems, not to find out who was “at fault.”** In this kind of environment, the person responsible for an error is free to admit their mistakes without fear. Kim says that the purpose of these evaluative meetings shouldn’t be to punish errors but to find a way to prevent them from repeating. Ideally, admitting a mistake should be rewarded. When treated as learning experiences, mistakes can make the whole company stronger.

> **Feedback and Vulnerability**
> 
> As Kim shows by depicting the IT department’s boost in morale, feedback does more than correct mistakes and improve productivity. In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott argues that **when leaders and workers commit to openness, they create a culture of mutual guidance and support.** That openness has two sides: caring for others and challenging them. _Caring_ means taking an interest in your colleagues that goes beyond their contributions at work, whereas _challenging them_ means being ready and willing to have tough conversations about solving problems—conversations that go both ways. Before giving feedback, a leader builds trust by asking for guidance and setting an example of how to respond appropriately.
> 
> Doing so requires that a leader be vulnerable, which Parts Unlimited’s CEO finds difficult but necessary. In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown insists that **allowing vulnerability in the workplace helps companies thrive.** Brown defines vulnerability as exposure to the risk of failure or emotional harm. While some people think that showing vulnerability is a weakness, being open to vulnerability makes difficult conversations more productive by demonstrating honesty and reducing defensiveness. Acknowledging and dealing with vulnerability can help an organization recover more quickly when something goes wrong. After all, the emotional fallout of failure can be worked through more quickly if it’s not bottled up.

> The digital studio Pixar is a dramatic example of a real-world business where candid feedback fueled remarkable growth. In _Creativity, Inc._ , Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull describes the practices that fostered Pixar’s brand of flexible, collaborative artistry and creation, including frequent feedback meetings where everyone can be heard, setting clear boundaries to keep people focused, allowing safe spaces for experimentation, and holding diagnostic sessions like the ones Kim describes so that lessons can be learned after projects are done without assigning blame or punishing mistakes. These practices bring about a beneficial cycle in which **the mistakes of one project lead to success and improvements in the next.**

#### Nonstop Improvement

A fundamental that Kim carries over from his previous book _The Phoenix Project_ is the need for continual improvement in a business. Rather than something that just happens on-the-fly, finding ways to improve how work is done must be part of each employee’s daily routine. In this section, we’ll look at the writings of leadership experts who highlight the importance of taking responsibility for the process, putting pressure on yourself and your organization, and making improvement part of your DNA.

Kim cites a policy instituted at Microsoft which states that if given a choice between developing a new software feature or working on a way to improve overall productivity, **an employee should always choose improving productivity.** This goes against the traditional management model in which procedures are dictated from on high while workers simply do as they’re told. Giving employees the freedom to explore new ways to improve the company itself requires managers and executives to change their mindset from being _bosses_ to acting as _guides_ and enabling their workers to make full use of their creative insights.

> **The Pressure to Be Better**
> 
> In _Extreme Ownership_ , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin go a step further than Kim by arguing that **leaders enable continuous improvement by taking ownership of their workers’ mistakes.** This doesn’t mean accepting blame, but rather that when someone on your team does something wrong, you should ask what you can do to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Accepting responsibility in this way links improving your team with improving yourself. This practice also means taking responsibility for your own mistakes, prioritizing constant improvement over salving your ego.
> 
> Another truism implied by Kim’s story is that **constant improvement requires constant pressure.** In _Relentless_ , Tim Grover frames this as an attitude necessary for individual greatness, but a similar outlook could be applied to an organization. The components of this mindset include not setting limits on what you can achieve, pressuring yourself to maintain high standards, and accepting that the process of improvement will involve some pain and discomfort along the way.
> 
> In a survey of many real-world companies, Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras confirm Kim’s assertion that **successful businesses make constant improvement a part of their identity.** In _Built to Last_ , they challenge the myth that outstanding companies focus on beating their competitors. Instead, by insisting on constant self-improvement, they remove the “finish line” of defeating an opponent in favor of always striving to do better and planning for long-term growth as opposed to chasing after short-term gain. Collins and Porras suggest that internal competition and forced innovation can keep progress going like an endless marathon where the company stays on the track of improvement.

#### Promoting the Flow

The final characteristic of a productive workplace is that it lets its employees achieve a state of flow in their work. “Flow” is the sensation of being _in the zone_ , when creativity comes as naturally as breathing and workers derive intense satisfaction while accomplishing the goals they’re working toward. In this final section, we’ll hear from psychologists and business professionals who agree that reaching a state of flow improves mental health and productivity, though it requires making deliberate choices to limit distractions and energize your mind.

In the example of software developers, Kim writes that a sense of flow can be reached when you’re able to write code, run it immediately, fix any problems, and know all the while that the work you’re doing is toward a tangible, positive outcome. When projects are simple and customer-focused, when you feel safe to take risks and learn from mistakes, and when nonstop improvement is the underlying drive, **a state of flow can be the natural outcome of a business culture that’s optimized for success.**

> **Deep Work and Distractions**
> 
> The state of creativity Kim writes about was first identified in _Flow _by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. While tricky to define, **a flow state can be characterized as an optimal experience** in which your attention and your energy are focused as you become completely immersed in what you’re doing. Enabling team members to reach flow states in their work can make them more self-confident and improve their sense of well-being. People are more likely to achieve a feeling of flow on the job if their work is challenging and engages multiple skills.
> 
> In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport presents a closer look at creative flow states specifically in the workplace, emphasizing that your ability to concentrate on and perform “deep work” determines how much you’ll be able to thrive in the information economy. A task qualifies as deep work if it’s important, difficult, and fulfilling. Newport gives specific advice for individuals to block out time for deep work, but a business can facilitate deep work as a priority by creating an environment that supports concentration and reduces distractions.
> 
> Distractions are the bane of staying in the flow. In _Make Time_ , Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky give practical tips for maintaining your focus and reducing interruptions, all of which could be made easier if embedded into a company’s culture. These include blocking off uninterrupted time to work on important projects, limiting your amount of email use, and being deliberate about how you use technology instead of letting your computer and phone dictate what you do from moment to moment. All of these steps can help team members maintain their focus and reach a state of flow, resulting in an overall increase in productivity.
