## 1-Page Summary

While on a family vacation in France, Seth Godin and his family were delighted to see fields full of cows. Cows were a novelty to them, and seeing so many was exciting—briefly. It didn’t take long for the novelty to wear off, and then every cow looked much like the others. They’d seen enough of the same old brown cows that they’d become bored. But a purple cow, now that would be remarkable!

That same principle must be applied to product development and marketing. Making another brown cow like all the others won’t get you or your product noticed. **You need a Purple Cow, something remarkable and exciting, in order to attract attention.**

### Mass Marketing Doesn’t Work Anymore

The traditional mass marketing strategies like TV commercials and newspaper ads just don’t work as well as they used to. People these days have less money, time, and attention that they’re willing to give you, so **you need to create something that will really catch people’s interest.**

While targeting as many people as possible may seem like the way to go (and is exactly what traditional mass marketing does), the unfortunate truth is that the majority will not listen to you. These people are looking for certainty and security, and they are far more likely to stick with what they know than take a gamble on a new product or service, even if it might be a little better. They have too many choices and too little time to sort through them as it is, and no guarantees that what you’re offering is what they want. No matter how clever your advertising is (or how much money you spend on it), to them, you’ll be nothing but more background noise.

**To get attention for your product, target the right people.** Your potential customers fit into a bell curve: On the left are the innovators and early adopters; the juicy center of the curve is made up of the early and late majority; and on the far side are the laggards, the ones who resist new products until the bitter end.

These days, **the real value is in the innovators and early adopters**. _They_ will be the ones to market your product to the majority. Therefore, your Purple Cow must be both remarkable enough to attract the innovators and flexible or universal enough to appeal to the majority, once they finally hear about it from a source they’ll listen to.

### Find Your Cow by Taking Risks

Finding your Purple Cow is a matter of looking for extremes. Take a look at your products, your advertisements, your image, even your pricing, and ask yourself: **What are the absolute limits of possibility?** For example, one limit of pricing would be giving your product away for free. It would certainly be remarkable, though it might not get the end results you want. A limit of design might be something so incredibly eye-catching that people are interested just from seeing your product, without any need for advertising.

You won’t necessarily be _going_ to those limits, but you need to see where they are (and where your competitors are) in order to make a plan. Finding the right limit to go to is one of the most surefire ways to make a Purple Cow.

In today’s world of brown cows, **playing it safe is risky.** Making a middle-of-the-road product with broad appeal will all but guarantee that nobody notices it, and trying to copy someone else’s success is equally ill-fated. If your product is just playing follow-the-leader, then by definition it isn’t remarkable (unless you have some great new innovation building off of that other product). You need something that will stand out, something that’ll catch the attention of the innovators and early adopters who will pass it on to others.

Two examples of this idea are the Four Seasons and Motel 6. At first glance, it seems like they have nothing in common, yet both succeeded because they are both exceptional. Motel 6 is cheap and practical, while the Four Seasons is expensive and luxurious. They’re opposite extremes in the hotel industry, which means they both stand out.

#### What Remarkable Doesn’t Mean

There are several concepts that are _not_ remarkability, but are commonly mistaken for it. Here are three of the biggest ones.

  * **Good is the opposite of remarkable.** “Good” products designed to have broad appeal actually have no appeal. They’re boring, and therefore much more likely to fail than exceptional products with smaller target audiences. Nobody talks about an experience that was exactly what they expected it to be, like an airline that gets you where you’re going and doesn’t do much more than that. 
  * **Ridiculous is not the same thing as remarkable.** Running an upside-down commercial filled with fart jokes would be ridiculous, and it might even attract some attention, but probably not the kind you want. Remember, you don’t just need attention, you need people to want your product.
  * **Cheap is not remarkable**. True, everyone loves a good bargain, but don’t rely on cheap pricing to move your product. The problem with this approach is that you’ll inevitably end up in a price war with your competitors; if they’re bigger than you, you’ll lose. 



### What’s Next?

Even if your product does everything right and catches everyone’s attention, you’re not done. Just making a single Purple Cow isn’t enough to run a business forever.

Your next step is to milk the Cow for all it’s worth. If you can, hand it off to another team who will be in charge of squeezing as much money as possible out of your Purple Cow as quickly as they can. Be aware that your window of opportunity won’t stay open forever.

Take the profits you earn and put them into developing your next big thing. Try to make it even better and more remarkable than the last. **Know that you will fail,** maybe a lot, before you hit upon your next big thing. It’s still better than trying to ride your one big win forever; you’ll eventually be overtaken by some new competitor with a new remarkable product. If you can keep this Purple Cow cycle going, your business could stay at the forefront of your industry for a very long time (and make a lot of money in the process).

However, don’t do something new just for the sake of doing it. Churning out mediocre products and ads is worse than doing nothing at all. Wait until you think you have your next Purple Cow before you try to catch people’s attention again. Remember, **remarkability is the key to success,** and **playing it safe is the riskiest thing you can do.**

The old days of safe products and mass marketing are over. The age of the Purple Cow is here.
