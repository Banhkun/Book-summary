## Chapter 6: You Have a Cow—Now What?

There are two goals once you have an established Purple Cow, and at first they might seem to contradict each other:

  1. **Milk it.** Try to get as much out of your Cow as you can for as long as possible. However, recognize that the Cow won’t last forever, and that’s where the second goal comes in.
  2. **Work to create a new Purple Cow** —or at least create a work environment where it’s likely that you’ll make another. This means investing in new projects and innovations, encouraging creativity, and resisting the urge to stifle creativity with compromises.



There is a four-step process to pursue both goals at once, and keep the Purple Cow cycle going:

  1. Once innovators and early adopters pick up your product, get permission from those new fans to let them know the next time you might have a new Purple Cow. _Don’t spam them!_ Only contact them when you’ve got something that’s worth their time.
  2. Work with those innovators and early adopters to help them reach more people. Give them the tools and the slogans they need to spread the word about your Cow. 
  3. Once your Purple Cow is established, hand it off to a different team to milk it. Squeeze everything you can out of your product or service, and do so quickly before it’s no longer remarkable. 
  4. Reinvest your profits into making a new Purple Cow, bigger and better than the last one. **Fail as many times as it takes.** A new success will be worth the failures.



Keeping this cycle going is the key to keeping your business thriving.

Yahoo! and AOL are two companies that _didn't_ continue the cycle. They had one major success each and tried to coast on it forever. Early successes got investors to buy into these companies. However, when they moved entirely into milking their Cows rather than trying to make new ones, it was only a matter of time before they were shoved aside by a competitor: Google.

With that said, you don’t need to be _constantly_ innovating (though it helps). The rewards for one Purple Cow can keep you going for a long time. For example, consider Starbucks. When it started, Starbucks shook up the coffee industry by marketing itself as a luxury brand using everything from Italian names to increased prices; but it was a luxury good that almost anyone could afford. It was a huge success and, even though Starbucks seems commonplace now, that initial push let them open tens of thousands of locations all over the world.

Doing something great is, of course, better than doing nothing.**__** However, **doing nothing is better than doing something mediocre.** Lackluster products or marketing will actively harm your reputation. On the other hand, if you sit back and do nothing until you’re ready for your next Purple Cow, your previous successes can keep advertising themselves and your company.

A good example of this is Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. Rather than crank out mediocre new types of ice cream just to keep the brand fresh, they wait until they have a real winner to add to their lineup. They’re now one of the most popular ice cream companies in the world thanks to their steady stream of remarkable products. The lesson here is: If you don’t have your next Purple Cow yet, **don’t do something just for the sake of doing something.**

To tie it all together: Milk your Cow as much and as quickly as you can, and invest the profits into creating a new Cow. _However_ , don’t bring out a new product just for the sake of doing so. Your new thing must be just as remarkable as your old thing. **And always remember, playing it safe is risky!**

### The Measure of Success

Measuring your results is key, and probably seems like an obvious step. You need to know what’s working so that you can do more of it.

Technology is making it easier to monitor which ideas and products are spreading, and how; in other words, what’s “going viral.” Successful companies will use that data to push effective strategies and products, and quickly kill ones that aren’t working.

A good example of this is Logitech, a company that makes computer peripherals like mice and webcams. The internal workings of their products don’t change very often, because they don’t need to. What they already have works well for most people’s purposes.

However, Logitech is constantly monitoring the user experience, taking feedback, and working to improve their products’ ergonomics, style, and ease of use. While the way the peripherals actually work doesn’t change much, Logitech’s focus on customer experience results in a lot of people who love the company and market them to their friends.

**Traditional mass marketers do not want to do this.** A company Godin used to work for once pitched a product to a large magazine publisher that would let them track who saw and responded to their ads. The publisher was horrified; he knew that kind of data would kill his business, because it would make it clear that the magazine ads weren’t working anymore. It would also make life more complicated for the publisher’s clients, who just wanted to stick with the old ways.

Mass marketing is based on feelings and craft, not science and evidence. That is to say, it _makes sense_ that making an ad with broad appeal and sending it to as many people as possible is the best way to get sales. Mass marketers live by that idea and don’t want data that contradicts it.

**However, the old days of safe products and mass marketing are over. The age of the Purple Cow is here.**

### Checklist: Is My Product a Purple Cow?

Before starting a new marketing venture, refer to the following checklist to make sure your product is following Purple Cow principles. Be brutally honest with yourself while working through the list.

  * My product is significantly different from its competitors in at least one way.
  * My product is _truly remarkable_ , not just ridiculous or “good.”
  * My product was not _specifically designed_ to have broad appeal.
  * My product is not the result of a compromise or of “playing it safe.”
  * My product will advertise itself through a remarkable design feature or function.
  * My product comes with a way for innovators to advertise it to their friends (such as a catchy slogan).
