## Exercise: Who Is Your Innovator?

Identify your ideal first customer.

* * *

Think about the product or service you want to sell. Imagine that your new business venture is ready to go, and now it’s time to find the innovator who will spread your idea to the rest of Moore’s idea curve. Now **imagine that you can advertise your new idea to any _one_ person.** Who would it be? (This doesn’t have to be a specific person, a “type” will work just as well.)

What features of your product will attract his or her attention?

Would your product be appealing to the majority? Why or why not?
