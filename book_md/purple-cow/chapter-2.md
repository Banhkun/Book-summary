## Chapter 2: The Downfall of Mass Marketing

(Shortform note: The failure of traditional marketing is the basis of Godin’s whole Purple Cow idea, and why he thinks it’s needed. Whether mass marketing is actually failing is a point of contention for many critics of _Purple Cow._)

Traditional mass marketing runs on the “5 Ps”—there are actually a lot more than 5, but everyone has their 5 favorites.

Some of these Ps might include:

  * _Product_ : What are you selling?__
  * _Publicity_ : How will you draw attention to your product?
  * _Pricing:_ How much will it cost?
  * _Packaging_ : What will it look like?



Whichever 5 you use, they’re meant to be a quick checklist to make sure that your marketing is effective and appropriate for what you’re selling. However, **the 5 Ps aren’t enough anymore.** To understand why, we need to take a quick look at the history of marketing and where we are today.

### Before, During, and After the Age of Advertising

Before mass marketing,**ideas (and therefore products) spread mostly by word of mouth.** For example, if there was one vegetable seller in the market who had better produce than anyone else, that seller would get talked about in town and would get more business.

During the Age of Advertising, **traditional mass marketing was king.** The winning strategy was to put your ads in front of as many people as possible, and trust that they would want your product and be willing to pay for it. This _used_ to be extremely effective, for a few reasons that don’t hold true anymore.

The main reason why mass marketing was so powerful was the _TV-industrial complex._ This term is a spin on the much-maligned military-industrial complex, and the system worked on the same kind of feedback loop: Companies would spend huge amounts of money purchasing ads. Those ads would then sell product, making profits for the companies, who then turned around and used the profits to buy more ads.

The companies with the best advertising made the most money and bought even more and better advertising. People came to believe that whatever they saw the most on TV had to be the best-quality products. If you’re doubting the power of advertising right now, think about cereal; every time you bought a box of brand-name cereal, you were paying extra money because of advertising.

**However, the Age of Advertising is ending.** Companies are spending millions of dollars trying to keep the loop going, and failing. One major problem is that traditional advertising is all about raising awareness for your product, but awareness isn’t enough anymore, as we’ll see.

According to marketing expert Sergio Zyman, two of Coke’s most popular commercials (“teach the world to sing” and “mean Joe Greene”) got tons of attention, but that attention didn’t translate to increased profits for Coke. Zyman had something similar to say about Kmart: Everyone _knows_ about it, but that doesn’t mean they go there.

With the Age of Advertising coming to an end, we’re back to word of mouth advertising. However, **that word of mouth is now hugely amplified by the internet and social media.** The world is much more interconnected than it used to be, so ideas that catch on will spread much faster.

### Why Mass Marketing Doesn’t Work Anymore

There are three major reasons why mass marketing is failing.

First of all, **the obvious targets for mass marketing are gone.** For example, think about Aspirin, the first major pain reliever on the market. It was cheap, was low risk, had obvious benefits, and almost everyone needed it sooner or later. Perhaps most importantly, it had no competition. It was a perfect candidate for mass marketing.

Now, though, there are dozens of painkillers out there. A new one would have a hard time finding traction in that crowded market, even if it is somehow a little better than the others. If you were trying to sell this new drug you’d have to find customers who need a painkiller, who are willing to try a new kind, and who have the time and energy to listen to your advertising. Even though almost everyone needs a painkiller at some point, the people interested in _yours_ will only be a small fraction of the population.

Second, **consumers will ignore you.** This is a relatively new phenomenon; even twenty years ago consumers had more free time, more available money, and fewer choices in what to buy. There were fewer things to spend money on but, at the same time, people’s needs were mostly met. Therefore, business became about selling people what they _want_ , and marketing got them to _want_ more and more.

Today, the number of choices people have keeps increasing, but the time and money to sort through them all keep decreasing. (Shortform note: Consider the rising cost of rent and college tuition compared to just twenty years ago. Also think about expensive cell phone plans and all the online services billed every month, all draining would-be customers’ bank accounts.) As a result of this, **people today are stingier with both their money and their attention.** Especially now, people are most likely to stick with what they know or what their trusted friends suggest.

Mass marketing often runs afoul of the _Law of Large Numbers_ : the idea that big numbers tend to come with big denominators. If you’re reaching millions of people, but only a tiny fraction of those people buy your product or click your ad, you’ve wasted time and money. (To avoid this problem, you need to figure out who’s likely to listen (more on that in Chapter 3) and **target those people with the perfect message for them.** Figure out the right combination of Ps to win them over.)

The third problem is that **customers who are already satisfied aren’t likely to spread new ideas**. Phrased another way, people who are happy with what they have aren’t looking for new products or services. To compound this problem, companies are constantly getting better at knowing what their customers want and delivering it, which makes it harder and harder for newcomers to get people’s attention.

A closely related problem is that it’s hard to spread new ideas through populations that are already cluttered with too much advertising and too much stuff. There’s so much advertising noise already; consumers are going to be reluctant to add to it. They won’t spread the word about a new product unless they’re certain the people they talk to will be excited about it.

### Case Study: The Wall Street Journal

Many companies are not adapting to the changing times. They see new marketing techniques like the Purple Cow as fads, rather than proven strategies that should be embraced.

_The Wall Street Journal_ provides the perfect example of this. A full-page ad in the _Journal_ costs hundreds of thousands of dollars (Shortform note: Google puts the price at around $240,000), a price that many willingly pay to put their products in front of as many eyes as possible.

However, **the ads don’t work.** Godin once asked some people reading the _Wall Street Journal_ if they could name even two of the companies who had full-page ads in the paper they’d just finished reading. They couldn’t. Also, they said that they had never—not once—looked for more information on a product after seeing an ad in the _Journal_.

The advertising clearly isn’t working, yet companies keep shelling out huge amounts of money for it. These companies don’t believe in the Purple Cow, and they don’t want to change their approach—they just want to do what works. However, this is exactly the point: **The Purple Cow is needed because nothing else is working**.

### The Mass Product / Mass Marketing Loop

Mass marketing is used to push mass products; that is, products designed to appeal to everyone. However, mass products are boring. Companies trying to make products with broad appeal will take spicy foods and make them blander, sacrifice high quality in favor of low cost, and so forth. **Products designed to appeal to everyone will not appeal to anyone.**

Furthermore, mass marketing requires mass spending. Companies can spend tens of millions—if not hundreds of millions—of dollars on a nationwide product rollout. Frontloading that kind of expense demands fast and impressive results, which boring products are unlikely to get. It also has two side effects:

  1. You can’t launch as many new products because of the huge cost associated with each one.
  2. You have no time to reach the majority of the population (more about this in Chapter 3). You’ll have given up or, worse, gone bankrupt by the time the majority of the population becomes interested in your product.



Rather than spending all that money on advertising, **you’re better off investing it into making something truly remarkable and letting the product speak for itself.**

Consider Tide laundry detergent, made by Procter & Gamble. This is a product that’s continually improved and marketed based on old wisdom. P&G invests millions of dollars every year into making their product better—but not remarkable. Even with all the money they’re sinking into R&D, at this point, it’s not likely that they’ll come up with something so innovative and exciting that it attracts a lot of new buyers. This strategy is most likely left over from a time when people had the time and energy to seek out the best laundry detergent on the market. Now, however, most people simply don’t care. Their clothes get clean, and that’s good enough.

It’s not hard to see how Tide got locked into this cycle. In its early days, Tide was hugely successful, simply due to being a good product with good distribution and advertising. However, with the TV-industrial complex dying, ads are much less effective than they used to be. Right now, Tide’s distribution is the only thing keeping it afloat—Wal-Mart accounts for a full third of its sales, so if something happens to Wal-Mart or it stops carrying Tide detergent, the product is doomed no matter how much money goes into R&D.

This clearly is not a winning strategy. According to Purple Cow logic, Procter & Gamble should cut their losses, stop sinking so much money into a dying product, and instead **use that money for exciting new innovations** in other markets.
