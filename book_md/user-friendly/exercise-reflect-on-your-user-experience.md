## Exercise: Reflect on Your User Experience

Kuang and Fabricant write that user experience design prioritizes the user in multiple ways: by considering what kind of product will be valuable to the user, by using a mental model that helps the user understand how the product works, and by using good feedback to make the product operation intuitive. Use these exercises to reflect on how the products in your daily life meet these user-friendly standards.

* * *

Write down a technology or product that you use almost daily and that you think of as indispensable. Why is it valuable to you, and how does it make your life easier?

Does the product you listed above have an underlying mental model or metaphor that helps you understand how that technology works? If so, explain the mental model, and if not, explain why the mental model might not be needed (for example, if it’s an appliance you’ve used your whole life, so it’s always been intuitive).

What kind of feedback does the technology have that’s helpful? For example, it might have a low-battery alarm or a satisfying click when an action is successfully performed. What kind of feedback does it lack that might make it more user-friendly?

Now write down a technology or product that you find frustrating. What are the specific aspects of the design that you don’t like? For example, is it something that’s not particularly useful (doesn’t meet your needs) or has poor feedback (like an obnoxious or overly sensitive alarm)?
