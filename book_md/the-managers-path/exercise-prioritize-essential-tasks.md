## Exercise: Prioritize Essential Tasks

Prioritizing is an important part of strategic planning and being a good engineering manager because it lets you complete your most important tasks without getting overwhelmed. In this exercise, you’ll sort through a list of tasks to determine which ones you should prioritize.

* * *

First, write down your tasks. (For example, if you’re in HR, your tasks might be submitting payroll, sending an email to a coworker who’s leaving the office soon, reviewing job applications, and researching a competitor’s pay scale.)

Now, review your list and note any _urgent_ tasks here. These are tasks that must be completed immediately. (For example, you’d put submitting payroll and sending an email on this list because they’re time-sensitive: You must submit payroll before the banks close and email your coworker before they go home. The other tasks can be done later, so they’re not included.)

In this box, note any _important_ tasks on your first list. Important tasks directly affect your ability to do your job. (For example, you’d put submitting payroll, reviewing job applications, and researching a competitor’s pay scale on this list. If you don’t submit payroll, you'll have to field complaints tomorrow instead of doing your other tasks; and if you don’t review job applications or ensure your salaries are competitive, you won’t be able to attract new employees. Your ability to do your job won’t be affected if you don’t send the email, so it’s not included.)

Finally, compare your urgent and important lists. Write down any tasks that are on _both_ lists here. These are the tasks you should prioritize. (For example, submitting payroll is on both lists, so you’d prioritize that over your other tasks, which are each on only one list.) Note: Once you’ve finished the tasks that are both urgent and important, prioritize the ones on your _important_ list—in our example, reviewing job applications and researching a competitor’s pay scale.
