## Exercise: Turn Misfortune Into a Gain

Consider how you can shift your Gap-thinking to Gain-thinking using a recent event in your life.

* * *

Think about a recent event in your life that put you in the Gap mentality. What were your Gap thoughts? In other words, what was going through your mind as you were stuck in the Gap? What idealized version of your future self were you comparing your present self to?

What did this event teach you about yourself, other people, or the world at large?

How will you use what youâ€™ve learned from this event to act or think differently in the future?

What about this event are you thankful for? Why?
