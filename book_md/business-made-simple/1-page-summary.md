## 1-Page Summary

If you’ve ever asked yourself why you aren’t making as much progress in your business career as you’d like, Donald Miller says he knows the answer: You’re not adding enough value to your company. Businesses always have the bottom line in mind, and they’re much more likely to notice and promote people who quantifiably bring more money into the company than people who simply do exactly what’s in the job description and nothing more. For this reason, Miller argues that you should see yourself not as a mere employee, but as an investment by your organization—and one that should provide a good return.

Miller proposes 11 steps to become a good investment for your company, from developing value-adding personal traits to learning how to effectively execute a plan. By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to add value to your company—or show others how to add value to your company—no matter what your role.

Donald Miller is the owner of StoryBrand, a company that helps businesses craft more effective story-based marketing messaging. Miller teaches the “StoryBrand Framework” at workshops for companies and individuals and via an online course. He’s also written a book called _Building a StoryBrand_ and hosts a podcast of the same name. In this guide, we’ll supplement Miller’s recommendations with advice from other business thinkers, psychological background on some of his ideas, and ideas from his other works.

### Your Goal in Business: To Be a Good Investment for Your Company

**To succeed in business, you must _add value_ to the company. This means being able to make money for a company**, writes Miller. If you can do this, you’re far more likely to rise within an organization or find success starting your own business, because the only thing leaders and investors care about is your ability to generate value.

(Shortform note: Making a company money may be easy for executives in marketing or sales, whose work directly influences revenue, but what if you’re only entry-level or work in administration? Based on the examples Miller uses in the book, it seems as though his advice does apply more to high-level employees working in fields like sales and marketing. However, he’d likely also argue that _anyone_ can find ways to be a good investment: An admin could find a way to save money on office supplies, for example, or retain customers through exceptional customer service.)

For instance, if you’re in marketing and devise a campaign that reaches thousands of new prospects and earns the company more money, you’re far more likely to be noticed and promoted than a colleague who simply does what the job description requires and nothing more.

### 11 Steps to Become a Good Investment for Your Company

Miller recommends 11 sequential steps that can help you become a good investment for your company. Let’s look at each.

#### Step 1: Develop Value-Adding Character Traits

The first step to becoming a good investment is strength of _character_ , writes Miller. A strong, value-driven character consists of these 10 traits:

**Trait 1: You See Yourself as an Economic Asset.** Successful professionals view themselves as entities that can provide value to a company (rather than merely as employees). Learn how to quantify and explain what value you add—for instance, how many sales you made last year and what revenue those brought in. Additionally, try to earn back for the company at least five times your salary: This nets the company a modest profit.

(Shortform note: There’s a growing business trend that argues that instead of viewing yourself as either an employee or a value-creator, you view yourself as an important part of a business’s _culture_. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses are increasingly focusing on creating work environments that make employees healthy and happy, and therefore productive. In other words, they’re moving away from a perspective that sees employees solely as investments and toward a perspective that sees them as people with personal needs and goals, which a job must meet.)

**Trait 2: You’re an Active Agent in Your Life.** If you see yourself as a victim and make excuses for why you’re not performing your best, you’ll never succeed or become a good investment for your company, asserts Miller. What’s more, by actively pursuing new goals, you learn and grow.

(Shortform note: Seeing yourself as an active agent is tantamount to having an _internal locus of control_. This is a concept in psychology that indicates how in control of your life you feel: An internal locus means you feel in control of your fate, while an external locus means you feel you have little control over your life. Generally, feeling that you have agency indicates good mental health.)

**Trait 3: You React to Problems Calmly.** You’ll accomplish more and earn the respect of your peers if you can respond to problems with greater equanimity than the situation might truly merit. Problems suck up mental energy, so being able to solve them gracefully saves you and others energy.

(Shortform note: This advice may seem difficult to act on at first, but meditation and mindfulness might help you respond to problems gracefully. When facing a crisis, take a minute to breathe mindfully in a quiet place. Then, proceed with what you were doing. Investing energy into a brief meditation often can prevent you from mindlessly investing _more_ energy in a problem.)

**Trait 4: You Gladly Accept Feedback.** Feedback helps you excel, even if it may be difficult to face at first. Consider actively and regularly seeking out feedback from mentors and friends.

(Shortform note: You might get more out of a feedback request if you ask for a specific type of feedback: an evaluation of your standing, coaching on how to improve, or appreciation of your efforts and abilities.)

**Trait 5: You Manage Conflict Productively.** You understand that to advance, you’ll need to confront and navigate conflict. Miller recommends dealing with conflict in four steps:

  1. Accept conflict as part of moving forward. 
  2. Avoid intense negative emotions, as these exacerbate the conflict. 
  3. Show respect for the person you’re in conflict with to prevent their defenses from being raised. 
  4. Aim for resolution, not for being right. 



(Shortform note: There are other approaches to conflict management, some of which advise you to conduct a self-analysis of your role in the conflict—something Miller doesn’t ask you to do. To perform this self-analysis, you’d ask yourself what started the conflict, who you’re mad at, what goal you want to achieve that you’re not currently achieving, and what you fear losing. In Miller’s four-step conflict management approach, this self-analysis might fall after the first step: Once you’ve accepted the conflict, you’d then logically consider your part in it before talking it out with the other person.)

**Trait 6: You Prioritize Being Respected Over Being Liked.** When you become a manager, it’s more important for the success of the company and team that others _trust_ you rather than _like_ you. Earn trust by setting clear goals, ensuring everyone knows their individual responsibilities, and rewarding them when they fulfill those goals and responsibilities.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles, _Jack Canfield adds another, perhaps less appealing, way to maintain your team’s trust: by taking responsibility for bad outcomes that were the result of your decisions. While owning up to mistakes may sound unpleasant, in the long term, it’s better for you and the team because you avoid sowing distrust by deflecting responsibility.)

**Trait 7: You’re Action-Oriented.** You habitually see projects through to completion, understanding that it’s not enough to intend or plan to do something: You must actually do it.

**Trait 8: You Trust That You Know What to Do.** When you trust and act on your knowledge, you advance faster than if you procrastinate or feign confusion to avoid a difficult decision.

(Shortform note: The two above traits are psychologically related: When you trust that you know what to do and that you can execute tasks—a concept referred to in psychology as self-efficacy—you tend to be more action-oriented. What’s more, you’re more likely to bounce back from setbacks, a trait we might imagine being well-placed on this list.)

**Trait 9: You’re Overwhelmingly Positive.** Feeling optimistic about the outcomes of your actions means you take more risks, which means you reap greater rewards in the long run.

**Trait 10: You Believe You Can Improve.** When you believe in your capacity to get better, you don’t give up after a failure, seeing it instead as a growth opportunity. You also take on greater challenges because you believe you can rise to meet them. The result of this is that you _do_ grow and improve, which leads to more responsibility and higher pay.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Advantage, _Shawn Achor contends that the above traits of positivity and belief in your ability to improve are especially important in difficult situations. He describes the three responses you can have to a problem: to keep mulling it over and accomplish nothing, to exacerbate the problem through another bad decision, or to take the opportunity to grow and improve. Only when you _believe_ you can improve as a result of adversity will you have the third response and grow.)

#### Step 2: Become an Effective Leader by Creating a Company Story

The second of Miller’s steps for becoming a valuable asset centers around creating a company story, which will help you become an effective leader.

Miller asserts that when you acquire the 10 character traits we just discussed, you’ll eventually be promoted into a leadership position. He then argues that to add value as a leader, you need to **create a company story for your team to be a part of**. A company story explains why you exist and why others—employees and customers—should engage with you. Without a coherent story or quest in which every employee plays a critical role, your company will lack focus and direction and will inevitably fail.

(Shortform note: Others agree with Miller on the importance of creating a company story, adding that, contrary to popular belief, it’s not the brilliant business idea or the visionary leader who makes a company stand out. Rather, the strength of the organization as a whole makes a company successful—and having a strong story adds to a company’s strength.)

Create a company story by first **writing a mission statement that inspires people to take action or join up**. Miller provides a template mission statement you can fill in: “We will accomplish [goal] by [date or year] because of [why achieving the goal is important].” For instance, if you sell a calendar software, your mission statement might be: “We will be the most used calendar software in the tech industry by 2025 because organization is key to progress.”

(Shortform note: Business thinkers have devised countless ways to craft an effective mission statement. Miller’s statement is story-oriented, but others recommend focusing more on your company’s purpose and how your company is different from others.)

Next, define the traits your employees must possess to fulfill the company’s mission. These should both encourage transformation and imply a specific behavioral change. For instance, a trait might be “supports other teammates.”

Now decide on three simple, repeatable actions that employees must take to pursue your mission each day. These might be: 1) Check in with your team to gauge progress. 2) Check that your goals for the day are aligned with our mission. 3) Make contact with at least one prospect.

(Shortform note: One objection to Miller’s recommendation to define traits and actions that help support the mission is that these likely differ between employees and departments. The traits a marketing team acquires to support the mission are likely different from those the accounting team must acquire, for instance. What’s more, if you make the traits and actions broad enough to apply to everyone, they’ll probably become vague and not easily actionable. An alternative approach might be to define the values __ everyone in the company should hold and then to create traits and actions that are specific to each department.)

#### Step 3: Enhance Productivity by Focusing Only on Critical Tasks

The third step toward becoming a good company investment is to manage your time to get the most value out of every hour. According to Miller, the best way to do this is to **prioritize the tasks that give you the highest return on your investment of energy.** Then, delegate or eliminate the other tasks.

Miller says you can best prioritize by creating two task lists: one that contains the three most important things to get done today and another one that contains all other, less important tasks. Then, get the three key tasks done first (or at least a piece of each key task, if they’re big).

(Shortform note: If Miller’s advice to create two task lists to aid prioritization isn’t detailed enough for your needs, you might follow some of David Allen’s advice in _Getting Things Done._ You could sub-organize your non-critical task list into tasks you’re waiting for additional input on, tasks you want to do at some point _,_ and tasks you’ll need to address in the future. You could also sub-organize important tasks into task types—like personal tasks, delegated tasks, and so on. This might further help you determine which tasks give you the highest return on your time investment.)

#### Step 4: Become an Expert Strategist by Visualizing Your Business as an Airplane

Miller writes that to become the most value-adding employee you can be, you must next learn how to strategize. He defines **strategizing as the act of balancing divisions and priorities to maximize company success**. The best way to do this is to see your business as an airplane that consists of five distinct parts or divisions: a body (your overhead), wings (your products and services), a right engine (marketing), a left engine (sales), and fuel (capital and cash flow).

Critically, **to fly and stay airborne, you must ensure all parts are in the right proportion to each other and support each other**. Otherwise, the plane may be too heavy (too much overhead), there might not be enough fuel (not enough capital), or your wings might not be strong enough (your products aren’t popular).

For example, if you want to hire more people and increase the weight of the plane’s body, your engines of marketing and sales must be powerful enough to keep the new weight aloft. You might thus launch a new campaign and increase your sales team’s monthly targets.

Specifically, to stay aloft, Miller recommends keeping overhead low, ensuring your products are both profitable and in demand, creating a marketing test website that lets you refine your messaging and gauge interest, building a sales funnel, and carefully monitoring cash flow.

> **Other Interpretations of the Business-Plane Analogy**
> 
> Miller isn’t the only person to use a plane as an analogy for business. However, others present the analogy differently, and include aspects of business that Miller doesn’t account for in his metaphor. For example:
> 
> **The Pilot Is the Leader**. Some compare the airplane pilot to its leader. Pilots must possess experience and skill to maneuver the plane safely, in the same way that a CEO must have business acumen to successfully lead a new company.
> 
> **The Crew Are the Employees.** Miller sees the salaries you pay employees merely as part of overhead. In other words, for him, employees are just a cost. But others view your team as actively contributing to your business success. Because of this, you must invest in training them and keeping them happy.
> 
> **The Fuselage Is the Culture.** Miller sees the fuselage (the body of a plane) as the overhead that must be supported, but others perceive the fuselage as the culture that keeps the organization together. For this reason, you must carefully create a culture that can gel your organization.
> 
> **The Passengers Are the Customers.** In your company, your employees are responsible for ensuring the comfort of customers, in the same way a flight crew ensures the comfort of passengers.
> 
> This interpretation of the plane analogy illustrates how a business works _in general_ , while Miller focuses on how to _balance_ the parts of the plane to ensure your plane can stay airborne (in other words, to ensure the company brings in enough revenue to support itself). For this reason, Miller doesn’t take into account culture, customers, or leadership, which don’t, at least directly, have anything to do with strategic revenue maximization.

#### Step 5: Base Your Messaging on a Story the Customer Can Star In

Let’s move on to marketing messaging, the fifth step toward adding value to your organization. Miller stresses that **the best way to grab a customer’s attention is to tell them a story they’re the star of**. He provides a story template into which you can plug the elements of your business to create a compelling story. You can then use that story whenever marketing or selling your product: in collateral, ads, and so on. Let’s examine these elements:

**The customer is the hero and has a goal:** Position the customer as a hero because the hero of any story is always on a journey of growth, and this is what customers identify with. Their goal must be related to something your product helps them achieve. For instance, your customer is a hero business executive who wants to organize their schedule more effectively.

**The customer faces an obstacle to their goal:** In every story, the hero must encounter an obstacle, otherwise the audience loses interest. In a marketing context, the obstacle is the problem your product solves. In our example, the obstacle would be the inflexible and inadequate free calendar software the customer’s currently using.

**You are the guide who can help the hero overcome their obstacle:** The guide of a story is wise, empathetic, and knows how to help the hero reach their goal. By positioning yourself as the guide, you become someone whose help the hero wants. In our example, you tell the customer you understand their frustration with the obstacle and that you have a solution: a calendar software that’s easy to use and totally customizable.

**You give the hero a plan to overcome their obstacle:** Show the customer the simple steps they can take to overcome their obstacle by buying your product. You might tell your customer they simply have to schedule a consultation on your website, pay for the product, and then download and customize it.

**You challenge the hero to take action:** If you don’t ask your customer to take action to overcome their obstacle by buying your product, they won’t buy it. Tell the customer to act now and perhaps even include an incentive, like a discount.

**The hero will gain something if they succeed and lose something if they fail:** Explain how the customer will benefit by taking the action of buying your product. Similarly, explain what they stand to lose if they don’t take action to buy your product. Without an idea of the stakes of not taking action, customers won’t feel urgency to buy. To conclude our example message, you might say that the customer will become more efficient and that their business might even grow due to their superior organization. Conversely, if they don’t buy your product, they’ll be stuck in a state of sub-par organization and perpetual confusion.

> **Drawing on Story Lessons From _Building a StoryBrand_**
> 
> In _Building a StoryBrand_ , Miller goes into more detail on story creation for marketing purposes. Here are some additional lessons about story-based marketing Miller doesn’t cover in _Business Made Simple._
> 
> **The story must come first. **Not only should you tell a story about the customer, you must also omit any marketing information that isn’t directly related to that story. Often, companies are tempted to include details in their marketing about the origin of the business or their company values. While companies should have these written down somewhere, they should _not_ be in their marketing collateral.
> 
> **The hero’s goals must be related to survival needs. **Miller also elaborates in _Building a StoryBrand_ that your hero’s goals (and therefore the goals your product fulfills) must be related to their _survival_. He argues that the human brain only pays attention to inputs that help it survive, therefore all marketing messaging must explain how a product helps someone survive. This might be by providing nourishment, safety, connections, and existential meaning.
> 
> **You can personify the obstacle as a villain. **When establishing the obstacle standing between your hero and their goal, consider turning it into a living being the customer can have negative feelings toward. For instance, you might depict the obstacle of an out-of-date software as an evil talking computer.
> 
> **Show your confidence as a guide through your website. **To convince the customer that you, the guide, are competent, you can use testimonials, statistics, awards, and logos of clients on your website.
> 
> **Give your plan a title. **Miller specifically recommends giving the plan you present to the customer a memorable title. This makes the plan seem more official and thus trustworthy.
> 
> **Consider two types of calls to action. **Miller elaborates in _Building a StoryBrand_ that there are two types of calls to action: direct and transitional. A direct call to action asks the customer to take action now to buy. A transitional call to action builds rapport between the customer and your brand, priming them to think of you when they later need to make a purchase. Depending on your customer, one call to action might work better than the other.
> 
> **Remember that people fear losing something more than they desire acquiring something. **When considering what positive and negative stakes to include in your marketing story, be aware that people are usually more motivated by a fear of losing something than the possibility of gaining something. For this reason, you might stress the negative stakes over the positive ones—emphasize that if they don’t buy your product, customers will suffer inconvenience, reduced productivity or health, and so on.

#### Step 6: Develop a Three-Step Sales Funnel That Builds Customer Trust

Now it’s time to learn the mechanics of marketing in your effort to become a value-driven team member. Miller believes the most important element of a marketing strategy is a strong sales funnel. **A sales funnel lets you stay in touch with customers, which builds trust and, eventually, sales.**

According to Miller, a sales funnel must take the prospect through three phases: curiosity, understanding, and purchase.

(Shortform note: Though he describes it, Miller doesn’t define what a sales funnel is outright. According to another source, a sales funnel is a representation of a customer’s shift from merely being aware of a product to buying it. In addition to letting you maintain contact and track customers, it also helps you determine a target group of customers so you can focus your efforts. What’s more, you can visualize the sales funnel in different ways than what Miller recommends. For instance, you could view the sales funnel as having four phases: awareness of the product, interaction with the brand (by requesting more information, for instance), continued interest in the product, and action to buy.)

To engage a prospective customer’s curiosity, craft a simple sentence that contains: 1) a problem, 2) the solution that is your product, and 3) the result of solving the problem using your product.

(Shortform note: It’s occasionally unclear in his book where Miller recommends using pitches and marketing materials like the above sentence to pique the customer’s curiosity. Based on _Building a StoryBrand, _we might infer that he wants you to use such pitches across all marketing platforms and collateral.)

Once the prospective customer is curious about your product, enhance their _understanding_ of it by explaining how it helps them survive. For instance, you might describe the features of the product and show how these improve the customer’s life. The best way to help the prospect understand your product is through a _lead generator_. This is a free product you offer—often a PDF, video, or other media—in exchange for your prospective customer’s email address (thus, the product generates a “lead” or new customer for the company). The content of this lead generator must help the prospective customer solve a problem and therefore be of real value to them.

(Shortform note: Miller notes some additional tips in _Building a StoryBrand _on how to create a great lead generator. First, always give your lead generator a title (for example: “Six mistakes marketers make.” This makes it more interesting and memorable for the reader. Further, have the lead generator appear as a pop-up on your website 10 seconds after the customer opens the page. Finally, don’t be afraid to include more information and value in the lead generator than might feel comfortable at first—it will strengthen trust because you’re helping the customer better understand how the product helps them survive.)

Only once you’ve completed the first two steps can you ask a customer for a purchase. This is because the first two steps establish a relationship with the customer that generates faith in your product and primes them to buy.

(Shortform note: We can link Miller’s belief that you must establish a relationship with your customer before asking them to buy to Malcolm Gladwell’s notion of _priming._Priming is the act of exposing someone to a stimulus that prompts a specific response to a later stimulus. In this way, you might prime your customer to buy from your brand by first exposing them to marketing stimuli about your brand that appeal to them.)

#### Step 7: Communicate in a Story Format so Others Listen

Beyond being an effective marketer, to add value to your company, you must also excel at basic communication—and especially presentations, claims Miller.

When making a sales presentation, Miller recommends following the story structure we discussed earlier: Immediately state what problem you’ll help the customer solve and your proposed solution (your product or service). Explain how your product will change the customer’s life, what next steps they should take, and the key takeaways they must remember.

Additionally, for _any_ type of presentation, decide what the main point of your presentation is and connect every subpoint to that main point. If you don’t show how the subpoints feed into your main point, audiences won’t follow them and will become confused. Miller recommends having only three or four subpoints in a presentation.

> **Additional Tips on Public Speaking From the World of TED Talks**
> 
> Miller’s advice on how to deliver an effective presentation is useful but relatively basic. However, if you want to craft a unique and memorable presentation, consider following some advice from Carmine Gallo based on the TED talk format.
> 
> First, if you have time, consider weaving in stories _other_ than the one about your product. Gallo agrees with Miller that stories engage people more than any other form of communication, and he suggests you tell your audience a story about your life (perhaps your journey to becoming a business owner) or a story about another person (perhaps a happy customer).
> 
> What’s more, in addition to connecting subpoints to your main point to keep your presentation logical, Gallo also stresses that your presentation should be short—no more than 18 minutes. If it’s longer than that, your audience will tune out, and no matter how logical and well-organized it is, your presentation won’t make an impact.

#### Step 8: Make the Sale by Qualifying Leads, Telling a Story, and Sending Proposals

Now that you’ve mastered messaging, marketing, and communication, let’s move on to how to add value to your company through sales. Miller recommends three actions to take when selling: qualifying leads, pitching in a story format, and sending physical proposals to prospects.

To avoid wasting company time and money on people who won’t buy your product, qualify leads (verify a potential customer’s likelihood of buying) before engaging further with them. Do this by answering the following questions about them: 1) Do they have a problem your product can solve? 2) Is your product within their budget? 3) Do they have permission from their boss, spouse, or other authority, to buy the product? You can determine these answers by talking to the lead and understanding their situation.

(Shortform note: For other sales professionals, asking questions is not only key to _qualifying_ leads but is also key to _making the sale_ itself. Instead of pushing your pitch and product onto the customer, ask questions that let the customer decide for themselves that they want the product, writes Jeffrey Gitomer in the _Little Red Book of Selling_. But it’s important to ask the right questions. These shouldn’t try to uncover how the customer’s currently doing things but rather should make the customer think about how your product could be a better solution. For instance, you might ask: “If you needed to schedule a video call with team members from all over the world in the next hour, would that be easy?”)

Miller states that your sales pitch should be made in a story format similar to the one we discussed in Step 7: First state the customer’s problem and articulate the irritation the prospect feels as a result. Then, explain your proposed solution, followed by a reference to the other clients you’ve helped with the same problem and their testimonials. End by explaining your plan to solve the problem.

(Shortform note: Carmine Gallo suggests another reason, beyond their ability to engage, that stories are extremely effective communication and sales tools: When hearing a story, the audiences’ brains go through the same neurological patterns as the storyteller’s. This means that if you, as the salesperson, are enthusiastic about your product and its ability to solve the customer’s problem, the listener will become so, too.)

Finally, after you’ve delivered your pitch, give your prospect a document or video that succinctly explains what you’re offering. This way, the prospect has all the details they need to make a decision even if they’ve forgotten your pitch.

(Shortform note: Science backs Miller’s recommendation to give listeners a written summary of your presentation—studies show that people retain only a fraction of the content of any presentation. For instance, when students listen to a 15-minute lecture, they retain 41% of its content. When they listen to a 40-minute presentation, that percentage goes down to 20%. Either way, listeners don’t retain even half the materials in a presentation.)

#### Step 9: Negotiate Effectively by Determining the Other Party’s Negotiating Style

Your ninth step in adding value is to learn how to become a confident negotiator. Miller writes that the most important lesson to learn is that **there are two types of negotiation: cooperative and adversarial**. In a cooperative negotiation, both parties want each other to leave the negotiation happy. In an adversarial negotiation, one or both parties want to win and see the other party fail.

(Shortform note: Someone’s negotiation style might correlate to their reciprocity style, a concept Adam Grant describes in _Give and Take. _He describes the “giver” style as applying to people who give more to others than they receive. Meanwhile “takers” want to receive more than they give, and they feel others must lose for them to be able to gain. If you’re a cooperative negotiator, you might be a giver, while if you’re an adversarial one, you might be a taker.)

The key is to know what kind of negotiators you and the other party are and to become adversarial if the other party is adversarial. To end the negotiation when you’re satisfied, _pretend_ you’re dissatisfied with the outcome: This signals to the other party that they’ve won.

(Shortform note: To convincingly feign dissatisfaction at the end of a negotiation, you might take a page out of Jordan Belfort’s _The Way of the Wolf. _He recommends playing with vocal tonalities to better deliver a pitch, and you can do the same in a negotiation. For instance, inflecting statements as if they were questions makes you seem agreeable but also demands the other party confirm what you’ve just said. You might use this to your advantage by saying, “This is far more money than I was expecting to pay” with a questioning inflection, which prompts the other party to confirm this and makes them feel satisfied they’ve won.)

Additionally, think about what factors other than money influence the other party’s decision, and capitalize on those. You’re more likely to seal a deal when you also speak to the other party’s emotional—not just financial—needs. For instance, when negotiating the sale of a used car on your lot, think about what other facets of the car the buyer might care about. Perhaps the buyer wants to look good when driving, in which case you might point out the sleek leather interior.

(Shortform note: To understand what other factors a buyer is considering, develop empathy as a salesperson. Zig Ziglar believes empathy is key in salespeople because it lets them understand how the customer feels and tailor their pitch to those feelings. Further, when customers feel their needs are understood, they’re more likely to buy.)

#### Step 10: Manage Teams Effectively Using Metrics

Let’s now turn to effective management of people, the 10th step of becoming a good company investment. Miller contends that **a value-driven manager relies on input and output metrics as their guiding light because these indicate _concretely_ what they’re doing well and what they could be doing better.** An input metric (what Miller refers to as a _lead indicator_) is a measure of how much work goes _into_ producing an output. An output metric (what Miller calls a _lag indicator_) is a measure of how much output was produced by the input.

For instance, three weekly social media posts (input metric) lead to 300 new followers through your social media page (output metric).

Use these metrics to make decisions that increase the value your department adds to the company. For instance, you might decide that relative to competitors, accruing 300 followers a week isn’t enough, and you might then increase the input metric to garner more followers.

> **Avoid Tracking “Vanity” Metrics**
> 
> While tracking metrics is a common and accepted facet of growing a business, it’s critical that you track the _right_ metrics. In _The Lean Startup, _Eric Ries warns against tracking “vanity metrics”: metrics that make the picture of your company look rosy but don’t actually reflect positive change.
> 
> Such vanity metrics are numbers that always increase, without intervention on your part. This could be the number of social media posts you make a year: By the end of the year, you might have 300 more social media posts than you had at the start of the year, which you might perceive as a success. But if you’ve simply consistently produced six posts a week all year, those 300 new posts don’t indicate progress. They just indicate you’ve been doing things the same as last year.
> 
> Conversely, if you were to track the _rate_ at which you produce posts, you’d see the rate was stagnant at six posts a week, and you could decide to increase that rate. Often, the right metrics to track are input metrics because these reflect what you’re doing on a daily or weekly basis and are more within your control to change.
> 
> Tracking only vanity metrics keeps you from making important changes to your business because they give you the false impression you’re doing everything perfectly already.

#### Step 11: Execute Well Using a Plan

The final step of becoming a value-adding employee is being able to execute a project or idea. Miller breaks successful execution of a new project into three steps:

  1. **Have a launch meeting to discuss a project.** Decide what the successful execution of the product will look like, who’s involved, what you’ll need to execute it (people and resources), and what the timeline will be. 
  2. **Check in with the team weekly.** This should be brief and only ensure everyone knows what their next step is. 
  3. **Keep track of your progress.** Do this publicly and measure input metrics—the efforts going into producing an output—rather than output metrics (which you can’t positively impact because the output’s already been produced). This will encourage your team to push themselves. 



> **Launch Projects Effectively by Limiting Inefficiencies**
> 
> When launching a new project, it’s easy to become bogged down in communication and minor, unimportant tasks that draw your attention away from the final aim of the project. In _A World Without Email, _Cal Newport proposes ways to manage your communication and check-ins so that they don’t interfere with your progress.
> 
> To track your progress effectively, Newport recommends using task boards: physical or digital boards with columns that represent stages of a project and cards that represent tasks. You can move tasks between stages and even relabel the stages to accommodate a new type of project. Newport even advises bringing this board to your regular team meeting. This way, everyone can see what others’ progress is and can better visualize what their next step is.
> 
> Finally, Newport recommends devising an effective process for scheduling irregular meetings, like a launch meeting. Scheduling such large meetings can be time-consuming and is a task better handled by an administrator or scheduling service than by the person leading the project.
