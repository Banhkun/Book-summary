## Exercise: Explore How You Can Be a Better Gardener Parent

Gopnik’s advice centers on providing a nurturing environment for your child to grow in without trying to control who they’ll become. Consider how you can apply this knowledge to better understand your child. (If you don’t have a child, consider how you could apply this to your relationship with any child in your life).

What are some natural interests you’ve noticed your child has developed?

When you think about your child’s interests, do you feel that you want to help them hone or perfect that skill? If you sense you have a wish for your child to use this skill to achieve something or gain success, briefly describe that wish.

Gopnik recommends resisting the desire to steer your child toward a preconceived vision of success. What could you do to encourage your child’s interest without pushing them toward a particular outcome?

Can you help guide your child through their formal education in a way that encourages them to simply explore their interests rather than achieve some vision of success? For instance, if your child loves playing the flute, and their teacher is strongly encouraging them to join orchestra because they think it will help your child realize their full potential, you might tell your child that they don't have to join orchestra and that it's okay to not "do something" with their interest.
