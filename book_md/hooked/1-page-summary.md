## 1-Page Summary

Habits are a shortcut for your brain - you execute automatic behaviors without having to think hard about it. Habits develop when the behavior has solved the problem continuously in the past.

Habit-forming products use a 4-step loop to hook you:

  * A **trigger** prompts the behavior. 
    * Triggers can be external or internal. External triggers come from outside a person’s thinking (e.g. phone notifications or seeing an advertisement). Internal triggers are internal drives (e.g. relieving boredom or loneliness).
    * For products, behaviors often begin with external triggers. Then, as the habit forms, the behavior becomes associated with internal triggers.
  * The trigger prompts an **action** , which is a behavior done in anticipation of a reward.
    * An action is more likely when there is motivation to do it, and when it is easier to do.
  * The action delivers a **variable reward**.
    * Predictable rewards don’t cause cravings. You don’t crave turning on your faucet since you know what happens every time.
    * In contrast, variable rewards prompt more intense dopamine hits and push the user to desire the next hit.
  * In completing the action, the user **invests** in the product, improving her future experience and increasing the likelihood of completing another loop in the future.
    * Investments include inviting friends, storing data, building a reputation, and learning to use features.



Each successive loop makes the next loop more likely to occur, causing a flywheel effect. To explain each in more detail:

### Trigger

**_External_ triggers are delivered through the environment**. They contain information on what the user should do next, like app notifications prompting users to return to see a photo.

Over time, as a product becomes associated with a thought, emotion, or preexisting routine, users return based on **internal triggers**. **Emotions** \- especially negative ones like boredom, loneliness, confusion, lack of purpose, and indecisiveness - are powerful internal triggers. These triggers may be short and minor, possibly even subconscious.

**To build a habit, you need to solve a user’s pain so that the user associates your product with relief.**

**To discover the root problem, ask “Why?” as many times as it takes to get to an emotion.**

### Action

**To initiate action in a habit, doing must be easier than thinking**. An action has three requirements:

  * Sufficient motivation
  * Sufficient ability
  * A trigger to activate the behavior



Make the process to use your product as simple as possible. Lay out the steps the customer takes to get the job done. Then **remove steps until you reach the _simplest possible process_.**

**Identify which factor is most impeding your users.** Is the mental effort needed to use your product too high? Is the user in a social context where the behavior is inappropriate? Is the behavior so different from normal routine that it’s offputting?

### Variable Reward

To build a habit, your product must _actually solve the user’s problem_ so that the user depends on your product as a reliable solution. The benefit the user receives is the reward.

**Variable rewards are more effective than fixed rewards**. Fixed rewards don’t change at all, delivering the same reward at unchanging intervals. **Variable rewards are more like slot machines** , delivering unknown amounts at an unknown frequency. Unpredictable reward sizes and novelty spike dopamine levels, which in turn strengthen the development of the habit. Imagine a slot machine that merely paid you $0.99 every time you wagered $1.00 - how fun would that be?

There are three types of variable rewards:

  * **Rewards of the Tribe**
    * We generally want to feel accepted, attractive important, and included. When other people give us social validation, this is a powerful reward.
  * **Rewards of the Hunt**
    * Before inventing tools, humans hunted animals through persistence hunting, out-enduring larger animals that couldn’t effectively cool themselves over hours of chase.
    * This selected for the dogged determination to **acquire rewards that aid our survival, including food, cash, and information.** We are even conditioned to enjoy the pursuit itself, on top of the material rewards.
  * **Rewards of the Self**
    * We seek **mastery and completion**. We are driven to conquer obstacles and complete obstacles, becoming more capable than we were before.



### Investment

**The more effort we put into something, the more we value it, and the more likely we are to return.** Thus, to encourage a user to return and build a habit, prompt them to put **something of value into the system** so that they value the app more highly and pave the way for longer-term rewards.

**Often the user’s investment increases the value of future rewards, building a virtuous cycle of usage that becomes ever more valuable**.

Here are examples of types of user investments, with explanations of how they improve future rewards and enable triggers:

  * **Content Curation** : when users curate content they like, the product can surface more content the user is likely to enjoy through customization.
  * **Data** : when users contribute personal data, the product can issue useful recommendations by analyzing the data.
  * **Social Connections** : when a user connects to other users, the contributions of other users provide more value and are compelling triggers to return.
  * **Reputation** : when users build reputations on a site, their influence increases, and their desire to leave decreases.
