## Chapter 2: Trigger

The next 4 chapters cover each step of the _Hooked_ model for habit-forming products.

The chain reaction that starts a habit **always begins with a trigger**. Habits form like pearls in oysters. It starts as a tiny irritant, like a piece of sand, triggering continuous layering of coats to produce a pearl (a fully formed habit).

#### External Triggers

**_External_ triggers are delivered through the environment**. They contain information on what the user should do next, like app notifications prompting users to return to see a photo.

Types of external triggers include:

  * Paid triggers like advertising and marketing
    * Habit-forming companies tend not to rely on paid triggers since paying for reengagement is often financially unsustainable.
  * Earned triggers like PR, app store placements
  * Relationship triggers like word-of-mouth and social signals
    * Paypal’s message about “money waiting for you” was irresistible
  * Owned triggers - the user consents for the product to occupy her attention space
    * App notifications on the phone, email newsletters



#### Internal Triggers

Over time, as a product becomes associated with a thought, emotion, or preexisting routine, users return based on **internal triggers**. **Emotions** \- especially negative ones like boredom, loneliness, confusion, lack of purpose, and indecisiveness - are powerful internal triggers. These triggers may be short and minor, possibly even subconscious.

  * Loneliness triggers Facebook to provide social “connection”
  * Boredom prompts finding novel content on Youtube or Buzzfeed
  * Lack of purpose, or the feeling that no one needs us, prompts email checking



**When triggered, we often execute a mindless action to ease the negative sensation.**

### Discover Your User’s Pain

**To build a habit, you need to solve a user’s pain so that the user associates your product with relief.**

The needs that users seek to solve are often timeless and universal. Said Ev Williams of Twitter, “We often think the Internet enables you to do new things - but people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.”

To make the user’s pain feel real, build a persona of user problems. This takes the form of a specific person of a certain demographic who feels and behaves a certain way. (e.g. “Mary is a stay-at-home mother in Wisconsin who doesn’t have time to feed her 3 kids after work.”) This persona provides a rallying force for the entire team to do the right things to solve the problem.

**To discover the root problem, ask “Why?” as many times as it takes to get to an emotion.** Example for professional email:

  * Julie uses her email for work.
  * Why? She wants to send and receive messages.
  * Why? She wants to exchange information.
  * Why does she want to exchange information? Information lets her do her job better.
  * Why does she want to do her job better? She wants to get good reviews and a promotion.
  * Why does she want this? **She fears that she’s not good at things, and she wants validation that her talents are useful.**



Now that you’ve uncovered this fear, you might design your product around the core pain point. For instance, you could highlight emails featuring positive feedback and allow her to sticky encouraging emails for motivation.

Naturally, people have different motivations for the same behavior (like checking email), so you could create multiple viable personas. People may use email to reduce FOMO, seek social connection, or avoid boredom. You’ll need to research your users and figure out which personas are most likely to use your product..
