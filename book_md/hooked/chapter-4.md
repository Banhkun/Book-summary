## Chapter 4: Variable Reward

**To build a habit, your product must _actually solve the user’s problem_ so that the user depends on your product as a reliable solution. **The benefit the user receives is the reward.

**When a habit is established, the user comes to _crave_ the solution before actually receiving the reward.** In the brain, the nucleus accumbens is responsible for dopamine signaling to reward behavior and set habits. Brain imaging studies have found that signaling was activating _not_ when actually _receiving_ the reward, but rather in _anticipation_ of it.

Importantly, **variable rewards are more effective than fixed rewards**. Fixed rewards don’t change at all, delivering the same reward at unchanging intervals. **Variable rewards are more like slot machines** , delivering unknown amounts at an unknown frequency. Unpredictable reward sizes and novelty spike dopamine levels, which in turn strengthen the development of the habit. Imagine a slot machine that merely paid you $0.99 every time you wagered $1.00 - how fun would that be?

The idea of variable rewards was famously studied by Skinner, who experimented with animals pressing a lever to receive food. In the variable group, each lever press was given a random amount of food at random intervals. Animals in the variable group dramatically increased the number of times the animal pressed the lever.

Similarly, products with predictable, finite variability are far less engaging than those with **unpredictable, infinite variability**. How often do you rewatch your favorite movie, vs checking Facebook?

**Infinite variability can often be achieved by the unpredictable actions of other people** , as in multiplayer games like World of Warcraft or social networks like Facebook.

### Three Variable Reward Types

There are three types of variable rewards:

  * **Rewards of the Tribe**
    * We generally want to feel accepted, attractive important, and included. When other people give us social validation, this is a powerful reward.
    * Seeing others get rewards also works on us. Witnessing someone being rewarded for a particular action promotes that action within ourselves. (For instance, seeing someone get publicly praised for picking up trash will make you more likely to pick up trash yourself.)
      * This works better when the people you observe are more like yourself or are more experienced role models.
    * On Facebook, people clicking Like on your posts offers powerful social validation. Furthermore, Facebook automatically adjusts your content to what you engage with most, which may tend to be people who behave and look most like you.
  * **Rewards of the Hunt**
    * Before inventing tools, humans hunted animals through persistence hunting, out-enduring larger animals that couldn’t effectively cool themselves over hours of chase.
    * This selected for the dogged determination to **acquire rewards that aid our survival, including food, cash, and information.** We are even conditioned to enjoy the pursuit itself, on top of the material rewards.
    * Examples: searching for a restaurant on Grubhub uses the reward of food; gambling uses the reward of money; Twitter and Pinterest use the reward of information.
  * **Rewards of the Self**
    * We seek **mastery and completion**. We are driven to conquer obstacles and complete obstacles, becoming more capable than we were before.
    * Games employ this by presenting difficult enemies to defeat, and rewarding progress by leveling up abilities.
    * Engaging work challenges you at the limit of your abilities, leading to a state of deep concentration called _flow_.



Here are two examples of successful habit-forming products that use variable rewards:

> **StackOverflow**
> 
>   * Tribe: good answers are upvoted by the community, validating your expertise.
> 
>   * Hunt: programming information is valuable to you to build useful things
> 
>   * Self: answering a difficult question at the limit of your ability is an engaging challenge
> 
> 

> 
> **Email**
> 
>   * Tribe: requests from other people validate your importance. Information from other people makes you feel connected.
> 
>   * Hunt: information contained in emails help you survive better (job offers, investment status)
> 
>   * Self: replying to and deleting emails are fulfilling tasks. Reaching inbox zero provides a sense of mastery.
> 
> 


**Any system of variable rewards isn’t an automatic panacea - it needs to be tied to what really, intrinsically matters to users.** Q&A site Mahalo.com tried to pay users money for answering questions, but ultimately found this was insufficient motivation. If money were a primary motivation, users were better off earning a wage, as the rewards came too infrequently and were too small. In contrast, more popular sites like Quora and StackOverflow don’t pay any money, but they use the more powerful tribe rewards to drive stronger behavior.

### Autonomy

In general, humans desire **autonomy** , the freedom to choose their own actions.

  * Research found that the rate of donations from strangers increased when ending a request with the phrase “but you are free to accept or refuse.” 
  * Similarly, successful apps tend to give users freedom to choose what to do, rather than forcing your hand.



Threats to autonomy give rise to **reactance** , the adrenaline-fueled feeling when your boss micromanages you or your mom tells you to put on your coat. This increases the friction of completing a task

The author hypothesizes that part of the reason people sneak breaks to look at their phone or Facebook at work is to regain some sense of autonomy.
