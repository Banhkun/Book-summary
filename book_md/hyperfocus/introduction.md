## Introduction

In a world full of distractions, most modern-day knowledge workers believe that the secret to productivity lies in your ability to manage your time.

In 2018’s _Hyperfocus_ , productivity expert Chris Bailey presents an alternate hypothesis: **The key to becoming the most productive, creative version of yourself lies not in managing your time but in managing your _attention_.**

When you deliberately manage your attention, you direct your attention to the most impactful tasks and activities. You also become better able to ignore modern-day distractions, so you’re more engaged in these activities—which has several benefits. For example, if you’re more engaged in a work task, you can complete it more efficiently. Being more engaged at the dinner table tends to improve your relationships with your family. Deliberately managing your attention also allows you to choose when _not_ to focus on a specific task and let your mind wander instead. As we’ll see, letting your mind wander also has a host of benefits—such as increased creativity and greater energy.

But how, exactly, do you deliberately manage your attention?

In this guide, you’ll first learn about your biological programming: What do humans do, and why doesn’t it work in the modern world?

Then, you’ll learn how to work around these biological limitations and deliberately manage your attention in two main ways. First, you’ll learn how to deliberately direct your attention to a particular task to maximize your productivity. Then, you’ll learn how to stop focusing on a specific task and intentionally mind-wander so that you can access the several benefits of mind-wandering, including increased creativity.
