## Chapter 3: Hyperfocus Steps 0-1: Prepare

Now that you understand the biological limitations on your attention and why deliberately directing your attention is necessary, you’ll learn how to work _with_ the biology of your brain to deliberately direct your attention for maximum productivity.

Bailey calls this method “hyperfocus.” In this section, we’ll first define what hyperfocus is and why it matters. We’ll then present the five stages of hyperfocus before elaborating on the first two.

### Hyperfocus: What It Is and Why It Matters

Bailey suggests that you can be your most productive self through hyperfocus.

In hyperfocus, you direct your focus on a single task.

> **Shortform’s Definition of Hyperfocus**
> 
> Bailey’s description of hyperfocus is contradictory. Initially, he describes hyperfocus as a state in which a single task “fills your attentional space completely.” (As you may recall, “attentional space” is Bailey’s term for working memory capacity.) But later in the same chapter, he espouses many benefits of hyperfocus that are only possible because you “have some attentional space to spare” during hyperfocus.
> 
> Bailey doesn’t directly address this apparent contradiction in his definition of “hyperfocus,” but we can infer that in some moments of hyperfocus, a single task fills up all your working memory capacity, while in others, the task takes up most of your working memory capacity but leaves some of it free. For clarity, we’ve defined hyperfocus based on what Bailey states is its “most important aspect”—the fact that you’re focused on a single task.

By directing your focus on a single task, you accept that your working memory capacity is limited and work within its confines. This allows you to avoid the biological attention traps we’ve discussed and maximize your productivity. By actively directing your focus, you deliberately direct your attention and don’t work in autopilot mode. Focusing on a single task ensures the task fits comfortably within your working memory capacity. As such, you don’t overload your attention. Instead, you experience the benefits of having spare working memory: You are better able to defend against distractions, you refocus your attention faster when your mind wanders, and you make better decisions about your task. In other words, you become less distractible, and you work more efficiently. You also avoid the traps of multitasking: Unlike when you multitask, you use your brain’s hippocampus instead of the basal ganglia, so you remember all the mistakes you made and don’t make them again—which improves your efficiency.

> **Why You Should Learn About Single-Tasking**
> 
> All of the benefits Bailey spouts about hyperfocus have been well-documented—notably in _Deep Work_ , which describes extensively the dangers of distractions and multitasking and how single-tasking can make you more efficient. However, most authors discuss the benefits of single-tasking instead of hyperfocus. Indeed, you could reasonably argue that they’re exactly the same thing.
> 
> So why do we need a whole book about focusing on one task? The obvious response, which Bailey addresses and which the spate of productivity books in recent years suggests, is that we live in a world full of more distractions than ever before, so we need more techniques to avoid those distractions.
> 
> Another potential response is that teaching people how to focus is especially important for younger generations, who’ve only ever lived in worlds inundated with technology and thus are terrible at focusing. But this may not be true: Younger generations may be both capable of focusing and also better at filtering out non-essential information than their predecessors.

Hyperfocus also maximizes your productivity because it helps you achieve a “flow state.” First defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow states occur when we’re so occupied by what we’re doing that we forget that time is passing. Flow states occur when a task meets the ideal level of difficulty, pushing your cognitive limits just enough to be challenging but not so much so that it’s distracting. And, as Bailey notes, we’re far more likely to experience flow if we are focused on a single task. (Shortform note: Most of us think about flow states when we’re trying to achieve a task, but Csikszentmihalyi’s _Flow_ also discusses how to achieve flow states in your relationships. In fact, having friendships and romantic relationships with flow is essential to your happiness.)

Bailey argues that hyperfocus is especially beneficial for busy people: The busier you are, the more you need to hyperfocus because it becomes even more critical to prioritize the correct tasks and not waste time on low-impact tasks.

(Shortform note: In _The Busy Trap_ , author Tim Kreider argues that we like being busy because it reassures us that our lives are filled with meaning. In contrast, both Bailey and _Essentialism_ suggest that we can find more meaning by doing fewer activities but doing them better.)

Crucially, despite its intense name and the fact that Bailey mostly describes how to hyperfocus at work, hyperfocus is essential in your personal life, too. You can hyperfocus just as well on a budget report as you can on a trip to the zoo with your kids. (Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Newport makes a similar point about deep work, which he defines as any task you do that’s aligned with and focused on your values. You can hyperfocus on spending time with your children, and spending time with your children can count as deep work.)

Bailey highlights how hyperfocusing on conversations improves your relationships, going so far as to posit that “love is nothing more than sharing quality attention with someone.”

(Shortform note: Hyperfocus may help your relationships because we’re just as distracted at home as we are at work. Looking at your phone while you’re with someone has become so prevalent there’s a word for it: phubbing, an amalgamation of phone and snubbing. But phubbing decreases the quality of your relationships—one study found that just having a phone nearby during a conversation reduced the trust and empathy participants felt from and towards one another.)

### How Hyperfocus Works: The 4 Steps to Hyperfocus

Bailey explains that there are four steps to hyperfocus.

  * Step 1: Choose What to Focus On
  * Step 2: Limit Distractions
  * Step 3: Focus for a Set Period 
  * Step 4: Maintain Your Focus 



(Shortform note: Bailey states that he modeled the stages of hyperfocus off of the scientifically accepted states of focus, but he doesn’t provide any evidence to support this and we were unable to find external research on it.)

After describing Step 1, Bailey presents several strategies on “starting a hyperfocus ritual.” Since most of these strategies involve choosing when and how long to hyperfocus, we’ve included these strategies as Step 0.

In our guide, we’ll also describe the various strategies Bailey presents in connection to each stage of hyperfocus. Bailey doesn’t always do this, as we’ll see; sometimes, he explicitly ties a strategy to a particular stage of hyperfocus, but more often, he discusses the importance of various techniques for hyperfocus without explicitly explaining which stage of hyperfocus it improves. In this way, Bailey presents a series of recommendations for hyperfocus that are sometimes hard to follow because they aren’t always presented in the most logical order. We’ve tied Bailey’s strategies to individual stages of hyperfocus to make his ideas easier to implement.

### Step 0: Choose When to Hyperfocus

In order to hyperfocus, you must first plan **when** and for **how long** you will hyperfocus. As Bailey explains, planning ahead is a critical element of ensuring that hyperfocus works with not just your biology but also your external reality.

Bailey argues that your brain feels aversion to the idea of focusing on only one thing for a prolonged period. As you’ll see, planning your hyperfocus sessions in advance helps reduce this aversion.

(Shortform note: _Why_ does your brain feel averse to the idea of focusing on one thing for a prolonged period? Bailey never makes this explicit, but he implies one reason we’ll elaborate on in our discussion of Chapter 4: Hard tasks require mental energy, which your brain wants to conserve. Neuroscientists have also proposed another theory known as the “process model”: Your brain does hard tasks only because it wants a reward—and if it isn’t confident it’ll receive a reward, it loses motivation to do the hard task.)

Furthermore, planning ahead allows you to work around external factors that affect your particular situation. For example, hyperfocusing at dinner with your family is more difficult if you’re going through a particularly busy time at work and need to be available for your coworkers after-hours.

(Shortform note: By scheduling when you’ll hyperfocus in advance, you also ensure that it remains a priority. As _First Things First_ recommends, schedule your most important tasks every week before filling the extra space with your less crucial tasks.)

So for how long and when should you hyperfocus?

#### How Long to Hyperfocus

Choosing how long to focus is simple. Bailey suggests starting small: Pick a length of time that feels comfortable. It shouldn’t be too short, but it shouldn’t be too long, either. (Shortform note: If you have trouble with this, imagine that you’re training for a marathon. You wouldn’t immediately try running 26.2 miles—you’d run just a little bit longer than you normally would then slowly increase the time. Treat your cognitive endurance in the same way.)

Additionally, Bailey explains, hyperfocus works best as a daily habit. So select a duration that won’t put you off from hyperfocusing more tomorrow. As you get used to hyperfocusing, you’ll become focusing for longer periods of time, and the lengths of your hyperfocus sessions will naturally increase. (That said, Bailey also cautions against overdoing it: If you’ve been hyperfocusing regularly for a few weeks but suddenly feel intensely averse to hyperfocus, give yourself a break.)

(Shortform note: In _The Talent Code_ , Daniel Coyle explains one reason why consistency is essential: neurologically speaking, skill development depends on the growth of myelin, the insulation around our neural circuits, and repetition increases this myelin—strengthening the neural connection. But when we let our practice lapse, the myelin decreases. So inconsistency worsens the connection and our ability to do the skill (in this case, hyperfocus).)

Bailey also recommends setting a timer to help keep you on track. Don’t feel obligated to stop when it rings if you’re in the zone. (Shortform note: While this is a useful strategy when you first start hyperfocusing, you might find it unnecessarily distracting as you continue hyperfocusing—especially if you start regularly achieving flow.)

#### When to Hyperfocus

Choosing when to focus is slightly more complicated, but it still involves working with both your biology and your external realities. Specifically, Bailey suggests basing your decision on three main constraints: your schedule, your energy levels, and your tasks.

Hyperfocus requires time and energy, neither of which are unlimited resources. (Shortform note: If you’re regularly low on energy, you may want to exercise more. Exercising regularly can improve your memory and thinking, which may help you focus.) One way to ensure you have both available during your hyperfocus is to **schedule your hyperfocus sessions around your other personal and work commitments.** For example, you might schedule fewer hyperfocus sessions during a busy holiday season. (Shortform note: _Indistractable_ takes the idea of scheduling when you’ll focus one step further: Eyal recommends “timeboxing,” where you split up your entire day into blocks (or boxes) of time, _all_ of which are allocated to specific activities—not just the times you focus.)

Alternatively, maximize your productivity by **scheduling your hyperfocus sessions when you have the most energy.** To discover what these times are, Bailey recommends keeping track of your energy levels for a few weeks. (Shortform note: Bailey calls the time you have the most energy your “Biological Prime Time,” a concept he described in his first book, _The Productivity Project_. To discover his, Bailey spent three weeks charting his energy levels hourly from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. He also cut stimulants like alcohol and caffeine, varied his workout times, consumed little sugar, and woke up without an alarm.)

He also recommends **manipulating your energy levels by consuming caffeine** , which increases focus, endurance, and performance on many cognitive tasks. Specifically, 200 milligrams of caffeine (about one and a half cups of coffee) will give you the maximum benefits—after that, you start to get diminishing returns, and more than 400 milligrams a day will stress you out. However, caffeine also causes energy crashes—so, he recommends, be strategic about when you consume caffeine: Maximize caffeine’s benefits by consuming it just before you hyperfocus instead of just after you wake up.

(Shortform note: Bailey notes that everybody reacts differently to coffee, so take your own reaction into account. In fact, coffee has several other benefits in varying amounts. _How Not to Die_ describes how people who had a high risk of liver disease and drank more than two cups of coffee daily showed less than half the risk of chronic liver problems, while people who drink six cups of coffee daily were 80% less likely to commit suicide. Adjust your coffee intake based on these factors as well.)

Another option is to **schedule your hyperfocus sessions based on the tasks you need to accomplish**. If you have a particularly cognitive demanding task that needs attention, like a presentation, that's a good time to hyperfocus.

##### Schedule Your Hyperfocus

Scheduling cognitively demanding tasks in advance can also reduce the amount of mental residue they leave behind. You may recall that you don’t stop thinking about a task the minute you stop doing it. All tasks leave behind some mental residue. However, Bailey notes that there are two ways to reduce this mental residue—both of which are easier if you schedule your tasks in advance.

First, **set a strict deadline**. The more time you have to complete a task, the more you think about _how_ you’ll complete the task. Even after you select a method, the other options you paid initial attention to leave behind some mental residue—so you continue to think about them, wondering if you selected the best possible option. But when you have a strict deadline, you only consider the options you can complete within the time limit. The fewer options you consider, the less mental residue a task leaves behind: You don’t _continue_ thinking about how to complete a task better if you never _started_ thinking about it in the first place.

(Shortform note: Bailey explains that strict deadlines make switching between tasks easier, but he doesn't specify whether self-imposed deadlines have the same effect. They probably don't if you always change the deadline. If you create your own deadline, consider taking another action that limits further editing of the project, like emailing it to your boss, so that you can reduce the mental residue left behind.)

Second, **space out your tasks**. If you wait long enough, the mental residue a task leaves behind will naturally dissipate, and you’ll forget about it. So Bailey recommends taking a break between cognitively complex tasks. This allows you to focus fully on your next task without any mental residue from your previous task to distract you. (Shortform note: Can’t space out your tasks? If you must switch tasks, write down what you're doing and what you'll do when you refocus on that task. This reassures your brain that you’ll come back to the task and allows it to release any residue from the task.)

(Shortform note: If you schedule your hyperfocus sessions based on what you need to accomplish, you must realistically estimate how long each task will take—but most of us are bad at this. Improve your estimates by discovering the percentage by which you underestimate task length and adjusting accordingly. To do so, divide the time you spend on a task by the time you expected to spend on a task.)

Bailey also recommends hyperfocusing on the tasks you don’t want to do, since you’re most likely to get distracted and procrastinate when doing them. If you think you’re too busy to focus on a particular task, ask yourself: Would I be too busy to do (something you like)? If not, chances are you’re avoiding focusing. (Shortform note: The tasks that are most cognitively demanding may also be the tasks you least want to do— _Eat That Frog_ suggests that your most important and consequential task is the one you’re most likely to put off.)

### Step 1: Choose What to Focus On

Now that you’ve chosen when to focus, you can turn to Stage 1 of Hyperfocus: Choose What to Focus On.

In this section, we’ll first explain why choosing the right task to focus on is essential. Then, we’ll describe the types of tasks you should—and shouldn’t—focus on and present Bailey’s suggestions for selecting the most impactful tasks. Finally, we’ll discuss how setting three daily goals can help you choose what to hyperfocus on.

#### Why You Need to Choose

Bailey argues that hyperfocus is most beneficial when we choose the right task to focus on.

According to Bailey, the quality of the tasks we pay attention to determines the quality of our lives. When we focus on high-quality tasks, we perform high-quality work and have high-quality impact. When we focus on low-quality tasks, even if we perform high-quality work, we will have low-quality impact.

(Shortform note: If you’re not used to setting priorities, you might think to yourself: Why choose at all? I can get everything done. _Essentialism_ argues that if you don’t set priorities for your own life, others will do so for you—and people often regret conforming to others’ expectations at the expense of their own goals at the end of their lives.)

#### What to Choose

Bailey suggests focusing on “complex” or cognitively demanding tasks, like preparing a presentation or helping your child decide what college to apply to. Technically, you can hyperfocus on anything you want—including habits. But Bailey cautions against this for two main reasons.

**First, hyperfocus is hard.** Mental energy and willpower are both finite resources. To be the most productive version of ourselves, we need to use them efficiently. But you perform habits in autopilot mode. You don’t need to think about your habits; you do them automatically. Since you don’t need that much energy to perform habits, it doesn’t make sense to hyperfocus on them. Conversely, hyperfocus requires a lot of mental energy and willpower. So you should conserve these resources for the cognitively demanding tasks that really need them.

**Second, hyperfocusing on habits worsens your performance.** Bailey references several studies that demonstrated that when people focused more than usual on habitual tasks, their performance on those tasks suffered. He argues that when we hyperfocus on habits, we overthink the activities that we normally do automatically. Therefore, we end up second-guessing ourselves and doing worse on the task at hand.

> **How Hyperfocus Can Help You Break Bad Habits**
> 
> Bailey’s suggestion not to hyperfocus on habits makes sense if these habits add value to your life. But what if you’re trying to break a bad habit? Habit experts differ on the best way to do this.
> 
> _Atomic Habits_ divides habits into four steps: A “cue” triggers a “craving” so you perform a “behavior” and receive a “reward.” To break a bad habit, you make the cue invisible, the craving unattractive, the behavior difficult, or the reward unsatisfying.
> 
> _Tiny Habits_ suggests similar strategies, most of which involve experimenting with the behavior you substitute. Hyperfocusing during the actual process of breaking your habit may make breaking it difficult since it might increase your craving—so perhaps an alternative solution is to hyperfocus when you brainstorm how you’re going to break the habit, instead.

However, it's not enough to hyperfocus on cognitively demanding tasks. You need to pick the _right_ tasks to focus on. A simple strategy is to hyperfocus on the meaningful tasks you pinpointed when you created your attention management matrix. But Bailey also suggests two more strategies for picking the _right_ tasks to hyperfocus on,

**Strategy #1: Consider the impact of your tasks.**

Bailey recommends hyperfocusing on the tasks that will have the biggest positive impact. To evaluate this, he suggests looking at both a task’s immediate and long-term effects. Think of your task as the first in a chain reaction. When you extend the chain, that’s the real impact of your task.

For example, let’s say you set an intention to be more present with your family by turning off your phone at dinner. The first effect could be that you pay more attention to what your kids are saying at the dinner table. Since you’re focused on them, your kids feel more loved. This is the secondary effect. Your kids feel more loved, so they feel more comfortable opening up to you more about a problem they’re having at school. This is the third effect.

If we extend this chain far enough, you could see your children feeling more comfortable in their relationships as an adult or being better parents to their own children—all because you put your phone away at dinner. This is an example of a task that has outsize long-term impacts that can make the temporary stress of not checking your notifications far easier.

(Shortform note: _Getting Things Done_ also recommends choosing your tasks based on their priority levels (although it uses a six-level model instead of a matrix). Interestingly, however, author David Allen recommends working from the bottom-up instead: Getting in control of the actions in front of you frees up your mind to think about projects, which leads to higher thinking.)

**​​Strategy #2: Make a plan**

Bailey explains that when we set even vague goals, we’re 20 - 30% more likely to achieve them than if we hadn’t set any goals at all—but when we make a plan for achieving our goals, we’re two to three times more likely to achieve them. Therefore, when you select a task to hyperfocus on, increase the likelihood you’ll complete it by creating a plan, sometimes called an “implementation intention.”

When you create an implementation intention, you plan for a behavior by assigning it a specific plan (usually a place and time). A useful formula is: When X occurs, I will do Y. This works the same way habits do: You choose to perform an action in advance. When you encounter that environment, your brain is already primed to do that action, so doing it becomes easier. (Shortform note: In fact, setting an implementation intention is one strategy Clear suggests for creating new habits in _Atomic Habits_. He adds that implementation intentions can be especially effective if they harness two well-known cues that trigger habits: time and place.) For example, you could set an intention to “work on your presentation.” But it’s much more powerful to say, “When I return from lunch, I will create six slides for my presentation.”

How specific you need to be varies due to several factors. Most of the time, it only needs to be specific enough so that you understand it—for example, “When I’m tired.” But if you have many tasks or a difficult task, more specificity is helpful. (Shortform note: Clear explains that this is because specificity removes the need for inspiration or motivation to kick in: all the decisions have already been made, and you just need to perform the intended action. Since more difficult tasks require more motivation, removing the need for them can be especially effective.)

It’s also crucial that you actually _want_ to accomplish your goal. If not, setting an implementation intention isn’t as effective. (Shortform note: Prevent yourself from working on goals you’re not passionate about by learning how to set better boundaries.)

#### Why You Should Focus on Three Daily Goals

Another way to ensure that you hyperfocus on the most important tasks is to **set three goals for each day**. These goals are the most important things you want to accomplish that day.

When you can select only three goals for the day, you’re forced to prioritize. When you know what goals are high-priority, you know what tasks will best support those goals. These are probably the tasks most deserving of hyperfocus. You also learn what is less important, so you learn what _not_ to focus on.

(Shortform note: If setting just three priorities seems impossibly small, consider this: According to _Essentialism_ , the word “priority” only had a singular form for centuries. We created “priorities'' in the 1900s, insisting that we could now have many “first” things.)

In addition to helping you prioritize your tasks, setting three goals has two major benefits.

##### #1: It’s a flexible habit.

Bailey states that setting three goals is simple enough that you can do it both when you have control over your schedule and when you don’t.

(Shortform note: Why does this matter? Probably because if it’s easy to set three goals in any situation, you’re more likely to do it every day. If you develop a habit of defining three goals every day, you’ll naturally want to complete the goals and direct your attention more often in pursuit of those goals. (We’ll discuss our brain’s innate desire to complete tasks in more detail in our discussion of learning and creativity.))

On days you have unavoidable appointments, Bailey recommends adjusting your perspective on those tasks. For example, a doctor’s appointment could become an opportunity to ask important questions about your health. (Shortform note: This may also be useful if you have little control over your tasks. Even if your everyday tasks are dictated by the whims of your boss, there’s usually some aspect of them that you can anticipate and control.)

##### #2: It’s easy to remember.

You can easily remember three goals, so you’re better able to pay attention to them. Bailey does also suggest setting three weekly goals and three daily personal goals, which totals nine, but they’re still easy to remember since they’re chunked into three.

(Shortform note: Consider creating overarching weekly goals and using daily goals to complete their component parts. For example, if your goal for the week is to plan your next vacation, your daily goals could include having a conversation with your spouse about where you’d like to go or booking a hotel reservation.)
