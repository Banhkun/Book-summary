## Part 1 | Chapter 1: How Your Biology Makes It Hard to Focus

Due to advancements in industry and technology, our world has evolved rapidly over the last several decades. Unfortunately, our brains have not. The fundamental functioning of your brain hasn’t changed since ancient times. Your brain is biologically optimized for a world that no longer exists.

So at best, your brain is not biologically equipped to handle the demands of the modern world as well as it could. At worst, the neurobiological phenomena that kept us alive as cavemen hinder our ability to succeed today by actively preventing us from focusing.

In this section, we’ll discuss the three biological tendencies that Bailey argues make our brains ill-prepared for the demands of the modern world.

Tendency #1: We default to autopilot mode.

Tendency #2: We can only pay attention to a limited amount of information.

Tendency #3: We love to task-shift.

### #1: We default to autopilot mode.

Bailey explains that, by default, our brains expend our attention in autopilot mode: Instead of choosing what to focus on in advance, we react to the external triggers that pique our interest. Bailey notes that we’re especially prone to reacting to anything new, potentially dangerous, or gratifying. (Shortform note: Ben Parr, the author of _Captivology: The Science of Capturing People’s Attention_ , also suggests that you may automatically react to things based on your personal associations with them.)

One reason autopilot mode kept us alive in ancient times is that it kept us alert to changes in our environment. In primitive times, the quicker we noticed new changes in our environment, the quicker we noticed their potential effect: bad, good, or neutral. The quicker we noticed danger, the quicker we could react to and avoid it. And the quicker we noticed gratifying things, the faster we could take advantage of them—for example, we could eat the delicious berries before the birds plucked them off.

(Shortform note: Another reason that autopilot mode kept us alive in ancient times may be because, as _Switch_ notes, it allows us to conserve energy. When you make familiar choices on autopilot, you don’t expend any energy on decision-making. So in ancient times, autopilot mode may have let us conserve our hard-won energy for the tasks that truly needed them. As we’ll see in Chapter 4, Bailey does imply that our brains are prone to distraction because we’re wired to conserve energy—but he never explicitly connects our brains’ desire for energy to our tendency to default to autopilot mode.)

#### The Pros of Autopilot

Autopilot mode remains useful in the modern day. As Bailey notes, nearly 40% of our actions rely on habits. Habits are an example of autopilot mode: We react automatically to specific triggers.

(Shortform note: Bailey doesn’t explicitly mention that autopilot mode is also what makes bad habits so difficult to break—we perform them automatically without stopping to think about whether they’re good for us.)

Similarly, autopilot mode lets us perform simpler cognitive tasks with ease. Thanks to autopilot mode, clearing the table is a five-minute endeavor instead of an exercise in intense decision-making about which dish to clear first. (Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , author Cal Newport calls non-demanding cognitive tasks “shallow work.” However, unlike Bailey, he adds that shallow work tasks don’t create much value and anyone can do them.)

#### The Cons of Autopilot

However, autopilot mode has one major drawback: It makes us prone to distraction.

As mentioned, in autopilot, you automatically react to anything new, potentially dangerous, or gratifying. This inclination makes us susceptible to distraction because usually, the thing we’re trying to focus on is not as new, gratifying, or potentially dangerous as other things in the room. (Shortform note: In Chapter 4, Bailey recommends several strategies to make the thing you need to focus on the most stimulating thing in the room, but all of his strategies revolve around limiting potential distractions. Alternatively, make what you need to focus on newer, more gratifying, or more potentially dangerous. For example, if you’re working on a book, treat yourself to a chocolate every time you finish a chapter. This can convince your brain that writing the book is more gratifying than it really is because it gets you chocolate.)

Furthermore, many modern-day companies have specifically designed their products to take advantage of our innate tendency to focus on new, gratifying, and potentially dangerous things. So it’s not just that you’re biologically inclined to get distracted—it’s also that the potential distractions you encounter every day are specifically designed to be as tempting as humanly possible. (Shortform note: _Digital Minimalism_ delves further into this, explaining how companies design digital tools to be addictive—such as by providing inconsistent positive reinforcement, causing you to continue the behavior more than if you experienced reinforcement consistently.)

Even if you do manage to resist these companies’ products, your _own thoughts_ might distract you from your original objective. As Bailey notes, one feature of being human is that our minds wander 47% of the time. So if they happen to alight on a thought that fits any of the distraction criteria (new, potentially dangerous, or gratifying), you’ll automatically start to focus on that instead. (Shortform note: The statistic that our minds wander 47% of the time is based on self-reported data. But self-reported data on mind-wandering is not ideal given that humans tend to be bad at noticing where their mind goes. One study on mind-wandering controversially tried to get around this issue by studying masters of Vipassana mindfulness meditation, which supposedly improves your ability to notice your thoughts.)

> **Can You Make Hyperfocus a Habit?**
> 
> In _Deep Work_ , Newport argues that you can use your brain’s tendency to default to autopilot mode to your advantage: When you turn deep work—focused, uninterrupted, intense work on a task—into a habit, your brain requires less willpower to ignore distractions and do deep work because you’ve trained it to do deep work on autopilot mode.
> 
> As we’ll see, Bailey also discusses the importance of regularly performing focused work on a task. But while he does say that regularly performing focused work on a task makes it easier to start the work and ignore distractions, he never argues that you can turn it into a habit you automatically default to.

### #2: We can only pay attention to a limited amount of information.

Another reason your brain isn’t optimized for the modern world is that **you can only pay attention to a limited amount of information.** This has to do with how attention works in your brain.****

When you pay attention to a task, it occupies some portion of your _working memory_. (Bailey refers to your working memory as your “attentional space.”) Working memory holds information that your mind is actively processing. Imagine it as your brain’s temporary storage solution: When your friend tells you their new phone number, you hold those digits in your working memory long enough to type them into your phone.

Working memory is essential to focus because focusing on a task requires you to remember information long enough to act on it. If you didn’t have a working memory, you wouldn’t be able to have a conversation: By the time someone reached the end of their sentence, you’d have forgotten what they said at its beginning, so you wouldn’t be able to understand their meaning.

The amount of working memory a task occupies depends on its complexity: The more complex a task, the more working memory it requires.

But your working memory can only hold so much information at a time. As Bailey notes, our conscious brains are incapable of processing too much information: Of the 11 million bits of information our brains process every second, our conscious brains can only process 40 of them. Therefore, you can only pay attention to the things that fit in your working memory.

_Working memory capacity_ refers to the amount of information your working memory can hold simultaneously.

> **The Difference Between Working Memory and Short-Term Memory**
> 
> Bailey’s explanation of attentional space is a little confusing, primarily due to his usage of the terms “mental scratchpad,” short-term memory, and working memory. He uses “mental scratchpad” to refer to both short-term and working memory, which implies that he’s using the terms interchangeably. But he then discusses how you hold something in your short-term memory _after_ you focus on it, which implies that they are different.
> 
> Compounding this confusion, the distinctions between the terms “short-term memory” and “working memory” are unclear in the academic field in general. Some researchers use the terms synonymously, but others don’t: Working memory usually “refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information,” while short-term memory is “the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time.”
> 
> In our guide, we’ve exclusively used the term working memory for several reasons. First, Bailey refers most often to working memory. More importantly, the exact distinctions between working memory and short-term memory are tangential to his main point, which is that you can only pay attention to a limited amount of information at one time.

So exactly how much information can you pay attention to simultaneously?

Studies suggest that the average person can hold only four bits of information in their working memory—and the maximum is seven. (Shortform note: The exact amount of information that fits in your working memory may depend on the type—studies suggest that people can hold seven digits but only five words.) Memorization techniques like chunking use this knowledge to their advantage: Remembering a list of 15 items is easier if you group it into three groups of five. (Shortform note: If you use this idea to memorize a random string of numbers, like Moonwalking with Einstein recommends, you might call it “arbitrary chunking,” since you arbitrarily impose the grouping and artificially create a unifying meaning for each chunk of numbers.)

Bailey argues that this cognitive limitation also explains why you often see groups of up to seven—like the days of the week—but rarely see groups beyond that. (Shortform note: A clear exception is groups of 12, like the months of the year, the 12 Apostles, or the 12 grades in school.)

#### How Many Tasks You Can Focus on at Once

As for tasks, Bailey identifies three general patterns of tasks you can focus on comfortably. (Shortform note: These patterns might not work for everybody: Research suggests that your working memory capacity peaks at young adulthood and declines as you age. Similarly, mental illnesses like schizophrenia and depression are associated with your working memory capacity.)

**#1: You can focus on multiple simple tasks.**

Bailey explains that many tasks are automatic and require little to no active intervention. Such tasks use very little working memory, partly because you do them mostly automatically. You likely expend some cognitive energy to begin these tasks, and there may be moments mid-task when the task demands more of your attention. But generally speaking, your brain reverts to autopilot mode once you get going. For example, beginning your skin care regimen might require conscious effort. If you put your lotion on the wrong shelf, you’ll focus on finding it. But otherwise, your skincare regimen likely doesn’t demand much conscious thought.

Since these tasks require so little attention, they’re the only kind you can successfully multitask: You can easily focus on them simultaneously.

**#2: You can focus on one complex task and one simple task.**

Some tasks don’t require as much attention as writing a term paper, but they require more attention than drinking coffee. You can combine these tasks with a simpler task.

This is why you can listen to the radio as you get ready for work in the morning. You mostly pay attention to getting dressed and eating breakfast (the more complex tasks), but you direct a small portion of your attention to the radio (the simpler task).

> **What Counts as a Simple Task**
> 
> Bailey refers to simple tasks as “habitual tasks,” which he defines as tasks that require “little mental intervention.” This seems self-explanatory, but his examples are somewhat confusing. For example, he defines grocery shopping as a habitual task. If you’re following a list, shopping for groceries requires little mental intervention. But if you decide what you want to buy while you’re at the store, shopping for groceries likely requires considerable mental intervention.
> 
> Additionally, as we’ll learn later, the better you get at a task, the less working memory it takes up. So buying groceries likely requires little mental intervention if you’ve been to the same store 100 times. But if you’re new to grocery shopping—or shopping in a new store where you don’t know the layout—the added layer of difficulty means the task takes up more of your working memory.
> 
> The conclusion is likely that there is no universal definition of a simple task—how much working memory a task uses up differs based both on who does the task and how they do the task.

**#3: You can focus on one complex task.**

Some complex tasks, like writing a term paper, are cognitively demanding and require focus. As such, they take up most of our working memory—but the exact amount varies moment to moment as you move through the task. So even when you’re performing a cognitively demanding task, you should have some working memory to spare.

Bailey states that having this spare working memory is beneficial for the following reasons:

  * Reason #1**:** When you have spare working memory, you’re better able to notice when your mind wanders, so you’re able to refocus your attention faster.
  * Reason #2:**** When you have spare working memory, you remember what you want to do as you do it—so you’re better able to notice and defend against potential distractions.
  * Reason #3: While most of your working memory is focused on _doing_ the task, the spare working memory can _think more broadly_ about the task—so you can think up methods to perform the task more efficiently. 
  * Reason #4: With spare working memory, you can stay focused on the task even if it unexpectedly becomes more difficult. 



(Shortform note: Having spare working memory may not be as helpful if you suffer from anxiety. Research suggests that since anxiety is one of the things your working memory pays attention to, the more working memory you have available, the more attention you can pay to anxious thoughts—but if you don’t have the working memory available, you don’t have any room to pay attention to anxious thoughts. This may also explain why music sometimes drowns out anxious thoughts—the music might literally crowd your anxious thoughts out of your working memory. If you suffer from anxiety, consider listening to music while you work, like this song proven to reduce your anxiety levels.)

> **How Parallel and Serial Processing Affect What You Can Pay Attention to**
> 
> A final reason you’re only able to pay attention to a finite number of things—and why that number changes based on the complexity of your task—may have to do with parallel and serial processing.
> 
> When you process information serially, you process one stimulus at a time. Conversely, parallel processing is your brain’s ability to process different stimuli simultaneously—it explains why you both feel the cup and taste the coffee as you drink your java. You often process information in parallel. However, psychologists explain that this ability is limited by “serial bottlenecks”: You're only able to process some stimuli serially.

#### What Happens When You Try to Focus on Too Much

So how, exactly, does the fact that you can only pay attention to a finite number of things limit your success in the modern world? Although Bailey doesn’t say it explicitly, we can infer that the problem stems from the fact that most people aren’t _aware_ of their limited working memory capacity. Faced with countless attractive modern stimuli, we try to take it all in simultaneously: We watch TV as we check our social media and chat with our friends. But when you try to focus on too much information, the various activities don’t fit into your working memory, and they start to crowd each other out.

Bailey refers to this state as “attention overload.” When you stop holding the information in your working memory, you stop paying attention to it and forget about it. Sometimes, the thing you forget is the thing you were trying to do in the first place. If you’ve ever opened the refrigerator and forgotten why you did so, you may have fallen victim to attention overload.

(Shortform note: Bailey’s description of “attention overload” sounds similar to the more widely used “information overload,” but they describe slightly different concepts. Attention overload exclusively describes your mental state when you try to take in too much information. Information overload can describe this mental state, but it’s also used to refer to the state of the world—in other words, the amount of information in the world you _could_ be paying attention to.)

### #3: We love to task-shift.

Bailey suggests another reason our brains are ill-prepared for modern-day success: We love to task-shift.

When people say they are multitasking at work, they’re usually referring to task-shifting. Multitasking complex tasks is biologically impossible: Our working memory is only large enough to fit a single complex task. What most people think of as multitasking is actually task-shifting: You’re not focusing on multiple cognitively demanding tasks simultaneously but switching your attention rapidly between them. (Shortform note: One article notes that people use the term multitasking to refer to three separate activities: classic multitasking (performing multiple tasks at the same time), rapid task switching (doing one task right after another), and interrupted task switching (switching between tasks before completing either). Bailey’s definition of task-shifting is closest to interrupted task switching, which the article explains is the most distracting way to multitask.)

Bailey suggests that people love task-shifting for logical reasons. As previously noted, our ability to quickly notice new changes in our environment kept us alive in ancient times: The quicker we noticed something new, the quicker we could assess whether it was a potential threat and act on it. Therefore, Bailey argues, our brains evolved a “novelty bias”: They release dopamine whenever we do something new. So in modern times, whenever you switch to a new task under the guise of multitasking, you receive a hit of dopamine. These hits of dopamine cause task-shifting to _feel_ good and productive, so people love it. (Shortform note: Our novelty bias may also explain why your brain is more likely to remember new things. _Moonwalking with Einstein_ suggests using this to your advantage by imagining things you want to remember in new, novel ways.)

This love of task-shifting negatively affects modern-day success because task-shifting doesn’t work: Research shows that task-shifting makes individual tasks take 50% longer. (Shortform note: Even worse, in _Brain Rules_ , John Medina notes that multitaskers make as many as 50% more errors.)

#### Why Task-Shifting Lowers Your Productivity

But why, exactly, does task-shifting negatively impact productivity? We’ve already seen one reason: When you’re paying attention to too many things, you risk overloading your attention. Bailey suggests two more reasons based on your brain’s biology.

**#1: You don’t encode your memories properly.**

Bailey explains that when you’re focused on a task, you use your hippocampus—the brain region responsible for storing and recalling memories. But when you multitask and task-shift, you use your basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is the brain region responsible for performing habits and learning skills.

Since you’re not using the brain area devoted to memory, you can’t encode what you’re doing properly, so you don’t remember it as well. Bailey argues that this harms productivity because you don’t remember your mistakes. If you don’t remember the mistakes you made on a task the first time, you’re far more likely to make those same mistakes again.

(Shortform note: _Make It Stick explains further exactly how different brain regions control different types of tasks_. The more you practice a skill, the stronger and faster the brain signals become to perform that skill. When it becomes a habit, your brain links the motor skill with the cognitive action so that they fire off simultaneously and subconsciously. So instead of using the hippocampus, which consolidates new information and memories, your brain recodes the habit in the basal ganglia, where other subconscious acts originate.)

**#2: Your brain doesn’t forget tasks quickly.**

Bailey explains that when you stop doing a task, you don’t forget it immediately. Rather, tasks leave behind mental residue. In other words, they remain in your working memory for some time before they eventually disappear. So if you stop doing Task A and immediately move onto Task B, you can’t totally focus on Task B. Task A still occupies some portion of your working memory.

When you constantly shift between the same tasks, you never stop doing any one of them long enough for its mental residue to completely dissolve. Since you’re always thinking about the last task you stopped doing, you’re never able to focus fully on a single task—which makes completing these tasks take longer.

In this way, task-shifting negatively impacts productivity.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Newport recommends that you reduce this mental residue when writing emails by articulating all the essential information. He argues that doing so closes the mental loop and prevents mental residue from accumulating. If true, closing the mental loop on other tasks should eliminate or reduce the mental residue they leave behind. Complete tasks before moving on from them, and close the mental loop by asking yourself: Have I done everything I can do right now to complete this task?)
