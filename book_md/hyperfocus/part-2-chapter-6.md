## Part 2 | Chapter 6: Understanding Intentional Mind-Wandering

In Part 1, Bailey espouses the benefits of deliberately managing your attention for productivity: By focusing on a single task for a prolonged period, you can be as productive as possible.

In Part 2, Bailey switches gears to explore a seemingly contradictory idea: that sometimes, deliberately managing your attention involves _intentional mind-wandering_ , which he calls “scatterfocus”—and that intentional mind-wandering can improve your life.

In this section, we’ll explain what intentional mind-wandering is, why you resist it, and why you should do it anyway. Then, we’ll introduce Bailey’s three main intentional mind-wandering techniques. Finally, we’ll discuss when, how long, and how often to intentionally mind-wander.

### Intentional Mind-Wandering: What It Is, Why You Resist It, and Why You Should Do It Anyway

When you hyperfocus, you direct your attention to a cognitively demanding task that takes up most of your working memory. Bailey explains that in order to intentionally mind-wander, you do the opposite: You deliberately leave a lot of room in your working memory, which causes the mind to wander.

> **Why Does Your Mind Wander?**
> 
> Bailey states that leaving room in your working memory gives your mind the space it needs to wander, but it’s unclear _why_ your mind wanders when you give it that space. He does state that intentional mind-wandering “lights up your brain’s default network—the network it returns to when you’re not focused on something.” Research indicates that the default network is active when your mind wanders. So it’s possible that having spare working memory activates your brain’s default network and thus causes your mind to wander.
> 
> But having spare working memory is also the reason you _notice_ that your mind has wandered, which further complicates the relationship between spare working memory and mind-wandering. This may explain why Bailey skips the neuroscientific explanation and instead just states that the more working memory you have available, the more your mind wanders.

#### Why You Resist Intentional Mind-Wandering

We’ll cover Bailey’s specific techniques for intentional mind-wandering in the next section.

But first: why would you want to intentionally mind-wander? After all, you just spent several pages learning techniques to prevent your mind from wandering so that you could hyperfocus on your highest-impact tasks. Furthermore, you likely dislike the idea of intentional mind-wandering—a preference Bailey attributes to your biological tendencies.

Bailey suggests that people resist the idea of intentional mind-wandering because they’re terrified of being left alone with their own thoughts. As we’ve discussed, your focus is naturally drawn to potential dangers—a disposition that kept us alive in primitive times.

But in modern times, external dangers are few. Bailey posits that the biggest threats we encounter are our own fears and anxieties. Bailey argues that we avoid letting our minds wander because we assume that if we do, we’ll have to face these threats, aka our fears and anxieties—which we dislike doing because it’s unpleasant. And in the modern world, you never have to sit with your thoughts if you don’t want to. You always have access to something, like your smartphone, that can distract you from your own mind. (Shortform note: It’s possible that this reliance on our phones increases our resistance to intentional mind-wandering. If you never let your mind wander because it’s scary, you might mentally exaggerate how scary mind-wandering is—which causes you to avoid it even more.)

(Shortform note: Bailey doesn’t explicitly state this, but there are presumably two elements of mind-wandering that stress people out: The idea that we have to be totally alone with our thoughts, and the idea that we also can’t use our phones. If you struggle with being alone in general, this _New York Times_ article has several suggestions—like starting small and realizing that excessive stress may be a sign you need professional support. If you’re intimidated by your own thoughts, it also suggests journaling as a method for processing those emotions.)

#### Why You Should Practice Intentional Mind-Wandering

However, Bailey argues, this resistance is unfounded: While our minds do ruminate on negative thoughts when they wander towards the past, they only wander towards the past 12% of the time. (Shortform note: Interestingly, the paper that found that people’s minds wander 47% of the time also found that mind-wandering decreases our mood no matter the topic. As we’ll see later, Bailey cites this portion of the study but argues that it decreases your mood only when the mind-wandering is involuntary. The study discusses only unintentional mind-wandering, so it’s not clear if the authors would agree with Bailey.)

More importantly, Bailey explains that mind-wandering isn’t inherently bad. Mind-wandering is only problematic during hyperfocus because it distracts you from your original intention and reduces your productivity. But mind-wandering has several benefits.

**#1: Mind-wandering helps you plan for the future.**

When our mind wanders, we spend 88% of this time thinking about either the present or the future. Both are essential for our success. We can’t simultaneously focus on and reflect on a task—so our wandering thoughts about the present allow us to reflect and consider alternate solutions to our problems. Conversely, our thoughts about the future allow us to think about our long-term goals and adjust our present circumstances so that we can achieve them.

> **Why You Must Mind-Wander to Think About the Future**
> 
> You may argue that you can reflect on your current tasks and think about the future without necessarily letting your mind wander—you could, for example, hyperfocus on discovering what’s wrong with your current approach or thinking up how you’ll increase your finances by 10% next year.
> 
> For reasons that are unclear, Bailey appears to think this is impossible, arguing that you must “step back” to “consider alternative approaches to the task,” and that “without entering scatterfocus mode, you never think about the future.”

**#2: Mind-wandering increases our creativity.**

Creativity involves making connections between disparate fields in our brain. When we let our minds wander, we give ourselves the mental space we need to make these connections. (Shortform note: We’ll elaborate more on this in our discussion about creativity, in Chapters 8-9.)

**#3: Mind-wandering lets us rest.**

Previously, we discussed how regulating our behavior exhausts our brain. When you let your mind roam free, you stop regulating your behavior. So mind-wandering gives your brain a break and helps you recharge. (Shortform note: We’ll elaborate more on this in our discussion about rest, in Chapter 7.)

##### The Benefits of Intentional Mind-Wandering

Technically, you can experience the benefits of mind-wandering whether it’s intentional or not. But **mind-wandering intentionally maximizes the benefits of mind-wandering.**

Firstly, Bailey explains that **in order to experience the full benefits of mind-wandering, you need to remember what you thought of—** which you can do better if you’re mind-wandering intentionally. As we’ll see, a common thread in Bailey’s intentional mind-wandering techniques is to pay attention to and write down the thoughts you have so you don’t forget them. For example, a creative insight you gain while mind-wandering is useless if you can’t remember what it was. But if your mind wanders unintentionally, you may not even notice that your mind has wandered—so you’re far less likely to remember any creative insights you have.

> **Why Memory Techniques Don’t Work When Mind-Wandering**
> 
> You might assume that you can increase the likelihood that you’ll remember what you think of when your mind wanders by improving your memory more generally. But most memory techniques—like the ones Moonwalking with Einstein describes—involve transforming information into a form your brain is naturally inclined to remember.
> 
> To do this, you must focus on the piece of information, which will stop your mind from wandering. Of course, writing down the thoughts you have also forces you to focus momentarily. But writing down the thoughts you have is easy and likely disrupts your mind-wandering less, whereas trying to transform your thoughts in order to remember them presumably requires more mental energy and is thus more disruptive.

Secondly, **intentional mind-wandering allows you to experience only the benefits of mind-wandering and avoid its potentially unpleasant effects**. For example, Bailey notes that some things that cause mind-wandering have unpleasant side effects: Namely, boredom makes your mind wander but also makes you feel anxious. If you mind-wander _intentionally_ , you can experience only the benefits of mind-wandering and avoid feeling anxious. (Shortform note: If you ever feel bored again, reframe your perspective to reduce your anxiety: Think of it as the ideal moment to try intentionally mind-wandering.)

Similarly, unintentional mind-wandering is a major source of distraction during hyperfocus, which makes it a type of double-edged sword. On the one hand, if your mind wanders unintentionally during a hyperfocus session, you might be happy if—for example—you gain a creative insight. On the other hand, since your mind is wandering, your hyperfocus session isn’t as productive as you want it to be. Intentional mind-wandering allows you to avoid this quandary altogether: You focus when you need to focus and let your mind wander when you want it to wander.

Bailey also notes that involuntary mind-wandering worsens your mood—and even if you’re thinking about a positive topic, mind-wandering doesn’t significantly boost your mood. He posits that intentional mind-wandering doesn’t worsen your mood because your mind is doing what you want it to so you don’t feel stressed or guilty about it. (Shortform note: Unintentional mind-wandering normally worsens your mood, but not always: One study found that unintentional mind-wandering about something interesting is associated with a more positive mood.)

Therefore, in order to access the benefits of mind-wandering, Bailey recommends intentional mind-wandering.

### How to Mind-Wander Intentionally

So how, exactly, do you mind-wander intentionally? Bailey presents three main techniques.

#### #1: Perform a fun but easy task

Bailey suggests performing a fun, cognitively simple task—in other words, something that takes up only a little working memory—and leaving the rest of your working memory open so that your mind can roam. Regularly check in to see what you’re thinking about, and keep a pad of paper on hand to jot down any great ideas. (Shortform note: What counts as a fun, cognitively simple task? One that Bailey recommends is walking, which both Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche regularly did. On his blog, Bailey also extols the benefits of knitting.)

Bailey suggests that this technique, which he calls “habitual mode,” is the ideal method for accessing the benefits of intentional mind-wandering for three main reasons.

First, **doing something you enjoy elevates your mood** —which has several benefits. Happiness increases your working memory capacity, so your mind can access more thoughts simultaneously as it wanders. (Conversely, a negative mood decreases your working memory capacity.) When you’re happy, your mind wanders towards more positive thoughts and increases the likelihood you’ll connect ideas in innovative ways. (Conversely, a negative mood increases the likelihood your mind will wander towards the past, which tends to depress you and isn’t as likely to lead to creative insights.) Finally, doing something you like is easy—so it gives your brain a break from overseeing your behavior.

In Chapter 10, Bailey elaborates further on the benefits of doing something you enjoy. He explains that happiness can be both the _cause_ and the _consequence_ of both hyperfocusing and intentional mind-wandering: On the one hand, being happier in general helps you hyperfocus more deeply and increases your creativity when mind-wandering for the same reasons mentioned above. On the other hand, hyperfocusing and intentional mind-wandering can result in increased happiness. Bailey argues that involuntary mind-wandering worsens your mood because your brain isn’t doing what you want it to. Hyperfocus prevents involuntary mind-wandering and allows you to focus your attention on the present; similarly, when you intentionally mind-wander, you have control over your brain and focus on more productive thoughts—so both make you happier.

> But there’s a simpler reason to improve your mood and do the things you enjoy: because it feels good. All of Bailey’s arguments hinge on the idea that doing things you enjoy allows you to better access the benefits of hyperfocus or intentional mind-wandering. But doing something you enjoy purely for the sake of achieving a particular goal can make your task less fun.
> 
> So don’t let an obsession with success sap enjoyment from your favorite tasks: It’s still OK to enjoy things because they’re fun to do and not because they make you more productive or creative in some way. This is primarily a matter of perspective. Doing the tasks you like will still allow you to access all of the benefits Bailey espouses about happiness. But if you start to view the task as a means to an end, it will likely add to your stress levels and won’t be as fun anymore.

Secondly, **doing enjoyable tasks extends the duration of your intentional mind-wandering session.** The more you enjoy a task, the more likely you are to keep doing it. So if you like the task that causes your mind to wander, you’ll want to keep doing the task—so your mind will wander for longer. (Shortform note: To focus for longer, make sure that your enjoyable task is something you’re physically able to continue for long periods of time. For example, if you have trouble with your feet or carpal tunnel, long walks or knitting may not be the best idea.)

Finally, **this technique maximizes your chances of capturing any creative insights you have.** When you do a relatively simple task, you have more working memory available, so you can be more aware of the thoughts that pop into your head. By keeping a notebook on hand, you’re able to capture and remember these thoughts. (Shortform note: In his section on hyperfocus, Bailey notes that although we shouldn’t spend too much time on “rote tasks,” we like them because they’re more enjoyable. You may be able to use these simpler tasks at work to intentionally mind-wander.)

(Shortform note: It may also be so that the details of your habitual task help you gain insights relevant to other areas of your life. Albert Einstein arguably had so many pioneering scientific insights because he spent so much time sailing at sea. Sailing can be complicated, but the fact that Einstein regularly got lost and liked to “let [the] boat drift” suggests he spent few cognitive resources on it.)

#### #2: Schedule time to record your ideas

Bailey recommends scheduling two 15-minute blocks each week with just your thoughts and a notepad. During this time, don’t think about anything in particular. Instead, write down whatever useful thoughts pop into your head so you don’t forget them. He refers to this as “capture mode.”

(Shortform note: Bailey notes a list of to-dos he thought of using this mode—nearly all of which were things he needed to complete in the near future. But what if you’d like more clarity on your longer-term to-dos? Try reading books that discuss the importance of having long-term goals—like _12 Rules for Life_. (Rule 4 is to judge yourself by your own goals, not by others’.) When you read books like this, you’ll have your long-term goals in the back of your mind, which may trigger mind-wandering towards actionable to-dos about the far future.)

Worried you won’t think of anything useful? Bailey argues that this is unlikely. As we’ve seen, your mind naturally focuses on threats, and your brain views tasks you haven’t yet dealt with as threats. Therefore, he argues, scheduling 15-minute blocks to think about nothing in particular will inevitably lead you to think about all the things you need to complete in the future. But if you’re concerned, Bailey recommends wandering around your house or office. The environmental cues you encounter might remind you of tasks you need to deal with—like when you look in your refrigerator and remember to buy milk.

> **Why Completing Tasks Might Help You Mind-Wander**
> 
> This technique appears slightly contradictory to Bailey’s argument that the benefits of mind-wandering outweigh its potential harms. He argues that it’s worth mind-wandering because we rarely ruminate on negative thoughts—but if your mind regularly wanders towards something it sees as a threat, doesn’t that mean it’s wandering towards a negative thought?
> 
> Presumably, Bailey doesn’t see the stress from incomplete tasks as a reason not to mind-wander because incomplete tasks are usually easy to deal with. But if you have many incomplete tasks on your plate—especially ones you’ve been avoiding that are an active source of stress—you may feel especially resistant to intentional mind-wandering. Reduce this resistance by completing a few easy tasks.

#### #3: Think about a problem while you do something else

Do you have a major problem that requires a critical solution? Have you tried traditional techniques—like brainstorming—to no avail? If so, Bailey recommends thinking about this problem while you do something else for 30-60 minutes. He refers to this as “problem-crunching mode.” Mull over the problem in your head, attacking it from different perspectives. If your mind wanders away from this problem, bring it back. (This isn’t to say that you hyperfocus on the problem—hyperfocus involves single-tasking, so in hyperfocus, you would think only about this problem and not do anything else. In problem-crunching mode, you let your mind wander while you do something else.)

This is the least clear of Bailey’s techniques for intentional mind-wandering for two major reasons:

1: Bailey doesn’t explicitly recommend thinking about the problem _while_ you do something else—he only recommends thinking about the problem. However, all of his examples involve him thinking about his problems while doing something else, such as canoeing or walking around town. Therefore, thinking about your problem _while_ you do another task appears to be the essential element of problem-crunching mode.

2: Bailey recommends reserving problem-crunching mode for only your most difficult situations because you can access “the same problem-solving benefits (and then some)” in habitual mode. However, he never makes clear _why_ problem-crunching mode is better for more difficult problems. Perhaps it’s because in problem-crunching mode, you’re deliberately directing your mind-wandering towards a specific problem, so you’re more aware of the thoughts you’re having—and you’re more likely to capture any creative insights you hit upon.

> **Hyperfocus vs Focused-Mode Thinking: Comparing _Hyperfocus_ and _A Mind for Numbers_**
> 
> In general, Bailey’s descriptions of hyperfocus and intentional mind-wandering are similar to what Barbara Oakley’s _A Mind for Numbers_ calls focused-mode thinking and diffuse-mode thinking.
> 
> Oakley explains that in focused-mode thinking, you focus your attention on something and process detailed information. But focused-mode thinking is susceptible to the “Einstellung effect,” which occurs when you are unable to solve a problem because the solution is outside the scope of where you are looking for it. You can circumvent the Einstellung effect by switching to diffuse-mode thinking: You relax your focus and let your mind wander, but your subconscious continues to work on the problem. During this time, you mentally step away from detailed problems and see the big picture or generate creative solutions by making connections between diverse concepts.
> 
> In hyperfocus, you also focus your attention on something and process detailed information—just like you do in focused-mode thinking. In scatterfocus, you also relax your focus and let your mind wander—just like you do in diffuse-mode thinking. However, Oakley’s text is geared towards learning, so her descriptions of focused-mode and diffuse-mode thinking describe how to use the modes to solve problems. In contrast, Bailey’s text is focused more broadly on attention. So while you can hyperfocus to solve a problem, you can also use it for other things, too—like responding to an email or having a conversation. Similarly, you can switch between hyperfocus and scatterfocus to solve a problem. But scatterfocus also has several other benefits, like giving your brain a break.

### When, How Long, and How Often to Mind-Wander Intentionally

When, exactly, should you mind-wander intentionally? The best time to mind-wander intentionally depends on several factors, like your schedule and your purpose for mind-wandering. Therefore, just as with hyperfocus, Bailey recommends pre-**scheduling your intentional mind-wandering sessions** at the beginning of each week based on your commitments and your needs.

Bailey also recommends the following general strategies for deciding when to intentionally mind-wander.

**Mind-wander intentionally when you’re tired.** Bailey explains that the more tired you are, the less restrained your brain is—which leads to increased creativity. He suggests tracking your energy levels and scheduling intentional mind-wandering sessions for when you’re lacking in energy. (Shortform note: This is an interesting recommendation given that, as Bailey posits, one major reason to mind-wander intentionally is to give your brain a break. Intentionally mind-wandering for the express purpose of having a creative insight when you’re tired seems like placing pressure on an already-tired brain, which would only tire you out more. So while you could mind-wander intentionally for creativity when you’re tired, it may be better to intentionally mind-wander for rest when you’re tired most of the time instead.)

**Mind-wander intentionally after drinking.** Bailey explains that alcohol increases your creativity. But it also decreases your ability to think logically and decreases your working memory capacity—so use it sparingly. (Shortform note: The link between alcohol and creativity may contribute to why so many famous artists—like Vincent Van Gogh and Jackson Pollock—suffered from alcoholism.)

**Mind-wander intentionally when you need to be more creative.** Bailey suggests that although everybody should intentionally mind-wander multiple times a day, you should schedule sessions more often during weeks that will require more creativity. (Shortform note: As we’ll see, you can intentionally mind-wander in situations designed to increase your creativity—but by nature, you can’t force yourself to have creative insights at a given time. The more often you intentionally mind-wander, however, the higher the likelihood that you’ll gain a creative insight.)

As for how long to intentionally mind-wander, Bailey explains that **sessions of at least 15 minutes help your brain switch properly from hyperfocus to scatterfocus mode**. Still, shorter periods are also beneficial because they allow you to rest and zoom out on your day. (Shortform note: Bailey doesn't specify why you need 15 minutes. It may be because, as we’ve seen, tasks don’t immediately leave your working memory once you stop doing them and instead leave behind some mental residue that takes a while to dissipate. So if you've been properly hyperfocused on a task, it may take that long for your mind to begin wandering at all.)

And how often should you intentionally mind-wander? Bailey recommends that everybody should schedule several intentional mind-wandering sessions each day for maximum benefit. (He doesn’t explicitly state why, but this is presumably to give yourself regular breaks from hyperfocusing.)

#### Signs You Need to Mind-Wander More Often

If any of the following apply, Bailey recommends that you intentionally mind-wander more often:

**You hyperfocus a lot.** It may seem counterintuitive, but in general, hyperfocus actually makes you better at intentional mind-wandering. Hyperfocus increases your working memory capacity. When you’re able to hold more information in your working memory at once, your mind can wander around more information—so you can potentially make more connections and have better ideas. (Shortform note: Since meditation and mindfulness both also increase your working memory capacity, practicing them should increase the productivity of your intentional mind-wandering sessions.)

Hyperfocus helps you remember more. You draw upon the information you remember to think of creative thoughts and to accurately imagine the future, so remembering more improves the benefits you get from intentional mind-wandering. (Shortform note: Hyperfocus might also help you remember more because it gets you in the right state: You’re focused on paying attention, so you learn more. Similarly, _Limitless_ suggests you learn best when you approach what you’re learning in a state of joy, curiosity, and interest.)

Thirdly, hyperfocus increases our attentional awareness. This also helps us when we mind-wander intentionally because we're able to notice when we have useful insights and remember them. (Shortform note: This may be a double-edged sword: Although researchers state that knowing that your mind is wandering improves creativity, they also state that knowing that your mind is wandering might prevent it from wandering in the first place. So if you struggle to make your mind wander at first, persist.)

However, **training your brain to focus on one thing for long periods of time causes it to wander less.** This is great for hyperfocus. But it means you won’t get the benefits of mind-wandering unless you mind-wander intentionally. Additionally, hyperfocus is tiring. The more often you do it, the more often you’ll need to recharge by intentionally mind-wandering.

(Shortform note: It seems probable that even though intentional mind-wandering recharges you, deliberately directing your attention at all times might be exhausting—especially if you’re used to spending most of your day in autopilot mode. To truly give yourself a break, give yourself permission to do absolutely nothing.)

**You rely on creativity.** As we'll see, intentional mind-wandering can regularly induce creative insights.

**You need to get it right the first time.**(Shortform note: Bailey explains that intentional mind-wandering as you create a plan saves time when you execute the plan, but he doesn't specify why. One reason may be that when your mind wanders, you imagine potential worst-case scenarios and are thus able to implement a plan that prevents them.)
