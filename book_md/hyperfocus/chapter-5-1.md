## Chapter 5.1: Hyperfocus Step 3: Use Mindfulness to Improve Focus

In Step 3 of hyperfocus, you focus on your intended task for a set period of time. This is a surprisingly difficult endeavor you can make easier by following the various strategies you learned in Steps 0 - 2. **Bailey also names two daily habits that can make hyperfocusing easier: meditation and mindfulness.** Meditation and mindfulness improve your ability to hyperfocus because they increase your working memory capacity. Furthermore, they offer several other benefits because they improve the quality of your attention in general.

In this section, we’ll first discuss what meditation and mindfulness are. We’ll then discuss how increasing your working memory capacity—a major benefit of meditation and mindfulness—improves your ability to hyperfocus. You’ll then learn three other ways that meditation and mindfulness improve the quality of your attention. Finally, we’ll describe Bailey’s strategies for effectively incorporating meditation and mindfulness into your daily life.

### Understanding Meditation and Mindfulness

While many people use the terms meditation and mindfulness interchangeably, Bailey does not. Bailey explains that **when you meditate, you focus on a single thing** and bring your attention back to it when your mind wanders. **When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to everything** you experience in a given moment. For example, if you wash dishes mindfully, you pay attention to everything that happens moment-by-moment, like how the water feels on your skin or how it sounds as it hits the sink.

In both meditation and mindfulness, you regularly refocus your attention. But when you meditate, you refocus your attention on a single task—like breathing. Practicing mindfulness is not about focusing on a single thing but about _noticing_ your current circumstances and directing your attention to whatever you’re currently doing instead of letting your mind wander away.

(Shortform note: Other people also distinguish between meditation and mindfulness, but their definitions differ from Bailey’s. For example, mindfulness expert Elisha Goldstein defines meditation as intentionally doing something good for yourself and mindfulness as a general awareness of your circumstances. She refers to what Bailey calls practicing mindfulness—purposefully noticing what you experience in a given moment—as “mindfulness meditation.”)

### How Increasing Your Working Memory Capacity Improves Your Ability to Hyperfocus

Meditation and mindfulness share another similarity: Research indicates that both practices increase your working memory capacity. (As Bailey notes, many brain training apps claim to improve your working memory capacity. But meditation and mindfulness are the only two scientifically proven methods for doing so.)

(Shortform note: Bailey later argues that hyperfocus increases your working memory capacity, too—perhaps because, just as in meditation and mindfulness, you regularly refocus your attention on the current task. However, this may not necessarily be a scientifically validated insight given that he cites no research on the topic.)

As you may recall, your working memory capacity dictates how much information you can pay attention to—the bigger it is, the more information you can process simultaneously. Therefore, Bailey argues that increasing your working memory capacity improves your ability to hyperfocus in three main ways.

First, **increasing your working memory capacity increases the amount of information you can pay attention to simultaneously.** The more complex a task, the more information you need to pay attention to simultaneously. So when you increase your working memory capacity, you improve your ability to process complex tasks.

(Shortform note: Increasing your working memory capacity may improve your ability to process complex tasks best when they’re new to you. A large working memory capacity helps you process complex tasks because it lets you fit all the information you need into your working memory—but the more you improve at a task, the less working memory it uses, and the easier it becomes to fit all the information you need into the working memory capacity you already have. (We’ll elaborate more on this in our discussion of learning and creativity).)

Secondly, **increasing your working memory capacity makes you less prone to distraction** : Research shows that the minds of people who have higher working memory capacity wander less when they’re focused on a complex task. And if something _does_ distract you, you can return to your original intention faster: The more working memory you have available, the less likely a distraction is to crowd your original intention totally out of it. Since your original intention always remains in your working memory, you never forget it completely—so you return to it faster than you would if you forgot it. (Shortform note: Research suggests that the opposite may also be true: A working memory deficit is associated with ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). One symptom of ADHD is distractibility.)

Finally, **increasing your working memory capacity makes you more productive.** Research shows that the minds of people with higher working memory capacity tend to wander toward the future—a generally productive endeavor, especially since Bailey seems to equate thinking about the future with _planning_ for the future. Similarly, Bailey explains that a higher working memory capacity improves your ability to make efficient decisions: You use some working memory to _do_ your current task, but you can devote your spare working memory to _thinking about_ your current task and what you want to do next. The greater your working memory capacity, the more spare working memory you have available—so the more attention you can pay to _thinking_ _about_ your tasks, which allows you to make better decisions.

(Shortform note: Bailey assumes that thinking more about your tasks leads you to make better decisions, but that shouldn’t necessarily be the case. If you think too much about the task, you could overthink your decisions and experience “analysis paralysis,” which is when you think too much about your decisions and are unable to make any decisions at all for fear of making the wrong one.)

### How Meditation and Mindfulness Improve the Quality of Your Attention

In addition to improving your ability to hyperfocus, Bailey argues that meditation and mindfulness improve all three measures of the quality of your attention. As discussed in Chapter 2, you assess the quality of your attention based on how long you can focus in a single sitting, how quickly you return to your original intention after becoming distracted, and how frequently you direct your attention.

**#1: Meditation and mindfulness teach you to focus for longer periods of time.**

Bailey explains that during both meditation and mindfulness, you focus on information or activities that only occupy a small portion of your working memory. With so much working memory available, your mind wanders a lot.

We can infer that through meditation and mindfulness, you get a lot of practice directing your attention to where you want it to go—whether it’s to a particular task (as in meditation) or to the present moment (as in mindfulness). The more you practice directing your attention, the better you become at controlling where it goes, the less likely you are to get distracted, and the longer you can maintain your focus on a single task. As such, we can conclude that since they let you practice directing your attention, meditation and mindfulness teach you to focus for longer periods of time.

(Shortform note In this way, using meditation and mindfulness to redirect your attention might be just like any other skill. As psychologist Daniel Goleman notes, every time you redirect your attention, you “strengthen the neural circuitry for focus” and get better at doing it.)

**#2: Meditation and mindfulness help you get back on track faster after you become distracted.**

As we’ve seen, we don’t always __ notice when we’ve become distracted. The longer it takes us to notice that we’ve become distracted, the longer it takes us to return to our original task.

So why do meditation and mindfulness help us get back on track faster? Bailey never makes his reasoning explicit, but we can infer the following: Both meditation and mindfulness are exercises in noticing and redirecting your attention, so when you practice them, you practice noticing your thoughts—which makes you more apt to notice your thoughts in general. The more often you notice what you’re thinking about, the faster you realize that you’ve become distracted, and the faster you refocus on your original intention. In this way, meditation and mindfulness help you get back on track faster after you become distracted.

(Shortform note: In _Quiet_ , author Susan Cain describes how extroverts tend to focus more of their attention on completing their task, while introverts tend to focus more of their attention on reflecting on the task. If introverts reflect more than extroverts do on individual tasks, they may also more generally reflect on their thoughts than extroverts. As such, you may find mindfulness and meditation more effective if you’re an extrovert.)

**#3: Meditation and mindfulness increase how often you deliberately direct your attention.**

In both meditation and mindfulness, you practice deliberately directing your attention. Bailey argues that this practice spills over into the rest of your life: You start to deliberately direct your attention even when you’re not meditating or intentionally being mindful. In this way, Bailey suggests that meditation and mindfulness increase how often you deliberately direct your attention.

(Shortform note: Bailey never makes explicit _why_ deliberately directing your attention during meditation should make you deliberately direct your attention more frequently in other aspects of your life. Perhaps it’s because if you meditate regularly, you regularly remind yourself to direct your attention and not operate on autopilot—and the more you remind yourself of that, the more you remember to do it.)

### How to Incorporate Meditation and Mindfulness Into Your Daily Life

So how, exactly, can you reap the benefits of both meditation and mindfulness? Bailey urges you to make both a daily habit.

**To meditate, sit down and focus on your breathing for a given amount of time each day.** For best results, Bailey encourages you to start small: Meditate only for an amount of time that feels easy. He also encourages trying guided meditations with apps like Headspace. **To practice mindfulness, Bailey encourages to pick a single daily task and be mindful during it.** In other words, notice everything that happens as you do that task. For best results, choose a task that occupies very little working memory, like eating a meal.

Your mind will wander a lot during both practices—but don’t beat yourself up if it takes a long time for you to notice! After all, researchers suggest that the brain regions that notice your mind wandering are the same regions involved when your mind wanders to begin with. Similarly, Bailey cautions against judging any thoughts you have too harshly. Just because a thought pops into your head doesn’t mean that it’s true or that you believe it.

> **More Than Attention: Meditation’s Other Benefits**
> 
> In addition to improving your working memory capacity, there are several other reasons to regularly practice meditation and mindfulness.
> 
> _21 Lessons for the 21st Century _suggests that meditation is critical for success because it’s the best way to understand your own mind, namely your thoughts, fears, and desires. By understanding your own mind, through which you interpret and react to the world, you can choose your actions more wisely and execute them more effectively. The same text adds that meditating makes you realize how little control you have over your thoughts—and that realization is the first step to gaining control over your thoughts.
> 
> Practicing meditation and mindfulness may also be good for your health. Several studies examining the relationship between a mindfulness practice and various medical issues have shown promising results. For example, mindfulness may help treat coronary disease and slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease.
