## Shortform Introduction

In a world full of distractions, most modern-day knowledge workers believe that the secret to productivity lies in your ability to manage your time. In 2018’s _Hyperfocus_ , productivity expert Chris Bailey presents an alternate hypothesis: **The key to becoming the most productive, creative version of yourself lies not in managing your time but in managing your _attention_. **

In his book, Bailey teaches two main methods of managing your attention. First, he presents several strategies to help you “hyperfocus,” or single-task, so that you can be as productive as possible. Then, he presents several strategies to help you “scatterfocus,” or intentionally mind-wander so you can be more creative and have more energy.

### About the Author

Chris Bailey is a Canadian productivity expert. His first book, 2016’s _The Productivity Project_ , was a Canadian non-fiction bestseller that chronicled the year-long productivity experiment Bailey undertook during his post-university sabbatical. Bailey also chronicled the experiment on his blog, which he continues under the name “A Life of Productivity.”

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Viking Penguin

Published in 2018, _Hyperfocus_ is Bailey’s second book.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

_Hyperfocus_ came out in the late 2010s, a time during which many authors were writing about how to focus in a world increasingly driven to distraction. Bailey’s own _The Productivity Project_ came out in 2016, as did Cal Newport’s _Deep Work_ , which shares tips on how to deeply focus on work. Nir Eyal’s _Indistractable_ , which also suggests strategies for doing focused work, came out in 2019—just one year after _Hyperfocus_.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers who appreciate the book like how actionable Bailey’s advice is. They also appreciate that he cites substantial research for his ideas. Additionally, they like his tone, which they find easy to understand and not too stuffy.

Online reviewers who dislike the book primarily feel that Bailey repeats too many ideas he’d already shared in his first book, _The Productivity Project._ Some also find the book elitist due to some assumptions Bailey makes about his readers—like that they have a lot of control over their own schedules.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Hyperfocus_ teaches you how to manage your attention partly by explaining the neuroscience of how attention works. Bailey gained this knowledge by reading scientific papers extensively—and perhaps in an attempt to simplify these papers for the layperson, he created unique words to refer to common concepts, such as “scatterfocus,” and “attentional space.” While well-intentioned, Bailey's terms don't exactly match those neuroscientists and other experts use, which sometimes makes it difficult to know what scientifically-backed concept he’s referencing when he’s using his own terminology.

Bailey’s simplification of the neuroscience of attention also manifests in imprecise (or absent) explanations of why or how these scientific phenomena work. This tendency weakens his argument: It’s not always clear how he came to a conclusion, and he often doesn’t explicitly address potential counterarguments. For example, he argues that if you develop a regular meditation practice, you’ll increase how often you deliberately direct your attention—but he never explains _why_ that might be the case.

As discussed, many online reviewers complained that _Hyperfocus_ was too similar to _A Productivity Project—_ and indeed, most of Bailey’s conclusions in the first half of _Hyperfocus_ reflect productivity techniques that may be familiar to fans of productivity books. The second half of Bailey’s book, which focuses on intentional mind-wandering and how it benefits creativity, is more unique, but it also reflects ideas in previously published texts: Notably, _A Mind for Numbers_ shares a similar technique for accessing creativity, although it is geared towards students instead of businesspeople.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Bailey begins his book with a few introductory chapters that explain his interest in focus, his approach in the book, and several strategies his reader can use to focus better on the book itself. He then splits the book into two parts. In Part 1, Bailey describes the neuroscience of how your attention works, explains what hyperfocus is, and shares several strategies for accessing it. In Part 2, Bailey describes the benefits of scatterfocus and shares several strategies for it.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide to Hyperfocus attempts to clarify some of the confusion resulting from the book’s oversimplification of the relevant neuroscience. To that end, we've replaced Bailey's unique terms with terms that are more commonly used or easier to understand. In our commentary, we also point out some of the logical inconsistencies in Bailey's arguments and offer ways to resolve them.

Sometimes, Bailey repeats ideas or clarifies an idea several chapters after he first presents it. Additionally, several actionable strategies lack a clear logical order, making them hard to follow.

Consequently, we’ve re-organized Bailey’s ideas to aid the flow of logic and make topics easier to find. Here’s a mapping of the parts of this guide to the chapters of the book:

  * Chapter 1 → Book Chapters 0, 1, 2 
  * Chapter 2 → Book Chapters 1, 3
  * Chapter 3 → Book Chapter 3
  * Chapter 4.1 → Book Chapter 4
  * Chapter 4.2 → Book Chapter 4
  * Chapter 5.1 → Book Chapter 5
  * Chapter 5.2 → Book Chapter 5
  * Chapter 6 → Book Chapters 6, 10
  * Chapter 7 → Book Chapter 7
  * Chapters 8 - 9 → Book Chapters 8, 9



In Part 1, we’ll explain why your biology makes it so hard to manage your attention and focus in the modern world. We’ll then explain how to hyperfocus, complete with strategies to use at each stage to make hyperfocusing easier.

In Part 2, we’ll share why Bailey considers deliberately managing your attention through scatterfocus, or intentional mind-wandering, an essential life skill. You’ll learn how it can increase your energy levels and how managing _what_ you pay attention to and how you direct your attention through scatterfocus can increase your creativity.

Throughout our guide, we’ll share how Bailey’s ideas compare to accepted neuroscience, providing greater background information to clarify _why_ Bailey’s strategies work. We’ll also compare Bailey’s techniques to methods from other productivity experts, like Nir Eyal and Cal Newport, supplementing his strategies when needed so that you can direct your attention even more effectively.
