## Chapters 8-9: How to Be More Creative

You’ve now learned how to mind-wander so that you can plan for the future and so that you have more energy.

A third major benefit of intentional mind-wandering is that it increases your creativity. But how, exactly, does intentional mind-wandering increase creativity? And how can you make your intentional mind-wandering sessions as creative as possible?

In this section, we’ll first explain how learning and creativity work in the brain. We’ll then discuss the importance of exposing yourself to the right stimuli and present Bailey’s strategies for maximizing your chances of getting the right stimuli. Finally, we’ll explain why and how to intentionally trigger creative insights with the right strategies.

### How Learning and Creativity Work in Your Brain

Whenever you encounter a new stimulus, your brain stores this information in what Bailey refers to as a “dot.” We’ll call them bits. Your brain treats each bit differently based on two major factors: what it is and what you already know about it.

When you learn, you connect a new bit to the bits you already know. In other words, you always interpret information based on your personal background. For example, a chef might look at a meal and think about how it was made. An environmentalist might look at the same meal and consider the environmental costs of all of its ingredients. (Shortform note: This connection can occur unintentionally—you smell a stranger’s cologne on the street and suddenly think of your first love. It can also occur deliberately, which many memory techniques use to their advantage. They make you connect new information to information you already know because the more connections a bit has in your brain, the more likely you are to remember it.)

Bailey explains that when you learn related bits, you join them together in a “cluster,” or chunk. The more bits you gather, the denser each chunk becomes. And the more chunks you gather around a topic, the more of an expert you become.

As an example of the chunking process, think about learning to drive a car with a manual transmission: To shift gears, you have to push in the clutch, move the stick to the right position, and keep the engine RPMs in the right range while you let the clutch back out. You also have to control the steering wheel, operate the brake, keep track of your speed, and so forth.

Initially, your brain treats each of these elements separately. Since only a few items fit into your working memory simultaneously, driving takes up all of your attention. However, once you learn to drive a stick-shift, you don’t think specifically about all these little tasks. You just think, “I need to drive to the grocery store,” and pretty soon you’re cruising down the road in third gear, without any conscious recollection of how you shifted from first gear into second or second into third. This is because your brain has condensed all the little tasks into a single chunk of information that you can use intuitively.

This single chunk becomes one of the things that your brain is paying attention to. Since all of the initially separate bits are now condensed into one, it requires less working memory, so we regain room in our working memory and thus the ability to pay attention to more items—like the radio in the car.

(Shortform note: In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Oakley describes this exact process. She also explains that the more often you access a chunk, the stronger connections it has and the more it sticks in your memory. This is one reason why it’s essential to regularly review any information you study.)

This isn't to say that you remember every piece of information that you ever learn. This is thanks to sleep, which purges unimportant bits from your short-term memory and moves important bits into long-term storage.

Just like learning, creativity also involves connecting clusters and bits together. But when you learn, you connect _related_ ideas together. Creativity involves connecting _disparate_ ideas together. This is why intentional mind-wandering often leads to moments of inspiration: By not focusing on anything in particular, our brains randomly look for connections between bits. When it arrives at one, you gain a new, creative insight.

(Shortform note: Most people assume that creativity is only necessary in the arts. But the researchers behind one study that found that mind-wandering increased creativity posit that mind-wandering is so common because it was useful in ancient times: We found creative solutions that helped us survive thanks to mind-wandering.)

### Why Having the Right Stimuli Is Essential

We’ve now learned that you create bits and chunks when you encounter new information, and you act creatively when you connect those bits and chunks in unexpected ways. Therefore, creativity depends on the information you encounter. In other words, the higher-quality bits and chunks you create, the higher-quality ideas you have.

So how do you get the highest-quality bits? Since our brains can store nearly limitless amounts of information, you could try cramming as much information into your head as possible. However, as we’ve seen, you can only _pay attention_ to a limited number of items simultaneously due to your limited working memory capacity. So even if you tried to pay attention to all the world’s information, you would only capture a certain amount—and not necessarily the data that was most beneficial to you. Furthermore, as we’ve seen, trying to pay attention to more items than your working memory is capable of holding overwhelms your brain and causes you to forget important information.

(Shortform note: Another problem with paying attention to all of the data has to do with information overload. _Smarter Faster Better_ describes how in our modern society, many of us become so overwhelmed by the amount of data available that we enter a state of “information blindness,” where we either ignore the data, misinterpret the data, or stop taking it in altogether. Author Charles Duhigg explains that you avoid information overload by interacting with the data in some way, such as by writing it out, plotting it on a graph, or explaining it to another person.)

Instead, Bailey argues, to get the highest-quality bits, you need to pay attention to the highest-quality information.

Bailey goes so far as to argue that paying attention to the right information is what causes genius. People often cite that geniuses are made by 10,000 hours of practice. But in order to come up with genius ideas and decisions, Bailey argues, you must connect 10,000 hours’ worth of _information_. (Shortform note: The 10,000-hour rule was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers, but this is actually a myth. One reason for this is that he doesn’t distinguish between different types of practice. As _Peak_ explains, not all practice is equal: deliberate practice, which involves setting clear goals and making specific improvements, is the best type.)

### How to Get the Most Beneficial Information

So how do you get the highest-quality information?

First, you must **determine what counts as high-quality information**. Bailey posits that all the information we encounter can be ranked based on its usefulness and its entertainment value. The most useful (and thus highest-quality) information is accurate, related to your goals, practical, and relevant long-term. Bailey suggests that we encounter this mostly in books and podcasts. (Shortform note: Although this is a generally applicable rule, rating the value of information is an extremely subjective process. If you personally find a piece of information useful, that’s enough. Don’t feel like information that doesn’t meet all of these criteria can’t be useful.) However, the most useful information also takes the most work to learn—so it’s also the least entertaining. According to Bailey, generally speaking, **the less useful the information, the more entertaining it becomes.**

Then, **improve the quality of the information that you take in.** Bailey doesn’t suggest exclusively taking in high-quality information. Fun is important, and given how much work it is to learn useful information, taking in only high-quality information would be exhausting. (Shortform note: Lower-quality information has benefits other than fun, too. For example, watching TV can help you relax if you’re facing a major stressor.)

Rather, Bailey recommends that you be more intentional about the information you do take in. So we recommend trying this experiment: Over the next few weeks, ask yourself the following questions before you consume any information. Doing so will teach you to be more intentional about the information you consume so that you can consume higher-quality information.

**Question #1: Do I enjoy this?**

Bailey explains that sometimes, we consume information out of habit and not because we genuinely enjoy it. Stop doing this. (Shortform note: If you struggle with this, try Chapter 4’s strategies for reducing distractions to help cull the information you consume.) Conversely, most of us enjoy something that others don't. Bailey encourages you to keep doing this, even if others find it strange or unappealing. (Shortform note: If you struggle to enjoy things that you like but other people don't, it may be a signal to be kinder to yourself. Try strategies like complimenting yourself—doing so boosts your endorphins and spurs you to accomplish more.)

**Question #2: Is this worth finishing?**

Have you ever powered through a book you hated just because you wanted to finish it? Bailey explains that this is due to the Zeigarnik effect—your mind doesn't like leaving things unfinished. (We’ll elaborate more on this later.) Give yourself permission to walk away from information that is ultimately not valuable.

(Shortform note: What if you don't want to read the whole book but are still curious about what happens? In this case, simply Google the title of the media you're consuming and spoiler. You’ll satisfy your curiosity without spending all the time to finish everything.)

**Question #3: Is this worth my time, focus, and energy?**

Bailey argues that too many of us select the media we consume based on others’ recommendations and not because _we_ actually want to. So he encourages you to vet any media you’re considering consuming by asking this question. (Shortform note: Bailey first introduces this idea in Chapter 0.5 by telling his reader to re-evaluate whether or not they really want to read _Hyperfocus._ This is unique in works about productivity and demonstrates Bailey’s commitment to his mission: Most books don’t encourage you to reconsider whether you want to read them after you’ve already picked them up.)

If you can’t decide between multiple options, imagine yourself looking back on your life. Which activity would your future self think was a better use of your time? Would your future self have any regrets about how you spent this time? (Shortform note Imagining your life from the perspective of your future self can help you determine more than what piece of information to consume—it can clarify your goals for the future. One common technique is to write your own obituary so that you think about the impact you want to leave and whether your current actions support that.)

**Question #4: Is this related to what I know already?**

Bailey explains that you gain the most creative insights when you connect the ideas that are the most different. So venturing outside your comfort zone and learning new things is key to gaining more creative insights. (Shortform note: This is true of both topics and creators. In 2020, many Americans deliberately diversified the media that they consumed—not by topic but by consuming more media created by BIPOC.)

That said, expertise comes from collecting as much information about a topic as possible. So when you stop consuming something, he recommends consuming something new—ideally, something related to your field of expertise. (Shortform note: Given that one of Bailey's major ideas is that we are generally overstimulated, this recommendation seems counterintuitive. It may be worth eliminating poor-quality sources of information and _not_ replacing them to get used to less stimulation overall.)

**Question #5: Do I want to do this?**

Since Bailey defines productivity as accomplishing your intended goal, relaxation can be productive. The key? Don't let yourself fall into autopilot mode. To accomplish this, schedule your relaxation periods in advance and stick to them. It’s OK to binge-watch a TV show as long as you decide how many episodes to binge in advance.

(Shortform note: A lot of distractions like Netflix suck us into long unintended bouts of relaxation because they autoplay. Make your Netflix binge more intentional by turning off this setting—having to manually select the next episode might help you reconsider whether this Is how you really want to be spending your time. This is an example of what _Atomic Habits_ describes as a one-time action that triggers good habits.)

### How to Trigger Creative Insights

You’ve now learned how, by improving the quality of the information you consume, you’re able to have higher-quality ideas. But how do you actually _have_ those ideas? Most people assume that creative insights happen randomly. However, Bailey explains that **you can _intentionally_ trigger creative insights** thanks to what psychologists call the Zeigarnik effect.

The Zeigarnik effect is the name for a peculiar neural phenomenon: We remember things we haven’t yet completed much better than things we’ve completed. Thanks to the Zeigarnik effect, your brain continues to work on problems you haven’t yet solved—even if you’re not actively working on them.

(Shortform note: One paper notes that, despite the Zeigarnik effect’s popularity in productivity books, most modern psychology books don’t mention it because researchers haven’t been able to replicate it reliably. Studies that support the Zeigarnik effect suggest that it relates to motivation: People motivated by feeling successful remember incomplete tasks better because they need to complete them to achieve their goal. However, the Zeigarnik effect is not a universal phenomenon.)

As you’re subconsciously working on this problem, your brain encounters various stimuli. It automatically tries to connect all of these stimuli to this problem. These stimuli might be external (like the apple that fell on Isaac Newton’s head). If your mind is wandering, these stimuli might be internal—like an old memory you haven’t thought of in a while. (Shortform note: A falling apple definitely triggered Newton’s theory of gravity—but there’s no evidence to suggest it fell specifically on his head.) Sometimes, the stimulus your brain encounters reminds it of something else it already knows. It connects this old information (or the new stimulus, which may itself be the information you were missing) to your problem—and solves it.

When your mind wanders, you encounter many more stimuli because you think about many more things. The more stimuli you encounter, the higher the likelihood you encounter the stimulus you need to solve your problem, so the more likely it is you’ll gain a creative insight.

If you mind-wander _intentionally_ , you’re far more likely to notice and remember this creative insight. Furthermore, when you perform a fun, easy task as you mind-wander, you maximize the stimuli you encounter: You experience both external stimuli (from doing the task) and internal stimuli (the thoughts you have as your mind wanders). Therefore, intentionally mind-wandering in the right situations can increase your likelihood of having and remembering a creative insight.

#### Strategies for Triggering Creative Insights

Design such situations yourself using Bailey’s strategies.

**#1: Intentionally mind-wander in busy environments.**

As we’ve seen, you need new stimuli to trigger a creative insight. So maximize your chances of having a burst of inspiration by maximizing the external stimuli you encounter. Bailey recommends intentionally mind-wandering someplace you’ll regularly encounter new cues—like a train station or a busy café.

(Shortform note: “Where’s the Spark? How Lockdown Caused a Creativity Crisis” describes how COVID-19 caused a loss in creativity partly because people weren’t exposed to new experiences. If your company still works from home, expanding your weak-tie network through cross-departmental collaborative projects might be a good way to increase new stimuli: Chance comments from “weak ties” can be the source of unexpected inspiration.)

**#2: Manipulate the Zeigarnik effect.**

Bailey explains that there are two main ways you can manipulate the Zeigarnik effect.

  * If you’re stuck on a specific problem write it down.
  * Stop your task in the middle.



Both methods ensure that your problem or task remains in the back of your mind. Writing down your problem helps you remember the problem. (Shortform note: Bailey doesn’t offer evidence to support this claim. Many studies indicate that _handwriting improves your memory_ , but typing doesn’t have the same effect—so Bailey’s strategy may only work if you handwrite your problem.) And stopping your task in the middle works because the task leaves behind mental residue, so your mind continues to work on it even if you’re not actively doing the task. (Shortform note: Stopping your task in the middle likely works best if you’re able to let your mind wander for a while. As you may recall from our discussion of hyperfocus, if you still have mental residue from a task in your working memory when you need to hyperfocus, the mental residue will distract you and you won’t be able to hyperfocus as well.)

When you move onto a fun but easy task and let your mind wander, the Zeigarnik effect ensures that your brain will try to connect all the stimuli you encounter to the unsolved problem or the incomplete task. So by mind-wandering after writing down your problem or stopping your task in the middle, you increase the number of connections your brain tries to make with your problem or task. The more connections your brain makes, the more likely it is to make a useful connection.

(Shortform note: Like Bailey, Oakley argues that you can switch to diffuse-mode thinking (which is similar to intentional mind-wandering) to work out a creative solution to a problem. But Oakley’s technique has one important caveat: She argues that in order for your mind to best come up with a creative insight, you can no longer be consciously thinking about the problem—which can take several hours. Bailey makes no such claim; in fact, the problem-solving mode we saw earlier uses the exact opposite logic since you need to repeatedly bring your mind back to the problem you’re working on.)

**#3: Delay your decision.**

As we’ve seen, the more you hyperfocus, the less your mind wanders—and the harder it becomes to trigger a creative insight. One strategy Bailey recommends if you regularly hyperfocus is to **wait as long as possible when making creative decisions**. The more time you give your mind to wander, the more stimuli your brain will encounter and the higher the possibility you’ll come up with an innovative solution. (Shortform note: Of course, there are famous examples of people coming up with creative solutions under high time pressure. But one study’s Time-Pressure/Creativity Matrix suggests this is exceedingly rare and almost exclusively when people feel a sense of purpose and urgency about their task.)

**#4: Sleep on it.**

You might argue that sleeping is a biological necessity and doesn’t count as intentional mind-wandering. But Bailey argues that dreaming is “scatterfocus on steroids,” noting several famous examples of great ideas humans had in their sleep. (Shortform note: One he doesn’t mention is Mary Shelley, who dreamt up her gothic classic Frankenstein during an afternoon nap.) He also cites a study indicating that REM sleep in particular allows your brain to make the connection it needs to find a creative insight. (Shortform note: REM sleep is also important for sleep quality: _The 4-Hour Body_ suggests that the higher the ratio of REM sleep to total sleep, the more restful your sleep.)

Bailey suggests that **dreaming may trigger creative insights because sleep is so neurally similar to intentional mind-wandering**. Both intentional mind-wandering and sleep energize us. Random neurons fire both when we sleep and when we mind-wander intentionally, which leads to breakthrough ideas. Our brains consolidate information during both brain modes. Our minds wander to similar areas during both modes, including the past, the future, and our relationships with other people. However, Bailey admits that our minds jump much more between these areas when we mind-wander intentionally.

(Shortform note: Why might sleep be so neurally similar to intentional mind-wandering? Perhaps it’s because dreams come from activity in the brain’s “default network,” which is most active when we daydream, too.)

So how can you use sleep to intentionally trigger a creative insight? Bailey recommends **asking yourself important questions and going over information you want to remember just before you go to sleep.** He posits that this will cause your mind to wander around these topics while you sleep—so you could wake up with a new creative insight.

(Shortform note: If you use this technique, keep a notebook on your nightstand to capture these insights. After all, most of us forget our dreams as soon as we wake up. Keeping a dream journal can also help you learn from your mistakes.)
