## Exercise: Plan for Change

When leading a team through a transition, William and Susan Bridges recommend the following strategies for each stage of the transition process: planning ahead, leading with empathy, and communicating with intention. Imagine that you’re crafting a transition plan that accounts for each of these strategies.

Think of a change that needs to be implemented at work. Briefly describe it here.

Planning Ahead: Who will be impacted by these changes? What do they stand to lose?

Lead with Empathy: What’s one thing you can do to acknowledge the loss people will experience?

Communicate with Intention: What’s the problem this change seeks to solve? How will you communicate this to your team?
