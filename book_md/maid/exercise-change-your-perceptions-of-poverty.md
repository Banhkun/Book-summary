## Exercise: Change Your Perceptions of Poverty

 _Maid_ paints a picture of poverty in America with which many readers are unfamiliar. Examine your perceptions of poverty and its causes.

* * *

Think about your earliest perceptions of poverty and the poor. What were your assumptions, and what were the sources of those opinions? (For example, school, family, books, personal experiences)

From your own experiences, have your perceptions of poverty or its causes changed over time? Explain why or why not.

Has reading this guide changed your views on poverty or its causes? Explain why or why not.
