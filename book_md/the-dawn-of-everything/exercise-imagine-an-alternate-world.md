## Exercise: Imagine an Alternate World

Graeber and Wengrow say one reason weâ€™re stuck in systems of inequality today is that we lack the ability to imagine alternatives. Use your imagination to design a better society.

* * *

Imagine your ideal society. What would _a perfect world_ be like, for you? Think about cultural values, norms, beliefs, structures, political and economic systems, and so on. List three that are especially important to you.

Now, when you have that vision of an ideal world, compare it to the reality of the society you live in. What are the most notable differences?

Considering the differences you noted, in order to transform your current society into your ideal one, _what would need to change_? Set aside the notion of whether these changes are realistic or not and simply engage the imagination.
