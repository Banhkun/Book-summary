## Exercise: Understand Yourself Better

Take Bet-David’s first strategic step by understanding who you are now, who you want to be in the future, and how to get there from here.

* * *

Being as objective as possible, write down your personal qualities, your strengths and weaknesses, the circumstances in which you thrive, how others perceive you, and anything else that comes to mind about your personality. (For example, you might be extremely sociable, have a hard time focusing on long-term projects, be perceived as a social butterfly, and thrive in fast-paced work environments.)

Next, write down three to five career goals you hope to achieve. (For example, you might aspire to work for a high-profile tech company.)

Finally, write down ways you can take advantage of your strengths (and avoid triggering your weaknesses) to pursue those goals. How can you best leverage your unique personality to realize your aspirations? (For example, as an extrovert who doesn’t like long-term projects, you might achieve your goal of working for a high-profile tech company by seeking roles in public relations, where you’ll need good people skills and projects are short-term.)
