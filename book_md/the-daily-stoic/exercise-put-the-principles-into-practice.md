## Exercise: Put the Principles Into Practice

 _The Daily Stoic_ is meant to motivate you to action, so consider how you can do just that.

* * *

The Stoics believed in regulating their emotions. Take a moment to identify what you’re feeling right now, then try being mindful of what your emotions reveal about your thoughts. (For example, if you’re feeling anxious, what’s the source of that anxiety? Identify it. Then, consider whether your anxiety will do anything to improve the situation.)nnUse the space below to identify an emotion and analyze its cause(s) and effect(s).

The Stoics also believed in living virtuously. Consider how you might motivate yourself to live in a way that’s consistent with your deeply held beliefs, like Marcus Aurelius. He reminded himself that other people depended on him to do what was right even if he didn’t feel like it. In the space below, express _one_ of your most deeply held beliefs in a concise statement. (For example: “All living things have value.”) Expressing your belief in writing can draw your attention to it and renew your motivation.
