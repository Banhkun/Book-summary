## Exercise: Become a Change Leader

Think about how to successfully transform your organization.

* * *

Have you ever had to play a role in shaping and directing an organizational change effort? This might include a large organization like a firm, but it could also include a smaller group like a family, a class, or a group of friends. Describe the experience.

How did you introduce the change to the group?

Were people in the organization receptive to change or was there resistance? Explain what happened.

What were the biggest implementation challenges you encountered? How were they resolved?
