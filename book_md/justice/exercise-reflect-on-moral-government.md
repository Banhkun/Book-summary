## Exercise: Reflect on Moral Government

Consider your own perspective on the role of a just and moral government.

* * *

What’s more important for the government to emphasize: freedom or welfare? Is it possible for the government to do both? Explain your answer.

Should the government uphold specific moral codes and beliefs? Explain why or why not. If you think the government _should_ uphold certain moral codes and beliefs, how should it decide _which_ beliefs to uphold?

What do you think influences your beliefs more: the communities you’re part of, or your own individual thoughts, personality, and experiences? Explain your answer.
