## Month 10: Cultivate Mindfulness

This month, we’ll focus on cultivating mindfulness and being fully aware of and engaged with the present—this practice can boost your happiness in three significant ways.

  * Being present helps you better appreciate what you have. Additionally, a deeper awareness of the present makes it more vivid. 
  * Mindfulness can help you break bad habits that are the source of unhappy feelings such as guilt or resentment. 
  * Mindfulness can elevate mood by lowering your stress levels, making you less defensive, and engaging you more with the people and events around you.



One of the most well-known ways to work on mindfulness is meditation—and while this may work for you, Rubin found that there were two resolutions that better helped her cultivate her mindfulness: to question her world and to change her behaviors in order to change her mindset.

### Question Your World

Asking questions about the world around you and the world you’ve constructed in your mind interrupts the automatic thought processes that cause you to pass through life disengaged.

#### Question the World Around You: Ponder Paradoxes

The first way to get your mind working in new ways is to contemplate questions and ideas that logic can’t answer. Buddhist monks call these questions _koans_ , and they contemplate them as a way to stop relying on reason and logic in the journey toward enlightenment. While adding this practice to your happiness project may not help you achieve enlightenment, it _will_ help you think in new, imaginative ways that help you look at your world with a bit more curiosity and flexibility of logic. In quiet moments, dedicate yourself to finding questions and phrases that you can’t use reasoning and logic to answer: What is the sound of one hand clapping? If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

#### Question the World You’ve Constructed: The Rules You Live By

The second way to get your mind working in a new way is to rethink the “rules” you’ve adopted in your life. These rules are called _heuristics_ —we use them as back-of-the-mind guidelines to help us quickly make decisions and find solutions to problems. Often, we don’t question our rules because we believe they’re inherently true. **A good way to cultivate mindfulness and “wake up” in your life is to occasionally examine the rules you’ve set for yourself.**

This is an important exercise because it grants you a deeper understanding of how you might unconsciously be pushing yourself away from happiness. Instead of acting on autopilot and applying your rules indiscriminately, this reflection lets you take a moment to remember your values and goals and ensure your thoughts and intentions are aligned.

**Examine the rules that you unthinkingly apply to your life.** For example, “My children are my first priority,” “Never go to bed angry,” “Better safe than sorry,” and so on. Ask yourself: Are they true? Are they helpful? Are they creating unhappiness? **Discarding the rules that don’t work in line with your values and goals is helpful for several reasons.**

  * Your rules can mislead you, causing you to draw conclusions that don’t make sense, are unlikely, or unnecessarily create negative emotions. For example, one of your rules might be, “Dogs are dangerous” because you once saw a news story about a dog attack. A dog attack is unlikely, but your rule keeps you in a state of unnecessary fear. 
  * Some rules may have worked for your happiness before, but no longer work for you. For example, “Do whatever makes for the better story” may have been a great rule to live by in your early 20s, but now it doesn’t make sense for you. You’ll be happier with making more responsible decisions that will help build the stable life you’re now looking for.
  * You’ll find that some of your rules are contradictory. For example, one of your rules might be, “If it makes you happy, buy it,” while another is, “Don’t make unnecessary purchases.” Once you see the contradiction, you can make a new rule that compromises between the two. 



Once you’ve weeded out your unhelpful rules, you have adequate space to create rules that _do_ help you in pursuit of your happiness goals. For example, Rubin came up with two new rules:

  * “Groups get more done.” This cultivates happiness because it pushes her to seek out connections and work with others. 
  * “If it didn’t work out, it wasn’t for you.” This cultivates happiness because it helps maintain a positive mindset when things don’t go her way. 



### Change Your Mind by Changing Your Behaviors

The second part of cultivating mindfulness is changing your behaviors in ways that will help you become more engaged with and aware of the world around you.

#### Awaken Dormant Parts of Your Mind

Taking part in activities that make your brain work in new, unusual ways stops you from living on autopilot and forces you to become more aware of your surroundings. There are a couple of ways you could add these “wake-up calls” to your day.

##### Wake-Up Call #1: Create physical reminders of your goals.

Each time you encounter one of your reminders, you’ll be prompted to reflect on your ambitions and how you’re working toward them. For example, Rubin put her resolutions on sticky notes around her apartment, and one of her blog readers changed all her login passwords to goals she was working toward, so she’d be reminded of them throughout the workday.

##### Wake-Up Call #2: Try a new way of thinking about your habits.

Rubin tried hypnosis as a way to change her patterns and habits. While she didn’t find that it was all it was advertised to be, she found that the exercise heightened her awareness of her mindless habits. Your method of reflecting on your habits can take any form—perhaps you perform a daily recitation of your habits to break, start a journal of your habits and desires to break them, or mediate with a recording like Rubin’s.

##### Wake-Up Call #3: Try a new activity.

Get involved in things outside the scope of your everyday activities—for example, a writer might try painting instead of journaling, or a photographer might try writing. This step is especially effective if you get involved in something you know you enjoy, but haven’t participated in for a long time—this wakes up a dormant part of your mind. There are two awareness-boosting benefits of this exercise.

  * First, because this activity is far from the work you’re used to, you likely won’t be good at it and can’t expect a productive or lucrative outcome. This helps you develop a sense of _non-judgmental awareness_ —that is, the ability to be fully engaged in the moment without criticism. 
  * Second, new activities get you outside your normal schedule and often into a new neighborhood among new people. This disrupts your “autopilot” self, promoting you to look at the world a bit differently and within the context of new experiences. This makes the present moment more vivid and engages you fully within it. 



#### Track Actions You Want to Be Mindful Of

**Lastly, stay mindful of habits you want to break _and_ habits you want to form by journaling. **In this journal, you should jot down each experience of the habit, as well as the details of your mood surrounding it. For example, if you want to exercise more, your journal would include your exercise habits, as well as a note about your mood before and after exercising, the excuses you come up with _not_ to exercise, types of exercise you enjoy, and so on. You don’t need to be fastidious with your journaling—simply thinking about your habits _sometimes_ is a big step up from not thinking about them at all.

Being aware of your patterns around your habit makes it much easier to quit or to stick with. You see clearly how your habit affects your mood, recognize the excuses or justifications you’re likely to use and are reminded of the progress you’re making.
