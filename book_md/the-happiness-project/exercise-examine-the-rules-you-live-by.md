## Exercise: Examine the Rules You Live By

Everyone makes autopilot decisions based on “rules” they’ve adopted throughout their lives—awaken your mind by questioning these rules.

* * *

Describe two or three of the rules you live by. (For example, “Never go to bed angry,” “Do whatever makes for the better story,” “Growth in my career is the most important thing.”)

How do these rules contradict or support your happiness journey? (For example, “Never go to bed angry” contradicts your knowledge that you and your spouse can more productively resolve an argument after you’ve both had a night to sleep on it.)

What new rules can you create for yourself that better support your current values and goals? (For example, “Don’t let arguments drag on” might be a better rule for your relationship with your spouse.)
