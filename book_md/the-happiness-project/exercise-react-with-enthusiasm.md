## Exercise: React With Enthusiasm

Being more positive about experiences not only lifts your mood, but also the moods of those around you.

* * *

Describe an experience that you reacted to unenthusiastically. (For example, the first time you heard heavy metal or getting _yet another_ scribbled drawing from your child.)

How could you have reacted to this experience more positively? (For example, instead of saying, “This sounds awful!” in response to heavy metal, you might have said, “It’s always interesting to experience a new genre of music.”)
