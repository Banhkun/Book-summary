## Month 12: Putting It All Together and Reflecting on Takeaways

**This month is the “boot camp” of the happiness project, when you try to stick with all of your resolutions, all of the time.** Keep in mind that you likely won’t be able to keep up with all of your resolutions at all times—and that’s okay. There’s an important distinction between _goals_ and _resolutions._

_Goals_ are finished once they’re achieved. And, it’s implied that anything besides achievement is a type of failure. On the other hand, _resolutions_ —which we use in the happiness project—don’t have an end point. They’re a commitment to making an effort, each day. **Rubin notes that having a visual resolution chart was _the_ singular most important factor in sticking with her resolutions all year. **They reminded her that her happiness is an ongoing effort, and kept her progress and objectives at the forefront of her mind. Even with a chart to spur you on, some days will see you giving less effort than others—but that doesn’t signify failure. Every day is a new opportunity to put effort into sticking with your resolutions.

Some days, your efforts will be better than other days. But, overall, this month will show you how much growth you’ve made over the year. By this point, you’ll find that even the days when you’re not fully committed to your resolutions are happy days because your baseline happiness is higher, you bounce back from bad moods quicker, and you’re living a more enhanced and connected version of your everyday life.

**Happiness is accessible to anyone—it’s not necessary to make huge changes or have incredible resources at your fingertips. You simply need to be ready to embrace the discomfort (and opportunity) of growth, get to know yourself and what’s _right_ for you, and commit to the hard work of happiness. **
