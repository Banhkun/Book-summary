## Month 5: Explore Play and Leisure

In our busy, ambitious lives, it’s easy to either forget about play completely or only engage in play that feels productive in some way. **This month is about focusing on leisure activities that are done purely for enjoyment and because you _want_ to do them—not because of their “productive” factor, money-making potential, or prestige. **We’ll focus first on _seeking_ more fun, and then we’ll explore the ways you can _draw out_ more fun from your everyday life.

### Seeking Out Challenging Fun

**In this chapter, we’ll focus on _challenging fun_ that helps you learn and master skills. **This type of fun is demanding but is rewarding because it creates a feeling of significant growth. It looks like teaching yourself a new instrument or training for a marathon.

#### Seek Out More of What’s Fun for _You_

It’s very possible that you’re not sure how you have fun—**many people go through life participating in activities that they _think_ they should enjoy instead of activities they _actually_ enjoy**. We do this with the goal of projecting a certain image of ourselves, and it’s an easy way to get sucked into activities that don’t feel good or right for us.

There are three parts to creating more opportunities for genuine fun.

  * **First, run through the ways you seek fun in your everyday life.** For each activity, ask yourself: Do I look forward to doing this activity? Does it make me feel energized or drained? These questions will help you separate activities you truly enjoy from activities you’re doing simply because you feel that you should.
  * **Second, think of new ways to have fun**. If you’re having trouble coming up with ideas, try**** writing down the ways you remember having fun as a child**.** It’s likely that what was fun for you at a time when productivity wasn’t a concern will still be fun for you now. 
  * **Third, embrace your idea of fun and announce it to others.** When you talk about your interests, you’re more likely to connect with like-minded people than if you kept your interests to yourself. For example, Rubin has a passion for reading children’s literature but used to feel it wasn’t “legitimate” enough to talk about. Once she and a friend spoke about their mutual interest in children’s literature, they were able to create a children’s literature book club and add genuinely fun meetings to their lives. 



An added benefit of talking openly about your interests is that you find “your people.” **Research shows that _each_ common interest you have with a person not only increases your chances of having a lasting relationship with them but also boosts your overall life satisfaction by 2%. **Furthermore, the feeling of belonging to a group bolsters your confidence and your happiness.

##### Make Time for It

Fun activities often aren’t spontaneous—book clubs don’t just _happen_. **To have more fun, actively work on making time for it.**

A commitment to fun is important to keep in mind because it’s easy to put off leisure activities in favor of productive activity, such as working, spending time with your family, or taking care of the house. However, dedicating time to leisure gives you the energy to bring your best self to the things you “should” do. On the other hand, working nonstop and _only_ doing productive activities will make you feel burned out, resentful, or too tired to fully engage.

##### Accept Your Limits

One of the toughest parts of identifying your fun is accepting that you can’t do everything, and you won’t __ naturally be interested in everything you wish you were interested in. Grappling with this idea can be hard and discouraging. **But, the good news is, once you clear this “aspirational clutter” from your mind, you create space for the things you truly care about and want to engage in wholeheartedly.**

#### Look Outside Your Regular Channels

A good way to expand the limits of your leisure is to actively look for new experiences, new ways of thinking, new places, and new connections—all of which may lead you to a new hobby you hadn’t considered, and force you to focus on experimentation and failing. Rubin tried two methods to force a change of perspective.

  * **Keep an interest log.** Rubin carried a notebook with her and wrote down everything that captured her interest. She then used this information to go on research tangents or look into new activities. You might find your own method such as collecting free maps where you can mark points of interest, or snapping photos of things you want to look into later.
  * **Purposely encounter unfamiliar information.** Rubin bought three magazines at random each week and read them cover to cover—this was a simple way to come across new ideas. You might do this by reading sections of the newspaper you usually skip, listening to new podcasts, or looking up at buildings instead of at the ground when you’re walking around. 



### Put Fun Into Small Moments

Finding a new, challenging hobby is a sizable undertaking, and will take most of your focus this month. Keep in mind, however, that it’s also important to bring fun into the small moments that make up your days. There are two ways to commit yourself to “small fun.”

#### Allow Time for Goofiness

Many people, consciously or unconsciously, shut down goofiness when they’re trying to get things done efficiently—even when there’s no time pressure or reason to be efficient. This happens at all points of the day, such as bathtime, when you’re cleaning up the house, or Saturday morning breakfast. When you find yourself shutting down play in the interest of unnecessary efficiency, adjust your attitude by asking yourself two questions.

  * Does this _need_ to be done now?
  * Can we spare a couple of moments to be goofy? 



This exercise prevents you from unnecessary nagging and arguing. And, it boosts _everyone’s_ mood due to “emotional contagion”—the way we subconsciously pick up on one another’s moods. When you’re goofy instead of frustrated or hurried, others will mirror your good mood—compounding everyone’s happiness.

#### Add Purpose to Play

Adding a small sense of purpose to a leisure activity can help you commit more of your time and attention to it. Rubin did this by starting a collection of bluebird figurines—building a collection added a sense of excitement and purpose to the time she spent wandering around and prompted her to encounter new places.

Starting a collection might not be for you, but there are plenty of other ways to transform your leisure time into a fun, purposeful quest. For example, you might take up architecture drawing, dedicate yourself to finding your city’s best pizza, or try out breweries within biking distance.

Beyond adding a new way to have fun in your life, these missions take you to new places and help refresh your mind, which can recharge you for large, mentally draining tasks. In this sense, simply having fun can actually boost your productivity.
