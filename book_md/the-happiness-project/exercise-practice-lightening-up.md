## Exercise: Practice Lightening Up

Finding ways to be lighter about the everyday annoyances of parenthood goes a long way to boosting both your mood and your kids’ moods.

* * *

Describe an unpleasant task that you and your kids have to get through regularly. (For example, waking up in the morning before school, or doing chores before dinner.)

How can you “lighten up” this task? (For example, playing your kids’ favorite song in the morning, or making a fun competition out of chores.)

Describe a parenting obligation that you don’t often feel like doing. (For example, driving your daughter to soccer practice, or needing to bake cookies for your son’s band bake sale.)

How can you reframe your thinking around this obligation and find positivity in it? (For example, “I love seeing my daughter have fun with her friends at soccer,” or, “I’m glad I have a simple way to help my son with something that means so much to him.”)
