## Month 8: Contemplate Life’s Larger Meaning

Whether you’re religious or not, it’s important to explore various “spiritual states” to augment your happiness—these states include awe, mindfulness, gratitude, and even reflection on death. Research shows that spiritual people—that is, people who spend time considering these spiritual states—are happier with their lives overall. **In turn, this elevated happiness grants them better mental and physical health, greater longevity, and an increased ability to deal with stress and setbacks.**

This month’s practices will help you cultivate a _deeper_ happiness that often is hard to recognize in our day-to-day lives. This deeper happiness includes a sense of gratitude for what you have, the recognition that your life as it is deserves appreciation, and the ability to focus on others’ happiness above your own. There are two significant ways to cultivate your spiritual happiness: seeking reminders of your good fortune and adopting a spiritual guide.

### Seek Out Reminders of Your Good Fortune

Like most people, you may take your everyday life for granted, thinking that nothing can disturb your reality. Unfortunately, major life changes and catastrophe can happen to anyone, at any time. **It’s often only in reflecting from the new perspective that catastrophe grants you that you realize just how good your life is, just as it is now.** There are three ways to train yourself to be more attuned to the good fortune of your everyday life.

#### Good Fortune Reminder #1: Examining Reminders of Life’s Fragility

Perhaps paradoxically, thinking about death and catastrophe can contribute to your happiness, as it adjusts your perspective and helps you realize how good your life is now, just as it is. This practice helps you deal with life’s difficulties in both small and large ways.

  * First, you more easily gloss over the minor setbacks and irritations of everyday life when you recognize your fortune in them. For example, instead of thinking, “My kids have way too much energy today,” you might think, “I’m grateful that my kids are healthy enough to run around the house.”
  * Second, when you inevitably encounter catastrophe or loss you’ll have a greater mental strength to move forward and take key lessons from the experience. 



There are many ways to examine loss and catastrophe—Rubin found that reading memoirs of those who had experienced terminal illnesses, devastating injuries, addictions, and death worked for her. In reading these memoirs, she found a renewed gratitude for her everyday life, as well as an appreciation of its _fragility._

Your contemplation of life’s fragility might not take the same form as Rubin’s. For example, if you’ve experienced a life-threatening illness, you probably won’t want to read accounts of others who have been through the same experience.**For this reason, it’s important to do some exploring to figure out what helps you contemplate the process of life and death in your own way.** For example, you might go hiking in different seasons to contemplate the cycle of life and death; watch documentaries that show the brutality of nature; study religious accounts of life and death; read obituaries; visit graveyards; and so on.

Adopting this practice comes with a few key lessons that will help you make the most of your life just as it is.****

  * **First, you’ll learn the importance of simply _being present_. **Take some time to reflect on present moments and realize what you might be taking for granted. 
    * One way to accomplish this is to try journaling. If you can’t commit to a full journal entry each day, try a one-line journal in which you write down the small things you’re likely to forget, such as a funny habit your child picked up or a nice chat with your mom. Years fly by in the blink of an eye—noting small, joyful moments of the present is a great way to capture and reflect on the “goodness” of your life before it passes by.
  * **Second, it serves as a reminder to get your affairs in order.** This can feel like a morbid and sad task. However, there are a few ways to find happiness in the experience. 
    * Think of the type of “happiness” you’re creating for your loved ones who won’t have to deal with your logistics in a time of immense stress. 
    * Choose a day of the year to go over your affairs with your loved ones and frame it as a reflection on “family responsibility.” Use this day to recognize and celebrate that you and your loved ones _are_ still here with you. 



#### Good Fortune Reminder #2: Creating a Gratitude Log

Another way to cultivate an appreciation for your life is to keep a gratitude log. Your log can take any form that feels right to you—a journal, a blog, or a short video each day. Consistently working on your gratitude is an important contributor to happiness for a number of reasons.

  * Recognizing the good in your life gives you a higher level of life satisfaction. 
  * It makes you less envious of others because you’re focused on what you _do_ have instead of envying what others have. Additionally, being less envious means you live within your means, which allows you to be more generous toward others. 
  * It makes you more forgiving. When you’re grateful for someone, it’s more difficult to feel angry or resentful toward them. 
  * It improves your connection to nature, which is often taken for granted but snaps into focus when you’re consciously working on appreciating its place in your life. 



##### Gratitude Log Creation and Maintenance

Start out with the basic process of listing three things each day that you’re grateful for. While making these lists, be sure you’re paying attention to the small, basic things you’re taking for granted or problems that you don’t think about because you don’t have them. For example, you might express gratitude for running water, healthy children, not living in a war zone, never having to do high school over again, and so on.

As you get further into this practice you’ll likely find that you need to adjust your methods to fit your preferences.

  * You may find that logging your gratitude less frequently—a few times a week, for example—instead of every day keeps the task from becoming a meaningless burden.
  * You may give up your physical log and instead dedicate a specific moment of your day to gratitude reflection—such as while you’re lying in bed, during your morning commute, or over your morning cup of coffee. 



#### Good Fortune Reminder #3: Reframing

At times, you may need to force yourself into a moment of gratitude. When you’re feeling annoyed or overwhelmed by a task, stop yourself and search for a way to express gratitude for the experience. For example, if you’re thinking, “I’m tired and don’t want to cook dinner for the kids tonight,” you might try, “I’m grateful that I have enough food in the house to pull together a meal.”

### Adopt a Spiritual Guide

On top of working on teaching yourself to be grateful and present, you can become more disciplined in your happiness journey by finding a “spiritual guide” to look up to. This guide can be _anyone_ who speaks to you—a favorite writer such as Mary Oliver or Thoreau, an artist such as Van Gogh or Monet, a scientific figure like Darwin, or a religious figure like St. Francis.

For example, Rubin chose St. Thérèse de Lisieux, who achieved happiness for herself and others by dedicating herself to perfecting small tasks and appearing as happy as possible. Your guide doesn’t have to have heroic or publicized virtue—they just need to have virtues that you seek to achieve yourself.

#### Why Does Happiness Need a Guide?

**Having a spiritual guide to emulate is important because happiness is _hard work_ , and their guidance can help you stay on track. **Reflection on their journeys and how they stuck to their values can help guide you through the common excuses that many people use to remain in the easy state of unhappiness.

  * **Excuse #1: Happiness isn’t an admirable goal, as it shows a lack of depth.** People who believe this think that unhappiness shows that you are pensive and care about “real” issues such as children living in poverty or world hunger. They think that the search for happiness is selfish and useless. However, these people contradict themselves—broken down, their goals are based on giving people the basic health and safety that allows happiness. 
  * **Excuse #2: Happiness suggests naivete or a lack of intellect.** While unhappiness is perceived as a source of creativity and deep thought, happiness is often regarded as complacent and unambitious. However, a number of studies have shown that there is _no link_ between happiness and intelligence.
  * **Excuse #3: Pessimism seems nonchalant and cool.** In reality, pessimism isn’t necessarily cool—it’s just an easy stance to default to. On the other hand, enthusiasm takes a great deal of effort and energy, which is far more interesting. 
  * **Excuse #4: Unhappiness allows you to maintain distance between yourself and your choices.** Many people use complaints and criticism to keep themselves at arms’ length from things they’re embarrassed to admit their interest in. For example, if you complain endlessly about reality TV stars’ drama, it’s clear that you actually watch reality TV and read gossip magazines. 
  * **Excuse #5: Unhappiness can be used to control and manipulate others.** In some cases, you might wield your unhappiness as a weapon, using it to guilt people into what you want them to do. For example, whenever you tell your parents you don’t want to do something, they remind you that they worked opposite shifts for years to support you and your siblings. They remind you of their sacrifice to make you feel guilty and obligated to do whatever they ask. 
  * **Excuse #6: Acknowledging and celebrating happiness is a way to “jinx” it.** Some people believe that the expression of gratitude for your good fortune somehow tempts the universe to take it away from you—but all this achieves is a fear of being present and fully appreciating what you have. 
  * **Excuse #7: Worrying prevents bad things from happening.** Some people indulge in excessive worrying in an attempt to control what happens to them—but it’s important to recognize that worrying _doesn’t change reality_. What will happen, will happen, regardless of your anxiety about it. Not only is worrying useless, but it also makes you and the people around you unhappier. 



Of course, the excuses people give to bask in unhappiness don’t apply to those who struggle with mental illness, such as depression—that’s a different type of unhappiness outside of conscious choice.
