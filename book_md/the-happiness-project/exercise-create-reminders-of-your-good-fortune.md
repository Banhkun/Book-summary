## Exercise: Create Reminders of Your Good Fortune

Consistently reminding yourself of how fortunate you are in your ordinary life goes a long way toward increasing your overall life satisfaction.

* * *

Describe a practice you can adopt to consistently examine the fragility of life. (For example, reading memoirs of people touched by catastrophe, or spending time in nature throughout the seasons to consider the cycle of life and death.)

How can you create a regular gratitude practice in your everyday life? (For example, starting a gratitude journal, or spending five minutes reflecting on your gratitude when you have your first cup of coffee in the morning.)

Describe a mundane task that you don’t particularly enjoy. (For example, going to parent-teacher conferences, or your daily commute on the subway.)

How can you reframe your thinking to force gratitude for this task? (For example, “I’m happy that my son’s teacher cares about him and loves sharing his progress with us.” Or, “I love the experience of people-watching during my commute.”)
