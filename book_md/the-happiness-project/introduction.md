## Introduction: What Is a Happiness Project?

Author Gretchen Rubin spent a year examining how to become happier in her everyday life, by making resolutions to improve different areas of her life in small ways each month—a practice she calls a “happiness project.” **She explains how you can create your own happiness project, a journey to become happier in your everyday life by focusing on happiness that already exists in your life.** You don’t need to be _unhappy_ to start a happiness project—it’s for anyone who wants to appreciate the joys of their life a little more. Choosing to boost your happiness comes with a number of benefits:

  * It increases your day-to-day gratitude. 
  * It pushes you to set a better standard for yourself in all aspects of your life. 
  * It boosts the happiness of the people whose lives you touch, such as your spouse, your children, your colleagues, and so on. 
  * It helps you transcend everyday negativity and you’ll spend less time dwelling on what makes you unhappy.
  * It helps prepare you for darker days—you can cope with adversity better when you have an arsenal of methods for recovering from setbacks. 



There are two main principles to keep in mind as you move through this book, explore Gretchen Rubin’s personal happiness project, and make plans to build your own happiness project.

  1. **A happiness project is _not_ about making grand changes to your life à la _Eat, Pray, Love_. It’s about rethinking the moments you already live and looking at your familiar surroundings with new eyes.**
  2. Happiness looks a little different to everyone—your project will be unique to you. The project we’ll discuss should act as a guide around which you build your own resolutions and ideas. 



### Essential Ideas to Return To

There are a number of key ideas to keep in mind throughout your happiness project—commandments that will keep you on track, mantras that will help you commit to the work of happiness, and truths that should help determine your focus.

#### The Ten Commandments

Rubin suggests coming up with your “Ten Commandments.” These are your personal values that will help you stay on track when your resolutions feel insurmountable or you feel tempted to give up on your commitment to your project. Your commandments might include ideas such as be yourself; enjoy the process; do the right thing; be polite; don’t keep score; and so on.

#### The Mantras of the Happiness Project

Mantras will help you commit to risks, act in line with who you _really_ are, and remember what all your work is for.

  * **What works for other people might not work for me, and vice versa.** This mantra will help you act in ways that benefit _you_ —whether it’s in finding a new exercise routine, deciding on a passion to explore, or learning to communicate better with your spouse. 
  * **You notice your mistakes more than other people do.** When you’re afraid of trying something new or failing, keep this mantra in mind. 
  * **Happiness doesn’t always feel good.** Throughout your project, you’ll repeatedly discover that enduring the discomfort of growth is essential to maximizing happiness. 
  * **Done is better than perfect**. Perfection is impossible and trying to achieve it will only make you frustrated and unhappy. Commit to seeing your resolutions through, instead of doing them flawlessly. 
  * **If you do good, you’ll feel good.** When you’re not in the mood to work on any of your resolutions, keep this mantra in mind and remember that you’ll often feel better once you take even a small action toward your resolutions.



#### The Four Truths of Happiness

Rubin has four “splendid truths” about happiness that help you understand what happiness _is_ —which can inform how you come up with your own resolutions and shape your happiness project.

**1) Happiness relies on an understanding of what makes you feel good, what makes you feel bad, what makes you feel “right,” and pursuit of growth.** While it’s common sense that you want to do more of what feels good and less of what feels bad, you also need to make sure what you’re doing feels right for you. For example, you might _enjoy_ your teaching career, but you might find that a writing career is what’s _right_ for you.

Furthermore, humans need to grow in order to bring purpose to their lives. This is because we adapt very quickly to our surroundings—when we attain something we want, the happiness of the item wears off quickly as we adapt to its presence. We become bored and dissatisfied once again. Finding new ways to grow within your life—such as working on ongoing projects, mastering skills, and striving for recognition—breaks that cycle.

**2) Making other people happy is one of the best ways to make yourself happy—and when you’re happy, you naturally make others happy.** In this way, creating happiness is a cycle that naturally furthers itself. This means that striving for personal happiness isn’t as selfish as it seems because you’re also spreading happiness to others and improving their lives by doing so.

**3) Your days might drag on, but your years will fly by.** Focus your happiness project on finding more ways to enjoy the everyday events of your life—they become a forgotten memory of the past much quicker than you think.

**4) Your happiness depends less on your circumstances than on how you perceive those circumstances.** If you think you’re happy, it’s likely that you are. If you believe you’re unhappy, it’s likely that you’ll be unhappy. This is why questioning your happiness in different parts of your life and finding ways to find more happiness is important. It helps you discover the many ways that you _are_ happy and urges you to invest time in the things that need a boost.

#### 12 Months of Happiness

The happiness project is broken down into months—first, because it’s easier to stick with goals when they’re broken down into specific actions, and second, because having your resolutions “scheduled” serves as a constant reminder for your unconscious mind to latch onto. **We’ll go through a one-year project, each month focusing on a new area in your life where you can adopt new behaviors and explore ways to make the happiness project your own.**
