## Exercise: Practice Expressing Complaints More Positively

It’s tempting to unload all your annoyances and complaints onto your partner at the end of the day, but this can drag both of you down. Practice reframing and lightening the conversation.

* * *

What is an annoyance or complaint that you find yourself dumping on your partner frequently? (For example, your boss’s unreasonable timelines or your sister-in-law’s overuse of social media.)

How do you usually talk about this complaint to your partner? (For example, “I hate how much time Rachel spends on Facebook. Doesn’t she have anything better to do?”)

How can you reframe the way you talk about this complaint to be more positive? (For example, “Rachel posted another photo of her trip. It’s nice to see what’s going on with her.”)
