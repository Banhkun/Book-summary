## 1-Page Summary

_Oversubscribed_ is a business guide that starts with an unusual premise: **Get more people interested in your product or service than you could possibly serve,** and don’t start selling it until that happens. In other words, minimize the risk and maximize the profit of running a business by leveraging supply and demand—ensure that there’s always more demand than supply, and you’re practically guaranteed to make a profit. The rest of the book teaches you how to attract that level of demand.

Daniel Priestley is a serial entrepreneur who’s founded several multi-million dollar businesses around the world, as well as cofounding Dent Global, which offers entrepreneurial training programs. He’s also the author of four bestselling books for entrepreneurs; _Oversubscribed_ is the most popular of these. Enterprise Nation named Priestley one of the UK’s top ten business advisors in 2018.

Our guide divides Priestley’s ideas into two main categories. First, we’ll discuss why and how you should build demand for your products before starting to sell them. Then, we’ll explore Priestley’s instructions for how to run a successful marketing campaign.

Our commentary will expand on Priestley’s ideas by comparing and contrasting them with the ideas in other influential business books, such as Seth Godin’s _Purple Cow _and Salim Ismail’s _Exponential Organizations_. We’ll also offer some actionable ideas to help you get started with your business, such as how to create remarkable products that will get people talking about your company.

### Create More Demand Than You Can Meet

In this section, we’ll examine the foundational lesson of _Oversubscribed:_ Attract more customers than you can serve to maximize your profits. We’ll also explore the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising and explain how you can get people talking about your business, as Priestley believes this is the single most effective way to market a product and thus create demand.

(Shortform note: The advice Priestley gives in this book is equally applicable to physical products and services. For brevity’s sake, we’ll refer to these collectively as “products.”)

#### The Core Message: Exploit the Law of Supply and Demand

As we’ve mentioned, the central idea of _Oversubscribed_ is**to maximize your business’s profits by making sure there’s more demand for your product than you can meet.**

Priestley explains that the law of supply and demand influences the price of a product—the harder something is to get, the more that thing costs. So, if there’s more demand than supply for a product, you can charge high prices for it, thereby making a significant profit.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Priestley, some business experts believe that the law of supply and demand is becoming outdated. For example, in _Exponential Organizations, _Salim Ismail says that the most successful modern companies are those that profit from information, a resource with an unlimited supply. Since in this scenario the demand can never exceed the supply, a company that profits from information can’t follow Priestley’s advice. However, these companies still manage to turn a profit: Some use personal information to perfectly tailor their products and advertisements to their customers, while others (most notably social media companies) directly gather and sell such information.)

Furthermore, _demand breeds demand:_ people are more likely to want something that’s very popular and hard to get. Therefore, make sure to continue advertising even after customer demand exceeds your supply.

(Shortform note: According to psychology research, wanting what’s hard to get is a common phenomenon. In short, it happens because your brain releases dopamine when you work toward a goal—and the harder that goal is to achieve (in this case, acquiring something that’s hard to get), the more dopamine the brain produces. In other words, scarcity works like a drug; in trying to get something rare, you’re really chasing that dopamine high. By following Priestley’s advice to continue advertising even after demand exceeds supply, you ensure that people _continue_ chasing that dopamine high. Your advertising will further increase demand, making your product even _harder_ to get, thereby increasing people’s cravings for it.)

#### Build Demand Through Word-of-Mouth

Since the central theme of _Oversubscribed_ is to have more customers than you can handle, a great deal of the book is devoted to methods of attracting those customers.

First of all, Priestley warns that **mass marketing strategies like commercials and printed advertisements aren’t as effective as they used to be,** largely because people are tired of being advertised to. There are so many companies and products already fighting for people’s attention that mass advertising would turn your product into part of the background noise of modern life, meaning your would-be customers would just tune you out.

(Shortform note: The death of mass marketing has been a theme in business books for quite some time—for example, in Seth Godin’s book _Purple Cow_ (2002), he makes a similar claim that mass marketing strategies don’t work anymore because people are simply overloaded with advertisements. However, many experts disagree with that opinion; some argue that mass marketing is still a key part of an effective marketing strategy because it puts your product in front of as many eyes as possible. Others believe that modern technology like social media will reshape mass marketing and make it more effective than ever, once advertisers perfect information-gathering and targeted advertising techniques.)

Rather than mass marketing, Priestley says that word-of-mouth is the best form of advertisement—**in short, people will buy what their friends are buying.** In fact, word-of-mouth marketing is more effective than ever because social media allows your customers to advertise your company to their connections quickly and easily.

(Shortform note: Whether or not mass marketing is still effective, some research supports Priestley’s claim that word-of-mouth advertising is more effective. According to Nielsen, one of the biggest names in media research and data collection, over 90% of people trust suggestions from friends and family members more than they trust any other type of advertising. Furthermore, customers who are referred by a family member, friend, or peer (through social media, for instance) spend, on average, twice as much as those who find a company through regular ads.)

The rest of this section will explore different ways to get people talking about your company.

##### Method 1: Differentiate Yourself

Priestley says that the best way to get people talking about you is to be unusual or remarkable in some way; in other words, find a way to stand out from the crowd and attract people’s attention. Here, we’ll discuss three ways to attract that attention.

First, **the most effective way to stand out is to offer something truly unique** —if you have no competition, then you won’t need to vie for people’s attention in the first place.**** If that’s the case, you can build a strong customer base before imitators start pushing their way into the market.

> **Unique Products Come From Extremes**
> 
> If your goal is to create something unique and remarkable, don’t try to make something “good,” meaning a product with broad appeal that everyone will want to buy. As Seth Godin explains in _Purple Cow_ , any “good” product you come up with almost certainly exists already.
> 
> Instead, Godin encourages you to go the opposite direction: **Brainstorm what extremes you could take your product to, regardless of how popular you think it will be.** For example, a very spicy candy bar (an extreme flavor) won’t be as popular as regular milk chocolate, but you won’t have to compete with established brands like Hershey’s. Some other possible extremes are quality, price, and product appearance.
> 
> Godin adds that once you have an idea, _don’t compromise on it._ Any kind of compromise is almost certainly going to push you back toward “good”—an unremarkable product that most likely already exists.

Second, if you can’t create a unique product, then you’ll need to give yourself an edge over your competitors. One strategy is to undercut their prices;**if you can provide similar products at a lower price than your rivals, people will tend to favor your company.** IKEA uses this strategy—by selling disassembled furniture that’s easy to pack and transport, IKEA saves money on shipping and therefore can sell its products at lower prices than other furniture companies.

(Shortform note: In _Purple Cow, _Godin warns that having a low cost isn’t a good way to stand out, especially for a new or small company—larger competitors that can afford to sell at a loss will always win the price war. The one exception to this guideline is if you have some innovation in your production process, like IKEA does, that significantly reduces your overhead costs.)

**A third way of attracting attention is to offer a product that’s more convenient than the current options.** For example, streaming services have largely replaced cable TV because streaming allows you to watch what you want, when you want, instead of having to follow a network’s schedule.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, making a more convenient product doesn’t require overhauling the product itself, just changing how people use it. For example, in _Purple Cow_ , Godin explains how Schindler Elevator Corporation dominated the market by improving how people interact with elevators: Rather than simply making elevators bigger or faster, Schindler integrated a computer into its elevators that calculates the most efficient way to get all the passengers to their destinations, then tells them which elevator to take.)

##### Method 2: Advertise Your Company, Not Just Your Products

Almost any popular product—no matter how innovative—will soon face competition from imitators and cheap knockoffs. Therefore, you need a customer base that’s loyal to your _company_ , not just to your products.

Priestly says that you can **create a market niche and build brand loyalty by carefully designing your company’s image,** and he offers a few tips for doing so.

First of all, advertise your _company values_. Make it clear that your company stands for a good cause and you’ll attract customers who also support that cause. For example, you could advertise that a certain percentage of your profits go toward a particular charity, or that you pay your employees well and encourage a healthy work-life balance.

Second, focus on good customer service. **Remember that you’re not just making a sale, you’re building a relationship;** you want repeat customers that advertise your company to their friends. Priestley suggests using customer surveys to gauge the strength of your customer service and learn what you could improve.

> **In Other Words: Build a Tribe**
> 
> In this section, Priestley is suggesting that you create what Seth Godin calls a tribe around your new company. In _Tribes,_ Godin explains that a tribe is a particular type of social group whose members have three things in common:
> 
>   * **A leader.** In this case, you’re the leader—as the head of your company, you’re the one guiding the group’s interests and actions.
> 
>   * **A shared belief.** A tribe forms around a shared belief and is motivated by that belief. This is why advertising your company values is so important: You’ll form a tribe of people who share your values and who therefore support your company as a means of promoting those values.
> 
>   * **Connections to the rest of the group.** This should happen naturally; people who support the same company and buy the same products will discuss their shared experiences and build interpersonal relationships as a result. This is also why you want to focus on good customer service—you want the experiences people share with each other to be positive so that your company has a good reputation.
>

> 
> Elon Musk is an example of someone who built a tribe. In his prime, Musk had millions of fans who shared his vision of the future (the belief) and trusted him (the leader) to make that vision a reality. In fact, Musk’s tribe is so strong that he still has numerous die-hard supporters even after his recent apparent missteps with Twitter.

### Drive Interest With Campaigns

We’ve covered why Priestley wants you to build more demand than you can meet and why he believes that word-of-mouth is the most effective way to do that. But how do you get enough people talking to make your business profitable?

Priestley says that **running a successful business—one with more demand than supply—requires you to be a _campaign manager_ rather than a salesperson.** In other words, he suggests that you connect with large numbers of people at once through special events and mailing lists rather than trying to draw in one customer at a time like a hawker on the street.

In his book, Priestley organizes his method for running a successful marketing campaign into five phases. Here, we’ve organized Priestley’s method into five steps; the first three steps correspond with Priestley’s first three phases. We’ve broken Priestley’s fourth phase (“Sales Follow-Through”) into Steps 4 and 5 to distinguish between _selling_ products (Step 4) and _delivering_ them (Step 5). We’ve also incorporated ideas from Priestley’s fifth phase (“Celebrate and Innovate”) into Step 5.

#### Step 1: Determine Your Supply

Before you even begin your campaign, Priestley says that you need to figure out exactly how much supply you have—in other words, how many customers you can serve and how often. **Only once you know your business’s capacity can you start making plans to exceed it.**

Your answer to this question will largely depend on your business model. For example, if you’re selling handmade clothing, you might only be able to fill a couple of orders each month. On the other hand, if you’re opening a family restaurant, you can serve dozens of customers every day.

(Shortform note: When determining your supply (in other words, your business capacity) make sure you’re taking human limitations into account. For instance, if your planned capacity requires you or your employees to work 60 hours a week, you’re probably being overambitious; you’ll soon find your employees suffering from overwork and fatigue. On a similar note, don’t plan your capacity around everything going perfectly—you’re bound to encounter problems and mistakes, so make sure you’ve left yourself a comfortable buffer rather than assuming you’ll reach your maximum possible production every day.)

#### Step 2: Prime the Market

Now that you know what you’re selling and how much of it you have,**you need to know who you’re selling to _._** What kind of people would you enjoy working with? Would those people want what you’re selling? Can they pay your prices?

For example, maybe you’re offering a rideshare service that would make it easier for low-income families to get around crowded urban areas. However, if you have to charge more than those families can afford, that won’t be a good market for you—you might be better off branding it as a luxury service and targeting a higher income bracket instead.

(Shortform note: When selecting your target market, it’s crucial to research that market instead of making assumptions about it. For example, demographics like the average age and gender of your target market can be just as important as that market’s average income—every piece of information you collect helps you understand what your future customers want and need and how much they’re willing to pay for a product.)

Once you know who your target audience is, let those people know what you’re selling and get them interested in buying from you. Communication is the key here: Priestley says you need to send very clear messages about what you’re offering and why people should want it, as well as providing a way for people to clearly express their interest.

Priestley suggests sending regular newsletters with information about your products and services, upcoming sales and special events, and what you’re working on next. This will help keep your company on people’s minds, and people who sign up for your newsletter are indicating interest in your company.

Aside from a general newsletter, you might offer customers subscriptions for updates about specific products. This maintains the relationship between your business and your customers and also provides a way for customers to show you what they’re interested in—the products that get the most subscriptions are the ones that you should focus on.

(Shortform note: In addition to educating people about your company and your products and helping you gauge people’s interest, newsletters and mailing list subscriptions can help foster a sense of community between your company and your customers—remember the importance of building brand loyalty, which we discussed earlier. For example, you can highlight individual employees, share and celebrate your successes with your customers, and publish personal statements to apologize for missteps or clear up misunderstandings.)

#### Step 3: Reach Critical Mass

As previously noted, the core concept of _Oversubscribed_ is that you should have more demand than you can fulfill; now Priestley clarifies exactly how much interest you should have in your products before you start selling.

Priestley sets three different goals and says that if you’re meeting at least one of them, you’re in good shape to bring your product to market.

**1) If people express strong interest, sell when there’s five times as much engagement as there is product.** Strong interest means a nearly-guaranteed sale, such as preorders and people putting down deposits for your product. So, for example, if you can sell to 10 people at a time and you have 50 preorders, you’ve met this goal.

**2) If people express moderate interest, sell when there’s 10 times as much engagement as there is product.** Moderate interest means that people have gone out of their way to learn about your product and express interest in buying it, such as going to an event or signing up for a mailing list. Again, if you can handle 10 customers at a time, you’ll meet this goal once you get 100 people at this level of engagement.

**3) If people express mild interest, sell when there’s 100 times as much engagement as there is product.** Mild interest suggests that people are curious about your product but not yet invested in it. People at this level of engagement might click on an ad, watch a short video, or download information from your company’s website. If you’re looking to sell to 10 customers at once, you’ll want at least 1,000 people at this level of engagement before moving to the next step of your campaign—making the sale.

> **Save Time and Trouble With Crowdfunding**
> 
> It can be hard to gauge exactly how much interest there is in a product, which may make it hard to apply Priestley’s advice on determining when to start selling. Fortunately, crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter can help you manage this step and the next one (making the sale) simultaneously. Instead of advertising a product, building people’s interest in it, then moving on to sales, you can advertise, know exactly how many people are interested in your product, and make sales at the same time with a preorder campaign.
> 
> As Salim Ismail explains in _Exponential Organizations_ , crowdfunding has other benefits too: Most notably, seeing how many people fund or preorder your product provides valuable market research about what people are (or aren’t) interested in. Also, if your campaign doesn’t perform as well as you hoped, you can cancel it at minimal cost to yourself—you’re only losing the money you spent on advertising—and no cost to your customers, which will help them to keep a positive view of your company.

#### Step 4: Make the Sales

Once you’ve got enough engagement to be confident that your product will succeed, it’s time to actually make the sales. This should be the most straightforward step of the whole process—people are already interested in your company and educated about your product, so at this point, a simple conversation with the customer is all you need.

(Shortform note: Priestley talks at length about having sales conversations with your customers, but that's not always necessary, or even practical. If you provide a relatively inexpensive product or provide a product to many people, then there's no reason to have individual sales conversations with all of them—just let the customers make their purchases and move on. In that case, automating your sales process with tools like chatbots, automated mailing lists, and FAQs will be a much more effective use of your time.)

Despite this step’s simplicity, Priestley says that this is where a lot of new companies stumble. People often feel uncomfortable asking for customers’ personal information and money, so they waste time with small talk and fail to actually close the deal.

Just remember: If you’re having a sales conversation with someone, it’s because that person has already expressed interest in buying your product. In other words, **you and the customer both know that the purpose of the conversation is to collect information and money, so there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable about it** —you can get through this step easily and confidently.

> **How to Have a Sales Conversation**
> 
> Sometimes, people feel uncomfortable leading sales conversations because they’re simply unpracticed or unsure of what they’re doing. If this is something you struggle with, here are a few tips to make sure you’re prepared.
> 
> First, be knowledgeable and confident about your company and your product. Project an air that you know what you’re talking about, that this customer will want this product, and that you’re not just trying to make a sale by any means necessary. **Uncertainty and desperation will drive customers away.**
> 
> Second, make sure it’s an actual conversation—in other words, that you’re having a back-and-forth discussion to **learn what your customer needs and explain how your product will meet that need.** Make sure you’re not just interrogating the client, but also make sure the customer isn’t leading the conversation the entire time; after all, you’re supposed to be the expert.
> 
> In short, any successful sales conversation starts with trust: The customer has to trust that you know what you’re talking about, that you’re not trying to scam or cheat them, and that your product will perform as advertised.

#### Step 5: Keep People Talking

Your work isn’t done just because you’ve made the sales. **When fulfilling orders, Priestley suggests giving your customers more than you promised.** Exceeding your clients’ expectations will excite them and get them talking about your company, making it so the end of one marketing campaign is also the start of the next one. For example, you might include a free sample of another product you sell or send your customers thank-you notes and small gifts.

Note that exceeding expectations doesn’t mean you have to work harder or strain your resources; you can accomplish the same thing by setting customer expectations a little lower at the start. For instance, if you’re prepared to deliver your product in one month, you might tell your clients that they’ll have it in two months—they’ll be very happy when they get it earlier than expected.

(Shortform note: “Underpromise and overdeliver” is popular business advice, but some research suggests that it might not be as helpful as people think. A behavioral study found that, although people were indeed disappointed when others failed to uphold their promises, _exceeding_ those promises didn’t make the test subjects any happier. In short, this study suggests that the best approach is to make the most appealing promises you can live up to—that way, you’ll attract as many customers as possible and those customers will be satisfied with your company.)

Finally, when you start your next advertising campaign, make sure to broadcast how successful your business already is. Remember:**Demand breeds demand, and people want what’s hard to get.**

(Shortform note: Although Priestley is arguably correct that people will be more likely to support a company that’s already proven itself to be successful, make sure to stay humble in your advertising—an arrogant tone could drive away potential customers. In other words, celebrate your victories instead of gloating about them, and make sure to acknowledge that your success is due to your customers, not due to your own “greatness.”)
