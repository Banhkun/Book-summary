## Step 9: Invest Your Capital

In this step, you’ll learn about options for investing your savings and building additional capital.

**This is the culmination of the program—having enough money coming into your life through passive income that paid employment is optional.** It’s not about getting huge amounts of money but about knowing how to invest so that you have enough money for the remainder of your life.

First, we’ll explore some key investing terms and principles. Second, we’ll delve into each of the investment options in more detail.

### Investing Lingo

#### Passive Income

Passive income is another way of saying “investment income”—money you don’t work to earn.

You can earn passive income from investments in five different ways:

  1. **Interest.** If you invest capital in certificates of deposit, bonds, or savings accounts, the money accrues interest over time. 
  2. **Rent.** This is any payment you receive from renting out estate property that you own. It is the money you received, minus any associated expenses, like taxes or repairs.
  3. **Dividends.** You’ll get paid dividends, or a slice of profits, if you’re the owner of a private company, or if you invest in ETFs, stocks, or mutual funds.
  4. **Royalties.** If you own a patent, natural resources, or a franchise, you’ll earn money through royalty payments when others use the property.
  5. **Capital gains.** If you sell stock or real estate, you’ll earn capital gains: earnings from the sale that exceed the money you invested when you purchased it.



#### Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance is your willingness to make risky investments. It’s a spectrum from not wanting to risk any capital to wanting to risk all of your capital in return for large gains.

Your willingness to make risky investments depends on many factors, which include:

  * How you were raised
  * Beliefs about money
  * Age
  * Time horizon—how quickly you expect to need access to your investments.
  * Crossover point—you may take more risks to build wealth quickly ahead of reaching your crossover point (though not in all cases). After your crossover point, you’ll want to invest in less risky instruments to preserve your wealth.



Age and time horizon are the two most significant factors. If you have multiple decades to go until you retire, it’s customary advice to invest 90 percent of your capital in stocks and 10 percent in bonds. Later in life (or if you’re more conservative) you might invest 20 percent in stocks and 80 percent in bonds. **Practicing the steps of this book means you’ll likely err on the more conservative side, because you want to retire early and retain wealth past the crossover point.** Conservatively investing ensures that your monthly investment income is greater than your expenses, no matter the state of the economy.

#### Fees

To avoid incurring lots of fees, choose investment options that aren’t actively managed. Not only do they have lower fees, they generally outperform actively managed options.

#### Financial Advisor

Investing can be time-consuming. A financial advisor is someone who provides expertise and aligns your investments with your risk tolerance as markets shift. Take time to research financial advisors to make sure you get your money’s worth.

#### Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)

Socially Responsible Investing is investing in companies that align with your environmental and social values. It began during the Vietnam War, when people sought to divest from companies supporting the war effort. SRI financial advising services research company practices to ensure that they align with best practices, like paying workers a living wage. Today, SRI investments account for 22 percent of all professionally managed money.

**SRI investments generally match or exceed the return of traditional investments.** However, the research involved generally makes it more expensive than conventional financial advising. If you’re unsure whether to pursue this or standard financial advising, look at the cost difference over the long term and assess if it would be worth it given the quality assurance inherent in SRI.

### Diversifying Your Assets

When the authors first published this book, they advised people to invest primarily in US Treasury bonds, but more recently, the bond interest rate has dropped so far that it’s no longer a high yielding investment.

There are plenty of options for investment beyond treasury bonds. It’s rare that all asset classes, or types of investment instruments, will be growing in value at the same time. **Diversifying, or investing capital in a variety of asset classes, allows you to preserve a steady passive income over time.**

These are the main asset classes:

  * Fixed Income (certificates of deposit, bonds, etc.)
  * Stocks (index funds, mutual funds, etc.)
  * Real Estate
  * Commodities (agricultural products, minerals, oil and natural gas)
  * Foreign Currencies
  * Green Energy
  * Peer-to-Peer Lending



#### Alternative Bonds

Though treasury bonds are not as high-yielding as they used to be, there are 2 other bond options to consider that generally have higher interest rates:

  * Agency bonds: invest in a specific part of the government you care about, like agriculture.
  * Corporate bonds: a bond issued by a corporation.



#### Low-Cost Index Funds

**Low-cost index funds are the go-to option for many seeking financial independence.** They’re designed to follow bond market or stock market indices using passive management. Minimal trading is a built-in, low-cost feature.

Index funds come with combinations of 3 characteristics. Mix and match to diversify your investment portfolio:

  * Stocks or bonds
  * Domestic or international
  * Small, medium, or large



Choosing funds with different sets of characteristics decreases your risk. However, there is always risk. Because stock market funds fluctuate with the market, they’re riskier than bond funds. In the history of the US, there have been multiple major market downturns in which it took decades or more for the market to recover. Young people like investing heavily in stocks but may not realize that they’re putting their capital at risk. Bond funds are less risky—if a crisis hits, you only risk dropping a percent or two.

##### Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

Employers may offer low-cost index funds to help you save for retirement. IRAs (“individual retirement accounts”) often have low-cost index fund options.

If your employer offers a matching program, go for it—you’ll expand how much money you invest.

**You can still enroll in these kinds of funds even if your employer doesn’t offer one.** Opening an account with a company like Vanguard or Fidelity is similar to opening a bank account, but the returns are better.

#### Real Estate

Buying a single-family home or multi-family dwelling is a great investment opportunity. If you rent out part of it and make it your home, your tenants effectively pay you to live there.

The two main downsides to homeownership are that it’s not easy to access the money quickly if needed, and there are considerable costs, like taxes.

Ask these three questions to select an appropriate real estate investment:

  * Do you like the location well enough to consider living there or maintaining the house for the next few years or longer?
  * Is the property value predicted to go up over time?
  * How much in expenses do you expect? This includes taxes, insurance, utilities, etc.



##### A Caveat on House Flipping

Some people like to buy homes, fix them up, and sell them for a higher price. This strategy can work well while you’re building up savings, but isn’t a great long-term investment strategy for financial independence because it’s risky—you can’t always make a profit, and it may drive the gentrification of a neighborhood by selling at a high price that displaces local residents.

#### Local Lending

Connect with organizations that pair investors with small businesses looking for loans. For example, you could lend money to a local bakery and ask for the principal and 5 percent interest back once they’re up and running.

### Step 9: Evaluating Investments

Ask these questions when deciding what to invest in:

  * Does it fit my risk tolerance?
  * Does it fit my values?
  * Does it help diversify my portfolio?
  * How easy is it to buy and sell?
  * Will it offer the income I need?
  * When can I access the income associated with it?
  * Will I have to pay local, state, or federal taxes on the income it produces?
