## Step 6, Part 1: Strategies to Cut Spending

In this chapter, you’ll learn strategies to spend less. To better understand these strategies, we’ll first explore what it means to be frugal. This will help you reframe your thinking around spending money and learn to meet your needs in creative ways.

### The True Meaning of Frugality

A key component of this program is finding fulfillment by spending your life energy—money—on what brings you happiness and learning to live with what is “enough” for you. Learning to practice frugality will help you do this.

**While most people think that frugality means severely restricting your spending, it’s really about enjoying or making use of something—and you don’t have to own things to enjoy them.** Yet people often try to satisfy their desires by buying things. Sometimes we like buying things because of the symbolism of owning them and the approval we get from others. For example, owning a fancy car is symbolic of a successful career. But practicing frugality means being able to enjoy stuff for what it gives you materially, not what it symbolizes to you.

To practice frugality, cultivate a higher joy-to-things ratio. If you enjoy _getting_ things more than _having and using_ things, this could be a sign that you need to improve your joy-to-things ratio. For example, if you have 5 perfectly good pairs of shoes but aren’t excited about wearing any of them, you might derive more enjoyment from getting things than using them. In contrast, if you enjoy wearing all the shoes you own, you buy only what you need and enjoy it to its fullest.

Ideally, take joy in each thing you use. This will help you avoid running toward the next material thing in search of fulfillment.

### Step 6, Part 1: Strategies to Cut Spending

There are 9 general strategies to help you cut how much you spend. In Step 6, Part 2, we’ll look at 11 categories to cut spending from.

#### 1\. Avoid Shopping

As we’ve discussed, we’ve been conditioned to fill immaterial needs with material goods. Thus, when we shop, we feel tempted to buy things, even if we didn’t plan to spend money in the first place.

Here’s how you can shop less:

  * Don’t go shopping when you don’t have anything you plan to buy. Be deliberate with your purchases.
  * Don’t mindlessly scroll through shopping websites for amusement. Only visit these when doing research or when you have a plan for what to buy.
  * Handle promotional emails by unsubscribing or filtering them. Emails can trigger shopping desires.
  * If you have an itch to buy something, wait a few days so you can figure out if you _really_ need it or whether you’re just impulse buying. Research shows impulse buying is common (75% of people admit doing it), but the majority who do it regret it later.
  * Pay attention to your shopping triggers. Men tend to impulse buy when drunk; women do it when they’re sad or bored.



#### 2\. Spend Only What You Can Comfortably Afford

Try to limit spending to things you can afford without having to take on additional debt. Here are some general strategies:

  * If you use credit cards, spend only what you can pay off each month.
  * If you want to buy something, but don’t have enough money, wait to buy until you do.



But what about buying houses, where most people have to take on debt? Investing in housing or something else that appreciates in value over time, can be a good investment. Always make sure to weigh your choices to take on as little debt as possible, and work to pay it off quickly.

#### 3\. Repair Your Possessions

Every time we buy something new, there are energy, labor, and environmental costs that go into producing that item. Though it may be tempting to buy cheap replacements for things that break, you’ll save resources and maybe even money in the long-run by repairing things instead of replacing them with new ones.

#### 4\. Use Stuff to the End

Many perfectly good items end up in the landfill just because we decide we want a newer item instead. **Using something until it’s completely worn out helps you avoid frequent spending on the same items.**

Here are some more strategies to use things longer:

  * If you do successfully wear things out for their intended purpose, ask whether you can repurpose them in some way. For example, use grubby dish towels as cleaning rags instead. Look to the internet for suggestions.
  * Resolve to upgrade less often than you usually do. For example, instead of buying the latest phone model every year, resolve to only upgrade every two years.



If you’re already on the frugal side, remember not to hold onto items so long that it costs you more life energy than it’s worth. For example, if you’ve worn your running shoes so thin that they’re hurting your knees, invest in new shoes—they’ll be cheaper than having to pay for knee surgery.

#### 5\. Dive Into DIY

These days there are more resources available than ever to help you learn how to do work yourself. Take advantage of online classes and YouTube videos dedicated to imparting new skills. **If you do choose to hire out the work, watch it being done and use it as an opportunity to learn something that you can use later.**

#### 6\. Think About What You Need

Thinking about what you need ahead of time can be a powerful tool to avoid buying things on a whim.

Here are some strategies to plan for long-term purchases:

  * Create a list of things you anticipate needing to buy in the coming year.
  * Research different brands and the price range of the item. 
  * Use sites such as online sellers or Craigslist to compare pricing, and set notifications to learn when an item has dropped in price.
  * Buy around the holidays, or other times when retailers offer discounts.



Anticipate things you’ll need in the short-term, too. For example, rather than buying expensive one-off items at a convenience store, think about what you need before you need it and try to buy it ahead during a supermarket trip or online where you can get it for cheaper.

#### 7\. Investigate Durability and Multipurpose Uses

In addition to price research, investigate how long something will last. **If you plan to use something frequently, learn if it will last enough time to make it worth its price.** On the other hand, if you don’t plan to use a product that frequently, you don’t need to invest as much money in ensuring it’s durably constructed. Less frequent use means it’ll naturally last longer.

Here are two ways to assess a product’s durability:

  * Examine it in-person. Look for signs like well-sewn seams and strong material.
  * Read online reviews where users share their impressions and experiences.



For example, let’s say you’re in the market for a washing machine. You come across a model that seems like a reasonable price, but notice that most of the online reviewers have checked a box saying they would not recommend buying it. Plus, many complain that the machine broke down after just a few uses and required frequent repairs, costing them more money in the long-run. You decide it’s worth looking into a slightly more expensive machine that users recommend.

Buying multipurpose items also saves you money because you pay the price of one item instead of several. For example, one all-purpose pot can eliminate the need for other appliances like a rice cooker or deep fryer.

#### 8\. Don’t Pay Full Price

There are 4 main ways to purchase items for less than their original price:

  1. **Search for the best price.** Use price-comparison tools on your web browser or metasearch sites to find which retailers have the best prices. Call retailers that don’t list their prices online. Many retailers have programs to match lower prices from other stores in town, or even some online stores.
  2. **Learn to haggle.** An item’s listing price is usually high. There’s no harm in asking for a lower price. Ask for a lower price when a sale has already ended, when you’re paying in cash, or for items already being offered at a discount. This strategy works best at small, locally-owned stores.
  3. **Buy previously owned or used items.** Many items put up for sale are still in very good condition. Try thrift stores, garage sales, and online sites like eBay and Craigslist. Garage sales tend to be best for small home appliances and furniture, while thrift stores are best for clothes. But thrift stores often offer more than clothes, so explore widely.
  4. **Get stuff for free.** Sites like Buy Nothing Project and FreeCycle Network connect people with goods others are giving away.



#### 9\. Devise New Ways to Meet Your Needs

Once again, living frugally is not about living a life of deprivation. It’s about learning to meet your needs without having to spend vast sums of money, and ideally, without spending much money at all. **In order to do this, we need to listen to our needs and desires and ask if they can be met without spending money.**

For example, we might value freedom and look to travel to satisfy it. Travel allows us to feel free in our movement. But perhaps the desire to travel is really a desire for novel experiences and a break from our routines. In that case, it might be possible to satisfy that need closer to home by seeking out novel experiences in our own area. We could take a vacation within a few hours drive of where we live, or explore a new part of town we’ve never been to before.
