## Step 2: Tracking Your Money

To understand why you don’t have to choose between your money or your life, you need to understand what money is. **It’s hard to define money, but it’s important—your personal definition may be preventing you from understanding how much you truly earn and how many hours you spend on work and work-related activities.** After we define money, we’ll define what it means to be financially independent. 

Lastly, we’ll cover Step 2 of the program. You’ll learn to: 

  * Calculate your real hourly wage 
  * Track your expenses 



###  What Is Money, Really? 

There are 4 basic ways people think about money: 

  1. It’s a material—literally the bills, plastic, or transaction that allows for the purchasing of goods. 
  2. It’s a reflection of our psychology, embodying our dreams and fears. How you spend money can reflect your personality, whether you’re a penny-pincher or like to spend liberally. 
  3. It’s a reflection of our culture: thinking that “more is better” and that we have a role in growing the economy. 
  4. **It’s “life energy”—we are willing to dedicate our time and energy in exchange for money.** This is the most useful definition of money because it’s consistent in most situations. 



Defining money as life energy allows us to make statements like, “I invested 8 hours of my life to pay for this pair of shoes”—we can see _exactly_ how much time and energy goes into each purchase. 

Your life has a finite number of hours. In general, you can assume that half of the hours remaining in your life will be filled with doing basic body-related things: sleeping, eating, exercising, and more. That leaves the other half to squeeze in work _and_ everything else that matters to you, like spending time with family. 

###  Escaping the Money Game 

Like it or not, we are all part of the money game—the buying and selling of goods and services. We need some to survive, but advertisements encourage us to consume things beyond the basic necessities. For example, you might be convinced to upgrade your phone even when you have a functional one. 

In addition, there are some economic indicators that force us to keep playing: 

  * Inflation 
  * Cost of living 
  * Recession and depression 



We’ve been trained to be sensitive to these kinds of economic indicators. If we’re told something is off, we respond accordingly. Here are some examples: 

  * If we hear that a recession is imminent, we might decide to forgo taking a vacation that year, despite having a stable job and plenty of savings. 
  * If the news says that the cost of living in our area has increased, it makes us feel poorer, playing off of our existing concerns about money. However, the consumer price index, which is used to evaluate cost of living, continues to add items that were once considered luxuries, like cell phones. We’re expected to need more things, even if our earnings haven’t risen to match. 



The money game’s ability to keep us spending isn’t unlike the premise of the popular film, _The Matrix_ . In the movie, machines pacify humans through a simulated reality and use human energy to power themselves. The main character, Neo, is offered a “red pill” to be able to see this reality. 

Understanding that money is life energy is like taking the red pill. You learn to: 

  * Identify what you need, rather than being convinced to squander your money or time. 
  * Reflect on your spending, and decide if you would spend differently in the future. 



**You can’t decide whether or not to play the game, but you can make more cognizant decisions about _when_ to play. ** In some instances, you might realize that spending money isn’t the best way to satisfy your needs or the needs of others. Instead, you can make use of other resources at your disposal, such as affection or expertise. 

###  Financial Independence: Myth and Reality 

Just as you need to understand the definition of “money” to improve your relationship with it, you need to understand what financial independence is in order to work toward it. 

When you hear the term, “financial independence,” you may think of becoming rich and the myriad of luxuries that would afford, like endless, swanky vacations. But being “rich” is a relative term— _you can’t feel rich unless other people have less_ . Striving to become rich isn’t a realistic goal and plays into the “more is better” myth. 

**Financial Independence means having the money you need to survive, plus more for the things you deem important for your life. This is the definition of “enough.”** It will be different from person to person. 

Aside from learning what your “enough” looks like, achieving Financial Independence means: 

  * Spending money based on your choices, not at the whims of your circumstances. 
  * Interrupting your assumptions about how you should or shouldn’t think about money. 
  * Understanding your finances so that you feel confident. 
  * Acknowledging the emotions you experience when thinking about money—anger, guilt—and moving beyond to make choices that fit your values. 



###  Step 2: Track Your Money 

Step 2 has two parts. First, you’ll calculate your real hourly wage. Then, you’ll start tracking every penny you spend. 

####  Step 2.1: Calculate Your Real Hourly Wage 

Calculating your real hourly wage is an important step in understanding your relationship with money. Most people take their hourly wage at face value (“I earn $25 per hour”). This neglects two things: 

  1. The time they spend doing work-related activities. 
  2. The money they spend on work-related expenses. 



A real hourly wage accounts for all of these factors. Ultimately, you’ll determine how much money your “life energy” is currently worth. 

For some categories, like commuting, the time and cost will be obvious and built-in. For others, you need to assign a value. 

1\. Create a table to calculate your real wage, as shown in this example: 

|  Hours/Week  |  Dollars/Week  |  Dollars/Hour   
---|---|---|---  
**Job (before adjustments)** |  40  |  1,000  |  25   
**Adjustments** |  |  |   
Wardrobe/Upkeep  |  +1.5  |  -25  |   
Commuting  |  +10  |  -125  |   
Food  |  +8  |  -80  |   
Sickness from work stress  |  +1  |  -25  |   
Escapism  |  +5.5  |  -45  |   
Unwinding  |  +5  |  -30  |   
Time Off  |  +5  |  -30  |   
**Total Adjustments (time and money spent maintaining job)** |  +36  |  -360  |   
**Actual Total (job with adjustments)** |  76  |  -640  |  **8.42**  
  
2\. Fill in the second row with the hours/week you work, dollars/week you receive, and your hourly wage. 

3\. Below, record the number of hours you spend on work and work-related activities and assign a cost. Here are the basic categories and some examples; feel free to add your own: 

  * Wardrobe and upkeep of your physical appearance: time spent grooming yourself for work each day, such as getting dressed and putting on makeup, as well as time and money spent on shopping for professional clothing, shaving your legs, etc. 
  * Commuting: time spent commuting to and from work, and the associated costs, like gas and insurance. 
  * Food: the cost of any beverage or meal that you eat out because of work, from coffee to any dining out you do because your job leaves little time to cook. 
  * Sickness from work stress: any time that you get sick due to stress from your job. 
  * Escapism: activities that you treat yourself to as compensation for how stressful your job is, like binge-watching The Great British Baking Show to take your mind off of work after a stressful meeting. 
  * Unwinding: time spent destressing from your job, like talking about it, or money spent on recreational substances. 
  * Time off: any vacation that you consider necessary to keep you coming back to work. It’ll likely be the vacation where you’re not doing much—maybe just parking yourself on the beach to recharge for a week. 
  * Miscellaneous: anything else you spend time or money on for your job, like taking out your frustration with your job onto your partner, or buying tools. 



4\. Add up all of the hours and money in columns 2 and 3 to calculate the hours you dedicate to work and work-related activities, and how much you spend on work per week. 

5\. **Divide your adjusted dollars/week by your adjusted hours/week to find your real hourly wage.**

In the above example, a job where the person’s hourly rate is $25 an hour really only pays $8.42 an hour when factoring in all of the time and money spent on job-related activity. 

Use this real hourly wage to evaluate whether your job, and future jobs, are worth your time. For example, if a job in the city pays more than a job close by, but you have to spend time and money commuting, it may be less lucrative over time than something close by that pays less. 

#####  Optional Step 

You can also calculate the value of your time down to the minute, which allows you to decide if a _purchase_ is worth your time. In the example above, the person must work 7.12 minutes for each dollar spent. Let’s say they want to buy a new set of earphones for $40. That would require nearly 285 minutes of work time. Is it worth it? 

####  Step 2.2: Track Money, Down to the Penny, You Receive and Spend 

Tracking the money that comes into and goes out of your life allows you to reclaim control over your spending. You can begin to discern necessary and fulfilling purchases from frivolous ones. You make a habit of taking an honest look at how much you earn and what you spend it on, leaving no room for exasperation, excuses, or resignation. 

People who are in control of their finances know exactly how much money they spend, and on what. Consider it a solid investment in your financial future. 

**Start by tracking every penny.** There are many formats to do this. You can use physical or digital formats, such as pocket-sized notebooks, calendars, notes on your phone or computer, or online software that tracks spending from your bank accounts. 

Ideally, break down payments where you bought more than one thing into each individual item. For example, when you buy groceries, record each individual item. Use round numbers for most items as long as the total accounts for the cents involved. 

It’s easy to get wishy-washy or want to round to the nearest dollar. But for starters, in service of getting the most accurate picture possible of your financial life, aim for the nearest penny. If you eventually round to bigger coins, or even whole dollars, that is fine.
