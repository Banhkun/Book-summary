## Exercise: Consider Energy Dependency

Though Maddow is critical of the energy industry, she also stresses how essential oil and gas are to modern life, work, and trade. Her suggestions for change focus on how we can mold the industry to do less harm and be more beneficial to the people dependent upon it.

* * *

What role do oil and gas play in your life? Do you use one or both every day?

Have you been affected by an energy shortage or increased prices in the past? What was it like and how did you respond to it?

What do you think about Maddowâ€™s suggestions for reform? Are there other changes you believe are necessary (for example, an increased focus on clean energy)?
