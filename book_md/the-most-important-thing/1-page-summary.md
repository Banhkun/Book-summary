## 1-Page Summary

To the outsider, the world of investing can seem daunting to enter—if not outright impossible. But, according to investment professional Howard Marks, this intimidating appearance couldn’t be further from the truth. On the contrary, he argues that **anyone can learn the basics needed to invest successfully** by implementing the lessons he’s learned from a lifetime of investing.

In his 2011 book _The Most Important Thing_ , Marks outlines the key tenets of his approach to investing. He argues that the best approach to investing in _securities_ —any financial asset with monetary value, like stocks and bonds—is _value investing_ , which involves determining securities’ intrinsic value __ and purchasing below it. To practice it successfully, you must learn the nature of market cycles to find opportunities for purchasing mispriced securities, while also learning how to mitigate the risk entailed by investing. Moreover, Marks contends that you must avoid the pitfalls that ensnare many investors, like greed and a herd mentality.

(Shortform note: In his later bestseller, _Mastering the Market Cycle_ , Marks concedes that _The Most Important Thing_ is a misnomer, as there’s no _single_ most important aspect of investing. He clarifies that, on the contrary, every lesson discussed in _The Most Important Thing_ is essential for investors to understand.)

As the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, an investment firm that manages $179 billion in assets, Marks brings years of real-life investing experience to _The Most Important Thing_. Additionally, key insights from Marks’s widely renowned investing memos—which Warren Buffett has praised—often form the foundation of his arguments throughout the book.

In this guide, we’ll first outline the fundamentals of value investing and why Marks prefers it over the main alternative, growth investing. Next, we’ll discuss Marks’s reflections on market cycles and how they’re useful to the value investor, before examining his contrarian view on risk and how to mitigate it. Finally, we’ll analyze the common mistakes that often leave investors exposed to unnecessary risk. Throughout this guide, we’ll also examine recommendations from other investors that supplement—and occasionally challenge—Marks’s investing wisdom.

### The Fundamentals of Value Investing

According to Marks, _value investing_ —the practice of purchasing securities below their intrinsic value—is the cornerstone of successful investing. In this section, we’ll detail value investing in greater depth, outlining Marks’s reasons for recommending it over growth investing and offering concrete strategies for finding underpriced securities.

#### Value Investing vs. Growth Investing

As Marks relates, value investing and growth investing represent different investing approaches based on securities’ _fundamentals_ —that is, information that reflects the financial health of a security, such as revenue, cash flow, and profit margins. He argues that **value investing is superior to growth investing because it yields more consistent and dependable returns.**

(Shortform note: Although Marks applies value investing more broadly to _all_ securities—not just stocks—experts traditionally discuss value investing in the context of stock market investing alone. That is, they focus on purchasing _stocks_ that are underpriced relative to their intrinsic value, rather than (say) purchasing underpriced corporate bonds.)

To understand growth and value investing, however, we first need to understand the notion of _intrinsic value_. At its core, intrinsic value refers to the fair value of a security, assuming all relevant information was factored into its price. For example, if extreme pessimism led investors to excessively sell Amazon stock at the beginning of 2023, then Amazon’s share price of $85.46 might have been lower than its intrinsic value per share.

(Shortform note: Though Marks emphasizes the importance of intrinsic value, he doesn’t specify what intrinsic value _is_. To that end, Robert Hagstrom’s explanation of intrinsic value in _The Warren Buffett Way _is useful. Hagstrom clarifies that a company’s intrinsic value is its expected net income over its lifetime, deducted by an appropriate discount rate. In other words, intrinsic value is the amount a company will profit over its lifetime in _today’s_ dollars.)

Marks notes that value and growth investors agree that over the long term, securities’ prices roughly match their intrinsic value. However, this agreement yields different conclusions. On one hand, value investors seek out underpriced securities—those whose price is below their intrinsic value—reasoning that, as the market corrects this disparity, these securities will increase in price. On the other hand, growth investors seek securities whose intrinsic value has high growth potential—even if these securities aren’t _currently_ underpriced—reasoning that, as their intrinsic value increases over time, so too will their trading price.

But Marks contends that it’s much more difficult to assess long-term potential than present value. Moreover, he writes that unless you’re superior to the market at identifying potential, it’s likely that this potential is _already_ factored into the security’s price. For example, Tesla’s stock price at the beginning of 2020—$28.30 per share—likely reflected not only Tesla’s business fundamentals, but also its potential for explosive growth. In turn, he concludes that value investing generates more consistent—and less speculative—returns than growth investing, making it preferable for investors.

(Shortform note: Although Marks presents value and growth investing as if they’re mutually exclusive, some investing strategies aim to consolidate them into a single approach. In particular, a strategy known as “growth at a reasonable price,” or GARP, seeks out companies with outsized earnings potential that nonetheless appear undervalued. By investing in these companies, GARP investors purportedly enjoy the consistency of value investing and the exponential returns of growth investing.)

##### Value Investing and the Efficient Market Hypothesis

Marks admits that value investing requires securities’ prices to occasionally differ from their intrinsic value. But, according to many academic theorists, this market disparity between prices and intrinsic value is rare—or even nonexistent. Many theorists embrace the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which states that market prices __ always accurately reflect securities’ intrinsic value because all relevant information about securities is baked into their price. Marks, however, cites discrepancies between market price and value to argue that **the** **EMH is mistaken, making value investing possible.**

For the clearest discrepancy between market price and value, Marks points to Yahoo’s share price in the 16 months between January 2000 and April 2001. At first, in January of 2000, Yahoo’s share price was $237, whereas 16 months later, its share price was $11. According to Marks, it’s implausible that Yahoo’s intrinsic value dropped by over 95% in that time span—rather, he maintains that the market must have mispriced its stock at least once, meaning the EMH must be false.

(Shortform note: Yahoo’s collapse was the byproduct of the 2000 dot-com bubble bursting, in which technology stocks dropped sharply in value, leaving many internet start-ups financially devastated. Experts explain that, because such a large portion of Yahoo’s revenue stemmed from advertising for these internet companies, its revenue plummeted when these companies no longer had the funds to advertise on Yahoo’s platform.)

#### How to Find Underpriced Securities

Having shown it’s _possible_ for the market to underprice securities, Marks then offers concrete advice for finding underpriced securities. He argues that **to find underpriced securities, look for those that investors have significantly misjudged**. Marks reasons that if investors have accurately assessed a security, then it’s likely trading around its intrinsic value. But, if investors have _inaccurately_ assessed a security (in this case, by underestimating it), the security’s market price will be lower than its intrinsic value.

(Shortform note: Some may say that Marks’s advice in this case borders on tautological: By definition, investors’ assessments of securities determine their market price, so it logically follows that securities are mispriced whenever investors misjudge them.)

To put this argument into practice, Marks offers several signs to look for that might indicate an underpriced security:

  * Its price has rapidly decreased, leading average investors to stay away from it.
  * It has some clear shortcoming that makes it less attractive to investors.
  * It’s widely regarded as a poor investment, meaning that it’s not drawing much capital.



If any of these conditions are satisfied, it’s possible that other investors (and thus the market) will undervalue the security, leaving you poised to take advantage of their mistake.

> **How to Distinguish Underpriced Securities From Unpromising Securities**
> 
> While rapid price decreases, clear shortcomings, and negative perceptions can be indications of underpriced securities, they can also be indications of unpromising securities that you should avoid. To that, experts offer various metrics to consult when attempting to distinguish between stocks that are undervalued and those that are simply poor investments.
> 
> First, they recommend seeking companies whose _price-to-earnings_(P/E) _ratio_ is lower than that of competitors. P/E ratios are the ratio of a company’s share price to its earnings per share (a company’s net profit divided by its number of shares), and these ratios offer a simple way to see how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar a company earns. Experts argue that comparatively low P/E ratios are indicative of underpriced stocks because low P/E ratios suggest investors are paying less relative to the company’s income than they pay elsewhere.
> 
> In addition, experts recommend seeking companies with high estimated revenue growth (projections for companies’ future gross income) relative to their peers. Even if such companies are currently floundering, high estimated revenue growth suggests they could have outsized potential and could currently be underpriced.
> 
> No individual metric is a foolproof indicator of underpriced securities, so these metrics can only be part of a holistic search for underpriced securities. Still, they provide a useful supplement to the signs listed by Marks.

### The Nature of Investing Cycles

According to Marks, one reason why securities’ prices can diverge from their intrinsic value is that investing markets undergo _cycles_ —pricing fluctuations often driven by factors beyond the business fundamentals that determine intrinsic value. In this section, we’ll examine Marks’s account of the origins of investing cycles, their implications, and how investors can exploit them for their own gain.

#### Investing Cycles and Their Origins

Marks explains that securities’ markets are _cyclical_ —they oscillate between highs and lows in the wake of psychological changes among investors. In light of these cycles, Marks argues that **investors should avoid extrapolating from recent trends** because these trends are often upended when cycles shift.

To understand Marks’s argument, it helps to first understand the origins of investing cycles. According to Marks, **cycles occur as investors alternate between excessive risk tolerance and excessive risk aversion**. Excessive risk tolerance generates cyclical highs as investors become too optimistic and overpay for securities under the assumption that prices can only increase. Excessive risk aversion yields cyclical lows as investors grow pessimistic and invest too sparingly.

Because investors’ attitudes toward risk fluctuate rather than remain static, Marks concludes that it’s a mistake to assume the future will look like the recent past when investing. For example, novice investors might invest in the stock market after it grew exponentially in the last year, assuming it will do so again in the next year, but according to Marks, this is a mistake: As investors become more or less risk averse, securities’ markets that can experience wide swings on a yearly basis.

> **What Factors Drive Investing Cycles?**
> 
> Although Marks argues that securities markets undergo cycles, he doesn’t offer an in-depth account of the factors that drive the changes in these cycles. But, in _Irrational Exuberance_ , Robert Shiller attempts to do just that. Shiller argues that the trends in investing cycles result from three kinds of interconnected factors: structural, cultural, and psychological.
> 
> First, he maintains that structural factors—factors that are external to markets and occur in society at large—help set the stage for investing booms. For example, he points out that the late 90s saw the rise of the internet, which increased investors’ enthusiasm and led to inflated stock prices. Moreover, as 401ks became common in the late 1900s, more investors became familiar with stocks, which increased trading.
> 
> Next, he argues that cultural factors can drive investing trends by amplifying the attention investors pay to them and by creating feedback loops. According to Shiller, one such factor in the US is widespread media interest in reporting on investing news. This media involvement, he contends, creates a cascading effect when news outlets report on initial price movements, thus reinforcing them. For example, if the media reported that stocks in the tech sector had dropped, this could spur investors to sell even more of these stocks, causing further drops.
> 
> Finally, Shiller writes that salient psychological anchors can impact investing cycles, either by causing them to reverse course or by causing them to continue in the same direction. For example, one such anchor could be a pervasive narrative that (say) the housing market can only increase in value. This narrative could suffice to perpetuate a housing bull market, as investors will be less likely to cash in and sell their investments and more likely to hold. According to Shiller, because these narratives hold such psychological sway, they can impact the duration of investing trends.

#### Exploit Investing Cycles to Increase Returns

Though cycles can ensnare novice investors looking to turn a quick profit, they can also provide lucrative opportunities for savvy investors. To that end, Marks argues that **investors can generate outsized returns by taking contrarian positions at cyclical extremes** because securities are significantly mispriced at these extremes.

(Shortform note: Taking contrarian positions is a key component of what’s more generally known as _contrarian investing_ , in which investors buck widespread investing trends that they believe are ill-founded. Such renowned investors as Benjamin Graham, author of _The Intelligent Investor_ , and Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” are considered contrarians.)

At a broad level, Marks notes that at any given point in a cycle, most investors’ views about the market will reflect that phase of the cycle. For example, in a bull market, most investors will be optimistic, leading them to frequently buy assets and drive up prices—otherwise, there wouldn’t be a bull market to begin with. However, Marks points out that acting in line with the consensus can only lead to market-average returns, by definition. After all, if you invest the same as the majority of investors, you won’t be able to outperform them.

(Shortform note: Harmful institutional incentives to avoid looking foolish might offer one reason why so many investors follow suit with cyclical trends. In _The Signal and the Noise_ , Nate Silver argues that professional forecasters’ reputations can suffer if they incorrectly oppose the consensus view, inclining them to make conservative predictions that, when incorrect, are less embarrassing. So, in a similar vein, investors might hesitate to buck mainstream trends because the embarrassment of mistakenly betting against these trends is much greater than the embarrassment of mistakenly betting in line with these trends.)

Consequently, Marks concludes that **acting contrary to the majority of investors is necessary for above-market returns.** Specifically, he contends that contrarian investing is most powerful when cycles reach extremes—for instance, purchasing securities at the peak of a bear market (when prices are about to rise) or selling securities at the peak of a bull market ( when securities are about to drop). Nonetheless, he admits that contrarian investing isn’t _always_ advisable—after all, for large portions of investing cycles, there aren’t widespread discrepancies between price and value. So, Marks recommends that investors base contrarian decisions on rigorous analyses of intrinsic value to maximize their chance of finding market errors.

(Shortform note: Although Marks advocates for contrarianism on the grounds that it can yield above-market returns, it’s worth emphasizing that “market-average” returns would actually place you better than the majority of investors. In fact, while the S&P 500 averaged annual returns of about 6% between 2000 and 2020, the average equity fund investor averaged only 4.25%. Experts point out that this disparity occurs because investors often buy when the market is high and sell when it’s low, leading to below-market returns. Additionally, John C. Bogle argues in _The Little Book of Common Sense Investing_ that many investors earn below-market returns because they invest in mutual funds with high turnover rates, which charge fees that cut into their profits.)

### How to Mitigate Investing Risk

Even rigorous analysis of securities’ value, however, can’t entirely shield investors from risk. On the contrary, Marks contends that **risk is an unavoidable aspect of investing**. In this section, we’ll outline Marks’s conception of risk, his warning signs of a risky market, and his recommendations for controlling risk by practicing defensive investing.

#### Marks’s View of Risk vs. the Academic View of Risk

According to Marks, any approach to investing requires an understanding of risk. He defines risk as **the probability that you’ll lose money** because that is investors’ greatest concern.

To see the novelty of Marks’s definition, it helps to understand the main alternative that he rejects—namely, the standard academic view that equates risk with _portfolio volatility_ , the extent to which the portfolio experiences swings in value. As Marks relates, this view is based on the assumption that more volatile investments are less reliable, increasing risk for investors.

(Shortform note: In _The Warren Buffett Way_ , Robert G. Hagstrom clarifies that academics equate risk with volatility because of their reliance on the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Hagstrom points out that, because the EMH assumes all investing success boils down to luck, proponents of the EMH believe that investors with volatile portfolios are simply more likely to lose money. So, it stands to reason that Marks’s disagreement with academics’ view on risk stems from his disagreement with their view on market efficiency.)

In Marks’s evaluation, this academic view misses the mark. Specifically, he suggests that investors aren’t concerned with portfolio fluctuations _per se_ because fluctuations alone don’t always cost investors money in the long run. On the contrary, a security’s price might fluctuate wildly, but as long as its price follows an upward trend over time, it can yield large returns. For this reason, Marks clarifies that the _real_ risk of investing is the possibility of permanent loss—based on his own investing experience, he argues that this prospect most worries investors.

(Shortform note: Some experts disagree with Marks’s claim that investors aren’t concerned with portfolio fluctuations. According to experts in behavioral finance, many investors suffer from _myopic loss aversion_ —the combination of loss aversion and a tendency to chronically check their portfolios.). As Daniel Kahneman relates in _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , loss aversion refers to our tendency to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains. Thus, when investors suffer loss aversion and chronically check their portfolios, losses from short-term fluctuations can prove psychologically painful.)

The upshot is that **risk can’t be objectively measured** , and only investors with careful qualitative analysis can discern the risk associated with a given security. In particular, Marks argues that investors must ascertain how stable a security’s intrinsic value is, along with the nature of the connection between this value and the security’s market price. After all, these are the two factors that determine the likelihood of loss: If a security’s value dips, or the market fails to accurately reflect this value, investors will lose money.

(Shortform note: Although Marks claims we can’t objectively measure risk, many professional economists attempt to do just that. For example, some economists measure risk via the Sortino ratio, which measures how a given security’s downside volatility compares to the average downside volatility of all comparable securities. However, formulas like these are based on the assumption that volatility equates to risk, a premise that, as we’ve seen, Marks rejects.)

##### Indications of a Risky Market

Although Marks maintains that risk is immeasurable, he admits that there are warning signs that often indicate the presence of high risk. Specifically, he argues that **widespread high prices are indicative of high risk** because high prices are a proxy for excessive optimism and risk tolerance.

Marks reasons that when prices soar, it’s more likely that stocks’ prices fail to include a _risk premium_ , which is the difference between a stock’s expected return and the risk-free rate of return (typically the guaranteed return from government bonds). For example, if Apple stock started to soar, it’s likely that the expected return would drop closer to the risk-free return of a one-year Treasury bond (4.72% at the beginning of 2023) because prices can’t rise indefinitely. According to Marks, this means investors are no longer compensated for the risk they incur when purchasing stocks instead of risk-free bonds, leaving them exposed to more risk without the prospect of a proportionately higher return.

(Shortform note: Because risk premiums depend on the risk-free rate of return, it follows that the same expected return from a security can yield a different risk premium depending on the risk-free rate at the time. For example, imagine that you could expect a 10% return on Amazon stock at the beginning and end of 2022. At the beginning of 2022, when the one-year Treasury bond offered a 0.4% return, your risk premium would be 9.6% (10% minus 0.4%). But at the end of 2022, when the one-year Treasury bond offered a 4.7% return, your risk premium would be much smaller at 5.3% (10% minus 4.7%).)

#### Control Risk Through Defensive Investing

Though he discourages high-risk investments, Marks recognizes that eliminating risk altogether—for example, by purchasing 10-year government bonds that return around 4% annually—will yield unsatisfying returns. He argues that, to balance this inverse relationship between risk and return, **you should practice defensive investing, which uses a margin of safety to reap reliable returns while minimizing risk.**

As Marks relates, the margin of safety refers to the difference between a security’s intrinsic value and its market price when purchased. For example, imagine that you purchased Tesla stock at $118.47 at the beginning of 2023, and its intrinsic value was $150 per share. Then, your margin of safety would be about $32 per share.

(Shortform note: Graham, who first introduced the concept of margin of safety in _The Intelligent Investor_ , argued that one crucial way to increase your margin of safety is through diversification (purchasing more securities of different types). He reasoned that, even with a margin of safety, investing in only one security leaves you exposed to loss if that security drops significantly. For instance, even with a $32 per share margin of safety when purchasing Tesla stock, a large drop in Tesla’s intrinsic value could leave you exposed to a loss if that was your only investment. By contrast, with a diverse portfolio, you’ll still be able to earn a profit even if some of your securities drop in value.)

According to Marks, investing based on the margin of safety has two key benefits. First, as we discussed earlier, securities purchased below their intrinsic value are likely to increase in price because market price typically reflects intrinsic value over the long term. Second, the margin of safety protects investors from loss if the intrinsic value of a security decreases. Returning to the previous example, even if Tesla’s intrinsic value dropped to $120 per share, it’s unlikely that you’d lose money since you purchased at $118.47 per share.

(Shortform note: Although investing with a margin of safety has these benefits, experts point out that it also suffers drawbacks. In particular, establishing a margin of safety requires accurately determining a security’s intrinsic value—a practice which, experts warn, rarely lends itself to a precise answer. For example, Buffett’s method of calculating intrinsic value requires estimating a company’s future net income, which is an inherently subjective estimate. For this reason, investors can easily _think_ they’ve established a margin of safety because of a faulty intrinsic value calculation, leaving them overconfident.)

### Psychological and Intellectual Pitfalls to Avoid

While investing grounded in the margin of safety sounds straightforward in theory, investing is more complicated in practice. As Marks points out, that’s because **investors often succumb to emotional or intellectual pitfalls when investing**. In this section, we’ll consider the primary investing mistakes that you must avoid to maximize your success.

#### Common Psychological Pitfalls

While Marks admits that investing markets might be perfectly efficient if investors were fully objective and rational, he contends that the opposite is true: **Psychological influences affect investors’ decisions, cutting into potential profits.** And though Marks lists an array of such influences, we’ll focus on the effects of three key ones: greed, fear, and the desire to conform.

##### Pitfall #1: Greed

First, Marks argues that **greed leads investors to make suboptimal decisions** as it causes them to abandon caution. He points out that when investors are overcome by their desire to earn money, they cast aside risk aversion in hopes of earning an outsized profit. For instance, a greedy investor might spend an exorbitant amount of money investing in an unproven cryptocurrency, leaving them exposed to massive losses if the investment fails. For this reason, Marks maintains that greed is one of the most potent forces working against investors.

(Shortform note: Although it’s impossible to precisely determine greed’s influence, CNN business experts have developed a fear and greed index that estimates which emotions are driving the market. This index relies on seven metrics—including market momentum, market volatility, and the demand for junk bonds—to assess whether the market is greedy, fearful, or somewhere in between. For example, a high demand for junk bonds (bonds that have a high likelihood of defaulting) suggests a greedy market, while an above-average degree of volatility suggests a fearful market.)

##### Pitfall #2: Fear

On the other end of the spectrum, Marks holds that **fear causes investors to leave profits on the table** because scared investors are unwilling to take even well-informed risks. According to Marks, fear paralyzes the would-be investor. For example, a fearful investor might see an opportunity to purchase a security for far below its intrinsic value, only to be frozen by the possibility that they’ll ultimately lose money. In this way, fear can hinder investors from maximizing their potential returns.

(Shortform note: According to experts, one way to mitigate fear when investing is to start with smaller investments and gradually work your way up to investing larger sums. Because fear is proportionate to the amount of money you’ve invested—after all, the more money that you invest, the more money that you could lose—slowly increasing your investment portfolio will help you cope with gradually increasing amounts of fear.)

##### Pitfall #3: Conformity

Both greed and fear, however, can result from a greater problem afflicting investors: the desire to conform to other investors’ behavior. Marks argues that **conformity often leads investors to act irrationally when the consensus view is misguided** , as it often is. Specifically, he contends that pressure to conform causes investors to forsake their own due diligence when assessing securities and incur excessive risk, as they reason that the consensus view can’t be mistaken. In turn, this behavior leads investors to purchase securities that they would never have purchased otherwise.

(Shortform note: In _The Warren Buffett Way_ , Hagstrom explains Buffett’s idea that conformity doesn’t just influence investors, but also business leaders. According to Buffett, these leaders often succumb to the _lemming factor_ and blindly follow industry trends, like constantly acquiring other companies, even when these trends are ultimately irrational. Thus, Buffett recommends investing in companies that are unafraid to look foolish and buck industry trends because they’re less likely to mirror these harmful tendencies.)

#### Common Intellectual Pitfalls

While emotions like greed and fear can spell disaster for investors, Marks argues that **intellectual mistakes can also lead to subpar investments**. Specifically, he contends that investors who are too credulous and those who fail to consider rare outcomes are susceptible to large losses.

##### Pitfall #1: Excessive Credulity

First, Marks maintains that **gullible investors often accept delusions that require them to ignore past investing wisdom**. For example, you might recognize that investing markets have experienced cycles historically, meaning that peak bull markets often lead to bear markets with their associated price drops. Even knowing this, the credulous investor could become convinced that these past norms no longer apply, causing them to continue purchasing securities under the delusion that prices can only rise. In this manner, credulity can result in excessive risk that leaves investors exposed to potential losses.

(Shortform note: Excessive credulity in investors might stem from the _ought-is fallacy_ —the fallacy of believing something because you want it to be true, not because of evidence that it is true. Informally known as wishful thinking, this fallacy explains why investors might purchase securities believing that their price can only increase, even though historical evidence suggests otherwise. After all, it’s natural for investors to _want_ their securities to only increase in value.)

##### Pitfall #2: Lack of Imagination

In a similar vein, Marks argues that **investors who lack imagination will fail to plan for rare contingencies** , leaving them vulnerable to loss when those contingencies occur. He maintains that such investors plan for the future by extrapolating from the recent past, assuming the future will reflect the past. However, this lack of imagination means they won’t account for instances when the future _does_ diverge from the past—for example, when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, as technology companies’ stock prices plummeted despite investors assuming that these prices could only increase. Consequently, investors without imagination pay the price when the future doesn’t meet their expectations.

(Shortform note: One possible reason why investors suffer from lack of imagination is that they rely too heavily on what Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 thinking. As opposed to System 2 thinking, which Kahneman defines as our ability to slowly and deliberately form judgments (like solving a complex math problem), System 1 thinking involves quick, intuitive judgments without voluntary effort (like performing basic arithmetic). According to Kahneman, System 1 thinking leaves us prone to extrapolating “patterns” from data that are actually random, like assuming a coin is rigged because it lands on tails several times in a row. Thus, investors that use System 1 thinking might assume market trends will continue indefinitely on the basis of recent data, although these data are often random subsets of larger data sets.)

#### How to Avoid These Pitfalls

Marks contends that there’s no foolproof strategy for avoiding these pitfalls. However, he does offer one main suggestion to investors: **Remain keenly aware of market conditions,** especially the supply-and-demand relationship for securities, because such awareness will help you realize when securities are mispriced.

For example, to avoid succumbing to greed, you might recognize that capital is flowing too freely into fledgling, high-risk securities in the technology sector as investors hope to find a diamond in the rough. In such a situation, cognizance of this market trend would help you realize that these securities are likely overpriced. Similarly, to avoid excessive credulity, you might recognize an inordinate demand for (say) real estate because investors think real estate values can only increase. By remaining aware of this, you’ll be poised to avoid the trap of thinking that past trends about the housing market are no longer relevant.

(Shortform note: Experts offer a variety of strategies for remaining on top of relevant market conditions like Marks suggests. For example, they point out that following news aggregators, such as Google News, can keep you aware of pertinent investing reports from a wide array of sources to ensure you don’t miss market developments. Moreover, they note that social media can provide direct access to the most important pieces of information about securities markets.)
