## 1-Page Summary

We go through our lives wrapped up in ideas, value judgments, and rules about the events, objects, and people around us. We even apply these social conventions to our understanding of ourselves. But according to Zen Buddhism, **all of these conventions are artificial and represent just one superficial way of engaging with and understanding the world**.

By learning to express the principles of Zen, you can break down the mental barriers that you use to divide yourself from the rest of the world—and finally see the world and the present moment for what it is. You can achieve this change in perspective without spending your life in strict meditation or dropping away from your family, your friends, your work, or the activities you value.

_The Way of Zen_ (1957) is an introduction to Zen Buddhism by philosopher Alan Watts, who has been credited with popularizing Zen in the West in the 1960s. Watts wrote a number of books based on Zen Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu ideas, including _The Book _(1966) and _The Wisdom of Insecurity_ (1951).

In this guide, we’ll explore how Watts defines Zen, what schools of religious and philosophical thought it grew out of, and what differentiates Zen from those traditions. We’ll also look at why Zen is still relevant in our modern world, how Zen might change your perspective on your life, and how to express Zen in your everyday life. We’ll also compare Watts’ interpretation of Zen with other scholars’ understanding of it and compare Zen’s principles with other ideas about how we experience the world.

### What Is Zen?

**Zen Buddhism is a “way of liberation” from the illusions you believe about the world and yourself**. Watts writes that Zen frees you to perceive the world in a more natural way, and you can experience this liberated way of moving through the world when you understand that you’re already enlightened due to your nature as a human being.

In this section of the guide, we’ll explore where Zen came from, consider the most important ideas that Zen adopted from the ancient philosophies and religions that preceded it, and explain which ideas differentiate Zen from other schools of thought.

(Shortform note: Watts makes a point of calling Zen a “way of liberation” because it isn’t a religion and isn’t a philosophy, and other writers—including D. T. Suzuki and Carl Jung—have agreed that it doesn’t fit neatly into either of those categories. Suzuki, from whom Watts first learned about Zen, explained that there can’t be a “philosophy” of Zen because “there can’t be a philosophy of suchness,” a Zen term for the true nature of reality that can’t be expressed in language or other forms of abstraction. Instead, Zen is something that you are and something that you do when you express your true nature and engage in disciplined practice.)

#### Where Did Zen Come From?

According to Watts, the traditional origin story of Zen credits a monk named Bodhidharma with introducing many of the ideas that would become Zen Buddhism. The story goes that Bodhidharma arrived in China from India in the year 520 and spent nine years meditating in a cave at a monastery in Wei. There, he became the first patriarch of Zen.

Several other monks played important roles in the origin of Zen, too. Seng-chao, a copyist of Confucianist and Taoist texts, read a Mahayana Buddhist text that explained that **awakening could be experienced in everyday life**. He went on to produce writings of his own, explaining Buddhism in terms of Taoism and forging a link between Taoism and Zen. Similarly, a monk named Tao-sheng seems to be the first to have taught that **awakening can be instantaneous**.

(Shortform note: Bodhidharma, Seng-chao, and Tao-sheng are often cited as significant Zen Buddhist figures. In _The Zen Experience_ , Thomas Hoover characterizes Seng-chao as a pre-Zen Buddhist who began integrating Taoism and Buddhism into what would become Zen. Hoover also explains that Tao-sheng is often cited in connection with two ideas: first, that good deeds don’t necessarily bring a reward; and second, that enlightenment is instantaneous. As for Bodhidharma, Hoover points out that though we don’t know the full teachings of the first patriarch of Zen, it’s believed that he promoted the use of meditation, sutras, and Buddhist rituals as tools for awakening to your true nature.)

Watts explains that ultimately, **Zen was created as a “way of liberation” to undo the effects of the conventions that we learn in society** —effects such as indecision, anxiety, and self-consciousness. Zen created a synthesis of Chinese and Indian traditions, and after its origin in China, it spread outward, most notably to Japan.

(Shortform note: Though psychological experiences like indecision and anxiety have many interrelated causes, the ideas of Zen might be able to help. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), an evidence-based psychotherapy that was developed for individuals with borderline personality disorder but is also an empirically validated treatment for anxiety, explicitly draws on the Zen idea of the synthesis of “opposites” to help people manage their distress and live more mindfully.)

### What Ideas Did Zen Borrow From Taoism, Confucianism, and Mahayana Buddhism?

Zen and its ideas can be traced back to three schools of thought:**Taoism, Confucianism, and Mahayana Buddhism**. Taoism and Confucianism are Chinese forms of thought and religion, while Mahayana Buddhism is an Indian school of Buddhism. Each contributed ideas that would become foundational to Zen Buddhist teachings about life and enlightenment. In this section of the guide, we’ll outline which ideas Watts identifies as having made the most crucial contributions to the development of Zen. Those ideas concern the nature of our perception, awakening, and our actions in the world.

(Shortform note: Though the word “awakening” appears throughout _The Way of Zen_ , Watts doesn’t explicitly define it. But in a TV program called “Buddhism and Science” that Watts recorded in 1960, he offers a succinct description. He explains awakening as a sudden realization that the good and the bad—the positive and the negative—in life are one. When you experience awakening, you understand that these phenomena are inseparable from one another, and that one is necessary for the existence of the other.)

#### Confucianism

Confucianism influenced Zen indirectly by affecting the organization of ancient Chinese society. Watts explains that **Confucianism is humanistic** :**It creates a social order focused on harmony, ethics, and communication by teaching people to follow social convention**. When Confucianism absorbed Buddhist practices, this interweaving of ideas led to an attainable way for the average person—who has work, family obligations, and interests—to practice Buddhism and to experience awakening. By contrast, other forms of Buddhism teach that attaining awakening would take lifetimes of effort across multiple cycles of reincarnation.

(Shortform note: Confucianism is a belief system that focuses on personal ethics and morality. These are achieved through the virtue of “humanity” and expressed in respect, humility, and altruism. Confucianism concerns itself with the ethical interactions among people and entities, not with spiritual matters. Philosopher D.T. Suzuki, a major influence on Watts, writes in _Zen and Japanese Culture_ that Zen emerged as a Chinese response to Indian thought as reflected by Buddhism, so Zen necessarily reflects the practicality and ethics of Confucianism.)

#### Taoism

A second school of thought that shaped Zen Buddhism is Taoism, which proposes what Watts calls a liberation from Confucianism. Whereas Confucianism emphasizes the importance of ethics and social conventions, **Taoism aims to help people see those conventions for what they are** : socially agreed-upon meanings and values rather than something real or concrete. Taoism proposes that realizing the true nature of these conventions enables us to step back from them and experience life in harmony with the universe as it actually exists.

(Shortform note: Taoism is concerned with the limitations that you impose on yourself in the physical, psychological, and spiritual spheres of your life, as when you follow a belief system like Confucianism. By encouraging you to question the ideas that you’ve learned from society, Taoism seeks to help you transcend your limitations and live in accordance with the true nature of reality, acting only in ways that are in keeping with the Tao. A key aspect of Taoism—one shared by Zen Buddhism—is that it proposes that the highest truth, or the Tao, can’t be expressed in words or understood through logical thought. Words are just symbols for the things they represent, and enlightenment happens beyond the bounds of description and definition.)

Two ideas of Taoism became foundational to Zen Buddhism: the idea that we can experience two different kinds of knowledge and the idea that we can act spontaneously in the moment.

##### There Are Two Ways of Knowing

First, the Taoist idea that there are two kinds of knowledge—conventional and unconventional—deeply influenced Zen. **Conventional knowledge is contingent on socially agreed-upon meanings and value judgments**. Watts writes that these are culturally defined and have to be represented in language (or other forms of notation, like mathematical equations). Facts, labels, and definitions are conventional knowledge. For instance, you use conventional knowledge when you walk down the street and notice that you’re walking under “trees”; that one is an “oak” and another a “planetree,” and both belong to a category of organisms called “plants.”

On the other hand, **unconventional knowledge doesn’t rely on the abstractions of language and representation**. Instead, it gets directly at the experience of the actual world. When you’re walking under an oak tree, you might feel its shade, take in the scent of its leaves, and watch the movement of its branches. Your experience of observing it without naming or describing it is unconventional knowledge. We often assume that we can’t “know” something unless we can express it in language. But Taoism proposes that unconventional knowledge enables us to know the world directly, by experiencing it.

(Shortform note: The distinction between conventional knowledge and unconventional knowledge is relevant beyond the borders of Zen. Philosopher Jay Garfield identifies the relationship between ordinary reality (conventional knowledge) and ultimate reality (unconventional knowledge) as a question with relevance in all schools of Buddhism. Questions about whether the two are the same or different, and whether the world is illusory or real, arise everywhere. In Indian Buddhism, the “theory of two truths” maintains that there is a “truth of mundane conventions” that fits within our conventional linguistic and conceptual frameworks and a “truth of the ultimate” beyond the limits of those frameworks.)

##### We Can Act Spontaneously and Naturally

Another idea that’s foundational to Zen comes from the Taoist principle _wu-wei_ , the **experience of making decisions naturally and spontaneously**. Watts writes that when you let your mind decide how to act, it moves more naturally and intelligently—not impulsively, but out of the spontaneity of the moment. This leads to the experience of _wu-hsin_ , translated as “no mind,” a kind of “un-self-consciousness” that you can experience when you let your mind work without trying to direct it or interfere with it. You can develop _te_ , or “virtue,” a creative ability that you can only access by acting naturally and spontaneously.

Watts traces this logic a step further and explains that **not only can you act spontaneously, but there’s no other way you can behave**. If you realize that even your intentions, purposeful actions, and voluntary decisions arise spontaneously from your natural self (the self that you actually experience, rather than the abstract idea of yourself), then you can stop trying to be spontaneous or worrying that you aren’t.

(Shortform note: Experiencing _wu-wei_ and _wu-hsin_ are key parts of the Taoist goal of living in harmony with the universe. The _Tao Te Ching_ teaches that while we make things out of tangible material, what we often use in our daily lives is intangible space, such as the empty space inside a house. To create a similar kind of emptiness in your life, you have to embrace _wu-wei_ , which involves letting go of your personal desires and acting only when the time is right. That’s when we can experience _wu-hsin_ and act naturally and unselfconsciously.)

#### Mahayana Buddhism

A third school of thought that shaped Zen Buddhism is **Mahayana Buddhism, which reframes the pursuit of _nirvana_** , the traditional Buddhist idea of release from karma and cycles of death and rebirth. Mahayana takes the idea of this cycle figuratively, explaining that the pursuit of _nirvana_ is futile and we’re continually reborn from moment to moment until we stop trying to escape what’s really happening in the present moment.

(Shortform note: Mahayana Buddhism is a family of Buddhist traditions (rather than a singular school) that proposes that all beings possess the potential for awakening. So it’s not surprising that while Watts characterizes Mahayana's views of _karma_ and _nirvana_ as figurative, other scholars offer alternate explanations. Philosopher Jay Garfield explains that it’s a core idea of Buddhism that we’re reborn every moment. Some traditions also teach that we’re reborn to new biological lives while others don’t consider this idea important or take it literally. But Garfield notes that in Mahayana Buddhism, a belief in cycles of biological rebirth is almost a prerequisite: Pursuing awakening is difficult and may require multiple lifetimes to achieve.)

Two ideas from Mahayana Buddhism had a major impact on Zen: the idea that we don’t perceive the world as it really is and the idea that there’s nothing for us to attain in life.

##### We Don’t Perceive the Real World

Important to Zen is Mahayana Buddhism’s teaching that illusions obscure your perception of the world. Watts explains that the principle of _maya_ is that **the language we use to describe the world obscures what it really is**. _Maya_ is about relativity: We name things like “light” and “darkness” or “good” and “evil” and consider them opposites. But in reality, they aren’t separate. Watts explains that Hindus and Buddhists refer to the world as “nondual” rather than as “one” because even the concept of “one” draws on a false duality (it’s conceptually opposite to “many”). Letting go of the impulse to name and delineate things enables you to perceive the relativity and impermanence of the world and experience _moksha_ , a “liberation” from _maya_.

(Shortform note: Experts say that _maya_ hides the true nature of reality and _moksha_ occurs when we shed the illusions of _maya_. Writer George Saunders, who practices Nyingma Tibetan Buddhism, explains that Buddhists believe a significant gap exists between the way things are and the way we perceive them, and this causes suffering. Saunders notes that if we could believe what Buddhism teaches—that our lives are impermanent, the world as we know it is transient, and that we have no fixed self—then our pain would disappear.)

It follows from the principles of _maya_ and _moksha_ that language also curtails what you can understand of yourself. Watts writes that in all forms of Buddhism, you can’t apprehend your true self because **there’s no permanent or unchanging self to understand**. He points out that what you think of as your self or ego is just an abstraction. Your true self eludes your understanding if you hold onto that abstraction.

(Shortform note: Novelist and Zen priest Ruth Ozeki explains that according to Zen, the idea of a separate self is an illusion. She compares our self-concept to that of a wave in the ocean: The wave might think that it’s something discrete and separate from all the other waves for a moment, but in reality, there’s no border between it and the rest of the ocean. Similarly, Eckhart Tolle writes in _A New Earth_ that your ego creates a false self-image that obscures your true inner self. He explains that mindfulness requires accessing your true self because it’s part of the energy that directs the entire universe.)

##### There’s Nothing to Pursue or Attain, Not Even Nirvana

Another Mahayana idea that’s foundational to Zen is the doctrine that**there’s nothing for us to grasp at, even _nirvana_**. (One of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism is _nirvana_ , which Watts characterizes as analogous to _moksha_. _Nirvana_ is a state of awakening.) When we seek things, we fail to see that everything exists in a state of relativity, where nothing exists except in relation to other things.

The origin of this idea is unclear. Watts writes that some scholars think that one of the earliest ideas of Mahayana Buddhism was that one could be a _Bodhisattva_ and reach enlightenment by foregoing _nirvana_ until all beings can experience it. But Watts argues that the idea underlying the _Bodhisattva_ is implicit in the logic of Buddhism: _Nirvana_ is a state you reach when you stop trying to grasp reality. But if there’s nothing to grasp, then how is there anything to attain?

(Shortform note: The idea of giving up all seeking, including the pursuit of awakening, sounds counterintuitive. Experts say that a _Bodhisattva_ simply gives up their desires so they can help others achieve theirs. In _Street Zen_ , a biography of Zen monk Issan Dorsey, David Schneider writes that being a _Bodhisattva_ involves becoming the kind of person who helps others attain freedom from illusions. Schneider characterizes Dorsey as an “unlikely Bodhisattva”: He became a Zen master after being discharged from the US Navy for homosexuality, working as a drag queen, and experiencing drug addiction. Dorsey looked on people leading similar lives with “a direct, personal compassion” and established a hospice for men dying of AIDS in the 1980s.)

**The word _tathata_ , often translated as “suchness,” represents the true state of all beings, including Buddhas, people who have experienced awakening**. That means that all beings can become Buddhas. It also means that by letting go of the abstractions through which you usually see the world and yourself, you can experience the world in its “suchness.” Watts explains that the use of a word like “suchness” to describe the true nature of all beings is intended to remind us that while “meaning” is a quality of thought or language, it doesn’t exist in the actual world. In other words, the idea of a person is separate from the reality of the person.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree that _tathata_ , or suchness, is a crucial concept in Zen. In _Religions of Japan in Practice, _Jacqueline I. Stone writes that from the idea of suchness, it follows that you don’t practice Buddhism to attain Buddhahood but instead to express it. She explains that a 12th-century text called _Shinnyo kan_ , or “ _Contemplation of Suchness_ ,” posits that Buddhahood lies in the contemplation of yourself and other entities in their suchness, removed from false ideas about their permanence or separateness

### What Ideas Differentiate Zen from Other Schools of Buddhism?

While Zen was built on what came before, it’s a unique school of Mahayana Buddhism with many original ideas. In this section of the guide, we’ll explore how Zen Buddhism differs from other schools of Buddhism. The most important differences are its directness (in awakening and in teaching), its stance on meditation, and its principles about how you should use your mind.

#### Awakening Is Direct and Instantaneous

The first idea unique to Zen is its understanding of the nature of awakening. In other schools of Buddhism, you might have to work a lifetime to achieve awakening. But **in Zen, awakening is immediate and can happen anytime**. Watts explains that you don’t have to pass through a sequence of spiritual stages or spend your days in meditation to get there. Instead, awakening can occur instantaneously, an experience called _satori_. Zen teaches that you can experience awakening in everyday activities like working, creating art, and appreciating the natural world.

**The point of Zen is not to experience awakening or to attain Buddhahood because you are already a Buddha by nature**. To try to become a Buddha is to deny that you already are a Buddha. Additionally, Watts writes that you can develop _prajna_ , a kind of direct knowledge or wisdom. The principle of _prajna_ is that by seeing the relativity of everything (including the futility of the pursuit of goals), we come to know the truth of the world by not knowing it.

(Shortform note: Though Watts may make it sounds like _satori_ happens without effort, that’s not how everyone interprets the principle. Novelist and Zen teacher Peter Matthiessen—who studied Rinzai Zen, the school of Zen that emphasizes sudden awakening, and wrote Zen-inflected books such as _The Snow Leopard_ —explains that the heart of Zen is _za-zen_ , a meditation practice in which you sit in silence and bring your attention to the present moment, often by focusing in on your breath. Similarly, Buddhist teacher Andy Karr writes that sudden enlightenment typically comes after a long journey; for most people, the process of developing _prajna_ requires studying, contemplating, and meditating on Buddhist teachings.)

#### Zen Can Be Communicated Directly, Without Symbols

The second concept unique to Zen is its directness. Watts writes that **Zen is unusually direct in the way it teaches and communicates**. The Zen method of instruction, called _wen-ta_ or the “Zen story,” typically takes the form of an anecdote where a question is asked and then answered. These stories aim to point the listener toward a realization, but they aren’t symbolic: The characters don’t represent something else, and there’s no metaphor.

(Shortform note: The directness of Zen contrasts with the abstraction we’ve become accustomed to using when we experience the world. Pico Iyer, author of _The Lady and the Monk_ , writes that because of its directness in thought and teaching, Zen Buddhism is known for “slicing with a clean sword through all the Gordian knots invented by the mind.” But while directness can sound appealing, it can also make Zen very counterintuitive. A saying attributed to Bodhidharma suggests that the teachings of Zen are independent of language and instead point directly to the human mind. Therefore, you can perceive your true nature and Buddhahood not through studying Zen, but by experiencing the true nature of the world in meditation.)

Watts explains that **the directness of a Zen story is typical of Zen’s directness in communication**. A method of conveying insight called “direct pointing” involves demonstrating a Zen principle through words or actions that don’t overtly comment on the question in the story. For example, Watts explains that according to Zen tradition, the Buddha simply held up a flower to communicate awakening to his disciple Mahakasyapa—a famous example of direct pointing.

(Shortform note: The idea of nonsymbolic communication sounds paradoxical. In _Pointing at the Moon_ , Mario D’Amato writes the Buddha is thought not to have used language in the way it’s ordinarily used: The enlightened use of language involves “use,” but not “reference.” Zen Buddhist priest Norman Fischer writes that the Buddha holding up a flower “would be enough to evoke all teachings, all truths” to transmit nirvana—because there’s nothing to transmit.)

#### You Don’t Have to Control or Empty Your Mind

A third idea core to Zen’s teachings is the principle of _wu-hsin_ , or “no-mind.” Building on the Taoist philosophy of naturalness, the principle of _wu-hsin_ suggests that **instead of trying to still, empty, or purify your mind, you should let go of your control of the mind itself**.

Watts writes that when you combine _wu-hsin_ , or “no mind,” with _wu-nien_ , or “no thought,” you free your mind to act while thinking, without trying to second-guess or control it. The point of this un-self-consciousness is not to be unaware of what’s happening around you or within you, but to **shift your attention away from conscious cognitive processes and toward a spontaneous and creative state**. This involves just observing thoughts come and go, without suppressing them, holding onto them, or trying to interfere with them.

(Shortform note: Much of Western thinking about mindfulness, including its emphasis on observing but not controlling your thoughts, is derived from Zen Buddhism and the concepts of _wu-hsin_ and _wu-nien_. In _Wherever You Go, There You Are_ , Jon Kabat-Zinn draws a distinction between thinking and the awareness required in mindfulness. He explains that thinking involves actively engaging with the flow of feelings and thoughts you experience, while mindfulness requires stepping back from those thoughts and feelings to simply observe them.)

According to Watts, Zen became a new school of Buddhism because it took a new and unique view of _dhyana_ , a concept that Watts notes is often but inadequately translated as “meditation.” He explains that _dhyana_ might be better understood as a state of **awareness that’s focused on the present and unconstrained by false boundaries between “the knower, the knowing, and the known**.” In other words, Zen teaches that when we enter a state of _dhyana_ , we look beyond conventional separations to see the world for what it is.

> **How Does Science Interpret the Experience of Dhyana?**
> 
> Scholars, including scientists, offer multiple ways to interpret _dhyana_. Tim Lott writes that this Sanskrit word signifies emptiness. He explains that the basis of Zen is the idea that all of existence has a kind of “dynamic emptiness,” where matter and energy are the same and objects aren’t so much things that exist as events that happen. Lott points out that this squares with a modern scientific understanding of quantum physics (which some experts say posits a kind of emptiness where objects and events are just temporary and quantum particles blink in and out of existence, only manifesting in space-time when there’s an observer).
> 
> Watts’s explanation of _dhyana_ as a state of awareness unconstrained by boundaries might also call to mind phenomena explored in neuroscience. The experience of _dhyana_ he describes in some ways parallels the experiences of people who have undergone brain traumas localized to one hemisphere of the brain. In _My Stroke of Insight_ , Jill Bolte Taylor writes that when she had a stroke in her left hemisphere, her left brain’s capacity for logic and judgment was silenced while her right brain’s capacity for empathy and stillness was heightened.
> 
> Taylor explains that to the right brain, there’s no sense of time, there aren’t boundaries but relationships to observe, and there are no value judgments to dismiss new experiences. The right brain perceives itself and the world as on a continuum, rather than composed of separate entities (just as Watts writes that dhyana does away with the boundaries among the knower, the knowing, and the known). Taylor concludes that we all have the brain circuits to feel the sense of connection she experienced—which may be something like _dhyana_.

### Why Should You Learn Zen?

Watts also discusses why you might want to practice Zen. In this section of the guide, we’ll explore why Zen is still relevant in modern life and explain what changes you might experience by expressing it in your life.

#### Why Is Zen Still Relevant?

One reason to dedicate time and attention to learning the principles of Zen is that they’re still very relevant. Watts writes that though Zen arose in a time and place that’s very different from what people experience in the West today, **it can still help you learn some kinds of knowledge—and unlearn other kinds**.

Because of its teachings about the nature of the world and your perception of it, Zen can help you see what’s false and artificial in your view of the world. Watts points out that **your consciousness is only superficial** —just one function of your true mind—and can only attend to a small part of reality at a given time. He notes that you can access a more holistic view of the present and the world if you practice the principles of Zen.

(Shortform note: Scientists are still figuring out how your consciousness arises from your brain and enables you to experience the self that, as Watts explains, determines how you perceive life. A centuries-old explanation is “panpsychism,” the theory that consciousness is universal and emerges from matter. Another theory is that a state of matter called “perceptronium” enables atoms to process information and create subjective experience. In _Homo Deus_ , Yuval Noah Harari points out that scientists know very little about consciousness, and the dominant theory is simply that consciousness is a byproduct of neural processes.)

#### What Are the Benefits of Zen?

Another reason to learn from the principles of Zen is that you’ll notice changes in the way you experience the world when you adopt Zen ideas in your life. In this section, we’ll explain what these beneficial changes can look like.

##### Feel Liberated From Constantly Trying to Improve Yourself

The first change that Zen can help you make is to curb your innate desire to constantly improve yourself or your situation. Watts explains that **this improvement is often an illusion of dualistic thinking—an illusion we can stop buying into to end the cycle**.

He writes that we apply the same dualistic (and mistaken) pattern of thinking when we conceive of good and evil or pleasure and pain as opposite states. When you see that not only can one not exist without the other but that you can’t experience one without the other, then you stop striving against inevitable experiences like discomfort, pain, and frustration.

(Shortform note: The Zen principle of the relativity, rather than dualism, of states like pleasure and pain informs many ideas about the human experience. In _Inciting Joy_ , Ross Gay writes that it’s a “fantasy” to imagine that any emotion is separate from the others. He explains that joy isn’t the exclusion of pain or sorrow but fundamentally entangled with pain and sorrow. Joy is also what emerges when we take care of each other through suffering, sorrow, and pain, demonstrating how it’s impossible to experience one without the other.)

##### Feel Interconnected With the World, Rather Than at Its Mercy

A second change that Zen can help you make in your life comes when the practice reorients you to your relationship with the world. Watts writes that **seeing beyond dualistic thinking can help you recognize that you aren’t as separate from the world as you think**. While you think of your “self” as an entity separate from your body and your experiences, Zen teaches that those distinctions are artificial. Your idea of yourself is not your true self: It’s an abstraction you’ve constructed to feel security and sameness from one moment to the next.

Letting go of the abstract image you have of yourself can help you stop feeling that what happens to you is out of your control. It can also help you recognize that even voluntary and involuntary events are relative. Watts writes that when you experience the world in its “suchness,” you don’t experience it as an obstacle or as something that you need to control, but as something with which you’re interconnected.

(Shortform note: The realization that you’re part of the universe may be a crucial one. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach writes that the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment when he realized that all of his suffering originated in a false belief that he was separate from the rest of the world. According to Brach, it was his sense of “selfness” that caused him to constantly chase the things he thought he wanted and run away from the things he feared, mistaking the universal human condition of suffering as something that was specific and personal to him.)

##### Live in the Present—Because There Isn’t Anything Else

The third way that Zen can help change your perspective comes when a Zen understanding of relativity changes your relationship with time. Watts explains that **learning to recognize time as relative can help you feel more still and calm no matter what’s happening**. When you’re worried about the passage of time, it just seems to pass more quickly. But when you stop trying to hold onto it, its pace seems to slow.

Watts writes that a major idea of Zen is that **you don’t have anything except the present moment**. He explains that to Zen, the past and future are just abstractions, and the only moment that has any concrete reality is the one you’re living in right now. As long as you don’t label this moment the present—which implies that it’s separate from the past and from the future—then you can be awake and alive to just this moment.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle writes that the past and the future exist only in your mind, and now is the only time that truly exists. He explains that the past is just memories, and the future is just speculation. According to Tolle, stress is caused by living in the future—always anticipating or worrying about what will happen—rather than living in the present. Though it’s common to feel stressed about the future, Tolle writes that you can eliminate the stress by staying present in the now instead.)

### How Can You Experience Zen?

There’s more to Zen than just a set of philosophical principles or a chronology of religious movements, which you can understand on an intellectual level. Zen is also something that you can experience in your own life, at the level of your embodied experiences in the world. In this section of the guide, we’ll explain briefly why Zen isn’t a practice per se, and then explore the ways it’s often experienced, looking at the starting points that Watts identifies for someone new to Zen and then exploring traditional practices such as meditation, Koan training, recreation, labor, and breathing.

#### Why Is It a Mistake to Think of Zen as a “Practice”?

It’s common but not entirely correct to refer to Zen as a practice. Watts explains that to understand Zen, you have to experience it. But that doesn’t actually mean _practicing_ it in a formalized, structured way. Paradoxically, **you can’t truly practice Zen if you’re pursuing it as a goal**. Similarly, Watts writes that Zen life begins with the understanding that you can’t practice Zen to become a Buddha because you are already a Buddha.

To experience Zen, you don’t need to practice any method in particular, nor do you have to do or think about anything specific. Watts explains that Zen isn’t a means to the end of awakening; instead, **awakening, or _satori_ , comes when you don’t have a goal in mind and are instead just experiencing the present moment in the concrete world**.

(Shortform note: Not everyone agrees with Watts’s interpretation of the Zen teaching that you are perfect as you are and have just lost touch with your true nature. Journalist Jules Evans writes that according to the Buddhist nun Tenzin Palmo, you can glimpse your true nature, but you still need to practice to experience enlightenment. Evans explains that the risk inherent in following Watts’s philosophy is that you can become complacent, even egotistical, and fail to change your habits even when they cause suffering to you or to other people in your life.)

#### Where Should You Begin if You Want to Experience Zen?

It’s one thing to understand the basic principles of Zen, but it’s another to express those principles in the way you live. Watts offers two suggestions for beginning: The first involves stepping away from your abstract idea of the world, and the second involves seeking to experience the real, concrete world instead. In this section of the guide, we’ll look more closely at each of these suggestions.

##### Let Go of Illusions and the Goals That Follow From Them

To begin living a life of Zen, you first have to **stop pursuing goals that reflect the abstract idea of the world**. Watts writes that this means letting go of trying to experience the good without the bad: When you understand their relativity, then you can appreciate that there aren’t goals that can be set or achieved. Stepping away from illusions also means loosening your grip on trying to plan for a future that, according to Zen, doesn’t exist.

When you internalize the idea that there’s nothing to be gained or obtained in life, and nothing except the present, then you can realize that none of your abstract ideas about self-improvement remain relevant to your true self. The way you do things matters more than the specific things that you do (or goals you set). Watts writes that Zen doesn’t demand that you engage in any specific practice or course of action: You can experience Zen in any activity.

(Shortform note: If you’ve ever noticed that you don’t tend to feel happier after achieving a goal you’ve set for yourself—a phenomenon attributed to what psychologists call the hedonic treadmill—then the Zen idea of stopping yourself from pursuing goals might appeal to you. But it’s not quite as simple as dropping goals altogether: Buddhist monk Kinrei Bassis writes that the idea of “seeking nothing” is to stop looking for life to give you what you want, and instead focus on what it already gives you. This teaching also aligns with what psychologists recommend if you want to get off the hedonic treadmill: One way to do that is to pay attention to the positive things and acknowledge the things you feel grateful for.)

##### Experience the World Around You

The logical counterpart to stepping away from your abstract idea of the world is **opening yourself to experiencing the real, concrete world instead**. Rather than naming and classifying experiences, observe them and encounter them as they really are. Watts explains that Zen masters don’t spend their time talking about Zen. Instead, they experience Zen by focusing on the _tathata_ , the suchness or the concrete reality, of the world around them.

(Shortform note: Experiencing the world directly is easier said than done. In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris—who teaches Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a mindfulness-based form of psychotherapy—writes that you have an observing self and a thinking self. Your observing self watches the thoughts you think, the sensations you feel in your body, and the world you observe with your senses. Your thinking self naturally interprets what your observing self experiences directly and distracts you from the immediacy of reality. By connecting with your observing self, you can stop identifying with your thinking self.)

#### How Is Zen Expressed?

As we’ve discussed, it’s a basic principle of Zen that you can experience awakening at any point without having to participate in particular activities or meditate on specific ideas. However, Watts also writes that many traditional activities have historically been associated with the experience of Zen. In this section, we’ll describe the activities that have traditionally been used as an expression of Zen, including meditation, koan training, work, recreation, and breathing.

##### Meditation

One traditional Zen practice is **sitting meditation, or _za-zen_ , where you look at the world without thinking about it in abstractions**. Watts explains that this practice helps you to see the “suchness” of the world since it involves letting your ideas about it fall away and experiencing reality as it exists right now.

_Za-zen_ involves attending to what’s happening in the present moment, feeling a continuity between yourself and the world, and observing the absence of a boundary between your mind and the thoughts that run through it. This is a common way to express Zen, and Watts writes that Rinzai and Soto Zen monks spend a significant amount of time in the practice of _za-zen_. For them, the translation “sitting meditation” is literal: They practice _za-zen_ sitting on a cushion in lotus pose.

(Shortform note: Watts’s interpretation of _za-zen_ has attracted controversy. Tim Lott writes that throughout his body of work, Watts dismisses za-zen as unnecessary to the practice of Zen, an interpretation Lott characterizes as “radical.” Similarly radical is Watts’s rejection of the traditional Buddhist idea of rebirth and the conventional understanding of karma as a system of rewards and punishments that transcends the human lifespan, according to Lott. But he explains that Watts saw his job in _The Way of Zen_ as teaching the reader to think clearly, which is challenging when Zen is counterintuitive to someone with a Western perspective, and to help the reader accept that two contradictory ideas can be true at the same time.)

##### Koan Training

Another traditional way of expressing Zen is the **_sanzen_ , where pupils in the Rinzai School visit Zen masters to present their understanding of Zen stories**: _kung-an_ or koans. Watts explains that in koan training, a student undergoes a series of 50 tests that take the anecdotes of historic Zen masters as their material. The student has to demonstrate that they understand the meaning of the koan. But they can’t just explain the story in words: The demonstration must be nonverbal and intuitive, and the student discovers its form in the process of coming to understand the koan.

When the student has found an answer to the koan, they present it to the Zen master using a verse from the _Zenrin Kushu_ , a compilation of Zen writings. The student carefully selects the verse to convey what they learned from the koan.

(Shortform note: Some experts say that koan training is one of the most meaningful practices in Zen Buddhism, even though the koans themselves are sometimes described as nonsensical. In _The Three Pillars of Zen_ , Philip Kapleau Roshi writes that the purpose of koan training isn’t to lead us to enlightenment, but to “make us lose our way and drive us to despair.” That despair breaks down your assumptions and patterns of thinking so that you can discover a new perspective.)

##### Recreation and Work

Recreation and work offer another way to experience and express Zen. Watts explains that some Zen practices don’t emphasize _za-zen_ ; **Instead, they teach people to use their everyday work and pursuits as a means of meditation**. He notes that traditionally, rituals like tea ceremonies, arts such as brush drawing and flute playing, and athletic pursuits like ju-jutsu, fencing, and archery all serve as a mode of meditation.

A traditional Japanese tea ceremony, or _Chan-o-yu_ , translated as the “art of tea,” offers one way to express Zen. The tea ceremony is a ritual that, according to Watts, requires a total immersion in the present moment, as tea is prepared and served in a traditional but secular ritual.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree that the Japanese tea ceremony is rooted in Zen thought and intends to bring participants’ attention fully to the present. It takes 10 years of study to fully master the ritual of the tea ceremony and the 37 steps it takes to brew, serve, and drink tea in the ceremony.)

**Traditional forms of art offer another way to understand and experience Zen (whether you’re practicing the art or just appreciating it)**. Watts characterizes Zen art as an expression of the artist’s experience of the present moment. Sumi-e, a style of calligraphic painting, expresses spontaneity in its depiction of natural scenes. Haiku, a short form of poetry, expresses the concrete reality of a moment in time, evoking its particular mood or sensation. These arts are intended to be practiced without making an effort, performed without separating thought from action and undertaken without setting goals for the practice.

(Shortform note: Today, the form of art that’s most closely associated with Zen is monochromatic ink painting. But all forms of Zen art are meant to evoke the simplicity and importance of the natural world, so they all express two concepts called _wabi_ and _sabi_. While Watts characterizes these as moods, art experts say that they’re more amorphous and express concepts such as rusticity, melancholy, loneliness, naturalness, and age, so that the simple image in a painting or a haiku becomes evocative of something much deeper.)

**Even work can serve as an expression of Zen** when you approach it in the right mindset. Watts explains that historically, many professions and traditional crafts in Japan were regarded as lay methods for learning the principles of Taoism, Confucianism, and Zen.

(Shortform note: The importance of using your everyday activities to practice your spirituality recurs in many traditions. For example, in _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama—who is the leader of the Yellow Hat school of Tibetan Buddhism—writes that it’s important to take opportunities in your everyday life to practice a spiritual teaching or to learn a spiritual lesson. In practice, this requires maintaining a calm mind that enables you to be present and observant and being disciplined about practicing the spiritual lessons you’ve learned even in everyday situations.)

##### Breathing

Finally, you can learn to express Zen in one of your most fundamental physiological activities: breathing. Watts notes that any activity can function as meditation. But no matter what practice you adopt for practicing Zen, **a key part of Zen is breathing**. Watts explains that when we breathe reflexively, our breath tends to be shallow. Proper breathing for the experience of Zen starts with the exhale, which should completely empty the chest and abdomen of air. Then, the inhale follows easily. The goal is not to breathe as an exercise but to become aware of and observe your breath as it moves in and out of your body.

(Shortform note: According to other experts, breathing correctly is a crucial part of experiencing Zen. Zen master Ken Kushner writes that breathing for Zen meditation involves breathing from the hara, or lower abdomen. Experts say that it’s similar to the belly breathing that’s taught in yoga, with one difference: While in belly breathing, the lower abdomen expands during inhalation and contacts during exhalation, in _hara_ breathing, the lower abdomen remains expanded on exhalation. Learning to breathe correctly enables you to direct your mind during meditation, and Kushner has developed several exercises to help you find your hara.)

> **How Is Alan Watts—and _The Way of Zen_ —Regarded Today?**
> 
> In the years since _The Way of Zen_ was published in 1957, and since Watts died in 1973, much has been said about the way he lived his life and talked about the principles of Zen Buddhism and other Eastern schools of philosophical and religious thought. Watts lived a flawed private life, and according to a biography written by Monica Furlong, referred to himself as “a philosophical entertainer, a genuine fake and an irreducible rascal.” His obituary in The New York Times characterized him as “virtually a cult figure,” and he’s often called a pop philosopher.
> 
> In a column published in 1994, writer David Guy notes that Watts has been accused of learning Buddhism from books, promoting facile interpretations of Zen ideas, and failing to acknowledge the work involved in practicing Zen. Guy writes that it’s true that Watts never underwent rigorous Zen training and acknowledges as fair the criticism that _The Way of Zen_ is biased toward the idea of sudden enlightenment and places too little emphasis on discipline.
> 
> Guy notes that the central idea of all of Watts’s books is that we aren’t separate from the rest of the universe and identifies his books are a touchstone for readers undergoing a shift in consciousness away from seeing themselves as isolated individuals. Guy thinks that some of Watts’s critics have wanted him to have all the answers, though Watts never intended or promised to provide them with all the answers. He’s credited with popularizing major ideas like mindfulness in the West, and Maria Popova characterizes _The Wisdom of Insecurity_ as an “existentially necessary” book that stays with the reader for a lifetime.
> 
> Gus Carter writes that Watts “hints at the something of Buddhism” but doesn’t fully commit to it. Carter explains that for Watts, the appeal of Buddhism lay in its promise of liberation from Western individualism, anxiety, and alienation from the universe, things that many other people feel and want to change in their own lives. Through divorces and affairs, psychedelic use and alcohol abuse, Watts was a flawed human being—poet Gary Snyder said that Watts “sowed trouble wherever he went.”
> 
> Yet David Chadwick writes that Shunryu Suzuki, a Zen monk and teacher who helped popularize Zen in the United States and built the first Zen monastery outside of Asia, referred to Watts as “a great Bodhisattva.” Chadwick explains that though people can speculate about Watts’s own practice and depth of understanding and personal life, Watts taught a version of Zen that is “authentic yet contemporary and accessible” and succeeded in bringing Zen Buddhism to countless people in the western world.
