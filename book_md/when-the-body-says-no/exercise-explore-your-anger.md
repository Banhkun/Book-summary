## Exercise: Explore Your Anger

Now that we know _repressed anger_ is possibly the biggest risk factor for disease, getting in touch with any anger you’re repressing is your first step in preventing and healing illness.

* * *

Start an anger exploration journal. Begin by freewriting your life story—just write anything that feels significant in your life, focusing on your relationships from as early as you can remember up to now.

Next, go back and reread your story and try to pick out any areas where you sense some negative emotions.

Once you’ve identified areas of negativity, write out those specific stories in more detail, digging into the emotions that surface around the people, relationships, and events. What is it about these situations that makes you feel angry or hurt? Do you see any common themes emerging? (For example, _uncertainty, conflict, lack of information, or loss of control_?)

How can those negative situations be resolved? If they can’t (due to the death of the other person, for example), how might you resolve a similar situation in the future?
