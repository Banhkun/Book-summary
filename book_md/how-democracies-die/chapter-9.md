## Chapter 9: Saving American Democracy

The authors note what they view as grave threats facing American democracy today—increasing polarization, no-holds-barred electoral competition, and the abandonment of traditional democratic norms. They further argue that democratic backsliding in the U.S. has emboldened autocratic leaders around the world, from Hungary to Turkey to Russia.

In this chapter, they explore what they believe might lie ahead for American democracy and propose some **reforms that can help rescue and strengthen it.**

### The Future of U.S. Democracy

Following their comparative historical analysis of democratic failure in an international context and their examination of the threats they believe to be confronting American democracy, Levitsky and Ziblatt present three possible scenarios for the future of representative government in the United States:

  * Democratic recovery
  * Authoritarian takeover
  * Worsening polarization



#### Democratic Recovery

In Levitsky and Ziblatt’s analysis, democratic recovery represents the most optimistic vision for American democracy. In this scenario, the Trump era proves to be short-lived, leaving behind few lasting effects. For example, he could lose his bid for reelection with Republicans suffering major electoral defeats at the federal, state, and local levels. Alternatively, he could be removed from office via impeachment or resignation.

As Levitsky and Ziblatt envision it, Trump would be swiftly replaced by new pro-democratic reforms that strengthen the republic. Future historians might look back on the Trump years as a brief aberration, a period during which America stared into the brink of authoritarianism and decided to step back.

However, the authors consider this scenario unlikely. They argue that **the forces within the Republican Party that enabled Trump long preceded him** —and they are likely to be in place long after he is gone from the political scene. In their ultimate analysis, Trump is more of a _symptom_ than a _cause_ of the current democratic crisis.

> **Has American Democracy Recovered?**
> 
> Since the publication of _How Democracies Die_ at the beginning of 2018, one could argue that the U.S. _has_ witnessed many of the events Levitsky and Ziblatt would associate with democratic recovery—a scenario they rate as unlikely. The 2018 midterm elections delivered what political analysts called a “blue wave,” with Democrats picking up a net 41 seats in the House of Representatives and winning the House popular vote by nearly 10 million—the party’s best showing since 1974 and the largest congressional popular vote difference in American history.
> 
> Following the Democratic takeover of the House, Trump was impeached twice (although not removed from office) and was defeated in the 2020 presidential election. If we accept Levitsky and Ziblatt’s analysis, this would seem to indicate a robust pushback by pro-democracy forces.

#### Authoritarian Takeover

The next scenario presented by Levitsky and Ziblatt is what they see as the darkest. This is a world in which the Republican Party continues to score electoral success with its shrinking and increasingly radicalized white Christian base. They see **the Republican Party using its majorities at the federal and state levels to rig the rules in its favor** and reshape the courts, gerrymander the electorate, and systematically disempower non-whites through voter ID laws, mass deportations, and harsh immigration restrictions.

> **The Ongoing Threat to U.S. Democracy**
> 
> There is some evidence to back up Levitsky and Ziblatt’s argument that a Republican Party catering more and more exclusively to the interests of its predominantly white base can still be electorally viable—even when significant majorities of the American electorate as a whole oppose it.
> 
> Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush and Donald Trump each won their elections in 2000 and 2016 respectively despite losing the popular vote. And some scholars believe that this is a scenario that’s likely to repeat itself. One model produced by the University of Texas predicts that Republicans will win 65% of the presidential elections in which they lose the popular vote by two percentage points or less, owing to the structural advantage the Electoral College gives to small, predominantly rural states—which, in the modern era, tend to lean heavily Republican.
> 
> This raises concerns that a minority Republican Party will be able to wield substantial political power far out of proportion to the actual number of votes it receives—and that it will use these structural advantages to further entrench itself.

#### Worsening Polarization

**The third scenario highlighted by the authors is one of continually worsening polarization**. They present this middle ground as the most likely course for U.S. democracy, citing the example of North Carolina as a possible glimpse into the nation’s future.

When Republicans took control of the state legislature there in 2010, they passed what the authors describe as one of the most aggressive and racially discriminatory gerrymanders in the country. This new electoral map was designed to virtually guarantee Republican supermajorities in the state legislature and congressional delegation, even in election cycles where the party was outvoted by Democrats.

This Republican majority also worked with the Republican governor to pass some of the harshest voter ID laws in the nation, while reducing early voting and ending voting pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds. According to the authors, these were nakedly partisan and anti-democratic maneuvers, done solely to make it more onerous for their political opponents to exercise the franchise.

When voters elected a Democratic governor in 2016, the Republican legislature continued its hardball tactics, using its veto-proof majority to strip powers from the incoming governor, allowing them to pack the state executive branch with GOP partisans—even after losing the election. Levitsky and Ziblatt cite these measures as extreme violations of institutional forbearance.

> **Resistance to Gerrymandering**
> 
> Since the publication of How Democracies Die in 2018, there have been new developments in North Carolina. In 2019, the state courts in North Carolina ruled that the state’s gerrymandered maps of congressional districts were unconstitutional. The court ruled that the maps violated freedom of speech and assembly, equal protection under the law, and a state constitutional guarantee of free and fair elections. The courts also threw out North Carolina’s state legislative maps in 2019 on similar grounds. This suggests that judicial challenges to biased legislative maps could be one possible avenue of resistance to gerrymandering and other anti-democratic tactics.
> 
> The new maps, however, still appear to confer an advantage on the Republican Party. In the 2020 state legislative elections, Democrats received 49% of the statewide vote but ended up controlling only 42.5% of the seats.

### Broad Coalitions

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that pro-democratic forces must overcome America’s deep structural divisions if they are to preserve democracy.

**They advocate the forging of broad, pro-democratic coalitions that cut across racial, ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic lines**. In their analysis, it is not enough to simply build interest groups of like-minded activists. A broad coalition would entail liberals reaching out to conservative businesspeople, evangelicals, gun owners, and other traditional opponents. These groups all have sharp disagreements with one another on a range of issues, but would all potentially stand to lose if authoritarianism and lawlessness gained a stranglehold over the country.

The authors contend that such broad coalitions can be enormously beneficial. By their very nature and composition, they can appeal to a broader slice of the country and transcend the partisan divide. This partial defusing of partisan tensions, they argue, can lead to _de_ polarization, which in turn, strengthens democratic norms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance.

> **Working Toward Depolarization**
> 
> Some research suggests that the depolarization envisioned by Levitsky and Ziblatt is indeed possible. Stanford scholars James Fishkin and Larry Diamond have seen some positive results with a technique called Deliberative Democracy. Through Deliberative Democracy, people from different backgrounds come together as “citizen delegates” to participate in a discussion about contentious political issues, consider the merits of opposing arguments, and try to consciously set aside their partisan labels.
> 
> In 2020, Fishkin and Diamond conducted an experiment called “America in One Room,” in which they brought together a representative sample of 500 Americans to discuss a range of hot-button issues from healthcare reform to global warming to immigration. Through moderated, small-group discussions, the researchers found that participants developed increased empathy for their opponents and gained a better understanding of how policy proposals would affect them.
> 
> The exercise seemed to deliver real results. At the beginning of the experiment, researchers found sharp divisions between partisans on all 26 issues under discussion. But after building mutual empathy and understanding, they were able to find significant common ground on 19 of the 26 issues. Currently, Fishkin and Diamond are working on a digital engagement tool that would enable them to implement Deliberative Democracy on a nationwide scale.

### What Republicans Can Do

**Levitsky and Ziblatt identify extreme partisan polarization as the main driver of the destruction of American democratic norms like mutual respect and institutional forbearance.** Much of why the Republican Party is in such a deeply dysfunctional state, they assert, can be attributed to its ethnic and religious homogeneity as the party of white Christians—a shrinking demographic. As long as it maintains this basic structure,**the Republican Party will be unable to act as a pro-democratic force—especially in an increasingly diverse society**.

Accordingly, the authors recommend that the GOP moderate its hardline right-wing social and economic ideology and abandon what they see as its appeals to white nationalism. They believe these moves will help the party broaden its appeal to a more diverse cross-section of the electorate, much of which might be attracted to certain aspects of conservatism, but is turned away by the party’s extremism on cultural issues. Only when it becomes a big-tent party that straddles religious and ethnic lines, say Levitsky and Ziblatt, can the Republican Party resume its function as the center-right tentpole of American democracy.

> **GOP 2020 Gains With Minority Voters**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt decry what they see as the drift of the GOP toward white ethnonationalist politics, the Republican Party gained support among Black and Latino voters in the 2020 elections over previous cycles.
> 
> According to exit polls, Trump gained four percentage points with African Americans, three with Hispanics and Latinos, and five with Asian Americans when we compare his 2016 performance with his 2020 performance. And it had a real impact. Analysis of these results shows that Trump’s improved standing with these voters helped Republicans win close races in Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. This suggests that, contrary to what the authors say, Republicans may _already_ have a path to broadening their coalition without significantly altering their policy agenda.

### What Democrats Can Do

Levitsky and Ziblatt see the challenges facing the Democratic Party a bit differently. While they do _not_ attribute the slide toward norm-breaking to the Democrats, they do argue that the party has a crucial role to play in rescuing American democracy.

**They urge the Democratic Party to use its position as the nation’s center-left party to ameliorate what they see as one of the main drivers of extreme polarization—widening income inequality**.

They call on Democrats to reject their traditional support for means-tested benefits, which are targeted to lower-income people but taper off as one’s income level rises. These programs tend to instill in middle-class people a belief that the government is taking their hard-earned money and giving it to the undeserving poor. And since poverty and race are so inextricably intertwined in the U.S., the authors argue that means-tested programs only add fuel to the fire of racial resentment on the part of whites—further driving the radicalization of the GOP.

Instead, they insist, Democrats should embrace universal benefits like childcare, healthcare, and even a universal basic income.**** Because _everyone_ benefits from this version of the welfare state, it can be supported by a broader political coalition—one that cuts across racial, cultural, and socioeconomic lines.

> **The Pitfalls of Universal Basic Income**
> 
> Closely tied to Levitsky and Ziblatt’s proposal to replace targeted, means-tested programs with universal benefits is an idea that has gained steam over the last few years—universal basic income (UBI). In 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made it his signature issue, and it’s attracted more and more adherents, on both sides of the aisle.
> 
> The most radical version of UBI would replace _all_ existing public benefits (such as unemployment, veteran’s benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security) as well as tax benefits (like standard deductions, personal exemptions, and child and family allowances) with a regular, universal cash payment for everyone. Unfortunately, contrary to Levitsky and Ziblatt’s hopes for a more universal benefit system, studies show that replacing the existing means-tested welfare state with UBI would actually _increase the number of people living in poverty_. This would be especially true for people over 65—especially the poorest seniors, who already receive far more from benefits like Social Security and Medicare than they would from UBI.

### Democracy: A Shared Enterprise

Ultimately, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that it will take committed citizens, not a single political leader or party, to renew American democracy. Democracy is a team sport and shared enterprise in which all participate together. Society can make the collective choice to destroy democracy—or enable it to thrive in a new, multiracial, multicultural society.

In the authors’ analysis, governing norms like mutual toleration and institutional forbearance were stronger in an earlier age of American politics—but only when the nation’s white majority enjoyed the exclusive privilege of making political decisions. Although that era of explicit white political dominance is over, the move toward greater racial equity also prompted a backlash that destroyed those norms.

**The key now is to move American politics to a place where it both embodies strong democratic norms _and_ guarantees effective political representation** for all members of today’s diverse society. Only then will American democracy be on truly solid ground.

(Shortform note: Critics have argued that the norms Levitsky and Ziblatt celebrate are not tenable in a truly diverse society. Therefore, a return to them won’t guarantee a truly multiracial democracy. We explore this argument in the next chapter.)
