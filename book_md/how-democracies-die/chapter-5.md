## Chapter 5: The Role of Norms

Levitsky and Ziblatt’s central thesis is that constitutions and written rules are not, by themselves, enough to protect democracy. They argue that, in fact,**it is political _norms—_ the _unwritten_ rules that govern political conduct—that provide the best protection for democracy. **

In the authors’ model of a well-functioning democracy, political actors adhere to shared norms governing what is and is not acceptable behavior, regardless of what might be technically permitted by the written rules.

(Shortform note: As mentioned in the Shortform Introduction, we’ve started our guide with Levitsky and Ziblatt’s Chapter 5, which lays out the book’s central thesis: that informal, unwritten democratic _norms_ are the main guardrails of a functioning democratic system. We’ve made some other restructuring and reordering choices throughout this guide and have noted these editorial choices where they occur.)

### Mutual Toleration and Institutional Forbearance

The two main democratic norms Levitsky and Ziblatt highlight are mutual toleration and institutional forbearance. The authors define mutual toleration as accepting the legitimacy of one’s political opponents and acknowledging their right to govern, as long as they win in free and fair elections—regardless of ideological differences.

The second norm Levitsky and Ziblatt identify is institutional forbearance. This is the unwritten rule by which **political actors agree not to weaponize their control of institutions to marginalize their opponents.** For example, the majority party in the legislature might technically have the _legal_ authority to uniformly and unequivocally block the judicial nominations of a president of the opposite party. But doing so would not only hamper the functioning of the judiciary, but be a violation of the norm of institutional forbearance. This could lead to a tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation—resulting in the ultimate destruction of democracy.

> **Judicial Appointments and** **Constitutional Hardball**
> 
> Other commentators had explored these themes before Levitsky and Ziblatt. In a 2004 paper titled “Constitutional Hardball,” Georgetown Law professor Mark Tushnet argued that when one side in a political system decides to abandon unwritten norms to secure some short-term partisan advantage, the other side often feels it has little choice but to respond in kind. This set of practices is known (as the title of his paper would suggest) as constitutional hardball—when politicians**** abandon restraint and abuse their institutional prerogatives to maximize their advantage over their opponents.
> 
> Tushnet identified two examples of such constitutional hardball from recent American history. The first episode was the highly unusual use of the filibuster (a parliamentary procedure to indefinitely prolong debate on a bill) by the minority Senate Democrats in 2002-03 to block Republican President George W. Bush’s federal judicial appointments. Tushnet argues that, while this behavior did not violate any _law_ , it was nonetheless a breach of longstanding _norms_ and customs within the Senate, dictating that a minority party ought not abuse parliamentary procedures to obstruct the majority.
> 
> Another example Tushnet cites is the 2003 redistricting of Texas’s state legislative and congressional districts by the Republican-dominated state legislature. While state legislatures do have the right to redraw political boundaries, they usually do so immediately following the decennial census. The timing of the 2003 redistricting was highly unusual in that it occurred out of cycle, between the 2000 and 2010 censuses.
> 
> The new district lines were also drawn so as to maximize partisan advantage for the Republicans at the state and federal levels. In response to this episode of norm-breaking, Democrats in the state legislature responded with their _own_ violation of political norms—by literally fleeing the state so as to deny the majority Republicans a quorum and temporarily prevent a vote on the redistricting plan from taking place. Ultimately, however, enough of the holdout Democrats returned to the legislature, which created a quorum that allowed the plan to pass.

### Examples of Norm-Breaking and Constitutional Hardball

Recent history offers several examples of democratic-norm breaking by powerful political leaders.

#### Example #1: Rodrigo Duterte and Media Repression in the Philippines

In 2016, Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines. Before his elevation to the nation’s highest office, Duterte served as mayor of Davao City, the country’s third-largest city. As mayor, Duterte was known for his hardline tactics against small-time drug dealers and had given public praise to extrajudicial death squads that are believed to have slaughtered approximately 1,400 petty criminals in the city during his mayoralty. Critics allege that Duterte even used his office to actively _encourage_ this vigilante violence by directing police and investigators not to look into the slayings—effectively weaponizing the powers of the state to serve his political interests (which Levitsky and Ziblatt would label a violation of institutional forbearance).

As president, Duterte has continued his hardball, anti-democratic tactics to silence and intimidate journalists. One online media outlet, Rappler, has been banned from participating in press conferences, its journalists have been subjected to death and rape threats on social media platforms by Duterte-aligned bots and trolls, and the company has been selectively targeted by state prosecutors on trumped-up financial charges.

#### Example #2: Jair Bolsonaro and the Delegitimization of Brazilian Democracy

In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president of Brazil. Known for his fiery right-wing populist style, Bolsonaro came to power by presenting himself as an outside alternative to the corrupt and ineffective Brazilian political establishment, which had presided over a 9% contraction of the nation’s economy and mass unemployment.

In office, Bolsonaro has faced his own accusations of corruption and nepotism and has been investigated by the Supreme Court. In response, Bolsonaro has discussed with his top advisers the possibility of using the military to depose the Supreme Court and replace it with loyalists, compiled extensive dossiers on critics in the government and academia, and given the state intelligence services broad latitude to harass and intimidate his political opponents.

### The Dangers of Polarization

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that**extreme political polarization is often the decisive factor in triggering the abandonment of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance.** They define polarization as the disappearance of the middle ground in politics, in which parties do not differ merely on basic ideology or matters of public policy—but, instead, are sorted into mutually incompatible worldviews. If a party comes to believe that its opponents simply cannot be trusted to hold power,**it becomes easier to rationalize _any_ means to prevent those opponents from attaining power.**

> **The Growing Partisanship of American Politics**
> 
> Other scholars have explored this theme of polarization and the threat it poses to stable democratic governance. In _Why We’re Polarized_ (2020), political journalist Ezra Klein observes that American voters have become more and more reliably partisan. In the 1970s, the typical voter was far more likely to split their ticket between Republicans and Democrats by voting for one party at the presidential level and for the other party at the congressional and state levels. Back then, there was only a slight 0.54 correlation between someone’s vote for president and their vote for House or Senate. But today, there is a near-perfect 0.97 correlation.
> 
> Klein argues that this is due to the growing ideological homogeneity of the two major parties and the consolidation within them of two monolithic and mutually exclusive worldviews—across which it’s become impossible to seek common ground. Furthermore, partisanship has become a closely held form of identity for many American voters because it is now bundled together with so many other forms of identity such as race, gender, and religion.
> 
> As we’ll see later in _How Democracies Die_ , Levitsky and Ziblatt delve further into the problem of polarization and offer some tentative suggestions for how to address it. Despite the attempt, however, they don’t fully address just how difficult it is to get people to question their core political beliefs and identities. In fact, political scientist Norm Ornstein points to studies showing that when you expose partisans to the views of the other side, they become more entrenched and unflinching in their own political identities.
