## Chapters 2-3: The Rise and Fall of American Parties

Extremism is nothing new in American politics, and it certainly existed before the rise of Donald Trump in 2016. Levitsky and Ziblatt have argued that—by acting as responsible gatekeepers— mainstream, institutional political parties are the best defense against an authoritarian takeover.

But they also make the case that the American political system—and political parties in particular—used to be far more effective at filtering out extremists and keeping them from the levers of power. In this chapter, they explore the processes by which, in their analysis, the two major U.S. parties lost this ability during the second half of the 20th century.

(Shortform note: Since Chapters 2 and 3 are thematically and narratively linked, we’ve merged them into one chapter. We’ve also moved them to _follow_ the analysis of democratic norms, party gatekeeping, and authoritarian tactics.)

### Smoke-Filled Rooms: Guardrails Against Extremists

According to the authors, **party insiders once played a decisive role in choosing nominees for the presidency.** These were the proverbial “smoke-filled rooms” of party conventions and caucuses. A candidate had to win over such party insiders to even have a _chance_ of winning a major-party nomination. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that this crucial gatekeeping function is why an outsider like Henry Ford ( a notorious conspiracy theorist and rabid anti-Semite who sought a major-party nomination in 1924) never had much of a chance as a presidential candidate—despite his popularity with rank-and-file voters.

Over a generation later, George Wallace suffered a similar fate. Wallace, a staunch segregationist and supporter of American racial apartheid who ran for president in 1968, was considered unacceptable by the leadership of both major parties. As such, he was forced to mount a third-party bid for the presidency in 1968 under the American Independent Party banner. Given America’s two-party system and the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College, this doomed his longshot presidential bid to failure.

> **George Wallace’s Legacy**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that Wallace had little long-term impact on American politics due to being constrained by the two major parties, he might be more accurately understood as a deeply significant figure. Besides earning an impressive share of the popular vote in the 1968 election (13.5%), he also earned 46 electoral votes by winning the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana. To date, he remains the last third-party presidential candidate to win _any_ votes in the Electoral College, a feat that subsequent high-profile challengers like Ross Perot and Ralph Nader never managed to achieve.
> 
> Moreover, Wallace understood full well that he had little chance of winning the Electoral College. His strategy was instead predicated on winning enough states in the Deep South to deny both the Republicans and Democrats the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. This would have then thrown the election to the House of Representatives, where Wallace hoped his Southern Democrat allies would hand him the presidency. In fact, this very nearly happened. Had a relative handful of votes in a few states like Tennessee, South Carolina, Illinois, or Ohio shifted, neither Richard Nixon nor Hubert Humphrey would have received enough electoral votes to clinch victory.
> 
> Lastly, observers have argued that Wallace’s 1968 bid represented a significant event in the long-term realignment of the two major parties. His surprisingly competitive campaign and his success in the Deep South helped draw many white Southerners out of their longtime political home in the Democratic Party. By loosening their traditional allegiance to the Democrats, Wallace helped start the process by which these same voters would ultimately become the new conservative base of the Republican Party.

### The Demise of the Old Party System

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that this old party system began to decay in the 1970s, when both the Democratic and Republican parties changed their rules governing presidential nominations. They date the beginning of this process to the turbulent events of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Party delegates, deeply divided over the Vietnam War, entered the convention with no clear consensus on who the nominee should be, as no candidate had secured a majority of delegates during the primaries. At the convention, party insiders installed Vice President Hubert Humphrey—a candidate perceived as being pro-war because he served in the incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson administration—as the nominee, despite him not having competed in any primaries. The authors contend that rank-and-file delegates, many of whom were bitterly opposed to the war, took Humphrey’s nomination as a deep betrayal.

But this was to be the last such presidential nomination carried out in this fashion. At a time when people were taking to the streets to protest the Vietnam War and popular candidates like the recently slain Robert F. Kennedy had helped open the door to a more representative form of party politics, the installation by a handful of party insiders of Humphrey at the top of the ticket was no longer considered acceptable.

According to the authors, the circumstances under which Humphrey was nominated dealt a crushing blow to the old party boss system and prompted calls for reform.

> **Hubert Humphrey: Party Reformer?**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt describe the perception of Humphrey in 1968 to be that of a stodgy political insider, he actually spent much of his career fighting for the expansion of political representation and for the enfranchisement of politically powerless minorities—often despite bitter opposition _from_ Democratic Party insiders.
> 
> A staunch liberal, Humphrey was one of the party’s early pioneers in the fight for civil rights. At the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Humphrey shocked the political world (and outraged Southern Democrats) by delivering a floor speech in which he called for the Democratic Party to abandon the cause of “states’ rights” (by which Southern Democrats rationalized the disenfranchisement and segregation of African-Americans) and instead embrace the cause of _human_ rights.
> 
> The reaction from the South’s party leaders was swift and fierce. Southern delegates bolted the convention and nominated their own candidate, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, under the banner of the States’ Rights Democratic Party.

#### The McGovern-Fraser Commission

In response to the chaos of the 1968 convention, the McGovern-Fraser Commission—a panel convened by the national Democratic Party—shifted the party to a system of state-level primaries for the 1972 presidential election. Instead of state bosses and other party elites choosing the party’s nominee, rank-and-file party members would directly elect delegates to the national convention, giving voters direct control over the presidential nomination process for the first time. Similar rules were adopted by the Republican Party before the 1972 presidential election.

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that these reforms marked the death knell of the old gatekeeper system. _Anyone_ could now run for the nomination and completely circumvent the traditional gatekeepers—opening the door to outsiders and extremists to capture major-party nominations.

One of the first “outsider” candidates to take advantage of the new nomination process was the U.S. Senator George McGovern—one of the co-chairs of the 1972 McGovern-Fraser Commission. McGovern used his mastery of the new primary system to win the Democratic Party nomination in 1972. An anti-Vietnam War candidate long considered to be on the far left of the Democratic Party, McGovern was precisely the kind of candidate that would have been highly unlikely to be nominated under the old system. He went on to lose in a historic landslide to incumbent Richard Nixon in the 1972 general election.

> **Extremist Candidates Under the Old Party System**
> 
> Levitsky and Ziblatt’s argument that the old, pre-1970s party system was successful at keeping insurgent outsiders from winning presidential nominations doesn’t quite stand up to scrutiny. For example, in 1896, 1900, and 1908, the fiery populist orator William Jennings Bryan won the Democratic nomination despite strong opposition from party establishment figures. And in 1964, U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater—a figure who contemporary politicos believed was too far to the right to be nominated and win—successfully captured the Republican nomination in the teeth of strong opposition from mainstream party leaders like Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon.
> 
> Both Bryan and Goldwater did, however, go down to landslide defeats in their respective general election campaigns—suggesting that perhaps party leaders were prescient in trying to block their nominations.

### The New Party Nomination System

At first, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, the new nomination system appeared to work quite well. Party insiders may no longer have been in direct control of the delegates on the convention floor, but **the parties were initially successful at defeating the campaigns of insurgent outsiders**. Such candidates—like Pat Robertson and Steve Forbes, who ran for the GOP nomination in 1988 and 2000, respectively—generated lots of enthusiasm and media coverage, but they fell far short of party presidential nominations.

(Shortform note: Across two presidential runs in 1996 and 2000, Forbes spent $69 million of his personal fortune. Despite this largesse, the billionaire publishing executive won zero primaries during either of his failed campaigns and secured only 21 delegates. At over $3.2 million-per-delegate, Forbes may have gotten the worst return on investment of any presidential candidate in the modern era.)

#### Vulnerability to Celebrities

Still, Levitsky and Ziblatt contend that bids like Robertson’s and Forbes’s should have been seen as early warning signs of just **how vulnerable the new system could be to hostile takeovers by outsiders with lots of money and high name recognition—in other words, celebrities**. These candidates earned a great deal of coverage from the media, which greatly boosted their already-considerable national profiles.

Before running, Robertson was already a famous televangelist, who boasted a built-in audience of millions of loyal viewers. Forbes, meanwhile, was a famous businessman with billions of dollars of his own money to spend—he could bypass traditional party donors, because he didn’t _need_ to raise money from them.

The authors also point to the rise of alternative media like Twitter and Facebook, as well as explicitly ideological and partisan media (especially on the conservative side of American politics) as forces that served to weaken the parties as institutions. Through these media channels, they argue, an outsider celebrity candidate could get their message across far more easily and communicate directly with their supporters. Media and technology, like the nomination process itself, had become democratized.

All of these factors were in place by 2015, when Donald Trump launched his bid for the Republican nomination. They were to give his campaign, at first considered a longshot, a decisive advantage and prove once and for all that the old system of party gatekeeping was truly gone.

> **The “Fox Effect”**
> 
> Even before Trump launched his campaign in 2015, political analysts had long studied the influential role of right-wing media in national politics.
> 
> In a 2006 paper titled “The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting,” researchers Stefano DellaVigna of the University of California at Berkeley and Ethan Kaplan of Stockholm University argued that the Republican Party benefited substantially from the debut of Fox News in U.S. cable markets in October 1996. According to their analysis of the data, the GOP gained between 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points in its share of the presidential vote between 1996 and 2000 in towns and cities where Fox News was available. They further calculate that the cable news outlet persuaded between 3 and 28% of its total audience to vote Republican.
> 
> Given the incredibly close margins in the 2000 presidential election, DellaVigna and Kaplan’s findings would indicate that George W. Bush owed his victory in the state of Florida (and thus, the election) to Fox News, which the researchers estimate to have generated 10,000 votes for the Republican above and beyond what he would have gotten in the state if the channel didn’t exist. This was more than enough to provide the margin of victory in a state that was decided by less than 600 votes.

### Donald Trump: Outsider Candidate

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that the nomination and election of Donald Trump in 2016 represented the culmination and direct consequence of this loss of power by party elites. They label Trump as a singularly dangerous figure whom Republican leaders were unable and, ultimately, unwilling to stop during the primary—and whose ultimate success they enabled in the general election campaign.

They assert that when Trump launched his campaign for the Republican nomination in June 2015, he was a novelty candidate who stood little chance of actually winning. A total outsider to GOP politics, he had no close institutional ties to the party and seemed to lack even the most basic grounding in conservative ideology—not to mention his anti-immigration rhetoric that many leaders in the Republican Party considered to be extreme and outlandish.

(Shortform note: It should be noted, however, that many of Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination—including Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal, Chris Christie, and Lindsey Graham—adopted similarly harsh rhetoric against immigrants during the course of the campaign, putting forward proposals to ban birthright citizenship and even authorize the use of military drones at the U.S.-Mexico border.)

But, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, Trump’s pre-existing celebrity as a real estate maven and reality television host of _The Apprentice_ was his secret weapon in the primary—something that gave him near-universal name recognition among GOP primary voters and helped him promote himself as a successful, hard-nosed businessman with the skills to bring the nation to prosperity.

(Shortform note: Trump’s name recognition _was_ truly exceptional, even at the very earliest stages of the primary contest. According to Gallup, by July 2015, just a month after announcing his candidacy, 92% of Republican voters reported being familiar with Trump—compared to 66% for Ted Cruz, 64% for Marco Rubio, and 35% for John Kasich.)

#### Media Dominance

Levitsky and Ziblatt also argue that Trump’s ability to dominate coverage on right-leaning media outlets like Fox News gave him a connection with Republican voters that was nearly impossible for party elites to break.

Although Trump had secured no major endorsements from leading party figures before the Iowa caucuses on February 1—and picked up hardly any even _after_ winning early primaries and emerging as a clear frontrunner—**the lack of endorsements turned out not to matter much at all**.

Levitsky and Ziblatt rate the assets Trump _did_ have as far more valuable than endorsements. For he had the loyalty of influential right-wing media figures like Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and the popular website Breitbart News. Combined with his high name recognition, this enabled him to communicate with his supporters directly, get his message out, and earn far more coverage than high-profile endorsements or campaign donations ever could.

(Shortform note: The origins of Trump’s relationship with Fox News actually predate the 2016 campaign. In 2011, the network’s co-founder and famous GOP operative Roger Ailes gave Trump a standing call-in slot on the channel’s popular morning show, _Fox and Friends_ , which further helped cement Trump’s relationship with Fox’s Republican-leaning audience.)

> **The Trump-Fox News Connection**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt don’t devote much space to the subject, this symbiotic relationship between Trump and the conservative media ecosystem became a defining feature of his _presidency_ as well as his candidacy. Popular hosts on right-leaning Fox News—like Sean Hannity, who spoke at Trump rallies during the president’s 2020 reelection bid—went on to become open surrogates for President Trump.
> 
> Fox News also shaped Trump’s presidential rhetoric and was a major force in guiding the Trump administration’s policy actions. Stories on Fox—like the alleged “caravan” of migrants headed to the U.S. southern border in fall 2018 or the debunked conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee had had a staffer murdered—quickly found themselves amplified on Trump’s Twitter feed. As progressive journalist Brian Beutler argues in _Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth _(2020), Trump even fired cabinet secretaries on the basis of attacks by Fox News hosts.

But, argue Levitsky and Ziblatt, it wasn’t just conservative media that boosted Trump. **He also excelled at generating enormous quantities of free coverage in the _mainstream_ media**. He achieved this thanks to 1) being a major celebrity _before_ he launched his campaign and 2) generating controversy—and thus, coverage—through outlandish and extreme statements. In effect, the media system _rewarded_ him for his extremism. Levitsky and Ziblatt cite one study done after the election that showed that Trump’s antics generated approximately $2 billion worth of free media coverage—something that all the endorsements in the world couldn’t buy.

> **The Power of Free Media**
> 
> Levitsky and Ziblatt point to Trump’s success in garnering free media, but it’s important to flesh out their argument and put his performance in context with that of his Republican rivals.
> 
> The data appears to show that free media coverage (which, unlike campaign ads, isn’t purchased directly by the campaign) was the most important asset in securing the nomination. Through February 2016, Trump’s paid advertising spending paled in comparison to that of ultimately ill-fated candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio—who spent $82 and $55 million on paid ads to Trump’s comparatively minuscule $10 million during the same period.
> 
> But he earned _free_ media coverage estimated at approximately $2 billion—nearly 10 times the $214 million worth of free coverage earned by his closest rival, Jeb Bush.

#### Constrained by Nomination Rules

Thus, boosted by name recognition and an uncanny ability to generate media coverage through extreme statements, Trump emerged as the clear frontrunner for the nomination, to the shock of many GOP insiders. Levitsky and Ziblatt do note that some party activists organized plots to change the rules at the convention to “unbind” delegates and let even those pledged to Trump (by virtue of him having won primaries in their states) vote instead for another candidate on the first ballot.

(Shortform note: For example, some conservative groups like the Our Principles PAC attempted to lobby the 168 members of the Republican National Committee to deny Trump the nomination in advance of the convention and even ran anti-Trump television advertisements in key primary states.)

But, as Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, these plans had little institutional backing from within the party and ultimately had little impact on events. The authors argue that this failure can be attributed to the fact that **the rules of the nomination process made it impossible to deny Trump the nomination** once he’d secured a majority of pledged delegates. These Trump delegates were bound by party rules to vote at the convention for the candidate who won their states’ primaries—Donald Trump.

In a previous era, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, party leaders might have been able to successfully organize an effort to block Trump. But by 2016, it was primary voters, media figures, and celebrity candidates like Trump who held the real power. GOP voters, with whom Trump was already enormously popular, had overwhelmingly chosen him as the nominee and party leaders lacked any politically realistic mechanism to stop him.

> **The “Nuclear Option”**
> 
> The authors don’t note that some delegates at the party convention were bound by state law (not just party rules) to support Trump at the convention by virtue of him having won their states’ primaries. Thus, Trump’s nomination can’t entirely be blamed on what they present as the fecklessness of the Republican Party.
> 
> Still, Trump _might_ have been stopped at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Some commentators pointed out that a majority of delegates could choose to exercise the so-called “nuclear option” by changing the rules on the floor to allow them to vote for the candidate of their choice, rather than the one to whom they were bound by primary voters. Since many pledged delegates were state and local party officials who were not necessarily personally loyal to Trump, some argued that the real estate mogul could have been defeated if the delegates were free to vote their conscience at the convention.
> 
> Notably, 2016 was _not_ the first time such a course of action was considered. At the 1980 Democratic National Convention, challenger Ted Kennedy attempted to block the re-nomination of incumbent President Jimmy Carter by having his delegates force a floor vote on exactly this kind of rule change. The Kennedy and Carter campaigns each launched furious lobbying efforts to convince delegates to support the rule change (in Kennedy’s case) or oppose it (in Carter’s case). Kennedy’s effort ultimately failed and Carter was re-nominated.

#### Standing With Trump Vs. Standing for Democracy

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that the final failure of the GOP to stop Donald Trump—a candidate whom they regard as deeply abnormal and authoritarian—came in the general election against Hillary Clinton.

They posit that Trump satisfied all four of their criteria for authoritarianism:

  * **He rejected the rules of normal democratic competition** by accusing the Democratic Party of using illegal immigrants to perpetrate a massive voter fraud scheme and indicated that he would not accept the results of the election if he lost.
  * **He denied the legitimacy of his political opponents** with his embrace and spread of birtherism (the conspiracy theory alleging that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States), and his calls for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned.
  * **He openly encouraged violence at his rallies** , on several occasions even offering to pay the legal fees of supporters who beat up anti-Trump protestors.
  * **He advocated the curtailing of the civil liberties of his opponents** with his promises to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton and his announced intention to change libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists who criticized him.



(Shortform note: Although he knew that the claims made by “birthers,” like Donald Trump, were unfounded, President Obama understood that racialized fearmongering directed at himself—the nation’s first African-American president—could be a potent political force. In an attempt to confront the charges head-on, Obama famously mocked Trump for his birtherism (to Trump’s face) at the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner. To learn more about Obama’s reflections on his presidency, including his response to the birtherism charges, read our guide to his memoir, A Promised Land.)

Levitsky and Ziblatt state that such a figure becoming the nominee of a major political party was an unprecedented development in American politics.**** According to them**,** GOP leaders faced a choice in the general election: to stand with Trump or to stand for democracy.

> **Is Donald Trump Really an Authoritarian?**
> 
> Despite Levitsky and Ziblatt’s assertion that candidate Trump exhibited clear authoritarian tendencies, some commentators—even on the left—questioned his authoritarianism as _president_.
> 
> Shortly after Trump became president, liberal political theorist Corey Robin argued that Trump’s alleged authoritarianism was more talk than action, citing Trump’s failure to fill the overwhelming majority of offices in the executive branch, leaving 85% of jobs either vacant or staffed with holdovers from the Obama administration. Robin argued that if Trump truly wished to subvert democracy, he and his allies would have made seizing control of key positions at the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security, and the intelligence agencies one of their top priorities. Their failure to do so indicated that Trump’s often bombastic remarks were more bluster than statements of intent.

### Party Over Country

Unfortunately, when faced with this choice, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that **GOP leaders chose to stand with Trump, putting their narrow partisan interests over their responsibility as democratic gatekeepers**.

The authors believe that prominent GOP leaders _could_ have made the opposite choice—to cross party lines and support Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. While acknowledging that such a move wouldn’t have shifted _every_ Republican voter to support Clinton, they contend that it would have likely had a significant impact, sending a clear signal to the electorate that there was broad, bipartisan agreement on Trump’s unfitness for office.

But, they argue, high-profile Republicans did _not_ do this and instead chose party over country— and democracy—in 2016.

> **The Never Trump Movement**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt castigate the Republican establishment for failing to form a united front against Trump by endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, many mainstream Republicans _did_ offer organized opposition to his candidacy—and, later, to his presidency.
> 
> The Never Trump movement was a broad coalition of conservatives who opposed Trump’s nomination, many of whom ultimately left the Republican Party altogether in protest against what they saw as the party’s dangerous, rightward, xenophobic drift under him. And especially in the wake of the _Access Hollywood_ scandal (in which Trump was caught on tape boasting about having sexually assaulted women) in October 2016, many prominent elected Republicans withdrew their support and called upon Trump to drop out of the race. Such figures included Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, and U.S. Senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) John McCain.
> 
> During the 2020 election, when Trump was running for re-election, many Republicans and conservatives once again proved willing to work with the Democrats to defeat Trump. Former Governor of Ohio and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich endorsed Democratic nominee Joe Biden and spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, while the Lincoln Project—a political action committee formed by anti-Trump Republican strategists—spent over $80 million during the 2020 election cycle to defeat Trump.
