## Shortform Introduction

In _How Democracies Die_ , authors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt set out to analyze democracy’s long-term prospects for survival in the United States. Levitsky and Ziblatt primarily explore this problem through the lens of Donald Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016. **Did the success of Trump—an inexperienced outsider with possibly authoritarian instincts—suggest that democracy in the U.S. was backsliding?**

The authors try to answer this question through an examination of the historical processes by which democratic norms and institutions came to extinction in other countries in the 20th and 21st centuries and offering a blueprint for how to save them in the U.S. Their main thesis is that the cornerstone of democracy is not written laws or constitutions. Rather, they argue, **democracy derives its strength from _norms_ —unwritten rules and standards of conduct** mutually agreed to by competitors within the political system. Adherence to these shared norms is what prevents political competition from straying outside the bounds of democracy.

### About the Authors

Co-authors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt are prominent scholars on the topics of democratization, authoritarianism, and democratic backsliding.

Levitsky’s work has primarily concentrated on the problems of authoritarianism and democracy in the context of Latin American politics. His works as a co-author and editor on these topics include:

  * _Transforming Labor-Based Parties in Latin America: Argentine Peronism in Comparative Perspective_ (2003)
  * _Argentine Democracy: The Politics of Institutional Weakness_ (2005)
  * _Informal Institutions and Democracy: Lessons from Latin America_ (2006)
  * _Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War_ (2010)
  * _The Resurgence of the Latin American Left_ (2011) 



Levitsky is the David Rockefeller Professor of Latin American Studies at Harvard University and a former visiting fellow at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies.

Ziblatt—Eaton Professor of Government at Harvard University and director of the Transformations of Democracy group at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center—is an expert on the history of European democracy. In his work, Ziblatt has explored the process of European state-building through the lens of the successful Italian and German unification efforts of the mid-19th century. He has also examined the special role that nations’ conservative parties play in determining the long-term survival of democracy.

Specifically, Ziblatt argues that democratic viability hinges on the willingness of _conservative_ political parties such as the Tories in Britain—parties typically associated with nobility and landed privilege—to accommodate themselves to representative forms of government and keep in check the forces of the radical right. Where conservative parties accepted democracy and proved willing to compete in the electoral process (as in Britain in the 1830s), democracy survived; where conservative elites held themselves aloof from democracy or actively sought to undermine it (as in Bismarckian and Wilhelmine Germany) democracy proved stillborn and ultimately vulnerable to right-wing demagoguery.

Besides _How Democracies Die_ , his works include:

  * _Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism _(2006) 
  * _Conservative Parties and the Birth of Democracy_ (2017)

### The Book’s Publication

_How Democracies Die_ was published in 2018 by Penguin Random House.

Although both co-authors were already acknowledged experts in the fields of democracy formation and downfall at the time of the book’s publication, _How Democracies Die_ is the best-known and bestselling work for either Levitsky or Ziblatt. It attracted a great deal of attention and commentary within academic journals as well as mainstream media as it rose to #12 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Since publication, the authors have appeared on multiple podcasts, television interviews, and have published joint op-eds in major publications discussing the topics in the book.

### The Book’s Context

Levitsky and Ziblatt’s book was part of an outpouring of works by commentators, journalists, and political scientists in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other notable books from this period arguing that Trump’s presidency was an attack on democracy include:

  * _On Tyranny: Lessons From the Twentieth Century_ (2017) by Timothy Snyder
  * _Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic_ (2018) by David Frum
  * _Fascism: A Warning _(2019) by Madeleine Albright
  * _Surviving Autocracy_ (2020) by Masha Gessen



### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

_How Democracies Die_ was hailed by many as an important contribution to political science (especially in understanding the contemporary rise of right-wing populism) by publications like the _New York Times_ and the _Washington Post_. Former president Barack Obama even listed it as one of his favorite books of 2018.

#### Critical Reception

Commentators viewed Levitsky and Ziblatt’s work as an important analysis of how, in the modern era, a new wave of charismatic, demagogic outsiders have successfully eroded democratic norms in country after country _without_ resorting to violent coups or military overthrows—instead, winning elections legitimately and then using their power to rewrite the rules and lock their opponents out of power.

However, some critics did think that the authors exaggerated or overplayed the threat to U.S. democracy posed by Trump. Writing in the _New York Times_ , Nicholas Kristof argued that America’s democratic institutions had stood up well to Trump at the time of the book’s publication.

Kristof and other critics argued that America’s democratic system of government and tradition of democratic politics was older, more robust, and better-tested than those of countries like Venezuela, Peru, Hungary, and others profiled in _How Democracies Die_. As such, they argued, comparisons between those countries and the U.S. were inappropriate and misleading. In _The Guardian_ , David Runciman argued that the book’s approach of using comparative historical analysis of other democratic collapses to get insight into the contemporary U.S. situation was fundamentally flawed. Given the enormous differences between the contemporary U.S. and countries profiled in the book (like 1970s Chile or Weimar Germany), he believed the historical parallels only offered limited insight.

Critics on the political right, meanwhile, claimed that Levitsky and Ziblatt, with their harsh criticism of Trump and the Republican Party, were guilty of violating the very same democratic norms they purported to cherish. Writing in the _Wall Street Journal_ , reviewer Jason Willick argued that the book demonized Republicans and conservatives by representing them as a singular threat to democracy. This demonization of one’s opponents, argued Willick, was the very thing Levitsky and Ziblatt were warning against. He and other conservative commentators argued that _How Democracies Die_ was an overly partisan work, calling out allegedly anti-democratic behavior by right-wing politicians while ignoring similar transgressions committed by the left and the so-called “Resistance” to Trump.

Finally, some reviewers simply found the prose style somewhat dull and repetitive, drifting too much into political science jargon for the average reader.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Levitsky and Ziblatt establish the patterns and practices by which democracies succumb to authoritarianism, highlighting the shared characteristics of authoritarian leaders of the recent past (generally, though not exclusively, focusing on leaders who rose to power after World War Two). They then apply this analysis to Donald Trump and his surprising rise to power in the U.S., using the success of his campaign to indict the Republican Party’s leadership for what they see as its failure to stop him from securing their nomination. They finish by analyzing Trump’s performance in office (although his presidency was barely a year old at the time of publication) and evaluating how democracy had fared under him thus far.

#### Our Approach in This Guide

The core thesis of the book is **the importance of norms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance among political competitors** in a well-functioning democracy. Indeed, understanding these two norms is central to understanding everything else in _How Democracies Die_.

Ziblatt and Levitsky, however, don’t fully introduce this thesis until Chapter 5. Therefore in this guide, we’ve chosen to explore these norms _first_ before introducing and commenting on the other concepts. After introducing these norms, examining how they’re upheld in a healthy democratic system, and exploring how 20th- and 21st-century authoritarians have undermined them, we _then_ turn our analysis to Trump. Any exploration of how Trump and the modern Republican Party have or haven’t undermined American democratic norms can only happen _after_ we’ve fully fleshed out exactly what those norms are and how they’re supposed to function—a different organizational approach from that taken by Levitsky and Ziblatt.

More generally, the authors occasionally drift away from the book’s core principles to critique Donald Trump and the Republican Party more broadly. We’ve consolidated much of this commentary and have incorporated alternative viewpoints, including from more conservative and right-leaning commentators, who argue that the Republican Party and Donald Trump haven’t been the only serial violators of democratic norms. Specifically, we include examples of norm-breaking on the part of Democratic politicians, to bring a more balanced and nuanced perspective.

With the benefit of hindsight, we’ve also included some commentary and additional insights from the last three-fourths of Trump’s term, as well as the period _after_ his presidency—events that Levitsky and Ziblatt could not have commented on in 2018. This gives the reader greater insight into how Trump’s presidency truly affected American democracy and enables one to make a more thorough evaluation of whether the alleged threat to democracy posed by the 45th president turned out to be as serious as Levitsky and Ziblatt warned.
