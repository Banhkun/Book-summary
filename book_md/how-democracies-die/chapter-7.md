## Chapter 7: The Downfall of American Norms

Levitsky and Ziblatt have argued that American democratic norms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance operated successfully throughout most of the 20th century, despite some challenges. But, they warn, **these norms are under siege today and may be slipping away entirely.** They see the success of Donald Trump as a critical failure by a major political party to stop an authoritarian figure from rising within their own ranks.

But, the authors argue, the emergence of Trump did not occur in a vacuum. They view him as a product or symptom of broader trends in the American political system—and the Republican Party in particular—that have gradually driven the degradation of democratic norms since arguably the middle of the 20th century. In this chapter, Levitsky and Ziblatt explore some key structural transformations in U.S. politics over the past few decades that have pushed norms to the brink.

### The Rise of Newt Gingrich

The authors argue that the rise of Newt Gingrich as a major political player signaled the beginning of the transformation of American politics into the more partisan, ideological conflict that it is today. In 1978, Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. But Gingrich, say Levitsky and Ziblatt, was no ordinary Republican.

**They argue that he had a view of politics as warfare, believing that defeating one’s enemies was its ultimate purpose** — _not_ working with rivals or seeking to find common ground with them. As he rose through the ranks, Gingrich formed the political-action committee GOPAC to train up-and-coming Republican politicians in these new attack messaging strategies, labeling Democrats as “sick,” “traitors,” and “anti-flag.”

Gingrich rose through the ranks of the GOP’s congressional wing throughout the 1980s, remaking it in his image and systematically destroying norms of mutual toleration. By 1994, say the authors, Gingrich had transformed the party into one **deeply committed to social and economic conservatism, opposed to compromise, and scornful of its opponents.**

> **Gingrich and the Revival of the GOP**
> 
> Despite Levitsky and Ziblatt’s seemingly unflattering characterization of Gingrich’s role in American history, other commentators have defended him. It’s been argued Gingrich was an important figure in revitalizing the congressional wing of the Republican Party, which had been in the House minority for 40 years before the 1994 midterm elections.
> 
> During these four decades in the political wilderness, the Republicans were only able to amend, defeat, or delay proposals by the majority Democrats—they were never able to initiate a vision of their own. That changed in 1994 with Gingrich’s Contract With America, a sweeping legislative agenda of tax reform, tort reform, and welfare reform, among other items. Proponents credit the Contract With America with bringing _ideas_ and a coherent governing agenda back to congressional politics, and to the congressional GOP in particular.

#### The Clinton Impeachment

Levitsky and Ziblatt cite the 1998 party-line impeachment of Bill Clinton—on what they characterize as spurious and petty charges related to an extramarital affair—as the culmination of Republican-led hyper-partisanship during the 1990s.

**The authors argue that this was a major breach of institutional forbearance and a blatant abuse of the impeachment power**. In their account, Clinton’s behavior did not come close to meeting the standard for impeachment, and the Republican majority cheapened the constitutional power of impeachment by turning it into another partisan tool.

> **Bill Clinton and #MeToo**
> 
> While Levitsky and Ziblatt dismiss the impeachment charges against Clinton as being spurious and motivated by partisan concerns, in the decades since the impeachment, many liberals—a group that was among his staunchest defenders during the ordeal—have taken a more critical view of Clinton’s extramarital affair with the White House staffer Monica Lewinsky.
> 
> In 2017, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)—later a 2020 presidential candidate—was quoted as saying that Clinton should have been forced to resign over the scandal, which, in light of the burgeoning #MeToo movement, she saw as an act of sexual predation on the part of Clinton toward a female subordinate.

### The Campaign Against Barack Obama

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that partisan rancor rose sharply again when Democrat Barack Obama was elected to the presidency. As the first African-American president, Obama’s rise was a historic moment in the history of the nation. But once in office, the authors contend that he encountered **a radicalized Republican Party that was openly committed to his political delegitimization** and destruction from the first day of his administration.

During the 2008 campaign, right-wing media stars and prominent Republican politicians darkly hinted that Obama was a radical Marxist and secret Muslim. These charges were echoed most effectively by that year’s Republican vice-presidential nominee—Sarah Palin, Governor of Alaska. Palin whipped crowds of rank-and-file Republicans into a frenzy by baselessly accusing Obama of “palling around with terrorists.” Other prominent Republicans contributed to the erosion of mutual toleration by encouraging their voters to view the opposition party as an illegitimate entity.

(Shortform note: John McCain appears to have later suffered genuine guilt over the tone and rhetoric of his 2008 presidential campaign, particularly with regard to his running mate, Sarah Palin. In his memoir _The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations _(2018), published a few months before his death, McCain wrote that he regretted choosing Palin and only did so to shore up his support with the right wing of the GOP. He wrote that he had wanted to choose Joe Lieberman—an independent senator from Connecticut who’d been the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2000—but knew that the party would never accept this choice.)

#### The Party of No

The authors argue that their success in painting Barack Obama as a thoroughly alien and illegitimate president gave the GOP the means, motive, and opportunity**to deploy extraordinary constitutional hardball tactics against him** , withholding any cooperation with his administration, even on much-needed economic recovery legislation.

After the 2010 midterm elections brought Republicans back into the majority in the House, they had fresh opportunities to pursue their no-compromise agenda. They abused their congressional prerogatives to obstruct even the most routine legislation and slow the confirmation of federal judicial appointments, pushing forbearance to the brink.

While the GOP’s behavior was technically within the bounds of the law, they were using their control of Congress in ways that seriously undermined the constitutional system.

> **The Scorched-Earth Strategy**
> 
> In fact, this was part of a carefully coordinated strategy on the part of Republican congressional leadership. After consecutive losses in the 2006 and 2008 elections, many commentators believed that the GOP’s only path back to power would be through compromise and accommodation with the Democrats. But the party deliberately took the opposite course.
> 
> As Barack Obama himself detailed in his 2020 bestselling memoir, _A Promised Land_ , figures like House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recognized that in a highly polarized political system, their best path back to power was to make Obama and the Democrats as unpopular as possible by refusing to work with them on any major legislation—denying Obama the bipartisan comity he’d campaigned on and handing Democrats the sole responsibility of taking tough votes.
> 
> They believed that any gestures toward bipartisanship would only benefit the Democrats. Thus, by withholding their support, the Republicans bet that they could make Obama and his party “own” the economic crisis and sluggish recovery, providing fertile ground for a GOP comeback in the midterm elections.

#### A Stolen Supreme Court Seat

The authors cite the behavior of the GOP with regard to the Supreme Court as one of the most serious and consequential breaches of democratic norms during the Obama era.

In February 2016, Republican-appointed Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, creating a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Within hours of Scalia’s death, however, prominent Republican leaders were declaring that Barack Obama should not be allowed to appoint a replacement for him in an election year.

Undaunted, Barack Obama nominated federal judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat. Garland was widely regarded as a highly qualified and ideologically moderate candidate. But, as Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, Garland’s qualifications mattered little to the Republican-led Senate. Mitch McConnell, now Majority Leader, announced that **the Senate would not consider Garland’s nomination** , declaring that an outgoing president like Obama had no right to make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.

The authors argue that the treatment of Garland constituted an unprecedented breach of institutional forbearance as **Republicans declared that Obama lacked the right to even make a _nomination_**. They held the seat vacant through 2016. When Donald Trump was elected president, Republicans quickly rushed Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch through the confirmation process and onto the Court.

(Shortform note: In 2016, McConnell justified his actions by claiming that he was in fact _upholding_ longstanding norms by not filling a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year. Observers noted that no such precedent actually existed and that nine justices had been confirmed in election years since the end of the Civil War. Subsequently, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, McConnell’s Senate majority quickly confirmed her replacement, Amy Coney Barrett—eight days before the presidential election.)

> **The Precedent of Blocking Judicial Nominees**
> 
> While Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that the non-confirmation of Garland represented an act of unprecedented obstruction, partisanship, and hardball on the part of Senate Republicans, some conservative commentators at the time countered that there was nothing particularly unusual about the majority party in the Senate blocking the judicial nominees of a president of the opposite party.
> 
> In _The Wall Street Journal_ , James Taranto argued that what had been done to Garland was no different than what Senate Democrats like Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy had done to Ronald Reagan’s nominee, Robert Bork, back in 1987. Taranto argues that Democrats successfully smeared the conservative jurist Bork by labeling him a dangerous reactionary and racist, resulting in the withdrawal of his nomination and the addition of a new word to the American political lexicon—“borking.”

### The Demise of Big-Tent Parties

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that while these events were happening, major structural transformations were also reordering the composition of the parties themselves. These structural changes both reflected and contributed to the radicalization of American politics.

According to the authors,**for much of the 20th century, both major parties were big-tent coalitions, with their support cutting across religious, ethnic, geographic, and ideological lines.** The Democratic Party counted conservative white Southern Protestants, educated urban liberals, and working-class Irish and Italian-American Catholics as key voting blocs; the Republican Party, meanwhile, contained conservative midwesterners, but also liberal New Englanders in its coalition. Levitsky and Ziblatt posit that these heterogeneous parties provided fertile ground for bipartisan cooperation and shared adherence to democratic norms.

**But, say the authors, this arrangement began to unravel as a result of the success of the civil rights movement** , which began making major gains in the decades following World War Two. Major pieces of legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which were signed into law by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson (and which were opposed by 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater), stamped the Democrats as the party of civil rights. This prompted a major realignment of U.S. politics, as **white Southern Democrats began moving into the Republican Party as a reaction against civil rights.**

(Shortform note: Aware of the shifting political dynamics, President Johnson is said to have remarked to an aide as he signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, “We’ve lost the South for a generation.”)

The authors argue that a new generation of Republican politicians like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan welcomed and encouraged this development, adopting a “Southern Strategy” of making coded appeals to racially reactionary whites through their rhetoric against school busing, welfare spending, and urban crime. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that **the GOP became the party of white racial reaction and resentment.**

In turn, they note, racial minorities, new immigrants from Asia and Latin America, and liberal white voters began to find their natural home within the Democratic Party—whereas, previously, such groups had been scattered across both parties. As the decades wore on, liberals neatly sorted into the Democratic Party and conservatives sorted into the Republican Party.

> **The Great Sorting and American Political Geography**
> 
> The sorting described by Levitsky and Ziblatt hasn’t just influenced how Americans vote—it’s even determined where they _live_.
> 
> Data suggests that more and more Americans are living in partisan, ideological clusters, where they are unlikely to encounter supporters of the opposite party. For example, in 1976, 26.8% of Americans lived in landslide counties—that is, counties that were won by one of the two major parties by a margin of 20 percentage points or more. But by 2004, that figure had grown to 48.3%.
> 
> And by the 2016 election, a full 61% of voters lived in counties that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump won by 60% or more. Of the nation’s 3,100+ counties, a mere 303 were won by single digits. This has led some commentators to declare the end of Purple America.

### Identity Politics and Asymmetric Polarization

But this polarization of the parties, argue Levitsky and Ziblatt, is about far more than traditional disagreements over political issues or liberal versus conservative ideology. **Polarization reflects deeper and more fundamental divisions in society, like race, religion, sexuality, and culture.** These are not new forms of division by any means, but Levitsky and Ziblatt contend that they’ve never before been so neatly folded into the structure of the two-party system. Partisan affiliation increasingly encompasses these other, more emotionally resonant forms of _identity_ , not merely political belief—which makes compromise or accommodation far more difficult.

The Republican Party, they argue, has become overwhelmingly the party of exurban and rural white Christians. The Democrats, meanwhile, are increasingly the party of secular, urban non-whites. Thus, one’s political identity is about far more than just beliefs about public taxing and spending policy—it is about one’s core _identity_ and set of values. This makes the parties more and more unrecognizable to one another—and less and less willing to extend mutual respect and institutional forbearance to one another.

Although these homogenizing trends have played out in the coalitions of both major parties, the authors argue that they have been far sharper in the Republican Party. They do not deny that Democrats have drifted leftward on economic and social issues; but they contend that the GOP has swung far more to the right. Beyond the influence of right-wing media, they attribute this asymmetric polarization to two factors:

  * The power of conservative interest groups
  * The cultural homogeneity of the party’s base



> **The Democratic Shift to the Left**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt label the Republicans as the primary driver of asymmetric polarization, it’s worth exploring how much the _Democrats_ have also moved away from the political center, especially in recent years.
> 
> In the 2020 Democratic primaries, viable candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposed policies that would have been considered far to the left of the median voter only a few election cycles before, including: reparations for the descendants of enslaved people, universal childcare, a wealth tax, and forcing corporations to reserve 40% of the seats on the boards of directors for workers. Self-identified liberals comprise a far larger share of the Democratic base than they did during the 1990s. In 1994, self-identified _moderates_ made up half the party, while liberals made up only a quarter. In 2020, liberals represented half the party, while moderates represented only a third.
> 
> And this move to the left may be influencing how the broader American electorate views the party. A 2019 Quinnipiac poll showed that nearly half the country thinks the Democratic Party has moved too far to the left.

#### Conservative Interest Groups

Ziblatt and Levitsky argue that Republican politics are also shaped by a network of **powerful and well-funded conservative interest groups** that put pressure on GOP officeholders to hold the line on ideology. One example they cite is the group Americans for Tax Reform, headed by longtime activist Grover Norquist.

Norquist’s group has successfully pressured nearly every Republican member of Congress to sign a “no tax” pledge, committing them to oppose any form of federal revenue increase. According to the authors, these pressure groups help to shape party orthodoxy, enforce ideological uniformity, and discourage norms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance within Congress.

> **The “No Tax” Pledge and Conservative Goals**
> 
> Some commentators have argued that pledges like Grover Norquist’s “no new taxes” creed not only make compromise and functional democratic government impossible, but also undermine the conservative ideological goals they’re supposed to help.
> 
> Although the pledge has indeed become party orthodoxy (more than 80% of Republicans in the 2021-2023 congressional session have signed it) it has largely robbed them of their ability to negotiate with Democrats, placing them in a maximalist, “all or nothing” position that makes it extremely difficult for them to vote for legislation that would help them advance the cause of conservatism.
> 
> For example, in August 2011, all eight Republican presidential candidates declared on a debate stage that they would not accept a deficit-reduction package with even a 10:1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases. In other words, they were forced to sacrifice long-desired spending cuts and sweeping deficit reduction (both major goals of the conservative movement) because the pledge bound them to accept _no_ revenue increases whatsoever.

#### Cultural Homogeneity

Finally, Levitsky and Ziblatt highlight the racial and cultural homogeneity of Republican voters themselves. **They argue that the GOP has become a near-homogenous party of white Christian voters.** For most of the country’s history, white Christians comprised the majority of the electorate and sat atop the social and economic order. But in a few short decades, this dominant position has collapsed, and white Christians now comprise a minority of the electorate (although they are still the plurality).

The authors theorize that this has given rise to a siege mentality within this community. They increasingly feel embattled by the profound social and cultural changes that have swept the country. Levitsky and Ziblatt cite surveys showing that white Christians believe the country is slipping away from them and that they see themselves as the “real Americans” (in other words, native-born, English-speaking white, Christian). Thus, conspiracy theories like birtherism are tapping into something very potent for a lot of white voters—a sense of loss for a country they no longer recognize.

> **The Twilight of White Christianity**
> 
> The Republican party has indeed become highly dependent upon white Christian voters, a group that now comprises just 42% of the U.S. population as a whole. According to Pew Research, 79% of registered Republicans were self-identified Christians on the eve of the 2020 presidential election, compared to 52% for Democrats. Furthermore, the same research found that 81% of registered Republican-leaning voters were non-Hispanic whites, compared to 59% for Democratic-leaning voters.
> 
> However, Levitsky and Ziblatt’s portrayal of this group as being in an inexorable demographic decline toward political irrelevancy may be somewhat overstated. Pew’s research shows that white Christian voters are highly overrepresented in key battleground states like Wisconsin (86%), Ohio (82%), Pennsylvania (81%), and Michigan (79%)—suggesting that they may have enhanced political clout that outweighs their numbers.
> 
> To learn more about the anxiety among white Christians about their perceived loss of cultural dominance, read our summary of Robert Jones’s article in _The Atlantic_ , “We’ve Reached the End of White Christian America.”
