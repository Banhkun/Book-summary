## Chapter 1: Political Gatekeepers

Having now explored what democratic norms are and how they’re meant to function, it makes sense to examine the processes by which they come to be violated. In this chapter, we’ll analyze Levitsky and Ziblatt’s arguments for:

  * How authoritarians come to power in democratic states 
  * The basic characteristics that are shared by norm-violating, anti-democratic politicians
  * The mechanisms by which mainstream political parties have traditionally kept such figures from attaining power. 



### Identifying Authoritarians

Before looking at how anti-democratic forces take over the political system, it’s important to delineate exactly what constitutes authoritarianism. **Levitsky and Ziblatt identify four warning signs of authoritarianism** , singling out politicians who:

  * **Reject the generally accepted rules of democratic competition by** refusing to accept unfavorable election results
  * **Refuse to accept the legitimacy of their democratic opponents** by accusing their political competitors of being traitors or criminals
  * **Endorse violence** or sabotage by their supporters
  * **Express a willingness to crack down on civil liberties** by, for example, threatening to sue media outlets that don’t give them favorable coverage



> **Robert Reich’s Warning Signs of Tyranny**
> 
> Other commentators have cited additional shared characteristics of authoritarian political leaders, separate from those labeled by Levitsky and Ziblatt. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich claims that authoritarians are marked by 15 common features, some of which include:
> 
>   * Repeated lying in an attempt to “gaslight” the public and make them doubt the veracity of information sources other than those approved by the leader
> 
>   * Nepotism and the appointment of family members and personal friends to positions of high power
> 
>   * Treating public office as an opportunity for graft and personal enrichment
> 
>   * Blurring the lines between civilian and military authority, especially by appointing active-duty generals to high-ranking positions in the civil bureaucracy
> 
> 


When _How Democracies Die_ was published in 2018, Levitsky and Ziblatt argued that Donald Trump, in his successful 2016 bid for the presidency, was the only U.S. major-party candidate in history who met all four of their criteria. They concluded that this made him a unique threat to the stability of American democracy.

> **Trump and the 2020 Presidential Election**
> 
> In the book, the authors mainly cite examples of Trump’s statements and behaviors as a presidential _candidate_ (like calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed or encouraging his supporters to rough up protestors at his rallies). With the Trump presidency now concluded and with the benefit of hindsight, we can look back at how now-former President Trump behaved _in office._
> 
> In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the results of the election, in which he lost to Joe Biden by a margin of seven million votes and was defeated in the Electoral College 306-232, according to the official results from the Federal Elections Commission. By Levitsky and Ziblatt’s signs of authoritarianism, these actions would appear to indicate 1) a rejection of democratic competition.
> 
> Trump further alleged that Biden was an illegitimate president who owed his victory to voter fraud and vote tampering, despite presenting no credible evidence to back this assertion. This would similarly indicate 2) a refusal to accept the legitimacy of political opponents.
> 
> And on January 6, 2021 a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the certification of Biden’s victory, resulting in four fatalities (including a U.S. Capitol Police officer) and hundreds of arrests. In the aftermath of the attack—whose perpetrators repeatedly cited Trump’s assertions of a stolen election as their rationale—Trump minimized its seriousness, claiming that the rioters were essentially harmless protesters. This episode seems to fit Levitsky and Ziblatt’s third sign of authoritarianism—a willingness to encourage or condone violence.

### Political Parties: Democracy’s Gatekeepers

Ziblatt and Levitsky argue that **the institutions best-positioned to safeguard a free society and form of government are mainstream political parties.** They identify four main strategies that political parties can use to act as democracy’s gatekeepers:

  * Refusing to nominate extremists for office
  * Getting rid of extremists _within_ the party
  * Refusing to forge alliances or enter coalitions with anti-democratic parties
  * Working with traditional opponents to form a united front for democracy



By refusing to join in political coalitions with anti-establishment, populist extremists and rooting them out of their own ranks when such figures arise, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that mainstream parties can be highly effective at limiting the growth of anti-democratic forces.

Unfortunately, they note, this is easier said than done. It is often very difficult for politicians and parties to resist the temptation to forge short-term alliances with popular demagogues—particularly if those demagogues are adept at delivering votes. Moreover, it is difficult for mainstream parties to work with their rivals in order to close ranks against a demagogue.

> **The Case for Strong Parties**
> 
> Ziblatt and Levitsky’s argument that political parties are essential to the functioning of a healthy democracy is backed up by other authors. In _Responsible Parties: Saving Democracy from Itself _(2018)_,_ co-authors Frances McCall Rosenbluth and Ian Shapiro point to the deterioration of strong, mainstream political parties as a key reason for voter anger, disillusionment, and attraction to fringe movements in democracies around the world. Rosenbluth and Shapiro claim that attempts to make political parties more _internally_ democratic and representative (like primaries and caucuses where ordinary voters, rather than party elites, select candidates) have tended to decentralize party decision-making power.
> 
> This makes them less cohesive; more fractious; and ultimately, too weak to adequately respond to the needs of the constituencies they serve. This in turn draws voters to more extreme political leaders out of frustration with gridlock and ineffectiveness.
> 
> Rosenbluth and Shapiro argue instead that political power must be _re_ -centralized and placed back in the hands of party elites, who will be better able to broker differences between factions and restore public confidence in political parties, which they view as the fundamental unit in a democratic system.

(Shortform note: Levitsky and Ziblatt’s argument for the importance of political parties conflicts with what the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed. In _The Federalist Papers_ , Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison argued that political parties, or “factions,” were a harmful—albeit inevitable—feature of free political systems. They argued that the constitutional framework and large federal union of states they established represented the best safeguard against any one faction becoming too strong or powerful.)

#### Example: David Duke and the 1990 Louisiana Senate Election

The 1990 race for one of Louisiana’s seats in the U.S. Senate was what political scientists call a nonpartisan blanket primary or “jungle” primary—meaning that all the candidates run at once in the general election on the same ballot. There are no party primaries in such a system, so these elections often feature several candidates from the same party running simultaneously.

That year, state representative, avowed white supremacist, and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke garnered national media attention when polls showed him emerging as the leading Republican candidate in the months and weeks leading up to the election. Although the GOP establishment attempted to promote a number of mainstream Republican alternatives to Duke, none of them were able to surmount his polling lead—leading to real concern that Louisiana might elect an unapologetic racist and Klansman to the U.S. Senate.

In order to prevent this, the Louisiana Republican Party consolidated around the Democratic candidate in the final weeks of the election. State Republican leaders endorsed the Democrat over Duke and the other Republicans dropped out of the race and similarly endorsed the Democrat in an effort to unite the anti-Duke vote. The Republican Party’s work to act as responsible democratic gatekeepers paid off when the incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. defeated Duke by a 53-44% margin.
