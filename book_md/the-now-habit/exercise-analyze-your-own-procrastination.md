## Exercise: Analyze Your Own Procrastination

According to Fiore, we procrastinate because we’re overwhelmed by fear and anxiety about our work. Therefore, one of the first steps in correcting procrastination is recognizing when that happens so we can adjust.

* * *

Describe a recent time you’ve procrastinated on something. What was the task? What exactly did you do to procrastinate?

What fears or anxieties did you have concerning the task? Remember, some common anxieties include perfectionism, fear of failure, fear of success, and frustration.

The next time you face this task (or one like it), which of Fiore’s techniques would most help you reduce your anxiety and avoid procrastinating? Why?
