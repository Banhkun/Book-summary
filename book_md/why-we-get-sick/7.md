## 7: Genes and Disease

We now return to a question asked earlier in the summary: Why haven’t we evolved away genes that cause disease?

You now know a few reasons: the disease-causing gene may have benefits that are not as obvious. Also, the gene may have been beneficial during the Stone Age, but only cause disease in today’s environment (we’ll cover this explanation more later in the chapter).

Here are even more reasons that we haven’t evolved away genes that cause disease:

  * **Natural selection may not be able to completely eliminate disease genes due to insufficient adverse selection.**
    * A harmful recessive gene that confers no disadvantage for heterozygotes has a low rate of adverse selection, even if the unfortunate homozygous recessive die without reproducing. 
    * The math shows that if a lethal recessive gene that is created in one out of a million pregnancies will stabilize in frequency at one out of a thousand individuals. In other words, mutation can create the defective gene as fast as natural selection eliminates it.
  * **Genes that cause serious diseases may have some less obvious benefits that allow persistence.**
    * Consider a gene that is lethal if homozygous. Maintaining such a gene at a prevalence of 3-11% in the population requires a reproductive advantage of 6%.
    * For example, bipolar disease causes manic periods that may promote risky feats leading to success (and thus social stature), as well as sexual aggression. This can increase reproductive fitness even at the cost of mental illness.
    * The gene for cystic fibrosis may reduce death from diarrhea.
    * The gene for Tay-Sachs disease may protect against tuberculosis.
    * The mutated DR3 gene that causes childhood-onset diabetes decreases miscarriage. By the Punnett square, a mating of Dd x DD suggests that half of babies should be heterozygous Dd, but the observed rate is actually 66%!
  * **Genetic diseases that occur after reproductive age are less selected against.**
    * Huntington’s Disease causes little harm before age 40. By this time, people will have already had children, so there is little selection pressure against the gene.
  * **Genes may have benefits only in certain environments.**
    * In regions with malaria, G6PD deficiency is protective, since it causes the red blood cell to burst when the parasite uses the cell’s oxygen, thus limiting the parasite’s reproduction. 
  * **Some genes may give heterozygotes an advantage, even if homozygous recessives suffer.**
    * The sickle-cell gene causes sickle-cell disease when inherited as homozygous recessive. However, in malarial areas, heterozygotes have less severe malaria.



### Stone Age Genes in Modern Times

As we’ve learned, a major reason that disease-causing genes still exist is that they may have been beneficial during the Stone Age, but only cause disease in today’s environment.

**Consider how vastly different the survival conditions of early humans were, compared to the modern age.**

  * Mortality was high. In fact, humans reproduced at a rate just enough to balance mortality. If humans increased population at 1% per century, this would have led to a 1000x population growth in 70k years, which did not happen. This suggests the death rate was very high.
  * Infectious diseases were probably the most common cause of mortality. Much genetic selection would then have favored genes that protected against infectious disease.
  * For food, humans hunted and gathered. Contrary to popular media depiction, humans got food less often from aggressive raids with weapons, and more from scavenging carcasses.
  * Food sources were highly variable and subject to environmental conditions. This promoted conflict between groups.
  * Within your small tribe, altruistic traits such as love, charity, and honesty promoted survival. Furthermore, since your tribe was likely to be made up of close relatives, kin selection was strong. However, there was no selection for global altruism—no survival benefit from looking kindly on the entire human species.



Humans (or our primate ancestors) lived this way for millions of years. Only in the past 20,000 years is agriculture believed to have been developed.

Therefore, it’s reasonable that **ancestral genes promoted survival in the past, but have only recently become a liability in modern environments.** Here’s a list of examples.

#### Nutritional Excess

**In a resource-scarce world, wanting more sugar, fat, protein, salt was a survival trait. Storing more weight in response to food was a survival trait in times of famine.**

We do have natural limits to overeating in a single meal, stopping us from overburdening our GI systems. But we don’t have built-in limits to long-term overeating. This is why people can carry a body weight far beyond what is normal.

We’re not even prepared for today’s selection of food. As hunter-gatherers in the Stone Age, we adapted to pick the sweetest fruit. But what happens if you surround yourself with cheesecake and candy bars? Modern food triggers **supernormal stimuli** that excite your senses far beyond natural foods.

  * Another example illustrates how the modern world can be confusing. If you put an egg and a tennis ball near a goose nest, she will roll the tennis ball back into the nest. **The ball is more egglike than an egg.** Likewise, our modern, processed food is more food-like than real food.



Our genes also work against us during weight loss. Because we evolved to survive famine, when our bodies detect a deficit in calories, they cut our metabolism to conserve calories. This makes further weight loss difficult.

Finally, today’s diet may cause diseases that never appeared in the past. In the prehistoric past, dental cavities were never a problem, as evidenced in skeletal remains. It’s only today’s sugar-rich diets that cause them.

#### Dietary Inadequacies

Ironically, our resource-rich environment may promote dietary inadequacies.

When agriculture was developed, humans often developed vitamin C deficiency, due to less foraging of vitamin-rich foods like berries, and more eating of wheat and corn.

Today, artificial sweeteners trigger the body’s expectations for actual ingestion of sugar. Humans never lived in a time when artificial, non-digestible sweeteners existed. The body reduces glycolysis and blood sugar in response to sweeteners; iff no real sugar is absorbed, the body may go into hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and thus crave more food.

#### Lack of Movement

In human history, **it was adaptive to conserve energy by being lazy whenever possible**.

Clearly in today’s sedentary environment we move far less than hunter-gatherers.

#### Myopia

25% of the human population is myopic, or near-sighted. A simple line of thinking would ask, “How could this portion of people possibly have survived in ancestral times?”

Instead, consider that myopia might be a modern artifact of how we use our eyes—namely, that **we do much more close reading than Stone Age people did**.

What’s the mechanism behind myopia? During development, the eye grows in response to visual blurriness fed to the brain. (If only one part of the visual field is blurry, only that part of eye grows, leading to astigmatism). This system is usually remarkably accurate—the margin of error for focusing the lens on the retina is 1% the length of the eyeball.

For 25% of people, something about reading or other close work causes the eye to keep growing inappropriately, leading to myopia. This could be the blurred edges of letters, or a focus on a close book with blurred surroundings.

If today’s near-sighted people had been born in a hunter-gatherer society, where no reading was done, they likely wouldn’t have vision problems.

#### Alcoholism/Addiction

Alcoholism is only a modern problem with the widespread availability of alcohol and distillation into high-proof spirits. In the historical past, alcoholism wasn’t as much a problem with low-alcohol content drinks like fermented fruit, or when homes had to prepare their own alcohol.

Likewise, addiction to drugs arose when opium was processed into the more addictive heroin, and coca into cocaine. Substance abuse seems to be largely a consequence of today’s environment.

Why might genes predisposing to alcoholism have been helpful in older times? **These genes may have increased the ability to pursue rewards despite difficulties, or psychological reinforcement in response to certain rewards**. These are hallmarks of alcoholic behavior, and would have been useful in many situations.

#### Skin color

Humans adapted their skin color for the areas they developed in. In northern areas with low sunlight, humans developed light skin to absorb and avoid vitamin D deficiency. In equatorial areas with plenty of sunlight, humans developed dark skin to limit UV radiation.

Now that different colored humans live all around the globe, the skin can now cause disadvantages in different climates. Light-skinned people in sunny areas get skin cancer. Dark-skinned people in low-sunlight areas get insufficient vitamin D.

### Is Disease Caused by Genetics or Environment?

A common line of inquiry is to ask whether disease is caused by genetics or the environment. In some cases, it’s clearly one or the other.

But in the cases above, it’s the wrong perspective. **Both the gene and the environment are insufficient by themselves, but interact together to produce the disease.**

In fact, discovering that a disease has a genetic cause may actually be a blessing, if a specific feature of the environment is causing the disease.

  * Phenylketonuria is minimized in a diet free of phenylalanine.
  * Myopia may be prevented with a lack of close reading activity in childhood.



### Poorly Adapted to Today’s Environment

We are just at the beginning of understanding how the modern environment causes disease. **Consider all the following aspects of modern life that would be utterly foreign to our Stone Age predecessors:**

  * Bright indoor lighting at night that disrupt our sleep cycles
  * Jet lag
  * Working night shifts
  * Working in windowless rooms with little exposure to nature
  * Working in large organizations of hundreds or thousands, and societies of millions—this surpasses the small tribes we used to live in by orders of magnitudes.
  * Eating readily available, soft, nontoxic foods. This means less chewing and might cause misaligned wisdom teeth and need for dental surgery.
  * Living in a nuclear family, largely separate from our relatives.
  * Having transient care from strangers, such as nannies for children and senior care for the elderly. 



In the coming years, we may find a host of consequences resulting from today’s unnatural environment.
