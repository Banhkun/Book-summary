## 4: A Never-Ending Arms Race

As discussed, hosts and pathogens adapt to each other in continuous cycles. One strategy is quickly defeated by a counterstrategy. This gives rise to the **Red Queen Principle** , named after the statement in Alice in Wonderland:**“It takes all the running you can do, just to keep in the same place.”**

  * The arms race can escalate to the point where the host organism expends so much on defense that it’s hard put to meet other basic needs, but the cost of losing the arms race is so great that it must continue defenses.
  * Bacteria and viruses have the edge in numbers. Bacteria can have 300 generations in a week (each time generating novel mutations that may help it infect), and viruses may have even more. Furthermore, they have vast numbers, with trillions in count for one human host. Humans therefore have a huge handicap in natural selection, and instead must compensate with adaptable mechanisms, like an antibody production system that can generate millions of unique antibodies.



#### Case Study: Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics

Antibiotics were one of the great medical successes of the 20th century. However, due to widespread use, increasingly bacteria are evolving resistance to even our most powerful antibiotics. The multi-drug resistance strain of tuberculosis causes a 50% mortality rate.

Bacteria don’t become resistant to antibiotics through gradual tolerance. Instead, rare mutations occur that confer resistance. In an environment where an antibiotic is present, these resistant bacteria replicate more readily and take over the population.

Once bacteria evolve drug resistance, they can pass these genes to other bacteria through plasmids.

If the environment changes and the antibiotic is removed, the ancestral strain slowly replace the resistant strains. This suggests that maintaining the resistance causes a fitness disadvantage (once again, natural selection is a collection of compromises).

However, the disadvantage of the resistant mutation can _itself_ be mutated away. Therefore, antibiotic resistance can persist in a population, even when no antibiotics are present for a long time.

### Why Don’t Parasites Help Us?

Here’s an interesting thought—**if parasites use host resources to survive and reproduce, why don’t they help the host thrive and get more resources?** The longer the host lives, the more the parasite can reproduce, and the more they can spread offspring to new hosts. This would suggest that the natural evolutionary path of parasites is to gradually become more useful until it becomes indispensable to host survival.

The authors argue this thinking is flawed and ignores two critical points:

  * First, **this ignores competition between different parasites within the host, and even within the same parasite species**.
    * Say that a liver fluke and _Shigella_ are competing for the same resources in the host. The one that most effectively exploits those resources will win.
    * Within the same species, if one parasite selects for cooperation and less virulence, other aggressive members of the species will overtake it in reproduction. The host-friendly gene is rapidly eliminated from the population
  * Second, the war between pathogens and humans has existed for millions of years. Parasites go through thousands of generations of reproduction in a host’s lifetime, so it’s likely the current situation is in an equilibrium. 
    * In other words, if it were so great for malaria to become helpful to the host, it would have already happened. That malaria still causes disease today suggests that this is malaria’s optimized strategy in today’s environment.



### A Better Model of Virulence

In contrast to the thinking above, infections are actually in a stable equilibrium right now. Both pathogens and hosts make tradeoffs between values like growth rates, reproduction, and defense.

A better model of virulence, or severity of disease, would include all the factors at play in the complex game of survival:

  * A pathogen needs to outcompete other pathogens in the host.
  * It needs to limit its damage to the host to increase dispersal to other hosts. Killing the host right away would cause the pathogen to die as well.
  * A pathogen needs to create new strains to evade defenses and reproduce more.



**The balance between virulence and dispersal is especially important to the success of the pathogen.** This leads to a few important ideas:

  * A pathogen that relies on host health for dispersal will be less virulent.
    * The common cold spreads between hosts through coughs and physical contact. If the cold virus incapacitates the host, making her stay home and avoid other people, it is self-defeating.
  * **A pathogen that doesn’t rely on the host to disperse itself can be more virulent.** It can aggressively use host resources to outcompete other pathogens and replicate itself.
    * Unlike the common cold, malaria is spread by mosquitoes and don’t require human-to-human contact. Therefore, the pathogen actually _benefits_ by making the host bedridden, so mosquitoes can feast freely without recourse. In contrast, malaria is mild in mosquitoes, since harming the mosquito would hamper further dispersal.



**Importantly, changing the mechanism of dispersal and the ease of dispersal may change a pathogen’s virulence**. The easier it becomes for the pathogen to spread to other hosts, the more the pathogen can afford to be virulent and damage the host. Here are a few examples:

  * _Shigella_ was previously transmitted by water. It would cause deadly dysentery, be shed by diarrhea into a water supply, and then be consumed by other humans. Therefore, its strategy was to cause virulent disease, replicating quickly and causing severe diarrhea. However, once water began being purified, this mechanism was cut off to it. It would cause severe dysentery but have little way to propagate to other hosts. As a result, over time, the _Shigella_ population shifted to a less virulent strain, which is transmitted directly between humans.
  * Within hospitals, infections can be spread inadvertently by medical professionals and unsanitized equipment. In this environment, pathogens can increase their virulence. Even if the pathogen causes severe disease and kills patients, it can still be spread by mechanical contact. This is why hospital-transmitted pathogens can be so much deadlier than pathogens in the outside environment.
  * Some research suggests that HIV existed in humans for many generations with little incidence, and only recently caused the deadly AIDS disease. This might be because recent cultural factors made sexually-transmitted dispersal easier—when prostitutes began serving hundreds of men a year, host survival became much less important. HIV could therefore then “afford” to be more virulent.



**Thus, epidemics may result when a novel environmental circumstance promotes virulence**. For instance, the bubonic plague had festered in Asia for many years, but it only became an epidemic in Europe because of the environmental change. In Europe, the concentration of the population in cities with flea-infested rats gave the plague a novel way to disperse itself.

Sometimes even our efforts to improve the environment can counter-productively make pathogens more virulent. Polio exposure in early childhood has only mild effects, and until the early 20th century, it wasn’t much of a problem. Plenty of people got polio with mild effects. But in the early 20th century, sanitation limited polio infection until a later age, when it has much more severe effects.

(Shortform note: these ideas lead to more consequences of how our treatment of disease influences the evolution of pathogens:

  * Treatment that stifles the reproduction of pathogen will promote less virulent strains that bypass diagnosis and suppression. The goal for the pathogen becomes to persist long enough to spread and not be treated.
  * Treatment that stifles host defenses (such as reducing fevers and coughing) can allow more virulent strains to cause more damage.)
