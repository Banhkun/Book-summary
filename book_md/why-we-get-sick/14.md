## 14: Mental Disorders

The field of psychiatry has tried to codify mental illness through clear-cut symptoms, rather than as gradations of emotions that are influenced by psychology and life experiences. Patients also understand their mental illness as imbalances in brain chemicals; they might be offended if the psychiatrist insisted that their illness were just a maladaptive psychological process.

The authors argue that ignoring the **underlying function of emotions is like ignoring physiology in medicine**.

As an analogy to today’s approach to psychiatry, imagine if we investigated “cough disorder,” creating objective criteria for diagnosis and subtyping (like coughing more than twice per hour). We then discover a cough center in the brain and muse about what dysfunctions lead to coughing, then investigate genetic causes for people prone to coughing.

This is clearly silly, but only because we know cough is a defense. We know not to look for causes of cough in the nerves and muscles, but rather upstream in the stimulus that provokes a cough (like the common cold).

Emotions are no different. They provide a valuable function to us in everyday life. Understanding this normal function should give us insight into when emotions go wrong.

#### The Function of Emotions

As with everything else discussed in Darwinian medicine, **our emotions are adaptations shaped by natural selection** and have powerful uses.

Emotions adjust multiple aspects of our body to respond effectively in a situation—they change our cognition, physiology, subjective experience, and behavior.

Unpleasant emotions like fear and anxiety protect us from bad situations. Positive emotions like optimism and joy help us seek opportunity and seek more of what is good for us.

When we feel an emotion, we may not be conscious of its cause, but the cause likely does exist.

Let’s cover a range of conditions considered mental illness, question the function of the root emotion, and consider why mental illness might be so common today.

### Anxiety

Anxiety causes the fight or flight physiological response that is useful in aiding an escape from danger—a rapid heartbeat, faster breathing, sweating, and an increase in blood glucose.

Anxiety is triggered in the face of danger or an emergency. Justifiable modern day triggers include hearing a gunshot or having a paper due.

But**the anxiety-provoking system may be overly sensitive, just like a smoke alarm**. A false positive (being anxious when you don’t need to be) isn’t very costly, but a false negative (not being anxious when you should be) can be fatal. As a Stone Age person, imagine you hear a stick break in the forest. It’s better to be overly cautious and assume it’s a tiger, than to have too little anxiety and assume nothing is wrong.

If anxiety is protective, why not be anxious at all times? The stress from anxiety uses extra calories, makes us unable to perform many everyday activities, and damages tissues. Like driving a car to its absolute limit, anxiety is a costly defense mechanism that pushes the body past its normal operating limits, and it should be released only in the case of emergency.

There might be a whole class of people who feel too little anxiety, but these aren’t classified as a mental disorder. People who feel too little anxiety may be impulsive and end up fired from their jobs or in emergency rooms.

### Sadness and Depression

Sadness often stems from a personal loss that can harm reproductive fitness. This includes losing resources (like a job), losing a mate, losing reputation, and losing friends.

**The evolutionary function of sadness is to stop current losses and prevent future ones**. Specifically, sadness has a few functions:

  * Sadness immediately stops you from continuing what you were doing, so as not to repeat losses.
  * Sadness dampens your overconfidence and optimism so that you can reassess your capabilities and goals realistically.
  * Sadness prevents you from wasting energy on impossible goals. Sit tight and store up energy for the next best use.
  * Sadness causes your memory to store emotional pain, which punishes whatever behavior led to the loss.



Interestingly, **some depressions go away after a person gives up a long-sought goal and turns her energies in another direction**.

#### Depression and Social Standing

Depression has other functions in signaling social standing:

  * It suppresses action in people whose abilities may threaten their superiors. This avoids the threat of retaliation and protects the high-ability people.
  * Depression results when a person cannot win a hierarchy battle yet refuses to yield. Depression kicks in to serve as an involuntary signal of submissiveness.



Researchers studied a primate group and removed the alpha male. They then randomly chose another male and gave him antidepressants. That male reliably becomes the new alpha male.

Serotonin may therefore function in mediating hierarchies within a social group.

#### Why Is Depression Rising?

Compared to prehistoric environments, our modern environment may increase the risk of depression by disrupting our place in society.

##### Competing With the World

**Mass communications make all of humankind one competitive group.**

In the Stone Age, we happily compared ourselves within a tribe of 100. Within this small group of people, you were likely good at something and valued for what you did. This made your life feel purposeful.

Now, with the advent of mass media, we compare ourselves to the best of 7 billion other people. You find it harder to be particularly good at anything. Compared to sports stars, beautiful models, and dashing entrepreneurs,**you may feel average in nearly all respects** , and you see your family and friends as similarly inadequate. (Shortform note: Because of social media, you might also believe your life is less fulfilling and exciting than those of your friends.)

##### Disintegrating Communities

We have a primal need for a secure place in a supportive group. In the past, this was served by a close-knit clan of dozens of people.

Today, people often live in competitive communities with no blood relatives nearby. Extended families have disintegrated. Many of us have a hard time finding someone who loves us for who we are, not what we can do for them.

Other institutions have substituted for the supportive group, such as religion, social groups, and psychotherapy.

### Attachment

**Monkeys raised in isolation with no bonding to mothers never recover behaviorally** —they don’t get along, have trouble mating, and treat their own offspring poorly.

Those growing up with absent or indifferent mothers may have trouble trusting people, feel prone to rejection, and are eager to please to protect themselves from abandonment. This might manifest in clinging and withdrawal behaviors.

### Child Abuse

**A lack of genetic relation between parent and child strongly increases the risk that the parent will abuse the child fatally.**

Sadly, this has precedent in evolution. The adaptive strategy for males who take over a group is to kill unrelated children. This prompts the mothers to mate with the new alpha male and concentrates resources on his children.

This pressure is so strong that in mice, just the smell of a strange male can induce miscarriage. The function of this might be to avoid bringing to term a baby that will likely be killed anyway.

Non-fatal child abuse may be an extension of this natural drive.

### Schizophrenia

Unlike sadness and anxiety, the authors believe that schizophrenia—with its paranoia, bizarre beliefs, and hearing voices that don’t exist—is not normal functioning.

Yet with a high prevalence of 1%, **schizophrenia is common enough that it _should_ confer an advantage**. Perhaps it increases creativity or sharpens intuition about others’ thoughts?

Relatives of schizophrenics who don’t have full schizophrenia themselves seem highly accomplished.

### Sleep Disorders

Is sleep shaped by natural selection? It seems so because it’s so widespread among animals. Universally sleep deprivation causes poor performance.

How did sleep arise?

  * The Earth naturally has dark-light cycles. Assuming there is greater danger at night (such as from not seeing predators) and more opportunity during day, then an individual that rested at night was more likely to survive than one that was active the entire day.
  * Once the individual started being inactive at night, then bodily processes might take advantage of inactivity to recover. The brain would form memories and synthesize neurotransmitters; the body repairs itself and cells divide.
  * This kicks off a positive feedback loop wherein we become more dependent on sleep, and thus more processes become confined to sleep.



#### Dreaming

Dreaming may function to purge unnecessary memories. Deprivation of dreaming sleep in cats shortens lives and disrupts their behavior.

Note that during dreaming, **we have strong visual sensations and perform actions, but we perceive little sound, smell, or touch.** This may be evolutionarily defensive—while sleeping, we need sound, smell, and touch to detect danger. But during sleep, our closed eyes block sight and we can’t move because our brains paralyze our muscles, so there’s little risk of using these capabilities during dreaming.

* * *

To be clear, the authors understand that many mental disorder cases are pathological and should be treated to reduce suffering.

But we should take a broader view of mental disorders. They can result from a variety of influences, including genes, early life events, drugs, relationships, life situations, and more.

We should be wary of how we think about negative emotions. **What will happen when we try to neutralize all negative emotions and thus avoid their protective functions?**

Furthermore, **are there disorders resulting from too little emotion**? Should we treat people with limited fear, anxiety, and sadness?
