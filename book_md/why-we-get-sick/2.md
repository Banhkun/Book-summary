## 2: How Natural Selection Works

Natural selection is often thought of informally as “survival of the fittest,” but this is a confusing phrase. People often have the wrong idea of what “fitness” means. It doesn’t mean fitness in the everyday sense of good health and long life.

In Darwinian terms, **a higher fitness means more reproduction and a greater number of viable offspring**. If a gene leads to production of more viable offspring in future generations, that gene will be enriched in the population. Likewise, if a gene codes for characteristics that result in _fewer_ viable offspring in future generations, that gene is gradually eliminated.

Taking the phrase “survival of the fittest” again, we now see that “survival” is important for natural selection only insofar as it increases reproduction. If a gene helps an individual survive longer, but at the expense of having fewer offspring, that gene will show up less often in the gene pool.

**Genes that increase lifetime reproduction will be selected for, even if they reduce the individual’s longevity.**

This is one reason that we haven’t evolved away common diseases—the genes that cause gout and dementia later in life may actually _increase_ our reproductive fitness earlier in life.

#### Look for Alternative Explanations

A key takeaway: **when we find something that seems like an error in natural selection, more likely we are missing some important function that compensates for the deficit.**

There’s a parable of Henry Ford when he asked a car engineer, “Is there anything that never goes wrong with any of these cars?” The engineer responds, “Yes, the steering column never fails.” Ford responds, “Redesign it. If it never breaks, we must be spending too much on it.”

Likewise, the body has evolved to be a set of compromises. Some traits might increase vulnerability to some diseases, but still give an overall fitness advantage.

### Nuances of Natural Selection

#### Fitness Depends on the Environment

A gene’s contribution to fitness is not determined in isolation. It’s measured in a particular species in a particular environment. **Change the environment, and the gene may no longer increase fitness.**

For example, imagine a population of rabbits in the forest. Half of them have a gene that makes them more timid at venturing out in the open, which decreases their chance of being eaten by foxes. The other half doesn’t have this gene. The timid half spend more time hiding in their dens, and so they tend to be less well fed than the bolder half.

The environment changes, and a very harsh winter arrives. The timid half stay in their rabbits’ dens, and most of them starve to death. The bolder half venture out and get food; while the bold rabbits _are_ more likely to be eaten by foxes, they also eat more in the winter, and so a greater fraction survives than the timid half. Over a series of harsh winters like this, the timid gene may be eliminated from the population.

Change the environment, and the gene may no longer increase fitness. As we’ll discuss later, this may be the case for a variety of genes that lead to disease in our abundant modern environment, like heart disease.

#### Natural Selection Arises by Chance

Natural selection operates by chance. Whether a population develops any particular trait depends on a string of random events:

  * Whether the mutation is created by random chance
  * Whether the bearer of the mutation will live long enough to show the beneficial effects to fitness
  * How random events influence the individual’s reproductive success
  * Whether the gene is by chance eliminated in the next generation
  * How unpredictable environmental changes affect the gene’s fitness



This randomness has a number of implications:

  * **Natural selection will not create every adaptation that would be valuable.** Because gene mutations happen by random chance, and there is a finite number of humans each generation, not all possible mutations are created. There are likely very beneficial mutations that no human has ever carried.
  * **Even if a helpful gene mutation is created, it may not persist long enough to be selected for in the species.** A mutation may arise in a person, but random chance may prevent that person from passing on the helpful gene to offspring.
  * **Natural selection does not always take the best path for the long-term welfare of a species**. While we wish that genes would arise that extend lifespan and decrease diabetes, natural selection has no agenda about our well-being or happiness. In some sense, natural selection could be mis-optimizing for reproductive fitness, when we would rationally opt for other traits even at the expense of reproduction.



### Natural Selection and Groups

A famous documentary about lemmings jumping off cliffs explained that when food becomes scarce, a fraction of lemming jump off the cliff to save enough food for others to survive. This was an example of the theory of “group selection”—some may sacrifice themselves for the sake of the species.

From a natural selection point of view, this is nonsense. Imagine that a gene codes for a lemming’s willingness to jump off a cliff to save the group. Some individual lemmings have a mutation that let them stay back and survive.

Over time, all the heroic, self-sacrificing lemmings die, and the selfish lemmings stay back and reproduced. The gene that promotes self-sacrifice is removed from the population.

The key point is that **natural selection benefits genes, not groups.** Natural selection acts on the level of the individual without a concern for the species. As Richard Dawkins noted in _The Selfish Gene_ , the individual is merely a vessel created by genes for the replication of genes.

(So why did the lemmings jump off the cliff? It turns out it was staged—documentary producers used brooms to force the lemmings to jump into the water.)

#### Kin Selection

From a natural selection point of view, we’re not completely devoid of reasons to help others to further our own genes. Your relatives share many of your genes. By helping your relatives, you increase their reproductive success, which in turn promotes the propagation of your genes.

The closer the relative is, the more apt you are to help them. Siblings share half of their genes with each other; cousins share one-eighth of their genes. From a genetic point of view, your sister’s survival and reproduction are half as important as yours, and your cousin’s are one-eighth as important.

Because of this, natural selection favors helping your relatives if the cost to you is less than the benefit to the relative, times the degree of relationship. A biologist said that he would not sacrifice his life for one brother, but he would for two, or eight cousins.

### Evolutionary Hypotheses

**Good evolutionary hypotheses are testable and stand up to reason.** Many speculations on traits and behavior don’t meet this criteria. Consider these superficially justifiable explanations that break down under scrutiny:

  * “We developed our nose structure to hold up glasses.” This can’t be right, because we had noses a long time before we had eyeglasses.
  * “Crying as an infant is useful to exercise their lungs.” But there’s no evidence that infants who cry end up with healthier lungs as an adult than infants who don’t cry.
  * “Humans die age 100 to make room for new individuals.” But, as we discussed, group selection doesn’t happen. 



#### The Adaptationist Program

Proper evolutionary reasoning undertakes the “adaptationist program,” which is a method of investigation that essentially makes hypotheses testable.

**If you understand the functional significance of some piece of human biology, you should be able to predict other unknown aspects, then investigate to confirm whether they are there or not.**

For example, consider a species of bird who may lay between 3-5 eggs each mating season. One might naively think that the exact number happens merely by chance. Instead, consider that the individual bird lays a different number of eggs each season to maximize her individual reproductive success—the bird only lays as many eggs as she feels fit to provide for. This would predict that if you found birds who laid 3 eggs, then added an egg to those nests, the offspring would be more likely to die than those of birds who naturally lay 4 eggs.

As another example, consider the sex ratio in humans. One might reason that males and females are equally balanced is because the X and Y chromosomes are randomly chosen with equal probability. But this is a proximate explanation that doesn’t explain _why_ this is important. The underlying evolutionary reason is that producing the gender that is scarce at any time has the reproductive advantage. Individuals that produce only male offspring will be selected against when females are scarce, and so the genes that predispose to male offspring are selected against. The same logic applies to genes that promote female offspring. Over time, these pressures balance out, so that individuals have genes that produce offspring at equal sex ratio.

The idea here is that a point of view based around natural selection can help make important medical discoveries. Darwinian medicine asks questions such as:

  * Is this trait of human biology adaptive?
  * What does the rest of the machinery look like? How can we test our predictions for this machinery?
  * If this trait seems undesirable, how could natural selection have allowed it to persist? Is the undesirable aspect the price of a hidden beneficial aspect?
  * Could the trait have been helpful during the Stone Age, and only causes disease in modern times?
