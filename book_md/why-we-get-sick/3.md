## 3: Infectious Disease

The war with bacterial and viral pathogens has gone on for millions of years and continues today. Our body has evolved defenses to combat infections, and in turn the pathogens evolve ways to overcome these defenses.

As previously described, the body is a collection of compromises. Maintaining the defenses at all times would be too costly—there’s no need to raise defenses when there are no pathogens around.

When the defenses _do_ activate, they sometimes cause symptoms that appear to be the disease. In reality, **the symptoms _are_ the defense mechanisms at work**. If this hypothesis is true, then treating these symptoms can counter-intuitively aggravate and lengthen the infection. Here are a few examples:

  * Fever increases effectiveness of the immune system. While it might superficially seem like the pathogen is causing the fever directly as a result of its havoc, in actuality the fever is our defense against infection.
    * In fact, syphilis was once treated by infecting the patient with malaria, which would induce a fever. This discovery won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Medicine!
    * Why don’t we have a fever all the time? Because fever depletes nutrient reserves 20% faster, causes temporary male sterility, and it may cause tissue damage.
  * During infections, the body depletes iron to limit bacterial reproduction. Bacteria need iron to reproduce. 
    * The body circulates proteins (called leukocyte endogenous mediator) to decrease blood iron availability. Furthermore, the protein transferrin circulates in blood and binds iron, sequestering iron away from bacteria.
    * This even affects our behavior—when sick, we tend to dislike iron-rich foods like ham and eggs.
    * There’s more suggestive evidence—egg white protein is 12% conalbumin, which binds iron, and thus keeps eggs fresh. Similarly, human milk protein is 20% lactoferrin while cow milk is 2% lactoferrin; breast-fed babies have fewer infections than bottle-fed babies.
    * Counter-intuitively, giving iron supplements in famines can _increase_ fatal infections, since the body hasn’t had a chance to develop transferrin.
  * When a local body part is infected, we feel pain. This reduces the use of damaged tissue that can compromise reconstruction and defensive mechanisms. The pain also causes us to remember the event that caused the infection, and to avoid the same situation in the future.
    * There’s suggestive evidence of the use of pain—a rare genetic disease prevents some people from feeling any pain, including pain from injury or illness. Nearly all of these people die by age 30.
  * When sick, we secrete mucus. The mucus traps pathogens, then coughing up mucus dislodges it to be swallowed, so that the digestive system kills pathogens and recycles the protein in mucus.
  * During illness, diarrhea causes ingested pathogens to be expelled more quickly.



**In all these defense mechanisms, treating the symptom for the sake of comfort might compromise recovery and worsen the illness.**

But not all defenses are adaptive or essential, and sometimes there isn’t a need to suffer without reason. The authors aren’t suggesting never relieving these defenses, but rather to be mindful of when relief is and isn’t net positive.

  * This line isn’t often easy to realize—studies that show that remedies aren’t effective are unlikely to get funded by industry. For example, medical companies are unlikely to fund a study that shows that nasal sprays delay recovery from cold.



#### Other Adaptations for Bodily Defense

Even when we’re not in an active infection, the body has a host of defenses that prevent disease. These include:

  * Protecting the skin. Scratching and grooming removes parasites. 
  * Taste receptors detect bitterness. Toxins tend to be more bitter than edible foods, and disliking bitterness makes us avoid toxins.
    * When in the body, toxins pass by the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the only part of the nervous system where brain cells are directly exposed to blood. Toxins trigger nausea and vomiting. This is why many drugs, like chemotherapy, are nauseating—they are in effect toxins to the body.
  * The authors propose that the function of menstruation is to shed the uterine lining to defend against uterine infections, especially sperm-borne infections. This helps justify the substantial cost of menstruation.
    * The suggestive evidence is that menstrual blood differs from circulating blood in ways that destroy pathogens while minimizing the loss of nutrients.
    * Furthermore, species that have sex less often, in distant fertile periods, tend to menstruate less than humans do.
    * Other researchers counter that the evidence doesn’t completely line up—menstruation doesn’t increase with infection, and there’s no consistent relationship between the amount of sperm females are exposed to and the amount of menstrual flow. This is an example of how good biological hypotheses are testable.



### Nuances About Bodily Defenses

Less accessible body areas have less regenerative capability. Infections of the brain or heart are usually fatal, so maintaining regenerative capabilities in these areas would have little benefit. As a result, natural selection seems to have shown that defense mechanisms to protect the brain during the rare infection don’t outweigh the costs of maintaining this system.

Some defensive behaviors have dual purposes, benefiting both host and pathogen.

  * Sneezing and diarrhea may be a defensive mechanism, but it also helps spread the pathogen.
  * Ideally, in medicine, we fine-tune defense to net benefit the human host.



Sometimes, infectious disease really does cause damage to the host. Often this is done to procure more resources for the pathogen and support its spreading or reproduction. Beyond these purposes, **damage to the host is often incidental and costly to both host and pathogen**. It does no good for the tapeworm to cause its host to be malnourished; it does no good for hepatitis to destroy the liver completely and quickly kill the host. As we’ll discuss in the next chapter, any especially virulent strain that rapidly killed its host would have little chance to spread itself, and the mutations that caused its virulence would be selected against.

### Pathogens Adapt to Defenses

Just like animals, bacteria and viruses undergo natural selection to propagate their genes. The pathogens that can best overcome host defenses succeed in reproducing and spread their beneficial genes to the population.

Pathogens have evolved a variety of responses to host defense, including:

  * Imitating the host immune system. 
    * Streptococcus bacterium presents a surface so similar to human cells that the immune system has difficulty recognizing it. In fact, antibodies produced in response to strep can damage the host itself, causing rheumatic fever and even mental disease like Sydenham’s chorea and possibly obsessive-compulsive disorder.
  * Evading the immune system.
    * The parasite that causes African sleeping sickness changes its surface proteins constantly to evade detection by antibodies. This is like a spy constantly changing its disguise.
  * Manipulating the host.
    * The rabies virus moves to the brain and adjusts the host behavior to better increase its own propagation. It paralyzes swallowing muscles, causing saliva to build up in the mouth and thus increasing the concentration of virus in the mouth. Then it increases the host’s aggression to better spread by bite.



### Strategies and Counters

We’ve seen a variety of strategies for hosts and counterstrategies by pathogens. Some observations of infectious disease, like decreasing iron levels, benefit the host; others benefit the pathogen; some are merely incidental damage in the ongoing war.

Here is a classification of how infectious disease manifests, based on their function.

**Observation** | **Examples** | **Beneficiary**  
---|---|---  
Hygienic measure by host  | Killing mosquitoes, avoiding sick neighbors, grooming, removal of parasites  | Host   
Host defenses  | Fever, iron withholding, sneezing, vomiting  | Host   
Repair of damage by host  | Regeneration of tissues  | Host   
Compensation for damage by host  | Chewing on the other side of the mouth to avoid tooth pain from infected tooth  | Host   
Damage to host tissues by pathogen  | Tooth decay, hepatitis liver damage  | Neither   
Impairment of host by pathogen  | Ineffective chewing, decreased detoxification of blood by infected hepatitis liver  | Neither   
Evasion of host defenses by pathogen  | Molecular mimicry (MHC complex), change in antigens (trypanosome changes surface proteins)  | Pathogen   
Attack on host defenses by pathogen  | Destruction of white blood cells; secretion of factors that inhibit inflammation  | Pathogen   
Uptake and use of nutrients by pathogen  | Growth and proliferation of trypanosomes, viruses bind to cellular receptors and enter cells to hijack resources and replicate  | Pathogen   
Dispersal of pathogen  | Transfer of malaria parasite to a new host by mosquito, sneezing  | Pathogen   
Manipulation of host by pathogen  | Exaggerated sneezing, diarrhea, behavioral changes (rabies increases chance of bites)  | Pathogen
