## Exercise: Practice Questioning Your Thoughts

Katie suggests that you can release resistant thoughts by writing down your interpretation of a situation that upsets you, asking yourself four specific questions, and then reframing your thoughts until you feel at peace with the situation.

* * *

Reflect on something in your life that you’re unhappy about. This could be something that’s happening now, something that happened in the past, or something that might happen in the future. Write short simple sentences to express your thoughts and feelings about the situation.

Consider if there is any evidence that disproves your interpretation of the situation. Write down at least one example that reveals your statement as untrue.

Reflect on how your interpretation of the situation influences your subsequent thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Write down at least one consequence of choosing to interpret the situation this way.

Consider if your interpretation of the situation inspires any positive feelings or behaviors that improve your life. Write down any benefits that come to mind.

Imagine if you’d never interpreted the situation this way. Write down at least one way that you’d think differently about your situation, and how this might change the way you feel and behave.
