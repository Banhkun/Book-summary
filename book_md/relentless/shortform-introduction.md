### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher:**Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster

Tim Grover originally self-published _Relentless_ through Relentless Publishing LLC. in 2014—Scribner published the book later that year. (This guide covers the later Scribner edition of the book.) While _Relentless_ is Grover’s first and best-known book, he’s written two additional books since its release: personal training guide _Jump Attack_ (2014) and self-help guide _Winning_ (2021).

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Tim Grover wrote _Relentless_ 15 years into his personal training career working with basketball legends like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Dwayne Wade. He claims that working with these players helped him understand what being the best requires, and aims to share that knowledge through his writing— _Relentless_ is the first book in Grover’s “Winning Trilogy,” which also includes _Jump Attack_ and _Winning_.

While _Relentless_ isn’t strictly a sports psychology book, it shares many similarities with the genre, which includes other books like Michael Sheard’s _Mental Toughness_ (2009) and Sian Beilock’s _Choke_ (2010). Grover’s book differs from others in the genre in that it’s based on his personal experiences and observations of excellent athletes, rather than on psychological research.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Relentless_ is the number one bestselling sports training book on Amazon. It’s received positive reviews from celebrity athletes like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, who speak to Grover’s ability to encourage success in his clients. Since the publication of his book, Grover has built a larger Relentless System brand, which involves lifestyle coaching, a blog, online virtual training, and public speaking.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

The majority of reviews of _Relentless_ are positive, noting that the book is easy to understand and promotes a mindset that encourages success. Positive reviewers also appreciate the book’s direct and declarative approach to self-help, which tells readers to stop making excuses and start pursuing success.

Negative reviews tend to criticize the book for not offering practical advice on how to become relentless and for relying too heavily on anecdotes to make arguments. Some also take issue with Grover’s recommendations, claiming that they promote working too hard at the expense of mental health or are unethical. They cite in particular Grover’s argument that relentless people shouldn’t apologize for misdeeds and his use of aggressive language like “attack” and “kill” in his discussions on achieving success.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Grover’s approach continually connects his recommendations back to his overall definition of relentlessness—putting everything you have towards reaching a goal. When he recommends a method or principle, he’ll explain how his principle allows you to fully commit yourself to pursuing success. He tends to argue via declarative statements backed up by anecdotes and experiences from his or his clients’ careers.

The extent to which _Relentless_ makes recommendations is unclear—in the introduction of the book, Grover says that he’s not trying to tell readers what to do. This claim, combined with the book’s use of the third person to describe relentless people, suggests that the book is less instructive and more observational. However, Grover describes his book as a guide to being relentless, which suggests it’s _more_ instructive than observational.

This question of instruction versus observation is important to consider when thinking about criticisms and defenses of _Relentless_ —a critic might say that Grover makes bad recommendations, but a supporter could say that Grover isn’t explicitly making recommendations.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Grover organizes his book into 13 sections covering the main qualities that consistently relentless people demonstrate. However, the 13 sections tend to overlap in their focus. This overlap allows a reader to fully understand what a relentless mindset is, but also means the book often repeats the same ideas multiple times.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In our guide, we’ve reorganized Grover’s 13 principles into the two main categories that all his qualities fall under: being motivated by success in itself and acting on instinct. We’ve done this to avoid repetition and to streamline the connections between each of Grover’s suggestions and relentlessness. We’ve also chosen to frame _Relentless_ as instructional rather than observational, directly referencing the reader instead of making observations about what relentless people do. By doing so, we can better explain how to apply the book to your own life and career.

Our commentary supplements Grover’s ideas with supporting and contrasting psychological research. In addition, we’ve provided practical advice on how to apply Grover’s recommendations and clarifications of his arguments that contain conflicting information.
