## Exercise: Reflect on Your Pressures

Consider the pressure you’re currently under, and how you can use that pressure to help you be relentless.

* * *

What was the biggest source of pressure for you in the last week? In the last month? Explain your answers.

Which of these pressures were productive (that is, encouraged you toward success)? Which were unproductive (that is, came about due to distraction or lack of commitment)?

How can you increase productive pressure? (For example, you might ask to take the lead on a few projects at work, so their success depends on you.)

How can you decrease unproductive pressure? (For example, you might feel pressed for time because you always get out the door late in the morning. You can reduce this pressure by committing to preparing the next day’s clothes and meals before you go to bed.)
