## Chapter 4: Use Any Means Necessary

Pushing yourself hard to improve and pressuring yourself are two essential principles to satisfying your need to succeed. However, to get the most out of these principles, Grover argues that you must follow the third principle behind the Unstoppable need to succeed: seeking success by any means necessary.****

In this chapter, we’ll explore the three methods Grover argues are crucial for following the principle of using any means necessary to succeed:

  1. Make sacrifices
  2. Accept discomfort
  3. Ignore judgments



### Method #1: Make Sacrifices

Using any means necessary to succeed in your field requires you to make sacrifices in everything else you do. Grover insists that you can only be Unstoppable at one thing and that you’ll have to spend less time and energy on everything else. If you split time and energy between multiple disciplines, then**** you aren’t giving everything you have to any of them and therefore aren’t pursuing success relentlessly.

(Shortform note: Gary Keller supports this idea of total commitment to one area of your life in _The One Thing_. He explains that extraordinary success comes from intentionally focusing your time on actions that carry you toward a specific goal—not from spreading your focus across everything you feel you _should_ be doing and treating every area of your life as equally important.)

Not only will you have to avoid spending time and energy on other disciplines, but you’ll also have to avoid spending too much time and energy on your family and relationships. Ultimately, this means that being Unstoppable comes with isolation. You’ll spend less time with the people you love and care about, and since there are so few other Unstoppable people almost nobody will understand what you’ve gone through to get where you are.

(Shortform note: Grover’s recommendation here seems to argue in favor of isolation, saying that spending too much time developing relationships impedes success. However, studies contrast with Grover by suggesting isolation negatively impacts mental and physical health, which could prevent success by damaging your motivation or your performance in your field.)

### Method #2: Accept Discomfort

The sacrifices mentioned above might make you feel uncomfortable, and further suggest that the life of the Unstoppable can be unpleasant. Grover doesn’t argue with this and says that **you must experience and _accept_ this discomfort to be Unstoppable. **Anyone can follow a clear, painless path toward success. But when success requires confronting fear, uncertainty, or even physical pain, discomfort holds back the Good and Great while the Unstoppable relentlessly push through it.

An example of this is a protester on a hunger strike. They feel intense discomfort and constantly face the temptation to give in and do what’s comfortable. An Unstoppable protester accepts this discomfort, knowing it's unpleasant but necessary for achieving their goal.

> **The Power of Accepting Discomfort**
> 
> Psychological research agrees with Grover’s argument that accepting discomfort is productive, and goes even further by suggesting that doing so will _lessen_ discomfort in the future. Specifically, psychologist Marsha Linehan discovered this when creating a method for accepting discomfort called dialectical behavioral therapy, or DBT.
> 
> One of the main theories behind DBT is that emotional suffering comes less from feelings and more from how you think about your feelings. DBT reduces this suffering by using a method called “radical acceptance”: Acknowledging your discomfort and accepting that it’s there without passing any judgments on it. More and more research suggests that radical acceptance leads to increased peace of mind, increased willpower, and increased emotional management skills.
> 
> The success of DBT suggests that accepting discomfort doesn’t just allow you to stay relentless, but will actually help _reduce_ your discomfort as you continue to pursue relentlessness.

### Method #3: Ignore Judgments

One kind of discomfort you might experience at some point when becoming Unstoppable is judgment from other people.**** Grover recommends ignoring these judgments because **acknowledging them creates self-doubt,** which prevents relentlessness.

(Shortform note: While Grover recommends you ignore judgments, psychological research suggests that even indirect judgments you might not consciously notice still have a significant negative impact on performance. Studies of “stereotype threat” show that members of groups associated with negative stereotypes face increased performance anxiety, even when others only passively mention those stereotypes. This increased anxiety often leads to worse performance. Research on stereotype threat suggests that Grover’s advice to ignore judgments might not prevent them from negatively impacting your performance.)

Grover explores two judgments you might get from others when pursuing relentlessness and explains how acknowledging them holds you back.

#### Judgment #1: “You’re Arrogant”

Grover explains that the intense confidence needed for avoiding fear and self-doubt will often come off as arrogance to others. Acknowledging or believing this judgment will damage this confidence, though, and will make it easier for you to feel fear or self-doubt and freeze up under pressure.

Furthermore, you shouldn’t acknowledge this judgment because it’s not true. Grover explains that there’s an important difference between relentless confidence and arrogance:**the ability to acknowledge errors and mistakes.** Because an Unstoppable person always seeks improvement, they admit when they’re wrong and work to make sure it doesn’t happen again. On the other hand, an arrogant person doesn’t acknowledge their mistakes and blames others or makes excuses instead of working to improve.

(Shortform note: Psychologists expand on Grover’s distinction between arrogance and confidence further by arguing that confidence and arrogance are mutually exclusive. This is because arrogance is actually a person’s attempt to overcome a _lack_ of confidence by comparing themselves favorably to others. Following this argument, the Unstoppable _can’t_ be arrogant because one of their defining characteristics is confidence in themselves.)

#### Judgment #2: “You’re a Bad Person”

The sacrifices you must make to be Unstoppable, as well as the indulgent ways you might unwind or release pressure (which we’ll explore in Part 3), might lead others to make the judgment that you’re a bad person.**** This judgment claims that you value success too highly, which makes you do morally questionable things. Acknowledging this judgment means questioning your goals and everything you’ve put towards them, and will shatter your confidence. Grover insists that you need to ignore this judgment and that**you should never apologize for the things you have to do to succeed or that make you who you are.** If you do, you’ll feel self-doubt and won’t be able to relentlessly pursue success.

(Shortform note: Many critics have ethical concerns with this advice, saying that Grover argues against self-reflection and repentance for bad behavior in favor of succeeding at a task. Critics claim this seems like Grover values success more than he values living ethically. That being said, there is room for interpretation in whether Grover is telling people how they should live, or if he’s just writing about how the Unstoppable are. If you interpret _Relentless_ as the latter, then Grover is just making observations instead of arguments.)
