## Part 2: The Unstoppable Need to Succeed | Chapter 2: Never Stop Improving

Now that we understand what relentlessness is and what can hold you back from it, we’ll look at the qualities of the Unstoppable: those who are consistently relentless.

For the rest of the guide, we’ll discuss the two main qualities Grover says you need to be Unstoppable: the need to succeed and the ability to direct your instincts. We’ll start in this part of the guide by defining the need to succeed through three different principles that support this quality:

  1. **Never stop improving**
  2. **Put intense pressure on yourself**
  3. **Use any means necessary**



This chapter outlines the first principle: Never stop improving. Grover says that constantly seeking improvement is a crucial part of doing everything you can to achieve your goals, and therefore is crucial for acting relentlessly. In addition, by constantly pushing as hard as you can to improve**,** you’ll**better understand what you’re capable of and how you can use those capabilities** to succeed.

(Shortform note: Psychology suggests that constantly pushing yourself hard, as Grover encourages, can lead to burnout—a kind of emotional exhaustion characterized by disinterest and cynicism in regards to your field. The risk of burnout suggests that there are moments when not pushing yourself will actually better enable you to succeed in the long run, since it’ll make you healthier and keep you motivated to succeed. To avoid burnout while still pushing hard, experts recommend you learn to recognize when you’re pushing yourself out of habit versus when you’re doing it for a worthy goal. Ease off if you’re acting habitually, and keep going if you have a good reason to do so.)

Grover recommends three methods that will help you commit to constant improvement:

  1. Don’t define what’s impossible
  2. Never settle for “good enough”
  3. Surround yourself with relentlessness



### Method #1: Don’t Define What’s Impossible

Grover emphasizes that an important part of seeking constant improvement is **never claiming that something is impossible** because it places a limit on you that may or may not actually exist. After all, there are plenty of things that seemed impossible until somebody did them—going to the moon, for example, or running the 100-meter dash in under 10 seconds. By calling things impossible, you naturally start focusing on what you think you can’t do, which is the kind of thinking that leads to fears and self-doubts that hold back the Good and the Great.

#### Redefine Failure

To avoid thinking about what you can’t do, Grover also recommends you redefine failure. **It’s not a lack of success—the only failure is giving up and no longer working towards success.** By using this definition of failure, you won’t focus on what you can’t do and will instead focus on how you can improve and overcome setbacks.****

(Shortform note: You might think that not acknowledging the impossible or failure like Grover recommends means not being in touch with reality, and exaggerating your own abilities. Carol S. Dweck (_Mindset_) argues that this is not the case and that those who believe they can improve to overcome challenges actually have a better understanding of their abilities. This is because focusing on improvement requires knowing your shortcomings and testing your limits. On the other hand, giving up or declaring you can’t do something means not discovering your full capabilities.)

### Method #2: Never Settle for “Good Enough”

Even though it isn’t explicitly giving up, putting in only partial effort or settling for “good enough”**** means**** no longer having a relentless mindset: As soon as you settle, you stop putting in everything you have.

Grover also points out that each time you settle for doing less, you’re only making it easier for yourself to settle again in the future. This means that not only do you fail to act relentlessly in the moment, but you also have a high risk of not acting relentlessly later on. To avoid this, Grover recommends you seek out new responsibilities and ways to improve without anyone asking you to.

(Shortform note: While Grover suggests you never accept where you are in your process of improvement, Mark Manson (_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_) argues that doing so is crucial for good emotional health. Manson explains that when you always expect yourself to be exceptional, you set yourself up for stress and disappointment when you inevitably don’t meet your high expectations. By lowering your expectations, you won’t judge yourself by too harsh a standard. This helps you better appreciate your own abilities and feel less inadequate and insecure. However, keep in mind that while lowering expectations might be preferable for mental health, doing so will also prevent relentlessness.)

### Method #3: Surround Yourself With Relentlessness

Grover’s third method for seeking constant improvement is to surround yourself with other relentless people.**** These people help you improve by offering accountability and honesty**** that you can’t get from non-relentless people. Grover explains why accountability and honesty are necessary for relentlessness, as well as why only relentless people can offer them:

#### Accountability

Due to the high pressure that comes from being Unstoppable, you’ll sometimes feel tempted to give up or take the easy route. But the relentless people around you will **make sure you stay the course and continue giving everything you have** —they understand what success requires and will hold you accountable to that standard. This accountability means recognizing where you can put more effort in and pushing you to do so. On the other hand, non-relentless people don’t understand how important total commitment is or might be uncomfortable with pushing you harder, so they can’t offer this accountability.

> **Organizing Your Relentless Support**
> 
> For practical advice on what kind of relentless people you should surround yourself with, look to Jack Canfield’s _The Success Principles_. Canfield recommends creating three categories of collaborators, each fulfilling a different role:
> 
>   * **Achievement group:** Make an achievement group of five or six people and meet with them to discuss how you’ll accomplish your goals. This group can be personal or professional, and can relate or not relate to your field—what’s important is that everybody works towards a shared purpose and provides each other with new perspectives and resources.
> 
>   * **Accountability partner:** Have one accountability partner, and meet regularly with them to make sure you’re both doing the work necessary to reach your goals.
> 
>   * **Support team:** A support team consists of experts dedicated to helping you excel in your field. Meet with members of your support team regularly in a one-on-one setting.
> 
> 


#### Honesty

Other relentless people will also be honest with you, giving you a reality check when you need it. Honesty is crucial for improvement because it’s how you learn **what needs improvement and how you can improve on it.** Relentless people don’t care about offending or upsetting others while pursuing success, and so they’ll tell you exactly what you need to hear. This could mean telling you what you do poorly, why you do it poorly, or how to stop doing it poorly. Non-relentless people can’t offer the same level of honesty, because the fear of being offensive or upsetting holds them back.

> **Using Feedback Well**
> 
> While Grover recommends improving by surrounding yourself with people who give honest feedback well, Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen (_Thanks for the Feedback_) argue that _receiving feedback well is even more important_ for improvement. To receive feedback well, they recommend a three-step process:
> 
>   * Avoid trying to prove that the feedback is “wrong.” If you do this, you’ll automatically dismiss what they say and won’t look for ways you could improve.
> 
>   * Instead of looking for what’s wrong, look for what’s different between your perspective and theirs. Consider why the two of you might have different perspectives, without dismissing either one.
> 
>   * Start looking for what’s right about the feedback—points you agree on or lessons you can learn from it. Even if you disagree with the feedback giver, you still might find they have valuable insight on areas where you can improve.
