## 1-Page Summary

In _Relentless_ , author Tim Grover explains the qualities you’ll need to become the best in your field—qualities that he collectively calls “relentlessness.” In this guide, we’ll first define relentlessness. Then, we’ll explore the two main qualities Grover argues are essential to relentlessness:

  1. **The need to succeed:** constantly pushing yourself as hard as you can to succeed by any means necessary 
  2. **Directed instincts:** training yourself to use your animal instincts constructively in your field



### Part 1: Defining Relentlessness

Grover defines “relentlessness” as a state of mind in which you’re**fully dedicated to becoming stronger, surviving, and overcoming obstacles to achieve your goals.** Being relentless, Grover asserts, is how you can become _the_ best at what you do and succeed time and time again.

(Shortform note: In some ways, relentlessness is similar to what psychologists call “conscientiousness” or the ability to make and work towards goals consistently while delaying gratification and overcoming obstacles. However, there’s one major difference between relentlessness and conscientiousness: While conscientious people plan ahead to avoid impulsive behavior, relentless people _rely_ on impulsive behavior to help them succeed (which we’ll explore in Part 3).)

Grover explains that anyone can be relentless in pursuing any task or discipline—relationships, your job, an art form, and so on. This is because **relentlessness isn’t about what you do, but about how you approach what you do**. In addition, he says that anyone can be relentless because relentlessness is natural and instinctual.**_All_** animals, even humans, are born with an instinctual drive to overcome obstacles and survive—in other words, we’re _born_ relentless.

> **How Much Does Evolution Inspire Behavior?**
> 
> Grover’s argument here—that relentlessness is instinctual—is similar to that of “evolutionary psychology”: A framework that argues that human behavior is heavily influenced by instincts gained through evolution. However, scientists and scholars heavily debate the merits of evolutionary psychology. Its main critics argue that experiences or environment inspire behaviors more than instinct does. They also argue that it’s impossible to test the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology because even if researchers observe an expected behavior, there’s no way of knowing if instinct inspired it.
> 
> Note that Grover isn’t using this method of psychology to make his arguments—in fact, at one point he argues that science can’t ever explain relentless instincts. However, his ideas are similar enough to evolutionary psychology that these criticisms are still worth considering.

After defining relentlessness, Grover notes three categories of people defined by how often they act relentlessly:**Rarely or never relentless people are “Good,” people who are relentless in specific circumstances are “Great,” and people who are always relentless are “Unstoppable.”**

#### Defining the Good

The Good, according to Grover, are rarely or never relentless due to a fear of failure. This fear prevents the Good from fully committing to a task—therefore preventing them from relentlessly pursuing success. Because of this, they can be good at what they do but will never be the best or even great. (Shortform note: Seth Godin (_Purple Cow_) agrees with Grover that fear of failure prevents success and offers further explanation as to why. Godin argues that being afraid holds you back from taking risks—which are essential for success because they help you stand out from everyone else playing it safe. This makes other people more likely to remember you and offer you opportunities.)

##### The Good Freeze Up Under Pressure

Grover explains that fear of failure also makes the Good freeze up under pressure. Pressure causes the Good to focus on the possibility of failure instead of on what they’re trying to accomplish—in other words, **they’ll freeze up because they overthink what they’re doing.**

(Shortform note: Psychologist Sian Beilock agrees that overthinking leads to paralysis in _Choke_ and offers a scientific explanation for why this happens. Beilock argues that once you learn to perform a task, your brain approaches that task without needing to think through each of its individual steps. However, **overthinking makes you go back to consciously thinking through each step** like a beginner would. This shift in approach confuses your brain, causing you to freeze up and fail to perform.)

#### Defining the Great

One step above the Good, there are the Great—people whom Grover says can be relentless _under specific circumstances_.**** The Great can be relentless **only in specific situations they have prepared for extensively**. This preparation gives the Great a clear planned approach to the situation, which allows them to avoid overthinking and commit their focus to action. However, if circumstances unexpectedly change, creating a situation that the Great haven’t prepared for, they’ll experience the same self-doubts and fears that the Good have and freeze up. This is why the Great can only be relentless sometimes—their confidence is situational.

(Shortform note: Sian Beilock (_Choke_) explains the science behind why unfamiliar situations cause you to freeze up. When you’re faced with a situation you know well, you experience stimulation in the portions of your brain responsible for the actions associated with that situation. However, in an unfamiliar situation, those parts of the brain aren’t as active because your brain doesn’t _have_ associated actions, and therefore, you can’t respond as quickly. Since the Great only plan for specific situations, it follows that their brains can only respond with immediate action to those specific circumstances.)

### Part 2: The Unstoppable Need to Succeed

Now that we understand what relentlessness is and what can hold you back from it, we’ll look at those who are consistently relentless: the Unstoppable. For the rest of the guide, we’ll discuss the two main qualities Grover says you need to be Unstoppable: the need to succeed and the ability to direct your instincts. We’ll start by defining the need to succeed through three different principles that support this quality:

  1. **Never stop improving**
  2. **Put intense pressure on yourself**
  3. **Use any means necessary**



#### Principle #1: Never Stop Improving

. Grover says that constantly seeking improvement is a crucial part of doing everything you can to achieve your goals and therefore is crucial for acting relentlessly. In addition, by constantly pushing as hard as you can to improve**,** you’ll**better understand what you’re capable of and how you can use those capabilities** to succeed.

(Shortform note: Psychology suggests that constantly pushing yourself hard, as Grover encourages, can lead to burnout—a kind of emotional exhaustion characterized by disinterest and cynicism in regards to your field. The risk of burnout suggests that there are moments when not pushing yourself will actually better enable you to succeed in the long run, since it’ll make you healthier and keep you motivated to succeed. To avoid burnout while still pushing hard, experts recommend you learn to recognize when you’re pushing yourself out of habit versus when you’re doing it for a worthy goal. Ease off if you’re acting habitually, and keep going if you have a good reason to do so.)

Grover recommends two methods that will help you constantly improve: not defining the impossible and surrounding yourself with relentless people. We’ll now explore why these methods push you to constantly improve.

##### Method #1: Don’t Define What’s Impossible

Grover emphasizes that an important part of seeking constant improvement is **never claiming that something is impossible** because it places a limit on you that may or may not actually exist. By calling things impossible, you naturally start focusing on what you think you can’t do, which is the kind of thinking that leads to fears and self-doubts that hold back the Good and the Great.

To avoid thinking about what you can’t do, Grover recommends you redefine failure. **It’s not a lack of success—the only failure is giving up and no longer working towards success.** By using this definition of failure, you won’t focus on what you can’t do and will instead focus on how you can improve and overcome setbacks.****

(Shortform note: You might think that not acknowledging the impossible or failure like Grover recommends means not being in touch with reality and exaggerating your own abilities. Carol S. Dweck (_Mindset_) argues that this is not the case and that those who believe they can improve to overcome challenges actually have a better understanding of their abilities. This is because focusing on improvement requires knowing your shortcomings and testing your limits. On the other hand, giving up or declaring you can’t do something means not discovering your full capabilities.)

##### Method #2: Surround Yourself With Relentlessness

Grover’s second method for seeking constant improvement recommends you surround yourself with other relentless people.**** Relentless people know what’s needed to succeed, and will keep you accountable to those standards and be totally honest about areas for improvement. Non-relentless people can’t offer this level of accountability and honesty, because they’ll be uncomfortable pushing you harder or worried about offending you.

> **Organizing Your Relentless Support**
> 
> For practical advice on what kind of relentless people you should surround yourself with, look to Jack Canfield’s _The Success Principles_. Canfield recommends creating three categories of collaborators, each fulfilling a different role:
> 
>   * **Achievement group:** Make an achievement group of five or six people and meet with them to discuss how you’ll accomplish your goals.
> 
>   * **Accountability partner:** Have one accountability partner, and meet regularly with them to make sure you’re both doing the work necessary to reach your goals.
> 
>   * **Support team:** A support team consists of experts dedicated to helping you excel in your field. Meet with members of your support team regularly in a one-on-one setting.
> 
> 


#### Principle #2: Put Intense Pressure on Yourself

Grover’s second principle for developing the Unstoppable need to succeed is **constantly putting intense pressure on yourself**.**** Grover agrees with the commonly observed phenomenon that **people perform better under pressure,** and that being under pressure**** forces you to find ways to rise to whatever challenge you’re facing.

(Shortform note: While many psychologists agree that pressure under certain circumstances will improve performance, it’s often in the context of short-term high-stress situations like a basketball game. However, in a longer-term context or in a field that doesn’t require immediate and precise action, psychologists disagree with Grover on the benefits of pressure. For example, one study found that increased pressure correlated with worse performance in math students. This research suggests that the extent to which pressure will benefit you is dependent on what your discipline requires.)

Constant pressure**** allows you to**** avoid fear of failure and self-doubt**** in two ways:

  1. Constantly putting yourself under pressure gives you lots of practice managing the fear and stress that comes with it, so you’ll improve at managing these feelings.****
  2. Internal pressure makes _external_ pressure easier to handle. Others depending on you or having high expectations of you won’t cause fear or panic because **the pressure they put on you can’t be any more intense than the pressure you put on yourself.**



(Shortform note: Psychological research agrees with Grover’s argument that using stress as a tool helps you succeed, and suggests that, beyond helping you avoid fear of failure, it also benefits your mental and physical health. One study found that those who think of stress as a positive and motivating force focused less on negative emotions and had less cardiovascular stress.)

##### How to Productively Pressure Yourself

While pressure can help keep you relentless, Grover warns that you need to recognize the difference between productive and unproductive pressure.**** Pressure from your drive to succeed will help you stay relentless, while pressure from something like forgetting to do your work comes from a lack of commitment, and therefore doesn’t help you stay relentless. Grover suggests two ways you can pressure yourself productively: leading others and reframing your successes.****

**1) Leading others:** When you’re Unstoppable, others will naturally see you as a leader—this can add productive pressure, since doing everything you can to succeed often requires helping the people around you perform at their best as well. A leadership role also adds the pressure of needing to accept responsibility and blame if things go wrong—**being at the top means no one else is capable of picking up your slack if you fall short.**

(Shortform note: Marshall Goldsmith (_What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_) agrees with Grover that leaders should accept responsibility when things go wrong, but his reasons why differ: While Grover argues that you should accept blame to put pressure on yourself, Goldsmith argues you should accept blame because it’ll earn you the trust and respect of your followers. He explains that accepting blame earns trust and respect because it shows your followers that you have integrity, courage, and modesty.)

**2) Reframing success:** Grover explains that **success should increase the pressure you put on yourself instead of being an excuse to relax.** The principle of constantly seeking improvement means that each success is merely a step on your path towards Unstoppable dominance in your field—not the destination. After each success, you'll have to set your sights on the next, _larger_ success instead of relaxing.

(Shortform note: Grant Cardone recommends a similar reframing of success in _The 10X Rule_ , but he takes his argument further than Grover by claiming a one-time achievement shouldn’t even be called a success—real success is only gained through many accomplishments over a long period of time. By adopting Cardone’s mindset, you might make it easier to frame one-time accomplishments as single steps on a journey to success, allowing you to keep up pressure on yourself.)

#### Principle #3: Use Any Means Necessary

To truly push and pressure yourself as hard as you can, Grover argues that you must follow the third principle behind the Unstoppable need to succeed: seeking success by any means necessary.**** Grover provides two methods for following this principle: making sacrifices and accepting discomfort.

##### Method #1: Make Sacrifices

Grover insists that you can only be Unstoppable at one thing and that you’ll have to make sacrifices elsewhere in your life by spending less time and energy on everything else. If you split time and energy between multiple disciplines, then**** you aren’t giving everything you have to any of them and therefore aren’t pursuing success relentlessly. Not only will you have to avoid spending time and energy on other disciplines, but you’ll also have to avoid spending too much time and energy on your family and relationships.

(Shortform note: Gary Keller supports this idea of total commitment to one area of your life in _The One Thing_. He explains that extraordinary success comes from intentionally focusing your time on actions that carry you toward a specific goal—not from spreading your focus across everything you feel you _should_ be doing and treating every area of your life as equally important.)

##### Method #2: Accept Discomfort

The sacrifices mentioned above might make you feel uncomfortable, and further suggest that the life of the Unstoppable can be unpleasant. Grover doesn’t argue with this and says that **you must experience and _accept_ this discomfort to be Unstoppable. **Anyone can follow a clear and painless path toward success. But when success requires confronting fear, uncertainty, or even physical pain, discomfort holds back the Good and Great while the Unstoppable relentlessly push through it.

(Shortform note: Psychological research agrees with Grover’s argument that accepting discomfort helps you pursue success and goes even further by suggesting that doing so will _lessen_ discomfort in the future. Studies suggest that accepting discomfort without judgment leads to increased peace of mind, increased willpower, and increased emotional management skills. According to this research, accepting discomfort doesn’t just allow you to stay relentless, but will actually reduce your discomfort overall as you continue to pursue relentlessness.)

### Part 3: The Unstoppable Direct Their Instincts

We’ve just explored the first main quality of the Unstoppable, the need to succeed, and discussed how you can productively fulfill this need. Now, we’ll explore Grover’s secondUnstoppable quality: the ability to direct your instincts—that is, the ability to use your natural animal instincts to accomplish the complex goals required by your field or discipline.

(Shortform note: You might assume that your animal instincts are so hardwired into your mind that you can’t tell them what to do. However, this isn’t the case—the rational part of your mind can actually train your instincts. After all, memory and experience can inspire instincts—for example, a child touching a hot stove will learn from that experience, and later will have the instinct to check if a stove is hot before touching it.)

In this section, we’ll examine three areas Grover says to direct your instincts—knowledge, emotions, and your primal self as well as how doing so will help you become Unstoppable.

#### Instinctively Using Knowledge

Acting on instinct, argues Grover, means acting without consciously thinking—this allows you to better use knowledge of your discipline because you can just _act_ on your knowledge without having to think about the best way to use it. Thinking opens you up to self-doubt and fear, damaging your confidence and, as a result, your ability to be relentless. On the other hand, by directing your instinct to use your knowledge automatically, you’ll be able to act immediately with no distractions or self-doubts holding you back.

(Shortform note: Research supports Grover’s argument that you can “train” your instincts to rely on the things you know or believe. A study on people who had performed heroic acts by risking their lives to save others found that the majority of these people hadn’t considered if their action was the right thing to do, but instead acted intuitively on their existing moral beliefs. This suggests that your more “rational” thoughts and beliefs inspire instinctive action.)

To instinctively use your knowledge, you need**** mastery: an understanding of your field so deep that you can access and use knowledge without taking time to think about it. Mastery allows you to address _any_ situation and to remain calm if circumstances suddenly change. **Mastering your field requires a lot of hard work over a long period of time,** and Grover says there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get it.

  * For example: A Great mechanic repairs a car by researching what the problem may be and how to fix it in the specific model they’re working with. An Unstoppable mechanic with mastery in the field knows his job so well that he can immediately identify the problem and understands the repair approach the specific model needs. 



(Shortform note: Anette Karmiloff-Smith explains the brain science behind mastery in _Beyond Modularity_. She suggests that once you’re skilled enough to perform a task automatically, your brain puts less effort into the task and can use that effort on other things. Your brain can then use this “freed up” power for a more flexible and creative approach.)

#### Instinctively Controlling Emotions

Grover explains that acting on instinct also helps control your emotions. This is crucial for consistent relentlessness because as we’ve discussed, strong emotions like fear and uncertainty can cause you to freeze up or doubt yourself—preventing you from acting relentlessly.

Grover explains that acting instinctively helps you control your emotions because it activates **intense focus:** **a state of mind where you block out all emotions except for focused, determined anger.** Acting instinctively activates intense focus because you’re acting without conscious thought—you don’t have time to let in distractions or emotions other than determined anger.

(Shortform note: While Grover argues that blocking out emotions will help you act decisively and confidently, psychological research contrasts with this idea. In _Descartes’ Error_ , Antonio Damasio explores the role of emotions in decision making. He researched people unable to experience emotion due to brain damage and found that they have trouble making simple decisions, often taking _hours_ to do so—unlike Grover, Damasio concludes that emotion actually benefits decisiveness.)

#### Access Your Primal Self

Once you’re able to direct your instincts to properly use your knowledge and control your emotions, Grover declares that you must access your primal self: **the person you are when acting entirely through instinct.** Directing your instincts _productively_ is the foundation for this step because it ensures you’ll still relentlessly pursue your goals even when acting impulsively.

Grover explains that to access your primal self, you must indulge primal desires: things you impulsively want, but keep secret because society tells you to (like sex, drugs, or gambling). Indulging primal desires allows you to practice accessing your primal self even when relaxing, making it easier to access when seeking success in your field.

(Shortform note: The primal self Grover speaks about is quite similar to what Sigmund Freud called the Id: the part of your mind dedicated to fulfilling impulses, needs, and desires. However, the two have contrasting beliefs about how you harness this animal, instinctual part of yourself: Freud believes that impulsive sexual desires motivate all great achievements, while Grover claims that the desire for _success in itself_ motivates achievement.)

However, Grover also emphasizes that you need to make sure that indulging your primal desires doesn’t take priority over succeeding in your field. If your desires take first priority, you’ll spend too much time and energy on indulgence and won’t be able to relentlessly pursue success in your field.

### Calling It Quits

Grover does acknowledge that there will come a time when you have nothing left to prove and are ready to finish up your career or lifelong commitment. He notes that in order for you to do so, your self-control will have to triumph over your primal self, or else you’ll never feel satisfied and won’t stop seeking success until you’re dead and gone.

(Shortform note: Going from relentless to retired is a difficult transition—research shows that highly gifted individuals end up less happy later in life, stuck wondering if they _fully_ lived up to their potential. However, there is a solution to this unhappy decline: helping others. By transitioning into a mentor role, you can continue using the wisdom you’ve developed over the course of your life. Scientists call this collected wisdom “crystallized knowledge,” and believe that it peaks far later in life compared to other mental faculties—meaning that you still have opportunities to “live up to your potential” in various ways, even beyond retirement.)
