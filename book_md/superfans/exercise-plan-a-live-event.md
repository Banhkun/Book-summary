## Exercise: Plan a Live Event

Flynn argues that one of the best ways to get customers involved with your brand is through live events. This activity will help you come up with an idea for a live event to bring your fan base together for an exciting, memorable experience.

* * *

Brainstorm three ideas for live events that would make sense for your brand: maybe a Q&A session, a conference, or even something festive.

Once you have three ideas, write down which one you think would provide the most value for your fan community and explain why.
