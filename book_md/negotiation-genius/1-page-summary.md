## 1-Page Summary

In _Negotiation Genius_ , negotiation experts Deepak Malhotra and Max H. Bazerman provide a comprehensive system for negotiating successfully in all areas of your life, whether you’re negotiating a deal with a customer, a salary with a potential employer, or how to divide household chores with your roommate. To be a “negotiation genius,” you must prepare extensively before a negotiation and learn to not only claim but _create_ value. By applying the authors’ strategies, you can avoid common negotiation pitfalls, make attractive deals, and strengthen relationships along the way.

Malhotra and Bazerman are best-selling authors and professors at the Harvard Business School (HBS). Their negotiation techniques are based on years of research, their experiences as negotiators and consultants, and the courses they teach at HBS.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the authors’ advice for preparing for and creating value during a negotiation. Then, we’ll look at common obstacles negotiators face and explore ways to avoid them or use them to your advantage. Throughout the guide, we’ll compare the authors’ strategies with those of other negotiation experts and supplement their advice with additional psychological insights.

### Prepare for Your Negotiation

According to Malhotra and Bazerman, the first step to good negotiation is preparation. Before you enter a negotiation, you must **gather as much information as you can about the other party.** Being well-prepared allows you to identify opportunities to add value to both parties, recognize the most effective negotiation strategies to use, and anticipate potential challenges.

(Shortform note: Other experts note the costly consequences of failing to prepare: Poor preparation can triple the amount of time and money spent after a negotiation to fix issues created by less favorable deals.)

#### Calculate BATNAs, RVs, and the ZOPA

The authors suggest you prepare three main things before entering your negotiation: your and your counterpart’s best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA), reservation value (RV), and zone of possible agreement (ZOPA).

##### Step 1: Calculate Your BATNA and RV

In every negotiation, you want to make a deal that leaves you better off than if you hadn’t negotiated. To ensure this outcome, you must determine when you should walk away. You can do this by calculating your **best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) and your reservation value (RV).**

(Shortform note: Identifying your BATNA and RV is not the only way to determine when you should walk away from a deal. You can proactively create a breakpoint list: a list of potential offers from the other party that would prevent you from achieving your goals for the negotiation. This way, if any offer proposed by your counterpart matches something in your list, you can consider walking away from the negotiation. This method may help safeguard you from sinking more time into a negotiation or settling for an unsatisfactory deal than if you relied on your BATNA and RV alone.)

Your BATNA is**** the course of action you’ll take if your current negotiation fails and ends without a deal. For example, if you’re selling a boat, your BATNA is what you’ll do if you can’t agree on a price with a potential buyer—for example, you might take a lower offer from another buyer.

To determine what your BATNA is, identify all available options should your current negotiation fail. Then, select the option that has the highest value as your BATNA. For example, if your alternative options are to sell your boat to another buyer for less money, keep the boat for yourself, or give it away to a relative, you might decide that accepting the lower offer gives you the most value out of the three and should therefore be your BATNA.

(Shortform note: Although Malhotra and Bazerman suggest you choose the most valuable alternative option as your BATNA, some experts encourage you to maintain two or three BATNAs. Throughout your negotiation, circumstances might change and your strongest BATNA could fall through—for example, a potential buyer might withdraw their offer. If you only have one BATNA, consider ways to expand your options.)

Next, define your RV, the worst deal you’re willing to accept in your current negotiation. For example, this might be the highest price you’re willing to pay or the lowest price you’re willing to sell. You need to know your BATNA before you can accurately calculate your RV. Let’s continue the example to illustrate this.

You have two potential buyers for your boat. Buyer #1 has already offered you $9,000, but you think you can persuade them to increase their offer to $10,000. Now you’re negotiating with Buyer #2.

In your negotiation with Buyer #2, what is your best alternative option if the deal falls through, and what’s the lowest offer you’ll accept from Buyer #2? Since you know you can definitely get $9,000 from Buyer #1, which gives you more value than keeping the boat, that offer is your BATNA. And since you’re confident you can get Buyer #1 to give you $10,000 for the boat, $10,000 would be your RV in your negotiation with Buyer #2—you can walk away from anything less than $10,000 from Buyer #2 because you believe you can get $10,000 from Buyer #1.

> **Should You Measure Offers Against Your BATNA or Your RV?**
> 
> According to Malhotra and Bazerman, you should decide whether to accept or reject a deal based on your reservation value (RV). In _Getting to Yes_ , however, Roger Fisher and William Ury give different advice about how to test if an offer brings you more value than you’d get without negotiating.
> 
> Fisher and Ury suggest you measure all offers against your BATNA (rather than your RV) and see whether any offers satisfy your interests more than your BATNA will. They refer to your RV as your “bottom line,” or the worst acceptable outcome, and write that while it helps you avoid bad agreements, it can also prevent you from achieving better agreements. Since you decide what your bottom line is _before_ your negotiation, it tends to be too high or low and doesn’t adapt to new information you’ll receive during the negotiation.

##### Step 2: Calculate Your Counterpart’s BATNA and RV

To get the best possible deal for yourself, you must also calculate your counterpart’s BATNA and RV to assess how much value they’re willing to offer that you can seize.

First, calculate your counterpart’s BATNA by thinking about what _they_ would do if the negotiation ended without a deal. Consider the information you’ve gathered in your research and think through possible alternatives. For example, if you and your counterpart fail to reach an agreement on your boat’s price, their alternatives may include finding another boat to purchase, renting, or waiting until a similar model is available.

> **Consider Two Different BATNAs**
> 
> Sometimes your counterpart might be negotiating on behalf of an organization. In that case, you should estimate two different BATNAs for the other side: One for the individual you're negotiating with and one for the organization they represent. You may find that they differ: If a negotiator fails to close the deal and their job performance depends on how many deals they close, their BATNA might be to find another job. On the other hand, the BATNA of the organization they’re representing might be to open negotiations with other interested parties. So, the individual negotiator may have more incentive to close a deal than to get the best deal possible.
> 
> To assess how your counterpart's BATNA differs from the organization they’re representing, consider what their incentives might be, how they’re compensated, or what their long-term goals might be.

Next, calculate your counterpart’s RV by considering _why_ they want to make a deal. Then, think about how much benefit they expect from this desired outcome. For example, if you think your counterpart plans to flip your boat for a profit, you might research how valuable that could be. Then, you could reason that their RV is higher (they’re willing to pay more) than if they were simply using the boat for entertainment purposes.

(Shortform note: Other experts argue that the best way to estimate the other side’s RV is to simply collect as much information as possible, make assumptions based on that information, and then test your assumptions during your negotiation. This approach arguably involves less work and might be better suited when you can’t find out much about your counterpart’s desired outcomes of the negotiation.)

##### Step 3: Calculate the ZOPA

Once you’ve calculated BATNAs and RVs, identify the **zone of possible agreement (ZOPA):** The space between your RV and your counterpart’s RV. For example, if the lowest you’re willing to sell is $10,000 and the highest your counterpart’s willing to pay is $15,000, then the ZOPA is between $10,000 and $15,000. This range gives you a more tangible measurement of how much value you can either claim or surrender during a negotiation. To claim the most value, you want to make a deal as close to your counterpart’s RV as possible.

(Shortform note: If there’s no overlap between your RVs, you’re negotiating in a negative bargaining zone. This means that a deal can’t currently be reached. If you find yourself in this situation, either one or both parties must find a way to compromise or you can discover more of one another’s needs and desires in hopes of finding ways to make an agreement. For example, if the person buying your boat wants to use it to fish and you have fishing gear that will no longer be useful to you once you sell your boat, you might offer those in addition to the boat and the buyer may agree to pay a higher price.)

#### Uncover Hidden Information

Beyond your counterpart’s RV or interests, you should also pay attention to less obvious factors that may influence their willingness to accept or reject your offer. The authors suggest you look for information that negotiators commonly overlook, such as:

**1\. Other parties involved.** Reflect on how the actions of other parties may impact a negotiation. If you only focus on the negotiation at hand, you may achieve a deal that produces less value rather than more. For example, if two parties are in a bidding war for a company and a deal will result in a financial loss for the losing party, the two parties may continue to raise their bids until they both end up worse off. The winning party overpays while the losing party loses money.

**2\. How the other side makes decisions.** Your counterpart may be bound to specific decision-making rules, such as being required to weigh criteria differently or needing to get the approval of a supervisor. By discovering this, you can figure out how to meet these criteria in a way that’s most suitable for you.

(Shortform note: When you’re trying to find out who has the decision-making power, you may encounter “blockers”—people who claim to have decision-making authority when they really don’t. These might be assistants or people who can influence the decision-maker but aren’t actually involved in making the decision. To deal with blockers, you must first understand the blocker’s needs, treat them with respect, and validate their importance so that they can facilitate your access to the real decision-maker.)

**3\. How strong the other side’s position is.** Negotiators may overlook their competitor’s strengths or underestimate how much information they have. To avoid this, the authors recommend you deliberately consider what unique advantages your competitors may have.

> **Find Your Black Swans**
> 
> The hidden pieces of information Malhotra and Bazerman urge you to look for might be examples of what Chris Voss refers to as _unknown unknowns, or “Black Swans.”_ In _Never Split the Difference_ , Voss writes that there are three types of information in a negotiation: _known knowns_ (information you have), _known unknowns_ (information that’s hidden but you know exists), and _unknown unknowns_(information that’s hidden that you also _don’t know_ you lack).
> 
> Voss argues that Black Swans are often the most important pieces of information to uncover because they give you insight into your counterpart’s deeper desires, anxieties, and perspective of the world. To uncover this information, Voss recommends you build rapport with your counterpart and pay attention to any nonverbal cues your counterpart might be giving off.

### Create and Seize Value During Your Negotiation

Now that you’ve learned to gather information and estimate BATNAs and RVs, let’s dive into the negotiation process itself. When negotiating, your goal should be to**** get the best possible deal for yourself while strengthening your relationship with the other party. Building relationships ensures cooperation and enhances your reputation as a negotiator. **To achieve a good deal and a stronger relationship, you must not only claim but _create_ value.**

(Shortform note: This approach to negotiation is similar to what the authors of _Getting to Yes_ define as _principled negotiation_ , which calls for both parties to work together rather than harbor hidden agendas. They argue that this approach is superior to positional bargaining, which is more adversarial and results in parties defending their positions and focusing on give-and-take. When you focus on cooperation and relationship-building, you can make agreements that satisfy both parties and aren't as time-consuming to reach.)

According to Malhotra and Bazerman, value is anything that people consider desirable or useful. Others may not value the same things that you value. Because value depends on perception, you must find ways to make more value available and apparent during the negotiation. In the following sections, we’ll explore tips for claiming and creating value during your negotiation.

(Shortform note: We not only value different things than other people, but we often have irrational or arbitrary reasons for valuing them. In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli notes several errors in the way we think that affect our perception of value, such as the endowment effect (our tendency to see anything we own as more valuable) and the liking bias (our tendency to value something more if we like the person associated with it). Perhaps, then, you can make value more apparent by giving your counterpart a sense of ownership, such as by having them imagine owning your product, or simply focusing on being more likable.)

#### Gather Information About Your Counterpart

At the start of a negotiation, you only have assumptions and estimates to work from. To create value, you must gather information about the other side’s needs and interests, verify or correct your assumptions, and fill gaps in your understanding. Here are some tips on how you can do that:

**Tip #1: Build trust.** Use vocabulary that your counterpart understands and consider spending time with them outside of the negotiation setting. This will make them more cooperative and open to sharing information with you.

**Tip #2: Ask indirect questions.** Most likely, your counterpart will be unwilling to directly share their RV, so you must use indirect questions to tease out information that could help you identify their true RV. For example, if you're negotiating a salary for a job, you might ask questions about the company’s outlook and financial health.

**Tip #3: Share some information.** When you share information, your counterpart will feel inclined to reciprocate. The authors suggest you tell them what your priorities are but don’t give away anything pivotal, like your RV.

> **Use Tactical Empathy to Gather Information**
> 
> In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss argues that the success of a negotiation depends on how well you gather information from your counterpart. To get them to share useful information with you, you must practice tactical empathy—understanding the other side’s feelings to get what you want from them. Let’s look at how you can incorporate tactical empathy into Malhotra and Bazerman’s advice for gathering information.
> 
> According to Voss, people have two basic emotional needs you must meet for them to feel comfortable and share information with you: security and control. Your goal in practicing tactical empathy is to fulfill these two emotional needs during your negotiation.
> 
> Malhotra and Bazerman’s first tip about building trust focuses on the first need. Beyond sharing your counterpart’s vocabulary and spending time with them, you should also practice active listening and adopt a welcoming tone. You can also signal that you’re similar to them by starting your next sentence with the last three words that they say.
> 
> Like Malhotra and Bazerman, Voss recommends you avoid straight requests for information by asking open-ended questions—specifically those that start with “how” or “what”—instead of direct yes-or-no questions. Direct questions lead your counterpart to expect you to give information in return. Open-ended questions, on the other hand, sound more conversational, and may also encourage the other side to more openly share information.

#### Create Value Through Logrolling

After you’ve shared and gathered information, consider what you’ve learned about their needs and interests to **create value through _logrolling_ —trading negotiation items that your counterpart cares about more for things that you care about more.** Recognize how your priorities differ and use those differences to make deals that are agreeable for both sides. For example, if you hate driving in traffic, and your partner dislikes cooking, you might agree to cook dinner while your partner agrees to pick up the kids from school.

(Shortform note: The term “logrolling” is also commonly used in a political sense and describes the practice of legislators exchanging votes to ensure the passage of one another’s bills. Like in negotiations, this requires knowing differences in priorities so that legislators can help one another without sacrificing what they personally deem more important. Unlike in negotiations, however, political logrolling is prohibited in many states in the US.)

Malhotra and Bazerman give tips for creating value through logrolling:

**Step #1: Identify your interests.** Since logrolling requires trading between multiple items, you should first make a list of everything you value that the other side may be able to provide (when negotiating the purchase of a home, this could be price, move-in date, inclusion of furniture, and so on). Then, create a scoring system using a common metric, like a number of points out of 100 or a dollar value based on how important each item is to you. This method allows you to compare items more easily and decide whether to accept or reject their offer.

For example, if the person you’re trying to buy a home from offers to include some furniture in the price of the house (30 points) and lets you move in early (10 points), you might be OK if they don’t renovate their basement ahead of the purchase because you only value that renovation at 20 points.

**Step #2: Identify your counterpart’s underlying interests.** Discover their underlying interests by asking yourself _why_ your counterpart is making their demands. This can clue you in to what they really want and help you find other ways to satisfy their needs, especially if you find their demands hard to meet. For example, if your counterpart demands a lower price, you might discover that they’re mostly concerned with wasting money on a faulty product. Instead of lowering your price, you might then offer a warranty.

**Step #3: Discuss multiple issues at a time.** To create more opportunities for logrolling, the authors suggest you introduce as many issues as you can into the negotiation. These might include timing, quality, price, contract length, warranties, and so on. Discussing multiple issues at a time helps you identify different priorities you and your counterpart have and allows you to make package offers. For example, if you care more about price and your counterpart cares more about timing, you could ask for a higher price for your product but offer to deliver it sooner.

> **How to Identify and Discuss Interests During a Negotiation**
> 
> According to Malhotra and Bazerman, logrolling requires identifying both your interests and the other side’s interests to find ways for both sides to win. In _Getting to Yes_ , Roger Fisher and William Ury also advise a flexible and open-minded approach when figuring out how to reconcile differing interests. They offer additional tips for negotiating with multiple interests and brainstorming creative ways to create value. Let’s compare their advice.
> 
> Like Malhotra and Bazerman, the authors of _Getting to Yes_ suggest you look for underlying interests rather than focus on specific demands. When identifying your interests, they suggest you consider what basic human needs you want to meet, such as the desire for security, control, or recognition. Communicate those needs in detail to explain each offer you make. This allows the other side to understand your interests and contribute to brainstorming ways for mutual gain.
> 
> To figure out _their_ interests, Fisher and Ury suggest you brainstorm with them. Consider setting up a brainstorming session separate from the negotiation as a time for you and your counterpart to share interests and generate creative options that can meet both of your needs. Try to create many options rather than figure out a single “best” solution.
> 
> While Malhotra and Bazerman recommend you consider multiple issues _during_ the negotiation, Fisher and Ury suggest you generate more options before the negotiation. They give four steps to do so: Describe the problem, analyze the problem for potential causes and obstacles to solving it, list various possible strategies, and write down specific actionable steps to solve the problem. This method of thinking allows you to generate many options you can discuss during your negotiation.

#### Decide Whether to Make the First Offer

At some point during your negotiation, you must decide whether to make the first offer or allow the other party to make it. According to Malhotra and Bazerman, **if you’re confident you know what your counterpart’s RV is, you should make the first offer.** Having an accurate estimate of their RV allows you to make a good first offer that's sufficiently aggressive and allows you to capture the most value (as opposed to making an offer that's too weak or _too_ aggressive).

The authors argue that the first offer largely impacts the outcome of a negotiation because of the anchoring effect. The anchoring effect is the tendency for people to be swayed by the first piece of information presented. By making the first offer, you set a reference point that the other side must adapt to. For example, if you ask for a high salary in a job negotiation, you signal to the recruiter that you have a lot of value. This makes it challenging for the recruiter to justify a much lower offer.

(Shortform note: In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , Peter D. Andrei explains why we’re susceptible to the anchoring effect: Our perception of the world is relative and we need reference points to make sense of things. For example, a student might feel happy about their score on an exam only to be disappointed when they learn that the majority of the class scored higher. Andrei argues that you can even use irrelevant anchors to alter people’s expectations. If you’re trying to sell a boat, for instance, you might talk about the prices of luxury cars with the other party beforehand. After discussing expensive cars, they may perceive your asking price for your boat to be much more reasonable, even though it’s a different vehicle.)

Conversely, if you’re uncertain about your counterpart’s RV, you should let the other side make the first offer. This way, you avoid making an offer that’s too soft or too aggressive.

However, if you let your counterpart make the first offer, you must resist being influenced by the anchor by shifting the focus of the conversation away from it. The more you talk about the anchor, the more it affects the negotiation. To pivot the conversation, you can reply that you view things differently than they do and shift the conversation to a different topic as a way to find common ground. Another way you can respond is by making an aggressive counteroffer and then suggesting both sides moderate their offers. You can then take control of the conversation by explaining why you made your counteroffer.

(Shortform note: You can better resist an anchor established by the other party’s first offer by creating an anchor for yourself _before_ your negotiation. To do this, research relevant numbers and data before your negotiation—for example, the listing prices of other homes in the neighborhood in which you’re selling a house. This allows you to go into the negotiation with a preexisting frame of reference, making you less likely to be influenced by offers made by the other party.)

> **Who Should Make the First Offer?**
> 
> The question of whether you should make the first offer in a negotiation or wait has been widely debated by negotiation experts. While Malhotra and Bazerman suggest you base your decision on how well you think you know your counterpart’s RV, other experts argue that there are other factors at play. Let’s examine different expert stances on who should make the first offer.
> 
> **You:** Like Malhotra and Bazerman, many expert negotiators encourage you to make the first offer if you feel confident in doing so. Some research has shown that the anchoring effect of first offers affects nearly all negotiation situations, regardless of culture, power levels, and the number of issues being negotiated. However, you might want to time your first offer differently depending on the culture. In certain countries (such as Japan), offers serve as information sharing and are offered at the start. However, in Western cultures, you should wait a little before making your first offer as this promotes more valuable and creative agreements.
> 
> **The other side:** Other experts argue that there are psychological reasons for letting your counterpart make the first offer: Negotiators who make the first offer tend to feel more anxiety and less satisfaction about the negotiation, even if they receive a better deal than they would have had they let the other side make the first offer.

##### What Should Your First Offer Be?

If you decide to make the first offer, the authors suggest you **make a bold offer that you know your counterpart will reject.** If you're buying, make an offer lower than their RV. If you're selling, make an offer higher than their RV. This way, you can keep the whole ZOPA open for negotiation. If you ask for an amount that’s lower than their RV (when selling) or make an offer higher than their RV (when buying), you give up some value right away. For example, if you think they’ll pay $15,000 at most for something you’re selling and you ask for $14,000, you lose $1,000 of potential value. Instead, you should ask for something higher than $15,000, like $16,000. Conversely, if you’re buying, and you think they won’t sell for under $15,000, you might offer $10,000.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that a first offer must be both ambitious and precise to get the best results during a negotiation. For example, instead of a price of $15,000, you might ask for $15,599. Experts argue that asking for a precise number gives people the impression that you’re knowledgeable about the true value of what you’re offering.)

To avoid making an extreme offer that upsets your counterpart, you must have a way to justify it. Find a good reason and offer relevant information to your counterpart. You should also consider the context of the negotiation. Depending on the purpose of the negotiation and your relationship with the other side, you might want to adjust how aggressive your first offer is, especially since your goal is to also strengthen your relationship in the process.

(Shortform note: Making an extreme offer can also damage your credibility. If you're unsure about whether your offer is realistically ambitious or too extreme, consider giving a range of numbers but attaching different terms to different price points. For example, you might offer to pay more for a product that has an extended warranty.)

#### Make and Invite Fair Concessions

After voicing your initial offers, you and your counterpart will begin _haggling—_ taking turns making concessions until you reach an agreement.

To ensure both parties take turns making concessions, you must invite _reciprocation_ : Clearly communicate when you’re making a concession and state that you expect reciprocation. Practice being comfortable with silence and resist making further concessions if your counterpart doesn’t reciprocate.

When concessions progressively get smaller, it may mean that you’re approaching your counterpart’s RV and they’re less flexible about how much they can concede. However, be wary of the other side using this as a tactic to confuse you about their real limits.

(Shortform note: In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss points out another technique negotiators use to signal that they’re at their limit: throwing in a non-monetary item. This method seems to primarily work when you’re haggling over price.)

> **What Concessions Should You Make?**
> 
> Malhotra and Bazerman provide a broad framework for how you should approach concessions, but how do you start making concessions and what kind of concessions should you make?
> 
> Ideally, you should make a list of concessions before your negotiation, sorting them according to what’s important to you and recording your estimate of how valuable each might be to your counterpart. However, avoid making it obvious that you prepared your concessions ahead of time or else your counterpart will feel like they’re not genuine sacrifices and therefore less valuable to them.
> 
> Like Malhotra and Bazerman, other negotiation experts write that it’s crucial to make it clear that your counterpart must concede something in return. If, early in the negotiation, you concede without communicating that you expect something in return, you signal to your counterpart that they can get free value from you.

### Use Influence Tactics to Make Your Offer More Attractive

Now that you’ve learned to gather information, create value, and overcome obstacles, let’s look at how you can make your offer seem more attractive by using psychology-based techniques and taking advantage of cognitive biases.

**1\. Highlight potential losses.** People tend to fear losing things more than they care to gain things. To make your offer sound more attractive, focus on what your counterpart stands to lose rather than gain.

(Shortform note: You can further highlight potential losses by making what you’re offering seem rare and scarce. According to Robert Cialdini in _Influence_ , how scarce an item is usually reflects how valuable it is, so people will be more strongly motivated to jump on an opportunity that seems scarce.)

**2\. Bundle negatives and split up positives.** People prefer to face one big loss rather than many small ones and receive many small gains over one big one. For example, when asking for concessions, you might ask for them all at once. When giving concessions, split them up and offer them separately throughout your negotiation. This minimizes the pain of losses and maximizes the joy of gains.

> **Hedonic Adaptation and Loss Aversion Affect Our Perception of Losses and Gains**
> 
> Hedonic adaptation might explain why we get more pleasure from many small gains over fewer large gains. Hedonic adaptation describes our tendency to grow accustomed to positive changes and return to a baseline level of happiness. It takes us more time to get used to numerous small gains than a single large one, which is why separating positives into smaller portions increases pleasure.
> 
> When it comes to losses, however, some studies show that people don’t experience loss aversion (or the heightened sensitivity to losses versus gains) for small losses, which runs counter to Malhotra and Bazerman’s belief. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to consider discussing losses separately if they’re small as this may make people less averse to them.

**3\. Use the “door-in-the-face” technique.** Make an initial extreme demand that your counterpart will likely refuse. Then, ask for something less extreme—what you really want. Your second demand will seem like a concession and sound much more reasonable in comparison, which makes your counterpart more willing to comply.

(Shortform note: Getting your counterpart to say “no” to your initial extreme demand also gives them a sense of control, which Chris Voss writes is one of two basic emotional needs people have that affect how comfortable and cooperative they are during negotiations. After they say “no” to your extreme demand, they may be more willing to agree to your real demand simply because they feel more in control and believe they’re freely choosing to comply rather than being pressured into it.)

**4\. Use the “foot-in-the-door” technique.** Conversely, you can make a small, easy demand your counterpart will likely agree to. Then, ask for what you really want from them. Because they already complied with your previous demand, they’ll feel committed to continue helping you.

(Shortform note: This technique is effective because people naturally want to behave in consistent ways. After agreeing to the first response, people may feel inclined to agree to the second simply to be consistent with their self-perception.)

**5\. Justify your demands.** The authors cite studies showing that people are more likely to agree with a demand if you provide a reason for it—even if the reason itself isn’t very convincing. This is because our brains are hardwired to help others with legitimate needs to form mutually beneficial relationships.

(Shortform note: In _Poor Charlie’s Almanack_ , Charlie Munger refers to this phenomenon as the reason-respecting tendency, which says that people tend to work and learn better when given reasons why they should do something. However, this tendency works even with illogical reasons because we naturally dislike doubt, so even bad reasons are better than none at all.)

**6\. Use social proof.** People tend to base their decisions on other people’s actions and opinions. To make your offer sound more appealing, show your counterpart how other people are interested in what you have to offer. For example, if you’re negotiating a salary at a job interview, you might discuss offers you’ve received from other companies.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, showing that there’s high demand for what you have to offer can have the opposite effect: The reverse bandwagon effect, or the _snob effect_ , causes people to avoid things _because_ other people are interested in it.)

**7\. Give gifts to encourage reciprocation.** The authors add that the size of the gift doesn’t matter. Any concession tends to make your counterpart feel more inclined to return something of value to you.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , Jonathan Haidt writes that we have a strong obligation to repay others for evolutionary purposes: It encourages cooperation and increases our collective chance of survival. However, many people feel uncomfortable receiving gifts, precisely because of this strong compulsion to reciprocate. They may even feel like your gift is an attempt to control or manipulate them. Therefore, if you are offering a gift, it may help to do so more subtly or genuinely to ensure that your counterpart feels comfortable rather than suspicious of you.)

### Overcome Obstacles That Affect Negotiations

Now that we’ve discussed the negotiation process, let’s look into some common obstacles during negotiations that can impede your ability to understand and communicate with your counterpart.

#### Cognitive Biases

According to the authors, cognitive biases are common errors in how we think, interpret information, and make decisions that can prevent us from negotiating effectively and recognizing ways to maximize value creation. To be an effective negotiator, you must **learn to recognize and confront your biases, as well as those of your negotiation counterpart.** The authors argue that it’s much easier to achieve a good outcome with a good negotiator than one who’s thinking irrationally.

(Shortform note: Malhotra and Bazerman focus on the ways cognitive biases can harm our negotiations, but other experts point out that these biases are, on the whole, necessary and even helpful in our daily lives. In _Influence_ , Robert Cialdini explains that these biases are mental shortcuts that allow us to make quick decisions and thereby navigate the world effectively. Without them, we’d simply get overwhelmed trying to process every situation we find ourselves in. For the most part, these shortcuts lead us to accurate conclusions—that a crowded restaurant has good food, for instance.)

First, to recognize and overcome your biases, the authors suggest you try to adopt an outside perspective. You can do this by discussing your negotiation with an impartial expert or friend. You could also ask yourself how you’d view the situation if you weren’t involved. Also, the authors recommend you avoid negotiating under time pressure, which prevents you from thinking clearly. Consider separating the negotiation into multiple sessions to give yourself a better chance of catching potential oversights or flaws in your reasoning.

(Shortform note: Malhotra and Bazerman provide tips for getting different perspectives so you can make better decisions during your negotiation, but Ray Dalio writes in _Principles: Life and Work_ that you must first adopt a truth-seeking mindset. He writes that your ego can discourage you from getting other people’s opinions, which is why you must commit to finding the truth even when you _think_ you’re right. Because you won’t know what’s in your blind spot, you must practice humility and be fully receptive to other people’s viewpoints.)

Next, you should also help your counterpart deal with their biases so you can cooperate and agree on a mutually beneficial deal. Sometimes, the other person may act in a way that seems irrational to you—they may reject an attractive offer or get angry during the negotiation. In that case, you should try to give them more facts that they don’t know and try to understand why they feel or act that way. Likely, they simply don’t have enough information, are overwhelmed with emotions, or are influenced by factors you’re unaware of. Try to address the source of the problem and talk about how you can work together to meet their needs and interests.

(Shortform note: While Malhotra and Bazerman suggest you share information to resolve conflicts, others suggest you be more proactive and regularly seek feedback from your counterpart to make sure they understand what you’re trying to say. You can seek feedback and prevent misunderstandings in several ways: by asking questions, clarifying and reflecting back what they’re saying, and practicing active listening.)

#### Deception

Apart from recognizing cognitive biases, you must also learn how to handle deception during a negotiation. First, discourage lying by **signaling to your counterpart that you’re well-prepared and have the ability to obtain and verify information.** If you suspect that the other side’s lying, ask questions that you already know the answer to or ask multiple related questions that make it difficult for someone to keep their lies consistent. Depending on the situation, you should then decide whether you want to continue the negotiation or not.

(Shortform note: Some studies reveal that deception is shockingly common during negotiations, occurring, depending on what is considered deceptive behavior, between 30% to 100% of the time. Beyond signaling that you're well-prepared, you can also discourage deception by reminding your counterpart of their reputation. Other experts note that many negotiators resort to using underhanded tactics because they’re too focused on getting advantageous results in the short term. Perhaps, then, simply reminding them of the long-term implications of unfair tactics can discourage them from using them.)

If you distrust your counterpart but want to continue negotiating, consider proposing a contingency contract. A contingency contract is an agreement that leaves parts of your deal dependent on what happens in the future. For example, you may agree to buy your child a new gaming console but only allow them to play on school nights if they maintain an A in all of their classes.

(Shortform note: To make a contingency contract, each party must describe the event they expect will occur in the future and define the actions they will take in response. For example, you and your child may outline two scenarios: They will either maintain all As or get a lower grade. If the first scenario is true, they can play on school nights. If the second is true, your child will study an extra hour instead of gaming. Ultimately, while contingency contracts can help you thwart deception and mitigate risks if you’re uncertain about your counterpart’s promise, experts suggest you always consider whether the other party has information you lack. If your prediction of future events is inaccurate due to a lack of information, you might end up paying the penalty for the contract.)

#### A Weak Position

Sometimes you may find yourself negotiating with an extremely weak position with little to no bargaining power. In these situations, you might have a weak BATNA (few or no good alternatives) while your counterpart has a strong BATNA. The authors describe ways you can negotiate from a position of weakness:

**Method #1: Focus on their weaknesses.** Don’t reveal how weak you are to your counterpart but, instead, make _their_ weaknesses apparent during the negotiation. The other side might also have a weak alternative, and they may need you as much (if not more) than you need them.

**Method #2: Identify what differentiates you from your competitors** that your counterpart also finds important. In doing so, you may overcome your weak position simply by highlighting your unique value.

**Method #3: Leverage your weakness.** If your position is extremely weak, the authors recommend you simply ask the other side to help you out of generosity and grant you some of your requests. By acknowledging your lack of power instead of negotiating aggressively, you might convince the other party to give more to you.

**Method #4: Reduce the other side’s power.** If possible, form alliances with other weak parties and negotiate collectively so that you can’t be pitted against one another. You can also directly combat the source of the other side’s power. For example, if you struggle to negotiate house rules with your roommate because they pay the larger portion of the rent and feel entitled to make more decisions, you could take on a side job to increase your income and contribute more to the rent. This way, you can reduce their power advantage.

> **Ask for Advice When Negotiating Without Power**
> 
> Malhotra and Bazerman recommend several ways to increase your power during a negotiation, suggesting you only acknowledge your lack of power if you're in an extremely weak position. In _Give and Take_ , however, Adam Grant writes that there’s no need to try to reduce the other side’s power or to increase yours. Instead, he suggests you lean into your powerlessness when communicating with all kinds of negotiators. He argues that you can better negotiate without power by asking for advice from the other party.
> 
> According to Grant, this form of powerless communication has several advantages: First, it encourages the other party to think more deeply about the negotiation so they can give quality advice (which might be a way to get them to reflect on their _own_ weaknesses and the unique value you bring to the table, as Malhotra and Bazerman recommend). Second, it makes them more willing to help you. Advice-giving requires the other party to view the negotiation from your perspective, which establishes empathy rather than opposition and makes them more committed to helping you.
