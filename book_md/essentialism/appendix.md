## Appendix: Being an Essentialist Leader

If you lead people in an organization or business, you can apply essentialist skills and thinking to your leadership. Here’s a review of how traditional and essentialist leaders perform:

**Characteristics of the nonessentialist leader** :

  * Mindset: Tries to do it all; be all things to all people
  * Hiring: Hires quickly; creates a “bozo explosion,” when a formerly great team or company is dragged into mediocrity by lackluster new team members.
  * Strategy: Has multiple priorities. People are spread thin and make little progress.
  * Management style: Disempowers by making arbitrary decisions. People’s roles are unclear.
  * Communication: Too sudden or too general to be actionable.
  * Accountability: Micromanages or ignores people, sometimes both.
  * Outcome: Chaotic team makes incremental progress in many directions or none at all.



**Characteristics of the essentialist leader:**

  * Mindset: Do less but better.
  * Hiring: Extremely selective about hiring; waits for the best candidate.
  * Strategy: Eliminates distractions. Focuses on excelling at doing the most essential thing.
  * Management style: Determines each team member’s best role and contribution.
  * Communication: Communicates the right things to the right people at the right time. Listens to what is essential.
  * Accountability: Checks in regularly to see how she can remove obstacles and facilitate small wins.
  * Outcome: Unified team makes a significant breakthrough to its highest level of contribution.



**Summary of the steps to being an essentialist leader:**

  * Be extremely selective in hiring people.
  * Establish a radically clear essential intent, not a fairly clear one.
  * Practice extreme empowerment by having clear roles and goals.
  * Communicate clearly, succinctly, and consistently (the right things to the right people at the right time).
  * Check in often to ensure meaningful progress. Remove obstacles and encourage small wins. 



Leading by applying the principle of less but better will allow your team or organization to make their highest collective contribution and achieve phenomenal results.
