## Introduction

We feel constantly pressed for time. We’re trying to do too much, yet when someone makes a request we say yes without thinking, in order to please them or avoid resentment. We feel that we must do it all.

As a result, we’re stretched too thin, we’re going in too many directions, and we’re making only minuscule forward progress on our many tasks and projects. We’re busy but not necessarily productive. We feel overworked but underutilized, because we’re spending much of our time on things that matter little.

As Greg McKeown, author of _Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less,_ puts it, many of us are **majoring in minor activities**. The way out of this trap is to practice “the way of the essentialist”: do less but better. Dieter Rams, a retired academic and industrial designer, coined the phrase and wrote a book in 1994 with that title. McKeown focuses his book on how to put it into practice, changing your thinking and your life.

### Essentialism Defined

**Essentialism is the consistent and focused pursuit of less but better, in all aspects of your life**. It’s not about being more efficient or doing more with less (or less with less), as many companies demand of employees. It requires stopping regularly to ask yourself, “Am I spending my time and resources on the right things?”

We have numerous activities and opportunities to choose from, and obviously we can’t invest our time and energy in all of them. Some may be good or excellent opportunities, but most are inconsequential; few are crucial or essential. Essentialism is differentiating among the options and selecting and acting on just a few essential ones while eliminating the rest. It’s doing the right things as opposed to doing more things.

**Essentialism is investing your time and energy only in what’s essential in order to make your optimum contribution to activities and projects that really matter.** Here’s how essentialism compares to the way most people function (nonessentialism):

#### Essentialism: Less but Better

  * You focus on just a few important things, so you’re headed in one clear direction.
  * You make significant progress on those things. 
  * You function by design rather than by default.
  * You make tough trade-offs between what you do and don’t do, but these one-time decisions set you on a path that keeps you from having to make the same types of decisions repeatedly.
  * Once you determine what’s essential, you remove obstacles so that achieving the essentials becomes routine.
  * You say things like: “I choose to. Is it essential? What are the trade-offs?”
  * You stop and ask yourself what matters most.
  * You say no to everything nonessential.
  * You remove hurdles so projects develop their own momentum.



Results: You do outstanding work, get the right things done, and feel in control and energized.

**Nonessentialism: All Things to All People**

  * You try to do many things at the same time, so you’re going in multiple directions. Because you’re not making choices, others make choices for you and you function by default.
  * You flail and make only minuscule progress in multiple activities.
  * You say things like: “I have to do it. I can do both. I can do it all.”
  * You react to the immediate and most urgent.
  * You say yes to virtually everything.
  * You “muscle” or force projects through to completion.



Results: You do too many things, none of them well; you feel out of control, overwhelmed, and exhausted.

Circumstances and people around us conspire against any efforts to choose and do the few most important things well. This book explains how to push back and put the “way of the essentialist” into practice in the workplace and in life.

Two examples illustrate the divergent paths of the essentialist and nonessentialist.

> **Example One: Opting Out of the Insanity**
> 
> Sam Elliot (a fictional name) is a busy Silicon Valley executive who said yes to everything his bosses and colleagues asked of him and soon found himself being run ragged. Not only that, he became increasingly dissatisfied with his work, feeling that he spent most of his time on things that didn’t move the needle. His performance slipped and he seriously considered quitting and becoming a consultant until a mentor advised him to just do the things he would do as a consultant and nothing else.
> 
> He began gauging requests by whether he had the time and resources to fulfill them, and he started to say no. When people seemed to respect that, he tightened his criteria even more by considering **whether the request was the most important thing he could do with his time at that moment**. He stopped attending many meetings and got involved in fewer email debates. He concentrated instead on a few high-value projects. His momentum and quality of work grew, along with his satisfaction. His performance ratings went up and he received a large bonus.

> **Example Two: Choosing the Trivial Over the Important**
> 
> By contrast, author McKeown said yes to business demands when he should have said no.

While at the hospital with his wife, who had given birth to their daughter the day before, he found himself answering emails and calls from work. A colleague requested that he come to a client meeting, and he left his wife and newborn to attend, thinking the client would respect him for his sacrifice. But he felt terrible about it and the client seemed to think less of him for leaving his family. The meeting turned out to be unimportant. The key lesson he learned: if you don’t set priorities for your life, others will inject their own.

### How Did We Go Wrong?

Why are so many smart people consumed by the pressures around them? What keeps people grinding their wheels instead of doing the most important thing they can do to the absolute best of their ability?

To start with, **we’re rewarded for saying yes to everything (nonproductive behavior) and punished for saying no (productive behavior).** Successful people are caught in a conundrum. It develops like this:

  1. Successful people have a clear purpose — they know what they’re trying to accomplish — and therefore they succeed at the tasks and projects they take on.
  2. Because of their success, they end up taking on more and more. They become the go-to person who can always be counted on to help and their bosses and others present them with increased options and opportunities.
  3. Increased options and opportunities, which demand more time and energy, lead to scattershot efforts — these successful people get spread too thin.
  4. They’re distracted from doing their most important work at an optimum level. In effect, their success has undermined the clarity of purpose that led to their success in the first place.



Thus, **pursuing success, if done in an indiscriminate way, can end in failure**. Pursuing too many goals can distract us from focusing on the important things.

In his 2009 book _How the Mighty Fall_ , Jim Collins examined why celebrated companies collapsed. He found that succumbing to “the undisciplined pursuit of more” was a key factor for many failures. Nonessentialism burns out both companies and people.

There are several reasons we’re prone to failing this way.

**There are too many options.** Because of our ever-expanding choices, we can’t distinguish the most important ones. More people having more choices represents a major change in the human condition — one for which our society isn’t prepared. We’re unable to manage the overwhelming number of choices by sorting the important from the trivial. We suffer “decision fatigue,” which results in poor choices.

**Social pressure keeps increasing.** In addition to having a plethora of choices, we’re also under increasing pressure to make certain choices. Social media enable others to constantly weigh in on what we’re doing. We have both information and opinion overload.

**We believe we can have and do everything.** The idea of “having it all” has been around for a while and is pervasive in advertising, job descriptions with huge lists of required skills and experience, and university applications requiring myriad extracurricular activities. The idea that we can and should have it all is creating more stress as our options have multiplied and we keep stuffing more into our schedules.Companies contribute to the problem, espousing a work/life balance while expecting their employees to be available by phone and email 24/7.

In staff meetings, managers list a dozen “top priorities,” setting employees up for frustration and failure. Originally, in the 1400s, there was no plural form of the word “priority.” “Priority” meant the first or prior thing. We pluralized the word in the 1900s, insisting we could have many “first” things. Businesses and individuals regularly try to operate on this belief, but **when many things are priorities, nothing is**.

**When we try to do everything, we make tradeoffs we’d never make as an intentional strategy.** When we don’t actively choose what to focus on, bosses, colleagues, friends, and others choose for us — and their agendas end up controlling our lives. Soon, what’s meaningful and important to us falls by the wayside.

### A Way Forward

At the end of life, many people express the wish that they’d had the courage to live on their own terms rather than trying so hard to meet the expectations of others.

You don’t need to suffer this fate yourself. **You can be true to yourself, focusing on the things important to you, by saying no to nonessentials**. You say no not randomly but intentionally, as part of an overall strategy.

Nonessentials include not only typical time wasters, such as spending time on social media, but also positive and appealing things. It takes determination and practice, but you can resist business and social pressures to be all things to all people by learning to focus on what’s essential and eliminating everything else.

#### The Closet Analogy

Taking an essentialist approach to your work and life is similar to how you or a professional organizer would streamline your closet. If you neglect your closet, it gets disorganized and crammed with clothes you don’t wear. You purge it periodically when it gets totally out of control. But if you don’t have an ongoing system that you stick to, you’ll keep ending up back at square one, with a disorganized closet, or you’ll discard something and regret it later.

The same thing happens to your life. With good intentions, you say yes to too many things without a sense of overall purpose and your schedule is soon cluttered and overflowing. Many activities are ongoing, and unless you have a system for purging them, they expand to fill your time automatically.

An essentialist approach to your closet — and your life — consists of three phases, in which you consider tough questions:

**1) Explore options** : While sorting items in a closet, you’d typically ask yourself whether you might wear an item someday. But an essentialist asks a tougher question: Is this a favorite item that I wear often? If the answer’s no, toss it.

In your life, the key question is, **is this activity essential to making my** highest contribution**?** Part one of the book helps you determine what activities are essential for you to contribute at the highest level to your goal.

**2) Eliminate the nonessentials** : You have trouble getting rid of things because of sunk-cost bias. This means you place a greater value than they’re worth on things you own because you’ve invested in them, so you’re reluctant to get rid of them. To circumvent this bias, ask yourself what you’d be willing to pay for the item if you didn’t already own it. This may be the reality check you need to realize the item’s true worth.

Regarding an activity, the question could be, “if it hadn’t just popped up, would I go out of my way to seek out this activity?” If the answer is no, it’s probably not an “essential” activity. Not only must you sort out the nonessentials, whether possessions or activities, but you must also actively eliminate them. Part 2 explains how to eliminate nonessentials from your work and life in a way that garners respect from bosses and colleagues.

**3) Execute routinely** : For your closet to stay organized, you need a maintenance system that’s automatic, so it stays consistently organized without requiring a Herculean effort every so often. In your life, once you’ve decided what things to pursue (your highest level contribution), you need a system to make doing the important things simple. Part 4 lays out a process for doing that.

While you control what goes into your closet, in life new demands bombard you all the time.

What if every time you opened your closet, you found that people had been adding their own items? That’s what happens at work — you start your day with a plan, and by 10 a.m. you’re already off track. Or, you start the day with a to-do list, and by the end of the day, it’s longer than when you started. Or your quiet weekend gets packed with others’ errands and activities.

#### Essentialism Reorders Your Life

Essentialism helps you create a system for keeping your life clutter-free and focused on what’s most important.

  * **It’s a discipline** you apply to determine whether requests and options get a yes or no.
  * **It’s a method** for making difficult trade-offs between the many appealing options versus the few outstanding options.
  * **It’s about learning** to do less but better so you can live a life true to yourself.



There are four parts to the book. The first explains the essentialist mindset, while the next three apply it.
