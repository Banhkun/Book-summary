## Part 4: Execute Effortlessly

There are two ways to execute or implement something. You can get it done by force of effort, or you can accomplish your purpose almost effortlessly because you’ve created a system. Essentialists create a system.

Returning to the closet example, after you cleared and organized your closet, you need a system so that keeping it clutter-free (your ongoing objective) is simple and routine. Similarly, once you’ve determined what activities and endeavors are helping you achieve your purpose, you need a system for executing them.

When things are easy to do, they’re more likely to get done. This part of the book explains how to make implementation (getting the right things done) as easy and smooth as possible. Steps include creating buffers, removing obstacles, achieving small wins, creating routines, and focusing.

### Create Buffers

You never know when something unexpected will pop up and threaten to sidetrack your plans. For instance, your flight may be delayed or canceled, or a traffic detour will make you late. At work, a supplier might be late, a colleague might drop the ball, or a client could change his mind at the last minute.

You can wait until something happens and react, or you can prepare by giving yourself a buffer. **Buffers are protective zones that keep things from conflicting.** An environmental buffer keeps threats such as chemical pollution from a sensitive area.

In your work and personal life, buffers make implementation easier. A time buffer keeps travel delays from throwing you off schedule. Making a list and packing for a trip in advance, rather than at the last minute, reduces the risk you’ll forget something important. Building time for questions into a presentation prevents you from running out of time to make the important points. You can create financial buffers by saving money for emergencies or planning for retirement or illness.

Nonessentialists assume a best-case scenario, even though things always take longer or are more complicated than expected. They’re forced to react to changes at the last minute and results suffer — for instance, they cut corners or turn in an incomplete report. Their execution is forced and they end up feeling stressed.

Here are some tips for smoothing implementation by creating buffers:

**Overprepare:** Think about what could go wrong and be ready. During the race to the South Pole in 1911, Roald Amundsen prepared for everything — he brought duplicates of critical items, created extra caches of food and supplies for the return trip, and posted extra flags or markers so they could be found in bad weather or from off course. The other team led by Robert Falcon Scott failed to prepare and ended up not having enough food and supplies, and he and his team didn’t survive.

**Beware of the planning fallacy** : The planning fallacy refers to people’s tendency to underestimate how long a task will take, even when they’ve done it before. To avoid succumbing to the planning fallacy, always add 50% to any time estimate. For instance, if you expect a conference call to take an hour, block off an additional 30 minutes. You’ll feel less stress — sitting in traffic is less stressful when you’ve built in extra time to reach your destination. If you don’t end up needing the extra time, it’s a welcome bonus.

**Do risk-management planning** : Governments and organizations create risk management strategies. They identify risks, determine who will be exposed and how vulnerable they will be, assess financial impact, and plan how to respond. You can apply the concept to building your own buffers. Consider the worst-case scenario, social and financial impacts, and what you can do to lessen risks and respond. These considerations will suggest buffers, like adding to a project’s budget.

### Remove obstacles

In your work and personal life, you face obstacles that keep you from achieving what matters to you or that slow the process. But by systematically identifying and removing these constraints you can make execution smoother and simpler. You do it, not by trying to fix everything at once, but by starting with the most critical obstacle, where improvement will have the biggest impact.

In _The Goal_ , a management-oriented novel by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, a fictional character, Alex Rogo, is tasked with turning around a failing production plant. He succeeds by focusing on improving the slowest aspect of the production process, which has a ripple effect on improving the whole operation. He learned the value of focusing on the weakest point while leading a Boy Scout hiking trip. The group moved inefficiently, starting and stopping when the faster hikers got ahead and had to wait for slower hikers. When Rogo put the slowest hiker at the front of the group and helped him go faster by removing weight from his pack, the group moved more steadily and quickly.

Similarly, essentialists address obstacles strategically, improving the overall functioning of the system by identifying the weakest point or “slowest hiker.” Thus, they reduce their effort and maximize results. In contrast, nonessentialists act haphazardly, addressing the most immediate or obvious obstacles with only marginal impact or making quick fixes in response to crises.

Here are some steps to identifying and removing obstacles, using the example of preparing a 15-page report for a client:

  * **Be clear about your purpose:** You can’t determine what obstacles to remove unless you’re clear on what you’re trying to achieve — in this case, your objective is producing and delivering your report by 2 p.m. Friday. With that level of specificity, it will be easier to identify obstacles.
  * **Identify the weakest point or “slowest hiker”:** Make a list of what obstacles are keeping you, or might keep you, from achieving your purpose. They might include not having all the information you need, your desire for perfection, or your energy level. Determine the obstacle that, if removed, would make the biggest difference or eliminate most of the other obstacles. There may be multiple obstacles, but removing them won’t facilitate the project if the primary obstacle isn’t addressed — so you have to focus on the right one.


  * **Remove the primary obstacle:** Maybe the key obstacle is your desire to make the report perfect and this is slowing things down. To remove the obstacle, make your priority getting the report done on time, rather than being perfect. When you remove the key obstacle, most other aspects of the job become easier. The weak point could be another person — a finance director who won’t approve your budget, for instance. To remove a human obstacle, go and see the person and ask how you can help (remove his obstacles).



### Create Momentum with Small Wins

When you’re trying to achieve something big, it’s tempting to feel you must start big. The nonessentialist approach is to go big on everything, to do it all. The nonessentialist mistakenly believes that the more effort she expends, the more she’ll achieve. But as every employee knows, company initiatives launched with great fanfare don’t always amount to much.

The best way to achieve a big goal is to start chalking up small wins in areas that are essential and celebrate progress. Research shows that the most effective type of motivation is progress.

A small win creates momentum and builds confidence in further success. A popular 1968 Harvard Business Review article reported that people are motivated by achievement and recognition.

As each small win propels you toward the next win, you build momentum until you achieve a significant breakthrough. The progress will seem effortless.

The Richmond Police Department reduced criminal behavior among young people by celebrating small successes. When they “caught” a young person doing something good — wearing a bike helmet, or picking up litter, for instance — police would give them a “ticket” redeemable for a reward, such as a movie pass. The rewards motivated more good behavior.

In your personal life, you can make significant progress toward your goals by building momentum with small wins. For example, the author and his wife wanted to reduce their children’s screen time. Rather than dictating time limits, they gave their children ten tokens each week that could be traded for screen time or money. A child could earn an additional token for spending 30 minutes reading a book, which could also be traded for screen time or money. The children’s screen time dropped 90 percent and reading increased by the same amount. The system of rewarding small changes worked effortlessly, achieved its goals, and the parents saved the time they had spent policing screen time.

Here are some techniques for creating similar effortless systems:

**1) Determine your minimal viable step:** In conceiving new products, entrepreneurs seek the simplest product a customer will find valuable — the minimal viable product. The idea is to avoid wasting resources on nonessential features. You can apply the principle by determining the smallest amount of progress that will be useful in accomplishing your essential task. The author used this method to explore the viability of writing this book. His minimal viable step was to share an idea on Twitter, and if it resonated, he’d write a blog further developing it. From there, he progressed to writing the book.

**2) Apply minimal viable preparation:** To accomplish your essential task, start early and start small. Start as soon as possible with the minimal time investment necessary to make progress.

For example, you could invest a small amount of time in a project two weeks before the deadline and it could help you avoid stress later. Think of a task or deadline and consider the minimum you could do now.

**3) Visually depict progress:** Whether it’s fundraising thermometer charts or star charts for chores at home, kids and adults like to see their progress toward a goal. As a motivator, try keeping visual track of your progress on a project.

When you start small and reward progress, you end up achieving more than when you start big

### Design a Routine

**Establishing a routine is a powerful technique for executing on essential tasks**. With a routine, you can execute automatically without expending energy figuring out what’s next. It also helps you counter the pull of nonessential distractions.

**Routines make challenging things easier** , although the reasons aren’t entirely clear. It may be that as you repeat something, you strengthen neural connections, making it easier for the brain to activate them. For example, it takes several repetitions and applications of a new word before you learn it. Once you’ve activated the same synapses or connections repeatedly you know the word without consciously thinking about it. Similarly, you can eventually make a familiar meal without looking at the recipe or drive the same route routinely without thinking about it.

In the same way, your ability to execute essential tasks gets better with practice, until the tasks become routine. And **when you follow a routine, mental space is freed up**. You can perform one essential task flawlessly while thinking about another. In _The Power of Habit_ , Charles Duhigg notes the brain can almost shut down when performing a routine, allowing you to focus on something else.

**The wrong routines can be boring and stifle creativity. However, the right ones boost creativity by saving mental energy that you can redirect** to another essential activity.

One researcher noted how creative people use routines to free up their minds. They learn their most effective patterns for sleeping, eating, and working and stick to them. They wear comfortable clothes and limit their interactions and activities. Freed from external distractions, they can concentrate on their art.

Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps followed the same routine at every race, arriving two hours early, stretching, warming up, and so on, all in a specific order. He had a string of steps and activities mapped out, all the way up to the point when he finally walked to the starting blocks, dried the blocks, flapped his arms, and got into position. He also had a visualization routine of imagining the perfect race, ending with him winning, which he ran through his mind every morning and evening.

#### Building the Right Routine

According to research, almost 40 percent of our choices are unconscious. The problem is that it’s easy to develop routines that aren’t helpful, like checking email at every traffic light or wasting time on social media. Here are some principles for breaking unproductive patterns and replacing them with routines that make executing the essentials automatic:

**1) Change Your Cues**

The reason it’s difficult to change a bad habit, such as eating junk food, is that the habit is reinforced by a powerful mental loop consisting of a cue, routine, and a reward.

As Duhigg explains in _The Power of Habit_ , the cue sends your brain into automatic mode and launches the routine or behavior. The behavior generates a reward that reinforces the habit for the future. The loop becomes neurologically set. For instance, seeing a particular doughnut shop on your way to work (the routine) is a cue to stop and get a doughnut (thebehavior), and your enjoyment of the doughnut is the reward reinforcing the behavior for next time.

**To change a habit, reassociate the cue that’s triggering the nonessential activity with a different, essential activity.** For instance, when you see the doughnut shop on your way to work, use the cue to remind you to buy something healthier from the deli across the street. If your alarm going off in the morning triggers you to check your email, use it as a cue to do something else, such as stretching exercises.

At first, repurposing a cue is difficult, but each time you repeat the new behavior you strengthen the mental link between cue and behavior. Soon the change will become routine.

**2) Create new triggers**

Besides reassociating old cues with something else, you can create new cues to trigger new routines. For example, the author created a new cue to develop the daily routine of writing in a journal.

For a long time, he’d written only sporadically, and would procrastinate. So he decided to make it less daunting by writing only a few lines at the same time each day. To generate a cue, he started carrying his journal in his bag next to his phone. Whenever he pulls out his phone to charge it each evening (already a habit) he sees the journal, which is his cue to write a few lines. The process has become instinctive and he looks forward to it.

**3) Do the hard thing first**

Develop a routine of doing your most difficult task the first thing in the morning. Find a cue (something you’re already accustomed to, like your first cup of coffee) to trigger you to focus on it.

**4) Have multiple routines**

To avoid getting tired of your routines, try having different ones for different days of the week. Jack Dorsey, cofounder of Twitter, divides his week into themes — for instance, Tuesdays are devoted to product development, Wednesdays to marketing, and Fridays to company and culture. Colleagues organize meetings and requests around these routines.

**5) Change one routine at a time**

Instead of trying to change multiple habits or start several new routines at once, start with one change and build on your progress from there. Starting new routines is challenging but it pays off in energy savings once they become automatic.

### Focus on Now

It’s easy to get stuck going over past mistakes or to spend time worrying about the future. In both instances, you’re thinking about things you can’t control. An essentialist’s time is better spent thinking about areas where your efforts matter.

**Worrying about the past or future distracts you from what’s essential now**. The Greeks viewed time in two ways: chronological (the time we measure) and the opportune or right time (now). We only have now. The essentialist focuses on the present and on the things that are truly important right now. Concerns about the past and future cause you to miss the present moment. However, when you focus on the moment, time seems to move more slowly, you’re more relaxed, and better able to concentrate.

Essentialists live in the moment, allowing them to devote their full energy to the essential task at hand.

Former Utah high school rugby coach Larry Gelwix took an essentialist approach — he kept his team focused on the present with the acronym WIN, which stood for “what’s important now?” The question helped players stay focused on what they needed to be doing in the moment, rather than rehashing a previous play or worrying about losing. Because they focused on their game and nothing else, winning became almost automatic. Over Gelwix’s 36 years as a coach, the team had 418 wins, ten losses, and twenty national championships.

He drew a distinction between losing and being beaten — being beaten meant the other team was better; losing meant you lost focus on what was essential in the moment.

Here are some tips for how to be present:

  * **Decide what’s important now:** When you feel overwhelmed, figure out what’s important right now. Make a list of things competing for your attention and cross off everything that isn’t important right now. 
  * **Ignore the future:** Make a list of things that might be essential, but aren’t essential right now (things you might want to do at some point, but not now). Once you get them on paper, you can set them aside to think about at another time, rather than being distracted or stressed by them.
  * **Prioritize:** Rank the items on your “what’s essential now” list. Cross off each one when it’s complete.
  * **Put your brain on “pause”:** When something is distracting you — when you can’t stop thinking about a work conversation, for instance — stop your thoughts, take a few deep breaths, relax, and let go of the distraction.



Focusing on being in the moment affects the way you do things — the times you can do this bring you contentment and happiness (for instance focusing on enjoying a cup of tea). Pay attention to moments throughout the day when you focus on being present — think about what triggered them and what brought you out of them. Recognizing the triggers, try to recreate them.

Training yourself to be present will make you happier as well as help you achieve your essential purpose.

### Live Essentially

You can think of essentialism as something you do occasionally, or as something you are. It can be something you add to your overcommitted life or it can be a different lifestyle, a simpler way of doing everything.

Essentialism is at the heart of many spiritual traditions. For example, Gandhi eliminated everything in his life to focus on a higher purpose: liberation of the oppressed. Buddha found his mission after leaving a life of wealth and privilege. Quakers also commit to a simple life, focusing on the essential.

More recently, successful people including Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett have lived by an essentialist philosophy of less but better. You must choose whether to commit to making essentialism your lifestyle.

#### What’s at Your Core?

In thinking about essentialism (focusing on your highest contribution) and nonessentialism (doing everything all the time), ask yourself which approach is your major and which is your minor. Most people practice aspects of both. The key question is, which one is your core identity?

People with essentialism at their core get much more from their investment than those who apply essentialism occasionally. The benefits are cumulative — essentialism becomes more routine as you repeatedly make essentialist choices. Ultimately, essentialism isn’t only about success — making your highest-level contribution — but also about living a meaningful life.

You have a simple yardstick for each decision or challenge in your life: Is this essential? If you’ve identified what really matters and focused your time and energy on it, you’re not likely to regret your choices.
