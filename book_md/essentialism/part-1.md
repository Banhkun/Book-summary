## Part 1: The Essentialist Mindset

Three principles underlie the essentialist mindset:

  * You (not your boss, friends, or family) need to choose how to use your time and energy.
  * You need to determine what’s most important. Very few things matter — most things are trivial; only a few are crucial. 
  * You have to make trade-offs — you can’t have or do everything. Instead of asking how you can make it all work, ask which problem you want to solve.



Based on these premises, the essentialist applies a method similar to the closet analogy described above, which eventually becomes instinctive. The book explores each step in depth. The steps are:

**1) Explore options**. The essentialist distinguishes the trivial from the crucial by exploring and assessing a range of options. Essentialists end up exploring more options than nonessentialists, who just commit to everything indiscriminately. The essentialist asks:

  * What inspires me?
  * What am I really good at?
  * What would make the world better?



**2) Eliminate the nonessential**. After determining what’s most important, the essentialist eliminates the rest. That means saying no to most things, although you’re programmed to say yes to everything. Resisting social pressure takes courage and discipline. You need to choose — if you give up the right to choose, you’ll be driven in many directions by others’ agendas.

**3) Execute routinely**. Make the process of executing your plan almost automatic by identifying and removing obstacles. By contrast, most people try to implement plans by force of will.

#### The Potential of Less but Better

Living your life based on the principle of less but better changes everything:

  * When you give yourself permission to choose what you’ll do, you open the door to greater achievement.
  * You discover freedom in eliminating nonessentials and controlling your life rather than being controlled by others.
  * You learn to make your optimum contribution in your life, work, and the world.



Imagine a society where schools replaced busywork with important projects that made a difference to the community or where students thought about their highest contribution. What if companies eliminated pointless meetings and let employees work on their most important projects? What if society stopped telling us to buy more, and stopped celebrating busyness as a sign of importance?

In your own life when you commit yourself to discovering and focusing on the essential, you’re ready to clearly answer the question posed by poet Mary Oliver: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”

### Changing Your Mindset

**Essentialism isn’t a way to do one more thing — it’s a different way to think about and do everything**.

We’re constantly pulled toward the flawed logic of nonessentialism: I have to do it. Everything is important. I can do it all. The essentialist replaces these false assumptions with: I will or I won’t do it (it’s my choice). Few things are important. I can do it if it’s important.

An essentialist does three things when faced with options or decisions: chooses, evaluates, and makes trade-offs.

#### Choose

When asked to do something, we often feel stuck, believing we don’t really have a choice. Sometimes we feel we can’t do something, but at the same time we feel we have to do it. When we acquiesce to the wishes of another, we give up our power to choose bit by bit until we’re following someone else’s path.

We usually think of choice as something we have, but it’s not as much something we have or don’t have as it is something we do. When we make a choice, we _act._ By contrast, options are things, not actions. **We don’t always control our options, but we do control our actions** —**we can choose or reject those options**. When we get overwhelmed by our circumstances, we often forget our ability to choose. Psychologists call this learned helplessness.

##### Learned Helplessness

A study using dogs showed how learned helplessness works. Dogs were divided into three groups — dogs in one group wore harnesses that delivered a shock, but they were given a lever to stop the shocks; dogs in the second group wore the same harness, but were given a lever that didn’t work; the third group wore a harness but didn’t receive shocks.

Later, the dogs were placed in a box with a dividing line, where one side produced a shock and the other didn’t. The dogs that had learned they could stop a shock by pushing a lever quickly learned they could go to the other side of the box and avoid shocks. But the dogs that had been powerless (their levers hadn’t worked) didn’t learn to move to the shock-free side. **They didn’t know they had any other choice — they developed learned helplessness.**

Humans also develop learned helplessness. For example, a child who struggles with math at a young age may give up, believing he can’t get better. In organizations, when people believe their efforts are futile, they stop trying. Or, because they don’t feel they have a choice of what tasks to take on, they try to do it all

Choices are difficult. They involve saying no (if you say yes to everything, you’re not making a choice), and when you say no, you may feel like you’re giving up or losing something.

Our social structures are designed to make it hard for us to say no — for instance, advertising pressures manipulate us to buy (say yes); at restaurants, the server doesn’t just ask whether we want anything else — she brings a dessert tray to our table and describes each option. Political ads try to make it seem disastrous to vote for the other side. Saying no is hardest with the people closest to us. We often feel we have the least choice when a family member wants us to do something.

##### The Way of the Essentialist

While nonessentialists often forget their ability to choose, **essentialists function with a heightened awareness of choice**. In fact, choice is a power you possess, independent of outside forces. The first and most crucial skill of an essentialist is developing your ability to make choices in all areas of your life.

#### Evaluate

Most people exhaust themselves trying to do everything because they believe everything is important. However, the opposite is true — **almost everything is unimportant**. If you don’t sort out which is which and focus on the important, you’re doomed to stress and misery.

Many of us are like Boxer the horse in George Orwell’s book _Animal Farm_. For every setback, Boxer’s answer was, “I will work harder.” He worked harder and harder until he exhausted himself and was sent to slaughter.

Hard work is important, but more effort doesn’t guarantee better results. Nonetheless, we often work longer and harder in our jobs like Boxer the horse, taking on every challenge. We’re taught as children that hard work is key to achievement and we’re rewarded for our efforts. Yet, there’s a point where doing more doesn’t produce more — results plateau or decline. In contrast, **doing less — being smarter and more selective about what we do — can produce better results.**

The author learned as a boy that some types of effort generate greater rewards than others. Compared to what he earned delivering newspapers, he realized he could make more money in less time by washing neighbors’ cars. Later, in a customer service job, he also benefited himself and the company by putting his time spent taking complaints to better use. He determined that the most valuable result he could achieve was winning back customers who wanted to cancel the company’s service. So he focused on that, and was paid more for each client he retained — he earned more and contributed more.

**Doing less but better is more productive than doing more** , although it seems counterintuitive given the way we were raised. Yet the argument for doing less dates back to the 1790s, when the Pareto Principle was introduced. It held that **20 percent of our efforts produce 80 percent of our results** ; therefore, the majority of our efforts are wasted.

In 1951, Joseph Moses Juran, a father of the quality movement, expanded on this idea with his Law of the Vital Few. He argued you could **substantially improve a product’s quality by resolving a small number of crucial production problems**. He applied the idea in Japan, which had a reputation for producing poor-quality goods. Japanese companies began putting their greatest effort into improving a few critical things. The emphasis on quality spread and eventually helped Japan become a global economic power.

You can distinguish the few most important things (the vital few) from the many unimportant things in almost any situation. For instance, Warren Buffett applied the principle to making investments. Instead of trying to make hundreds of good investment decisions, he invested heavily in only a few businesses that he was confident in. He said no to many good investments in order to focus on a few great ones and it paid off — one of his biographers reported that 90% of his wealth came from only 10 investments.

In evaluating options, remember that almost everything is worthless and only a tiny number of things are extremely valuable. As author and leadership consultant John Maxwell put it, “You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.”

##### The Way of the Essentialist

To be an essentialist, you need to start looking aggressively for the vital few and eliminating the many; say no to good opportunities and yes to great ones. Invest time in exploring and evaluating all options; the time invested will more than pay off when you choose the most important things. Evaluate more so you can do less.

Many capable people don’t reach their optimum contribution level because they cling to the belief that everything is important. To practice the skill of identifying the vital few, start by applying it to everyday decisions. When it’s second nature, apply it to bigger things.

#### Make Trade-Offs

Trade-offs are difficult because by definition they involve choosing between two things we want — for instance, more pay or vacation time, getting caught up on the latest email influx or getting to a meeting on time, doing something faster or doing it better. When faced with a choice between two things we want, we often try to answer yes to both, but the reality is that we can’t have it all or do it all. **Saying yes to something precludes doing something else.**

Our workplaces are full of people who ignore the reality of trade-offs. Some people are always trying to squeeze in one more thing. For example, they agree to produce a report by Friday even though they have another big deadline the same day. They end up missing one or both of their deadlines.

Senior executives are among the worst at accepting the reality of trade-offs. Company mission statements are an example. They list too many priorities and fail to zero in on what the company values most, or what choices employees should make when company values conflict.

By contrast, under Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines made a series of trade-offs as part of a strategy to keep costs down. For instance, rather than fly to every destination, they offered only point-to-point flights. They chose not to serve meals and offered only coach seating. In choosing to provide low-cost service, Kelleher said no to anything that didn’t substantially contribute to that objective.

At first, the approach was criticized, but when profits soared, competitors tried to imitate it. However, they didn’t go the whole way — they kept their existing strategies while also trying to apply the new strategy. By refusing to make trade-offs, they ended up losing huge amounts of money and angering customers. For example, Continental Airlines offered a service called Continental Lite, but because Continental executives clung to their traditional business model, which didn’t allow the price of “lite” flights to be competitive, they lost so much money they had to make unplanned cuts that compromised quality.

The lesson is that ignoring the reality of trade-offs is a poor strategy for companies and for individuals. As happened with Continental Airlines, it can force you to do things by default that you didn’t think through as part of a coherent strategy.

##### The Way of the Essentialist

Although painful, trade-offs are an opportunity. **When forced to compare options and choose the one that aligns best with your strategy, you increase your chances of getting the results you want.** Instead of bemoaning trade-offs, essentialists welcome them as an opportunity to ask, like Kelleher of Southwest Airlines, what do I want to excel at?
