## Exercise: Hell Yes or No

Remember that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Learn to focus on what’s essential and what really excites you so you can discard what’s not important.

Make a list of opportunities available to you right now that you need to decide on.

Which of these make you say “hell yes?” Why do they?

What prevents you from saying “no” to the other ones? Write a short explanation for each.
