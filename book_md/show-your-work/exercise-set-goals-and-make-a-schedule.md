## Exercise: Set Goals and Make a Schedule

Sharing your work the way Kleon describes takes dedication and effort. In this exercise, let’s take a look at the creative work you love the most, how often you do that work, and what you hope to achieve with it. Then, we’ll set some goals and schedule sharing into your routine in an effort to achieve those goals.

* * *

Take a moment to precisely describe the creative work you’re most passionate about. For example, if you’re interested in music, describe what kind of music you feel most passionate about creating: playing guitar and writing original songs or perhaps remixing digital samples to make beats, for instance. After you’ve described it, write a few sentences exploring _why_ you feel so passionate about it. This is the work you should focus on sharing.

Now, set some goals for yourself. What do you hope to achieve by doing this creative work? Do you want to get a gallery showing, or record an album, for example? Maybe you hope to find some people to collaborate with. Write down your top three goals in the space below.

Consider how you might use the habit of sharing your work to achieve those goals. For instance, choose some times of day or days during the week when you can set aside 30 minutes to make a post on social media, live stream, or write a blog post, and block out those times in your schedule. Make it a point to follow through on this schedule for at least one month. Plan to re-evaluate the schedule at the end of that month to ensure that it’s fitting into your routine.
