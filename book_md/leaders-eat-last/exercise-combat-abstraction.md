## Exercise: Combat Abstraction

According to Sinek, when you don’t have social contact with other people, they become an abstract idea to you, rather than a person. This means you’ll be more likely to act in your own self-interest instead of considering how your actions may affect other people. Thus, combating abstraction is important for maintaining a supportive environment.

* * *

Describe an area of your job that involves communicating with people remotely, rather than in person. (For example, you might spend time emailing customers or communicating over the phone with coworkers who are based in different states.) How close do you feel to these individuals, as opposed to the people you interact with in person?

Describe a situation where you’ve behaved differently toward these remote contacts compared to your in-person contacts. (For example, you may have treated a supplier you talked to in person more politely than a remote supplier who you talked to over the phone.) How did these differences in behavior cause problems for you or your remote contacts?

Make a plan to combat the abstraction you’re experiencing with your remote contacts. Come up with a plan for each individual or group you described above. (For example, plan to hold meetings in person rather than remotely or communicate through video calls instead of email.)
