## 1-Page Summary

Do you prefer to listen to sad songs? Do you seek out beauty in everyday life? If so, you may have a bittersweet disposition. In _Bittersweet_ , Susan Cain defines the bittersweet disposition as **frequently experiencing intense joy, sadness, and yearning simultaneously.** People with this temperament are deeply conscious that their time in the world is finite, and they accept that pain, beauty, struggle, and hope are always intertwined.

(Shortform note: Cain’s terminology here—bittersweetness—is arguably the most accurate word to describe things that are pleasant but also marked by suffering, and it has been for centuries. The first recorded use of the word bittersweet as a noun was in the 14th century, describing pleasure mixed with suffering or regret. It was first used as an adjective in the 16th century.)

Cain examines the bittersweet aspects of the human experience, including the connections between love and longing, joy and sadness, and life and death. In doing so, she argues that **all of us can glean greater meaning and wisdom from life when we embrace bittersweetness,** even if we don’t naturally have a bittersweet disposition.

(Shortform note: Embracing bittersweetness is powerful because it involves acknowledging that happiness can’t exist without sadness. Happiness is a comparative emotion, so when we don’t allow ourselves to feel sad sometimes, we also limit how happy we can be.)

Cain is an award-winning author and speaker. She’s been recognized by LinkedIn as one of the world’s top 10 influencers and by _Fast Company_ as one of their Most Creative People in Business. Cain is best known for her international bestseller _Quiet_ , which underscores the importance of introverts’ unique skills and qualities in a world built for extroverts.

In this guide, we’ll explore different facets of bittersweetness, beginning with the link between states of bittersweetness and our yearning for love and belonging. We’ll also discuss the hidden power of sadness for fostering empathy and creativity. Finally, we’ll examine how awareness of life’s impermanence can help us find deeper meaning in our relationships and everyday life. In our commentary, we’ll discuss the science behind bittersweet emotions, different perspectives on how to think about impermanence, and further suggestions for coping with grief.

### Longing for Something More

According to Cain, **one major characteristic of people with a bittersweet disposition is a feeling of longing for something**. (Shortform note: Longing is a partly melancholic state because we feel sorrowful about our separation from the thing we yearn for. However, it’s also sweet because there’s at least a small possibility that we’ll achieve our dream. These joyful possibilities live in our memories and imaginations, making the experience of longing inherently bittersweet.)

**What we yearn for __ varies from person to person**—many of us long for a sense of belonging or a feeling that we’re finally home. Others long to visit faraway places. Ultimately, Cain argues that we’re all searching for a glimpse of a better world, one that is idyllic and sublime, and it’s from this longing that bittersweetness arises.

(Shortform note: Many languages from across the world have distinct terms to represent different forms of longing, exemplifying Cain’s assertion that bittersweet yearning of many kinds is a universal part of the human experience. For example, the Welsh word hiraeth conveys a deep longing for home. Hiraeth goes beyond mere homesickness—it’s a yearning for a time, a person, or a place that may no longer exist. Additionally, the German concepts of Fernweh and Sehnsucht describe different kinds of yearning: Fernweh means longing for places you’ve never been, sometimes in the context of searching for home, while Sehnsucht evokes a deeper, more general sense of longing for a beautiful and perfect world.)

#### Longing for the Perfect Love

Cain notes that **for some of us, longing manifests in our romantic lives.** We search for a soulmate—the perfect person who we feel will complete us. According to Cain, some people argue that this longing is natural, beautiful, and even sacred. It’s one of our most important desires because we all want to belong and feel understood.

> **Where the Soulmate Connection Comes From**
> 
> Where does the deep feeling of connection and understanding we have with a “soulmate” come from? Some psychologists argue it derives from communicating nonverbally with our partner. Couples with soulmate-level intimacy respond unconsciously to each other’s body language and facial expressions—for instance, someone may unconsciously pick up on sorrow in their partner’s eyes and send a reassuring glance back.
> 
> Additionally, these couples can understand each other’s voice cues, including subtle changes in the stress or pitch of their partner’s voice. As they pick up on mutual nonverbal cues that signal different moods, they begin to share the same emotions, so their subjective experience of the world becomes intertwined.

##### Is Seeking a Perfect Partner Healthy?

According to Cain, **others suggest that our longing for a _perfect_ partner prevents us from finding someone who’s imperfect but good for us.** Everyone has unique flaws, so we’ll never be entirely compatible with anyone. When dating, if we exclude everyone we’re not perfectly suited to, we’ll end up alone. Additionally, if we hold onto the dream that we’ll someday find our perfect “other half,” we’ll be unable to appreciate the good qualities of our current partner.

(Shortform note: As the research Cain cites suggests, trying to find a perfect partner can be problematic because it leaves you unable to accept that everyone (including you) has flaws. That’s not the only issue with this mindset, however—searching for a perfect partner also becomes unhealthy when you look for someone who brings you perfect happiness. When you place responsibility for your happiness on a romantic partner, you may resent or blame them when you’re _unhappy_. This can create a codependent dynamic. When you instead take ownership of your own happiness, you’ll leave yourself open to real, healthy love.)

These people argue that, to improve our relationships, **we should spend energy improving ourselves rather than trying to change the other person.** No one’s flawless, so we’ll always have room to improve. Additionally, we can’t force other people to become our ideal match, so we can only really change our relationships through our own actions. Finally, we should learn to accept our partner’s flaws, instead of longing for unattainable perfection.

(Shortform note: When deciding whether you can accept a partner’s faults, know the difference between true acceptance and tolerance. Acceptance is acknowledging that a certain characteristic is part of who your partner is, and they don’t need to alter it for you to love them. You let go of all the resentment and frustration you have about the characteristic. In contrast, when you merely tolerate something, you hold onto your resentment, and you’re still uncomfortable with the characteristic or behavior. Tolerance doesn’t work long term, as it leaves you in a state of exhaustion, constantly wishing your partner were different.)

> **When It’s Okay to Change for Someone (and When It’s Not)**
> 
> Altering ourselves to improve our relationships may feel wrong at first. We’re frequently told that we should never have to change for another person and that our partner wouldn’t ask us to change if they really loved us. That’s not always true, though—relationships are based on compromise, and as Cain’s research suggests, there’ll always be flaws that both you and your partner must either learn to accept in each other or work to overcome.
> 
> For most people, acceptable things to change include how you communicate with your partner and how you view the world (to an extent). For example, as your relationship progresses, you may communicate more openly with your partner. Your interests might evolve to include more of what your partner enjoys. Likewise, your social habits, health habits, home habits, argumentation style, and ideas about the future might change with a romantic partner. All of this could be natural and necessary to grow in a relationship.
> 
> That being said, there _are_ certain parts of yourself you shouldn’t have to change for someone else. If you feel like you have to change something about your core self or personality—for example, your kind nature or your love of the outdoors—to be with a person, they’re probably not right for you.

#### Religious Perspectives on Longing

Some religious belief systems agree that our romantic relationships with others will never entirely fulfill our feelings of yearning, but their reasoning differs from that of the above research. According to Cain, these traditions believe that **our feeling of longing comes from our innate desire to return to our proper place with the divine.** Only when we die and return to our creator will we regain our sense of belonging.

(Shortform note: In contrast to this research, other spiritual traditions consider romantic love not separate from but rather an expression of divine love and belonging. They believe that being in love is the closest we can get to the perfect wonder and beauty of heaven on Earth. Falling in love with another person gives us a small glimpse of our oneness with each other and with God.)

For example, Sufism (a type of Islamic mysticism) teaches that we’re separated from God when we come into this world, and we spend our entire lives yearning to get back to him. The feeling of longing itself is proof of God’s existence because it’s the result of that original separation.

(Shortform note: The concept of divine love and Sufi mysticism arose in the 8th century. Its origin is credited to a woman named Rābiʿah al-ʿAdawīyah, who introduced the idea of a pure love for Allah (God) that wasn’t tied to a hope for paradise or fear of hell. Mysticism developed in the Islamic world in the decades after her death, partially influenced by ideas from Christian hermits. Over the centuries, the mystical path came to be about awakening the inherent ability inside of us to love and be loved, since the bond of love with God is at the core of every human.)

Cain argues that no matter what you believe or how your longing manifests—whether it’s for God, nature, music, other people, or something else—it all comes from the same place. **Everyone yearns for perfection, beauty, understanding, and love.**

(Shortform note: Beauty isn’t just an ideal we long for—it can be important for our health, too. Studies show that having aesthetically pleasing surroundings improves our cognitive function, behavior, mood, and general well-being. Similarly, some psychologists state that understanding is important to our well-being—even more important than love. For any kind of love to last, we need to feel like the other person understands who we are. Gaining understanding from others also indicates acceptance and belonging. In contrast, being misunderstood leads to intense feelings of loneliness and a sense of disconnection from other people, which can have seriously negative consequences for our mental state.)

### The Misunderstood Power of Sadness

Now that we’ve touched on the bittersweet nature of longing, let’s take a look at one of the other primary emotions of bittersweet existence: sadness. Cain presents sadness as a powerful emotion capable of inspiring much more than just pain—**sadness can lead to positive experiences, too**.

(Shortform note: Note that there’s a distinction between sadness and depression. Sadness is an inevitable part of life, but it isn’t constant. Due to its temporary nature, it can help us slow down, consider what’s bothering us, and propel us to change our circumstances for the better. Depression involves _severe_ sadness that lasts for more than two weeks and involves the loss of interest or pleasure in activities we normally enjoy. Additionally, it may cause symptoms such as low energy, loss of appetite, and insomnia. Depression may be triggered by a traumatic event or psychological stress, and genetic factors often predispose people to it.)

In this section, we’ll discuss Cain’s assertion that sadness can be a powerful way to inspire compassion for others. We’ll also examine the role of sadness in sparking creativity.

#### The Compassionate Power of Sadness

According to the author, though we often shy away from the pain of sadness, it’s actually one of our most important emotions. This is because **sadness is a prosocial emotion, meaning it engenders compassion and empathy for other people**. When we see someone who’s sad, we feel sad too, and we want to make it better. Since sadness inspires us to care for others and drives us to help others in response, it deepens our bonds.

(Shortform note: Many studies support Cain’s assertion that sadness has numerous prosocial benefits. Since sadness inspires empathy and compassion, it prompts others to respond to our needs. For example, participants in negotiations are more likely to yield to someone who’s sad than someone displaying another emotion like anger, because sadness triggers empathic concern.)

Cain notes that **sadness activates the same parts of our nervous systems regardless of whether we’re hurt or we witness the pain of someone else.** Specifically, it activates the following parts of the brain:

**The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)** , which regulates our ability to complete complex tasks. This region activates when we experience pain and when we see someone else suffering. For example, your ACC would activate in the same way whether you stubbed your toe or you saw someone else stub their toe.

(Shortform note: The ACC plays an important role in a variety of cognitive functions: emotional regulation and awareness, decision-making and choosing what to pay attention to, pain management, anticipation, mistake detection, and autonomic nervous system responses (such as blood pressure regulation). This means it helps us identify emotions in others, affects how we deal with difficult emotions, and regulates how we respond _emotionally_ to pain (not our physical perception of pain). All of these functions prime us to respond to painful emotions in others, like sadness.)

**The periaqueductal gray (PAG)** , which drives mothers to take care of their young. (Shortform note: Studies show that the PAG plays an important role in mediating survival behaviors, caregiving behaviors, and responses to vocalizations in mammals. Some research also suggests that the PAG is part of the auditory pathway in our brains that helps us distinguish between infant vocalizations and other similar sounds. Thus, it helps initiate a rapid care response toward our young.)

**The vagus nerve** , which helps regulate reproduction, breathing, and digestion. Additionally, the vagus nerve fires whenever we see someone in pain, such as children who are being treated for cancer. This suggests that it has a strong role in prompting us to care about the suffering of others.

> **Compassion and the Vagus Nerve**
> 
> Substantial research supports Cain’s assertion that activity in the vagus nerve is deeply tied to our compassionate response. In several studies, researchers found that both our depth of compassion for and motivation to help others directly correlate to the level of activity in our vagus nerve: People with more activity in their vagus nerve tend to show more compassion to others.
> 
> Researchers measure activity in the vagus nerve using vagal tone, which represents the strength of our vagus nerve: Higher levels of activity mean a stronger vagal tone. They calculate vagal tone by analyzing how much our vagus nerve slows our heartbeat, using the difference between our heart rate during inhalation and exhalation: As we inhale, our heart beats faster, and as we exhale, the vagus nerve slows it down again. Without the slowing influence of the vagus nerve, our hearts would beat too fast. The stronger our vagal tone is, the more our vagus nerve slows our heartbeat, and the more compassionate we are toward others.

##### Sadness, Compassion, and the Mother-Child Bond

Cain explains that **the power of sadness as a means of connection goes back to our evolutionary roots** , starting with the compassion required of mothers to care for defenseless infants. Because adult humans have a high level of intelligence and large brains as a result, we have to be born at an early stage of development—when our brains, and thus heads, are smaller—otherwise, we’d get stuck in the birth canal.

(Shortform note: Cain states that we evolved to care deeply for our infants because our level of intelligence and brain size require us to be small and vulnerable when we’re born, but recent studies suggest that the reverse may also be true. One evolutionary model purports that we evolved to be more intelligent _because_ our infants are born underdeveloped and we need to be smart enough to protect them. One model doesn’t preclude the other—rather, they’re self-reinforcing. Our big brains mean we’re born helpless, and our helplessness as infants means that we need big-brained, intelligent parents to keep us safe. Therefore, early birth and large brains were both selected for during our evolution.)

This early birth means that human babies are especially vulnerable, and mothers must be hyper-attuned and empathetic to babies’ needs to take care of them effectively. This empathetic connection drives mothers to instinctively respond to signs of their children’s pain, including displays of sadness like crying.

(Shortform note: Crying—an important indicator of sadness and pain—is one of the primary things that drives mothers to care for their babies. Research shows that hearing a baby cry induces a rapid physiological response _within a second_ that activates the parts of a mother’s brain associated with empathy, compassion, and alarm. Their response time to an infant's cries is almost two times faster than their response to other sounds. Additionally, studies indicate that heightened levels of the hormone oxytocin (associated with love and social bonding) in mothers make them more sensitive to the sound of their children’s cries.)

Cain elaborates that **over time, the instinct to care for others expanded beyond caring for our own children to caring for anyone who needs help.** Because we evolved to respond to the cries of helpless infants, we learned to respond compassionately to anything that reminded us of infants. For example, the same instinct that allows us to empathize with our young compels us to take care of puppies or help someone who’s crying.

> **The Evolutionary Roots of Our Compassionate Responses**
> 
> Evolutionary theory suggests that we evolved to feel compassion toward people beyond our own kin because it strengthened our social ties. Our helpful behavior benefited others in our social group and created opportunities for reciprocity that could later positively serve us. Our compassion extended especially to people we identified strongly with and were likely to engage with frequently. In our modern day, we’re still more likely to feel compassion and empathy for people whom we identify with in some way.
> 
> Evolution has also played a role in which helpless, non-human organisms we extend compassion to: We don’t offer our empathy equally to all creatures. Studies show that the more distantly related we are to an organism on the evolutionary timeline, the less likely we are to experience empathy for it. This explains why we might feel horrible hurting a dog but not think twice about crushing a spider.

##### Why We Listen to Sad Music

The links between sadness, connection, and empathy also help answer the question of why so many people choose to listen to sad music. Cain states that **sad songs make us feel more empathetic toward and connected to other human beings** than songs that evoke other emotions, creating a more profound listening experience. Sad songs enable us to inhabit the stories and emotions of others through music, tapping into the profound sense of connection that sadness creates. No other emotion in music, negative or positive, elicits the same feelings of transcendence and connection as sadness.

> **The Healing Benefits of Sad Music**
> 
> In addition to helping us empathize with the pain of others, sad music can help us work through our own sorrow. When we experience sadness through music, we can move beyond pain into catharsis. In the context of music, the painful emotion isn’t a result of a true threat to our well-being or to the well-being of those we love like it might be in everyday life. We’re therefore able to process it with a layer of separation, and we can express and fully experience sadness while suffering less.
> 
> Listening to sad music also tricks our brains into releasing the hormone prolactin, which helps to soften feelings of grief. When there isn’t a traumatic event to trigger it, the hormone just creates a pleasurable sense of calmness. Further, some psychologists state that listening to this type of music comforts us because it makes us feel less alone. When we’re feeling distressed, lonely, or introspective, the artist behind the sad music becomes an imaginary friend who offers support and understands how we feel because they share our experience.

##### Putting It Into Practice: How to Cultivate Compassion for Others

As noted, listening to sad music can be a great way to access empathy and communion. If you want _more_ ways to deepen your connection with others and develop your sense of compassion, Cain offers several strategies:

**Be as humble as you can.** If you think you’re better than others, you’ll struggle to empathize with their pain. Studies show that people of a high social status and an accompanying sense of superiority are less able to recognize and empathize with sadness or cultivate connections with others through bonds of caring. This inability to empathize makes them less likely to help others when they’re in need.

(Shortform note: Cultivating humility can do more than increase your compassion for others—it can bring you greater professional success as well. Research shows that humility and empathy are both important leadership qualities that spur success in business. Humble leaders inspire stronger commitment and performance among employees along with higher levels of innovation and creativity. Further, compassionate and empathetic leaders must practice humility to let go of their ego-driven behaviors and understand and uplift the people around them. This fosters positive, effective communication and collaboration. Evidence shows that companies thrive when their leadership promotes caring and cooperation over individual success.)

**Increase your compassion toward yourself.** Engaging in self-compassion means quieting your negative inner voice as much as possible. This will increase your capacity for kindness toward others—to take care of others, you must first take care of yourself. To practice self-compassion, instead of berating yourself when you struggle or make a mistake, take a deep breath and engage with yourself like you would with a child. Imagine the kind of sweet reassurance a child would need, and offer yourself the same.

(Shortform note: Self-compassion has numerous additional benefits that indirectly increase your ability to help others. For example, people who exhibit greater self-compassion are also happier, physically healthier, and less susceptible to anxiety and depression. This means they have more time, mental space, and energy to spend on helping other people. One exercise for practicing self-compassion is writing a letter to yourself whenever you’re struggling. This can help you process the feelings you’re experiencing, comfort you, and motivate you to make a change. Try writing from the perspective of a wise, kind imaginary friend, or say to yourself what you’d say to a friend going through the same thing you are.)

**Write about moments of compassion you experience.** Regularly write down moments when you empathize with the suffering of others. This can reveal times when you feel strongly for others _and_ , by omission, times when you avoid acknowledging the suffering of others.

(Shortform note: Noticing these patterns of empathy (or lack of empathy) can help you determine which issues you really care about and how to cultivate your compassion further. For example, maybe you notice that you always tear up a little when you see a TV commercial about animals in need. This might indicate that you care deeply about animals, and it could prompt you to take action to help them by volunteering at a shelter or donating to a conservation organization. At the same time, you might notice that you avoid interactions with people who are sad at work. To increase your compassion in those situations, you might try checking in with your upset coworkers instead. You could ask them how they’re doing and practice active listening to show that you care.)

#### The Creative Power of Sadness

The author states that, in addition to its connective power, sadness is deeply intertwined with creativity in two ways. First, **naturally creative people may be more susceptible to sadness.** Many artists, writers, musicians, and other creative people throughout history were prone to states of melancholy, and modern research shows that creative people are highly predisposed to sorrow. Additionally, some studies suggest that people who work in the arts—some of the most creative people in our society—are more likely to have mood disorders.

(Shortform note: Many psychologists agree that there’s an established link between highly creative people and an increased likelihood of mental illness. However, another school of thought argues against the stereotype of the “tortured artist.” These people criticize the studies that support the link between creativity and mood disorders because the research often relies heavily on anecdotes, studies small sample sizes, and doesn’t include control groups to compare to the sample groups. Other critics argue that researchers should study creativity in more people than just artists to fully understand any connection it might have to mental illness. Finally, some research has found that mental illness hinders rather than bolsters creativity.)

Second, Cain notes, **sadness may trigger increased creative output, even in people who don’t have a naturally creative disposition.** This might be because sadness has some benefits: It primes our minds for the high level of focus, openness, and problem-solving that creative pursuits require. Some studies found that people in sad moods displayed sharper focus, greater attention to detail, fewer cognitive biases, and higher memory retention than usual.

(Shortform note: When researchers refer to sadness having positive aspects and being beneficial as described above, they’re usually referring to mild sad moods. Temporary sad moods are normal and an important part of how we react to challenges we face, and they can offer many advantages, as Cain states. For example, participants in one study were less susceptible to misleading information after recalling a sad memory as opposed to a happy one. However, intense, long-lasting sadness needs to be addressed for the sake of the person’s mental health, regardless of any benefits it may bring. There’s likely an underlying cause that won’t go away without help.)

##### Cain’s View on Sadness and Creativity

Cain states that **sadness isn’t the only way to increase creativity.** Many creative people have joyful and calm dispositions. Additionally, clinical depression can severely dampen creativity, and we’re much more likely to experience important moments of perception when we’re feeling happy.

(Shortform note: As Cain argues, sad and happy moods can both have creative benefits, but they arguably help us with different _elements_ of creativity. We can view the difference like this: Negative emotions like sadness help us with creative problem-solving and aid us in evaluating situations critically. They push us to persevere and find innovative solutions. Positive emotions open our minds to new possibilities, leading us to produce many new ideas. They quiet our critical selves and allow our imaginations to freely explore.)

Instead, Cain argues that **we can more accurately attribute high levels of creativity to states of being in which beauty _and_ sadness intersect**. This is because creativity has a uniquely transformational effect. When we can’t release our pain, creativity allows us to turn it into something beautiful, like a painting or a song.

(Shortform note: The therapeutic power of artmaking is well-documented, supporting Cain’s argument that creative pursuits allow us to transform our pain. Art therapy can be beneficial in addition to or instead of traditional therapy by allowing patients to express emotions that are difficult to put into words. It can also help patients improve interpersonal skills, increase self-awareness and self-esteem, and discover new insights. Finally, artmaking relieves anxiety and tension.)

### Accepting Impermanence and Loss

In the previous section, we discussed how sadness can be a powerful tool for inspiring compassion, connection, and creativity. Now, in this final section, let’s dive deeper into one of the main aspects of life that inspires sorrow: the inevitability that everything we care about will cease to exist someday.

According to Cain, people who are drawn to states of bittersweetness have a higher-than-average awareness that their time is limited and that they’ll eventually lose the things they love. Though this awareness might sound depressing to some, Cain argues that **an intimate understanding and acceptance of impermanence can benefit us,** **enhancing our joy, togetherness, and wisdom.**

(Shortform note: Cain asserts that a high awareness of impermanence and death can be beneficial to us, but some argue that it can be detrimental to our mental health. People with this view argue that fixating on our mortality can make us fearful and upset, ruining our experience of the present moment. Additionally, though awareness of mortality can give our daily life weight and meaning, moments when we feel light and limitless have value too. These can turn into some of our best memories.)

First, we’ll discuss how awareness of our impermanence can create connection and meaning. Then, we’ll touch on different ways of coping with the grief and loss that come from the impermanence of those we love.

#### Embracing Impermanence

The author asserts that **we all experience the effects of impermanence throughout our lives.** We become aware of impermanence in times of transition, like moving to a new place, and times of loss, like losing a loved one. Transformation and loss are painful because we must grapple with the truth that something in our life has changed forever, and we won’t be the same due to this shift. Because experiences that increase our awareness of impermanence are often painful and frightening (especially reminders of mortality), many people try to avoid or deny them.

> **Why Transitions Are Difficult**
> 
> As Cain asserts, times of transition, including times of loss, are difficult because we have to let go of an old identity to become someone new. This includes letting go of some of the people and things we’re attached to. We often think of our identities and the people around us as fixed and absolute. Therefore, losing any part of our identity—whether it’s a relationship, a job, a place, or something else—makes us deeply uncomfortable because we realize that nothing in our lives is as secure as we thought.
> 
> To reflect on times of transition and transformation in your own life, try making a timeline of big events you’ve experienced. Consider how they affected you and what you learned from them. This will help you see the wisdom you’ve gained over time—one of the benefits of change and growth.

Cain argues that **instead of shying away from impermanence, we should coexist with it.** Let’s explore two benefits of doing so: finding life more meaningful, and strengthening connections with others. We’ll then discuss _how_ you can coexist with impermanence.

##### Benefit #1: Acknowledging Impermanence Gives Life Meaning

According to Cain, **acknowledging impermanence gives everyday life greater meaning and beauty.** More specifically, cultivating an awareness of the impermanence of your mortality can help you appreciate what you have right now, instead of constantly seeking more—whether it's more friends, more money, or more accolades.

(Shortform note: One way to cultivate awareness of mortality and make life feel more meaningful is through maranasati meditations: Buddhist practices for increasing mindfulness of death. These meditations range from reflections on the ever-present possibility that we could die at any moment to contemplations about the breakdown of the physical body after death. According to tradition, the Buddha encouraged monks to remain mindful of death so they could appreciate the preciousness of their current life and reduce their attachments to desires and fears. Additionally, the Buddha recommended death meditation as a way to stop conflict—once we realize that we’ll all die one day, we recognize that quarreling is futile.)

To back up this recommendation, Cain cites several studies involving the elderly, people with terminal illnesses, and people living through civil unrest—in other words, people with a high awareness of their own mortality. The researchers found that the participants’ knowledge that their time was limited made them better appreciate things, people, and aspects of daily life that were already familiar and important to them.

(Shortform note: One study conducted with _young_ people found that even hypothetical scenarios that involved limiting people’s time prompted participants to choose what was familiar over what was new. In one experiment, participants were asked to select books or movies. Some were told to choose as if they were choosing for the last time, and others were given no such limit on their future. Those hypothetically choosing for the last time primarily selected books and movies they already knew and liked.)

Further, **people with a greater sense of mortality are able to stay in the present moment, rather than worrying about the future.**

(Shortform note: If you struggle to stay in the present moment and find yourself frequently anxious about the future, consider using some simple methods for returning to a mindful state. For example, deep breathing exercises can bring your focus back to the present and reduce feelings of anxiety. Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique, where you inhale for four counts, hold for seven, and exhale for eight.)

##### Benefit #2: Acknowledging Permanence Strengthens Connections

Cain also argues that **accepting impermanence may strengthen our connections with others.** Studies found that people close to (and thus highly aware of) death seek to deepen the connections they already have with others, rather than form new ones. This means they spend more time with the people they love and work to improve the quality of their relationships.

(Shortform note: According to research, focusing on social activities and meaningful connections is the best way to live a happy life for people of any age, not just those with limited time. We get the most joy from activities that strengthen our bonds with friends and family or benefit our community in some way. Additionally, living a meaningful, socially fruitful life that we enjoy plays an important role in increasing our longevity—people with satisfying relationships, strong emotional well-being, and a sense of purpose and engagement live longer than people who feel unhappy and disconnected.)

In contrast, **young, healthy people (who typically try to avoid acknowledging their mortality) tend to feel like their time is unlimited.** Therefore, they frequently start new relationships rather than developing the ones they already have. Likewise, they spend their time learning new information and building new skills while planning for their future, rather than searching for deeper meaning in their present daily life.

(Shortform note: Young people often spend their energy developing new relationships because they’re transitioning from spending time with their inherited family (the family they were born into or grew up with) to seeking a chosen family (people they’ve chosen to support, love, and care for regardless of blood or marriage ties). Unfortunately, when young people are still searching for their chosen family, they might lack the meaningful connections that older people have. This can leave them susceptible to loneliness. They’re often homesick, alone while making important life decisions, and separated from the communities they know, all of which contribute to feelings of isolation.)

> **Why Focusing on the Future Isn’t Always a Bad Thing**
> 
> Having a future-focused mindset isn’t necessarily a bad thing: Studies indicate that thinking about the future can help us in several important ways. First, it makes us more likely to choose a long-term, delayed reward over smaller, more immediate rewards. Building new skills that’ll help us achieve a future goal, as young people often do, is one possible example of this.
> 
> Additionally, imagining we’ll do something positive in the future (like achieving a goal or helping someone in need) makes us more likely to actually do it.
> 
> Finally, future prospection can help people with depression and trauma to heal—thinking about what they want from the future allows them to break free from their struggles in the past and present.

##### Putting It Into Practice: How to Increase Your Impermanence Awareness

Luckily, Cain asserts that **you don’t _have_ to be close to death to access the benefits of impermanence awareness.** She names three strategies for accessing this same state of mind right now:

**1) Study religious and philosophical traditions that deal with death,** such as ancient Stoic writings on mortality. They require us to reflect on the fact that we’ll all die someday, so we should appreciate the time we’re given.

(Shortform note: To explore Stoic writings on death, ancient Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations _might be a good place to start. As well as advocating for making the most of every day, Aurelius argues that we shouldn’t fear the death of the flesh because our bodies are the least important part of us. Our spirits and especially our minds are most important.)

**2) Spend time thinking deeply about death and impermanence.** You can do this by paying attention to ephemerality in nature, like the setting sun or a sudden storm. (Shortform note: You can intimately understand ephemerality in nature and meditate on impermanence through gardening. When you tend to a garden, you’re constantly surrounded by the life and death of plants, changing with the seasons. Plants also have good days and bad days like us. Growing them can remind you that nothing lasts forever, whether it’s good or bad.)

**3) Appreciate people while they’re here.** Spend time with older people and listen to their stories—this can remind you that they won’t always be around to tell them. (Shortform note: As well as increasing impermanence awareness, listening to the stories of your elders can benefit the storyteller. For one, engaging with and relaying their past memories can help keep their minds sharp and active. Additionally, the act of telling stories can improve communication between elders and their caregivers. This reduces stress on both sides, preventing conflict and caregiver burnout. Finally, sharing life stories contributes to increased self-worth and a sense of purpose.)

#### How to Bear Grief and Loss

The author argues that though we can learn to accept our own mortality and the impermanence of our own lives, **we might find it harder to bear the fact that we’ll eventually lose the people we love** : We can recognize this fact’s inevitability without feeling at peace with it. The pain of losing our loved ones comes from knowing that we’ve been separated from them, and we don’t know if we’ll ever be reunited. This makes loss extremely difficult to cope with.

(Shortform note: As Cain states, grief for the loss of loved ones often feels all-consuming in its pain. Additionally, unlike our own mortality, it’s nearly impossible to prepare for. Some psychologists suggest this is because we can’t prepare for _future pain_ , specifically: The most we can do is _anticipate_ the pain and make ourselves miserable in the present. The powerlessness of grief is also difficult to prepare for—we can’t do anything to bring our loved one back, so we feel crushed by our lack of control. Finally, we may feel like we’re betraying our loved one if we try to prepare for their loss in advance. To let go of our fear of losing them, we have to let go of our attachment to them. This can feel like loving them less, even though that probably isn’t true.)

Though we all experience the pain of grief and loss, people in modern Western culture often view extended periods of bereavement as inconvenient, self-indulgent, and even shameful. They prefer to keep death out of sight, so they feel uncomfortable with open displays of mourning. They most admire those who are able to keep their grief hidden.

Cain asserts that it doesn’t have to be this way—**instead of ignoring the existence of loss and grief, we should treat it as an inevitable, normal part of life.** When we normalize grief and allow ourselves and others to display and experience it fully, we realize we’re not alone, and we can find comfort in our shared pain. This feeling of understanding and connection with others can help ease our suffering, if only a little.

> **How to Support Someone Who’s Grieving**
> 
> Feeling like we have to hide our grief because it makes other people uncomfortable or is somehow shameful can be an isolating experience, making an already difficult time worse. However, as Cain argues, it doesn’t have to be this way. We can normalize grief by actively supporting those who are going through loss and making space for their pain, no matter how long it lasts. Here are some ways you can support people during their bereavement:
> 
>   * **Keep in touch regularly,** and continue to do so when most people have stopped. Bereaved people often have trouble reaching out, so you can help them by taking the initiative.
> 
>   * Instead of asking how they are (most likely, they’re not well), **ask how they’re feeling today** —this will give them an opportunity to express whatever emotions or thoughts they want to share.
> 
>   * **Don’t be afraid to talk about the person they lost.** It may be difficult for your friend to talk about their lost loved one, and they may cry. But, it’s better for you to show that their loved one will be missed and remembered than to pretend they never existed.
> 
>   * **Instead of offering advice, listen.** People often process grief by telling stories about their loved ones, even if it’s the same one over and over. Your understanding is more valuable than your advice at this time.
> 
>   * **Reserve judgment.** Loss is a huge life change, and grief can’t be rushed. Let your loved one heal in their own time.
> 
> 


Cain outlines two methods for coping with grief that she encountered while conducting her research:

##### Method #1: Accept the Complexity of Grief

According to Cain, psychology experts assert that **we should acknowledge the complexity of grief and our resilience in the face of it.** Grief doesn’t just manifest as a long period of sorrow that slowly fades over time—it’s often full of complicated, layered emotions that involve both sadness that the person is gone and joy that comes from your memories of them or the ways they influenced you. For example, we may laugh at a funny story someone tells about our lost loved one and cry minutes later over a picture of them. We have to accept the coexistence of these positive and negative feelings and learn to live with an ever-present pain.

(Shortform note: Cain discusses the _emotional_ complexity of grief, which can involve both negative and positive emotions that are difficult to navigate. Beyond this emotional experience, grief can manifest in other complex, unexpected, yet deeply affecting ways. We might experience physical reactions like sleep disruption, fatigue, and headaches. Additionally, we might have cognitive reactions like confusion, difficulty focusing and making decisions, or even short-term memory loss. If you’re going through a loss, know that the grieving process is different for everyone, and there’s no correct timeline or procedure to follow to work through your grief.)

##### Method #2: Find Comfort in the Promise of an Afterlife

Cain relates that **many people of varying religious and spiritual traditions ease the suffering of loss with the belief that they’ll see their loved ones again in the afterlife.** Therefore, they can take comfort in knowing they only have to endure the pain of separation for a finite period of time.

(Shortform note: Instead of feeling comforted by religion during a time of loss, some people experience a loss of faith when they’re grieving. This is especially common for people who’ve spent many years devoted to their religion. They may feel punished and betrayed by God through their loss, and they may reject their spiritual ties out of anger. This can lead to complicated grief, which typically doesn’t abate on its own and leaves the mourner feeling stuck and despondent. In these cases, it’s important that the grieving person sees a therapist who can help guide them through the changes in their life.)

##### Cain’s View: Carrying on Without Moving on

To conclude, Cain states that grief is just love manifesting in a different form, so it stays with us as long as we still love the people who are gone. **Ultimately, we don’t have to let go of our grief to take positive steps forward after a loss.** We can find new connections and happiness _while_ carrying the pain of loss—the grief we carry means we exist in a state of ever-present bittersweetness, where joy and love are always intertwined with sadness.

> **How to Handle Outside Pressures When Coping With Grief**
> 
> Despite Cain’s assertion that we don’t have to move on from our grief to move forward, you might experience pressure from people around you pushing you to feel better and get over your grief before you’re ready. If you find yourself in this situation, first, consider your own internalized beliefs about grief and how they might affect your response to pressure from others. If you already feel like you should be coping better or faster, you’ll likely experience more shame and doubt if others question you as well.
> 
> Then, remind yourself that there’s no correct way to grieve—every person handles loss differently, and it’s often a very confusing process that we only understand when we go through it ourselves. If you recognize and accept this, you’ll be less phased by the unfair judgments of others.
> 
> Finally, be honest with people who are making you uncomfortable. Tell them that the pressure they’re putting on you isn’t helpful, and it just makes you feel worse. Even if they don’t stop, you took a step to change the situation for the better.
