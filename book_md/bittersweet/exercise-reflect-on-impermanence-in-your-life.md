## Exercise: Reflect on Impermanence in Your Life

Cain explores the benefits of bittersweet states, and she describes many methods for accessing them in everyday life. Spend some time considering your relationship to one of these states—impermanence awareness.

* * *

How much do you consider impermanence in your everyday life? (For example, you might think about your mortality regularly; or, it might only cross your mind occasionally.)

What has encouraged or discouraged you from thinking about impermanence in your life? (For example, maybe a spiritual practice has encouraged you to think about it, or you’ve been discouraged by your fear that you’ll lose the people you love.)

How do your views on impermanence affect your current choices? (For example, maybe you avoid spending time with your family because you feel that if you isolate yourself from them, losing them won’t hurt as much.)

Which strategies for accessing impermanence awareness and accepting mortality might work for you? Why? (For example, maybe meditating on impermanence through nature appeals to you because you already enjoy spending time in nature.)
