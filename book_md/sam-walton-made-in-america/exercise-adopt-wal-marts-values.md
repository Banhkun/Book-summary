## Exercise: Adopt Wal-Mart’s Values

See how you align with some of Wal-Mart’s most important values.

* * *

Sam Walton unfailingly worked in service of the customer. Imagine that in your work, you care only about the customer outcome and will fight on their behalf. When you’re doing something difficult, you are doing it for the customer. How would you behave differently if you took this to heart?

Walton knew where the value in the company was generated, and he made everything else subservient to them. In Wal-Mart, the senior management and buyers were servants of the individual stores. Where is the value driver in your company? How could you reorganize things to better serve the value driver?

Sam Walton regularly invited criticism from his worst critics to find areas of improvement. Who could you reach out to for incisive, accurate feedback on what you’re doing? How could you hear what you don’t want to hear?
