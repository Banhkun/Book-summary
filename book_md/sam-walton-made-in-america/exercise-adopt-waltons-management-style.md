## Exercise: Adopt Walton’s Management Style

Take up some of Sam Walton’s most important management techniques.

* * *

Walton had a “whistle while you work” philosophy, and he wanted people to have a good time working. Do you take yourself too seriously at work? How could you lighten up your perspective?

Walton enjoyed communicating to the team by broadcasting widely. How could you better communicate to your team in a way that’s high-leverage for you?

Walton made a habit of talking to individual associates within Wal-Mart. He especially enjoyed talking to truck drivers, who saw what was really going on and weren’t afraid to share it. Who are the truck drivers in your organization that you should talk more to?
