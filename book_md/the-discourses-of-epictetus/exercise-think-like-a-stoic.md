## Exercise: Think Like a Stoic

Now that you’ve learned some of Epictetus’s most important teachings, try applying Stoic reasoning to some events in your own life. Think about a challenging or upsetting situation you’ve encountered recently, and use calm rationality to determine the best response to it.

* * *

Describe a challenging or upsetting situation you’ve encountered recently. Was this situation in your control, or outside of your control? For example, maybe you got into an argument with a family member or made a mistake at work. (Remember that Epictetus says the only things _fully_ in your control are your own thoughts and actions.)

How did you respond to this situation when it happened? Did you become emotional, or did you approach the problem calmly and thoughtfully? Using the benefit of hindsight, was there a more rational way you could have handled it?

What lesson can you learn from this situation to help you act with reason and dignity in the future? For example, if you lashed out emotionally, perhaps next time you could pause for a moment and think about your response first.
