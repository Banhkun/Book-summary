## Exercise: Practice Gratitude

The most difficult time to practice gratitude is when you’re faced with challenging and painful circumstances. Ironically, this is also the time when practicing gratitude is most necessary. This exercise will help you to get started.

* * *

Describe a challenging and/or painful circumstance in your life, one that you could easily use as an excuse to identify as a victim. It can be a past circumstance or a present one.

What’s the “victim thought” (“It isn’t fair”; “Life wasn’t supposed to be like this”; “I never get any good breaks”) that this circumstance has created or tried to create in your mind?

Take this victim thought through the exercise that you learned in Chapter 10 for identifying and diagnosing a negative thought and then comparing it against God’s truth: What is the thought? Is it true? What does God say about it? Will you believe him? Write your responses below.
