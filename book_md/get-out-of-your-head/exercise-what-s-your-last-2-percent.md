## Exercise: What's Your “Last 2 Percent”?

In Chapter 9, Allen talks about the liberating value of sharing things that you hold back from others in an attempt to protect yourself from shame. You don’t really help yourself through this act of concealment. Instead, you actually empower the hidden things to poison you and dominate you. It’s only when you bring them into the light of community that they can be healed.

We all know of people who have suffered for refusing to share their “last 2 percent.” There are also notable examples in literature and film. Think of a “real-life” example or, if you prefer, one from a book, movie, or television program. Name them in the box below.

What was the person’s last 2 percent, and why did they conceal it? What were they afraid would happen if they revealed it to others?

How did their refusal to share their last 2 percent affect their life?

What’s your own “last 2 percent”? Why do you hold it back? What are you afraid will happen if you share it with someone else? If you prefer not to write your answers, just reflect deeply.
