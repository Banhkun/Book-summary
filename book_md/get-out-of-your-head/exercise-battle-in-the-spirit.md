## Exercise: Battle in the Spirit

Part 2 of this book detailed seven battles in the war for your mind (the battle against distraction, the battle against fear, and so on). Part 3 gave thumbnail sketches of how Jesus demonstrated and illustrated victory in each of these battles. It also pointed out that you have the same Spirit in you that empowered Jesus.

* * *

Which of the seven battles in Part 2 is particularly important to you? Which do you find yourself fighting most frequently? Even if you could validly name several of them, for this exercise choose just one.

Why _this_ battle? Why is it yours to fight more than some of the others? Why is it a struggle in your life?

How did Jesus face and fight the same thing? How did this battle manifest in his life? How exactly did he respond and overcome? You may want to answer this with your Bible open (since it contains much more detail about these matters).

What can you learn from Jesusâ€™s example? Concretely, how does his route to victory apply to you and your battle?
