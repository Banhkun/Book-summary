## Exercise: Analyze a Fear

Chapter 10 presents several strategies for surrendering your fears to God. This exercise leads you through practicing one of these.

* * *

Write one of your chief fears, something that persistently causes you anxiety and has the potential to knock you into a toxic thought spiral. (Are you afraid of close relationships? Do you suffer from anxious thoughts about failing publicly at your job? Do you lose sleep because you’re afraid for your family’s safety?)

What is the enemy’s lie that fuels this fear?

What is one scriptural truth that contradicts or replaces this fear?

What additional strategies can you use to surrender the fear to God? (For example, apply Philippians 4:6-7; spend time reflecting on God as the deepest and truest reality; pay attention to the manifestation of your fear in your body; use the modified mental story map tool). How will you practice them? If applicable, practice them now.
