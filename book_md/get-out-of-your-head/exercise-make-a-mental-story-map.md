## Exercise: Make a Mental Story Map

Allenâ€™s mental story map exercise brings out the current contents of your mind for evaluation. It provides a useful tool for taking the first step toward controlling your thoughts, which is to become aware of them.

* * *

Before continuing to the questions below, make a mental story map. First, draw the map, with your primary current emotion circled in the middle and its contributing factors surrounding it. Second, pray, search the scriptures, and talk to God about it. Third, look for common patterns and themes in the map. Finally, notice the storyline that these uncovered themes and thoughts have built about God.

Use the space below to record and reflect on what you learned from the exercise. First, what primary emotion did you list at the center? Anxiety? Anger? Shame? Contentment?

What contributing factors did you list for your current emotion? Exactly how is each of them contributing?

What common patterns or themes do you notice in your map?

What story do the thoughts revealed by this exercise tell about God? _Is that story true?_ Either way, what are the implications?
