## Chapter 9: The Battle Against Shame

In this second battle of the war for your mind, you’ll face an enemy that wants to shut you off from relationships with other people. Even more, it wants to shut you off from a relationship with God himself.

### Your Enemy and Your Weapon

**Your enemy in this battle is _shame_** , which leads you to behave self-protectively by generating an illusion of self-enclosed autonomy.

Some typical thoughts associated with shame include the following. Look for these in your own mind:

  * People would run if they knew how badly I’ve failed.
  * I’m not a people person. I enjoy being a loner.
  * Other people just don’t get me.
  * Nobody wants to hear about my problems.



**Your weapon against shame is _community_** , a relationship of open, heartful connection with God and other people.

### The Lie: You Don’t Need Anyone

**The enemy’s basic lie in this battle is that you can “do it on your own,” that you can live your own life and solve your own problems.** This lie is generated and fueled by the shame described above. We’re each burdened with a deep-seated fear that our true selves are shameful, that other people would reject us and abandon us if they really knew our thoughts, actions, and true identities

**Shame produces a dysfunctional behavioral pattern:**

  * It leads us to act self-protectively by refusing to ask for help. Under shame’s spell, we think of asking for help as “bothering other people with our problems.” Letting other people “in” feels threatening when shame is dominating us.
  * So we push others away with harsh words and defensive behaviors, leaving us alone in the toxic swirl of our own thoughts.
  * Then our self-created isolation amplifies our sense of worthlessness and shame by “confirming” it. So we’re caught in a self-fulfilling mental and behavioral trap.



Ironically, the current generation has actually made an idol out of this dysfunction. We worship and promote absolute independence from others as if it’s a virtue, when in fact it’s the very thing God is calling us away from.

### The Truth: God Made You for Community

**The truth that explodes the lie of shame is that God made you not to go it alone but to be seen, known, and loved.**

A key scripture highlighting this truth is 1 John 1:7: “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.”

The author learned a critical lesson about God’s plan for community when she and her husband went through the process of adopting their son Cooper from an orphanage in Rwanda: For children to thrive, you have to make them feel seen and loved. Moreover, this insight applies to all of us. The old saying “it takes a village” applies to more than raising a child. We’re “village people,” built to thrive in communities that gather together and share each other’s lives.

#### God’s Intrinsic Community: The Trinity

**The fact that God made you for community reaches back to the nature of our creator himself. God is intrinsically a community because of his triune nature.** The Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exists for all eternity in an internal community of loving relationship. It’s the primal template for human relational needs. We need community because God made us that way.

Through Jesus, God provides community by inviting us into his family. When we’re saved through faith in Christ, we become God’s children, and he becomes our loving father. We receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we’re adopted into the eternal loving community of the Trinity.

The whole Bible supports the irreducible need for human community. It assumes that those who follow God will live in community with other God followers.

#### Wired for Community

We can also see God’s design for community in the very workings of our brain.**The need for community is neurologically and psychologically hardwired into us.**

“Mirror neurons” fire when you interact with others, enabling you to feel what other people are feeling. In other words, our very heart-brains are designed for empathy. This also works negatively, in reverse: Disconnection and isolation alter our brains in negative ways. For instance, severed relationships literally hurt, as feelings of rejection activate the same brain area as physical pain. The popularity and effectiveness of group therapy speaks to this as well, as research shows that such therapy doesn’t just provide emotional comfort; it actually heals.

### The Strategy: Choose to Know and Be Known

**The way you defeat your enemy of shame and its lie that you don’t need others is by _choosing_ community.** In other words, choose to know and be known by others. In this endeavor, it’s important to **remember that God’s Spirit lives in you**. Trust the Spirit to be with you in reaching out to others.

To illustrate this last point, the author relates a painful past experience from when she started her IF organization. A misunderstanding about her motivations brought public criticism from prominent women whom she admired. She reached out to them by phone, forged a relationship, apologized, and asked for their wisdom. They proved open and accepting. Allen’s risk in reaching out ended up bringing healing and new friends and allies.

You can also find vivid descriptions of ways to achieve real community in Philippians 2 and Colossians 3. According to Paul in those books, creating real human community may look like:

  * Showing brotherly affection
  * Trying to “outdo each other” in showing honor
  * Living in harmony with others
  * Comforting others and seeking peaceful interactions
  * Denying your own sinful desires and serving others
  * Being kind and forgiving
  * Being grateful
  * Worshiping God together



#### Awareness and Courage

Along with the Holy Spirit’s help, **you require two additional things for successfully reaching out to others for community: awareness of what you need and the courage to seek it out.** Here’s some specific advice for these:

**Find and connect with healthy people.** Look for emotionally healthy people, those whose lives show they’re truly following Jesus. See Paul’s exhortation in 1 Corinthians 11:1 to “follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.” Look for people who show authenticity, openness, peace, and a willingness to share, listen, and grow. Remember that you’re called to cultivate this kind of emotional health in yourself, too, and to share it with others.

**Confidently ask for human connections.** Drop the discomfort of thinking you’re bothering people. Practice asking until it doesn’t make you cringe. Examples include:

  * asking someone for help with a chore
  * asking for creative input on a project
  * when you meet someone interesting, someone you’d like to know better, asking them out for coffee and conversation



**Learn to “bother” others, and let them bother you. Be the friend you wish they’d be for you.** For example, if you notice that a friend or family member seems “off” or not herself, straightforwardly “bother” her until she opens up. Offer to pray, ask her to lunch. “Bug” her into community.

Once when the author’s daughter Kate traveled out of town with a friend and the friend’s family, she called home, and it was obvious that she was upset about something. She said she wanted to enter counseling when she got back. Her mother affirmed this over the phone but also talked at length with her daughter, emphasizing her motherly love for her and drawing her out into healing conversation. This is an example of lovingly bothering someone to maintain community.

**Also learn to accept the same bothering from others.** Open up. Risk getting hurt. Allen says her closest girlfriends at various stages of her life have shaped her, elevated her goals, refused to let her “settle,” and helped her in all kinds of ways through their friendship.

**Learn to say “yes.”** Say yes to requests for companionship, help, and so on, even if they’re inconvenient or unexpected. Also remember to retain your wits. Learning to say yes isn’t about flinging the door wide open for toxic people but about welcoming healthy friendships.

**Show your authentic self early—** including, especially, your annoying quirks and weaknesses—so that your real friends will become evident. Doing this and refusing to make yourself look “better” will scare off the wrong people (those you don’t need) even as it brings in the right people (your true tribe of friends and allies). The author describes some aspects of her own “messy” personality as examples of what to share early: She’s forgetful, she’s flighty in conversation, she laughs at inappropriate moments, she asks intrusive questions.

**Finally, share “the last 2 percent.”** This refers to the final, deep thing that you tend to hold back from family and friends even when you’re otherwise being open and authentic. It could be a long-ago mistake, anger issues, or something else that you feel you need to conceal. Airing and sharing such things creates healing. Bringing your dark struggles into the light breaks their power.

A Christian friend of the author’s demonstrated this principle when she confided that she had been strongly attracted to another man (not her husband) at work and had even started texting him. She told Allen that when she shared that “last 2 percent” at an IF:Gathering, the attraction immediately evaporated.

Here’s a visual showing the negative spiral of shame and how you can reverse it by choosing community:

#### Beyond the Book

As an important proviso or disclaimer, remember that _reading about_ _community_ isn’t the same as _experiencing community_. You can’t choose to know and be known in loving relationships simply by reading this book or any other.

The same warning actually encompasses this book as a whole. You have to cultivate the discipline of a healthful and godly mental life in relationship with others, not as a solo act.
