## Chapter 13: The Battle Against Victimhood

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to fight effectively against an enemy whose goal is to convince you that you’ll never be happy because life is against you.

### Your Enemy and Your Weapon

**Your enemy in this chapter is victimhood** ,**** a state of unhappiness centered in self-pity over your painful experiences.

Some typical thoughts associated with victimhood include the following. Look for these in your own mind:

  * It isn’t fair.
  * I’m doing the best I can just to survive.
  * I can’t ever recover from what happened. I can’t move on.
  * My life wasn’t supposed to turn out like this.
  * Nobody would believe what I’ve been through.
  * I never get any good breaks.



**Your weapon against victimhood is _gratitude_** , an encompassing attitude with an accompanying practice of thankful appreciation, no matter what happens.

### The Lie: You’re the Victim of Your Circumstances

**The enemy’s basic lie in this battle is that you’re a victim of your circumstances.** It tells you that you’re doomed to a life of misery because of the negative things that have happened to you, because of your situation, because of what other people have done to you or withheld from you, because of what you lack or can’t do, and so on.

This lie can use circumstances both major and relatively minor to perpetuate itself. The author shares several stories about people in her life who have encountered serious troubles, ranging from racism to terminal illness to disability, that presented potential points of access for the lie of victimhood. The next section below describes some of these stories.

A friend of the author’s actually bought the lie. This young woman worked as a clerk at a retail clothing store, and since the job didn’t line up with her ambition to use her skills and her college degree for something “better,” she was caught up in frustration and disillusionment. The circumstance was less serious than, say, a terminal illness, but it was still sufficient to allow the lie of victimhood to worm its way into the woman’s mind.

### The Truth: You Can Find God’s Goodness in Your Circumstances

**The truth that overturns the lie of victimhood is that your circumstances, far from being a trap and making you a victim, provide all the opportunities you need for experiencing God’s goodness.** A key scripture supporting this truth is Paul’s exhortation in 1 Thessalonians 5 to “rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”

The pain you experience from your circumstances doesn’t have to become your identity. It isn’t your master. The power of Jesus enables you to acknowledge your frustration and pain without losing peace and joy.

#### Count It All Joy

The author’s youngest daughter, Caroline, is dyslexic. This causes Caroline exhaustion and sometimes frustration. But she’s also persistent and tough. She hasn’t let her disability con her into adopting a victim identity.

Paul had more reason than most to consider himself a victim. He suffered threats on his life, beatings, imprisonment, shipwreck, betrayal by friends, and many more such things, any one of which might be enough to throw many of us into spasms of self-pity and victimhood. But Paul told the Philippian Christians that his difficulties were all joy to him (!) because they had served to advance the cause of Christ. He saw his trials as opportunities for experiencing and sharing God’s goodness.

After a time of frustration, the author’s friend at the clothing store began to learn from Paul’s example. She realized that she could choose her attitude toward work. She began praying during her commute, using her interactions with customers and coworkers as opportunities to serve others, and recognizing her circumstances as a chance to advance God’s kingdom. The result? She came to love her job.

A married couple named Roddy and Dee experienced heartbreak when Dee was diagnosed with ALS, which is fatal. His condition rapidly degenerated until he could only communicate through a speech synthesizer. After he died, when the author asked Roddy if she had felt any anger toward God, Roddy found the idea unthinkable and said she and Dee had both viewed his illness from the start as something that God could use for good.

This principle also enables a powerfully God-affirming and life-affirming response to injustice. Christ enables us to call out and oppose real oppression—racism, sexism, cruelty toward women and children and minorities and immigrants and unborn children—without defining ourselves by other people’s wrongdoing.**In Christ, you fight from a place of reconciliation and confidence instead of outrage and insecurity. You affirm God’s commitment to redeeming all things.**

  * A friend of the author’s told a group at church about the racist attacks, both verbal and physical, that she has experienced in her life, including in a church. Instead of claiming victimhood, the woman joined this new church and launched a series of conversations on racial reconciliation.



### The Strategy: Choose to Be Grateful

**The way to defeat your enemy of victimhood is to choose gratitude. Be grateful no matter what happens, no matter what life brings.**

You can implement this strategy in various ways.

**Meditate on scriptures**(such as Isaiah 41:10) that teach and reinforce the truth that God holds you and keeps you secure in all circumstances.****

**Practice looking beyond your immediate situation.** Fix your mental gaze on God’s infinite goodness and long-range purposes. Follow Paul’s instruction in 2 Corinthians 4 to look not at the temporary things you can see with your physical eyes but the eternal things that you can only see with your eyes of faith.

**Look for the unexpected gifts that difficult circumstances may bring.** You may find that you and your loved ones grow the most in your faith _because_ of hard times. Bank on Paul’s description of some of these benefits in Romans 5: “We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”

**Learn and receive the neurological benefits of gratitude for improving your life.** Science has identified several of these and found that—to put it in Christian terms—gratitude contributes to the transformation of your mind and life in a Christlike direction.

  * Gratitude facilitates human relationships.
  * Gratitude improves physiological and psychological health.
  * Gratitude reduces aggression and increases empathy.
  * Gratitude improves sleep patterns.
  * Gratitude enables appreciation of other people’s achievements.
  * Gratitude increases mental strength for overcoming trauma and enduring hard times.



**Use the techniques and strategies you learned in earlier chapters** to identify victim thoughts and replace them with thoughts that thank and honor God and enable you to recognize his goodness coming to you in all circumstances, even the hard ones.

Here’s a visual showing the negative spiral of victimhood and how to reverse it by choosing gratitude.
