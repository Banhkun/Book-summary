## Conclusion: Breaking Through the Empathy Wall

**To heal America’s growing political divide, liberals and conservatives must find ways to overcome the empathy wall that separates them.** Each side is far too busy demonizing the other and reacting to caricatures of their political opponents, rather than substantively engaging with what the other side really believes and why they believe it.

Conservatives like the ones profiled in this summary must recognize that liberals do not wish to impose their values on them or judge them for how they live their lives. Instead, American liberalism is premised on a vision of the common good, one in which traditionally marginalized groups are empowered to chart the course of the nation’s future and economic gains are shared more equitably. And, sometimes, the federal government is the only entity with the resources and direction to bring such a vision to life.

**Liberals must recognize that conservatives are not motivated solely by bigotry and hatred, nor are they uneducated or unsophisticated**. Their political beliefs and resentments stem from a long history of feeling marginalized and discarded by mainstream American culture—of feeling like strangers in their own land. Moreover, there is much that liberals ought to admire about people on the right—their sense of pride in the dignity of work; their commitment to family and community; and their spirit of entrepreneurship, individualism, and independence.

By speaking more honestly with one another on an individual level and breaking out of their respective bubbles, liberal and conservative Americans would find that there is much that they actually have in common. On some level, both groups believe that the American economy has become unfair and rigged, with liberals believing that wealthy and powerful corporations are taking up too large a share of national income, and conservatives believing that the government is unfairly rewarding the indolent and lazy over the thrifty and industrious.

And there is indeed room for compromise and movement on a shared agenda between liberals and conservatives. For example, although he remains a member of the Tea Party and retains staunchly conservative positions on taxes, welfare, and abortion, Mike Schaff, whom we met in Chapter 2, has become a committed environmental activist (even if he still dislikes that label). While he is still generally hostile to government, he has come to recognize that there is a role for government oversight of business, especially when corporations destroy communities through their environmental mismanagement, as Texas Brine did to his beloved Bayou Corne.

**Mike has been able to turn his right-wing values regarding honor and community toward _progressive_ ends**—he feels outraged, dishonored, and disrespected by Texas Brine’s indifference to the community that he loves. Now, he is working to get the Tea Party to embrace environmentalism as an important issue for _conservatives_ as well.

If progressives wish to remain electorally competitive and to make progress toward their vision of a national common good, they must step outside their left-wing bubble and actually engage with those who disagree with them. Mike’s story shows that cooperation is possible. Some ways to bridge this division could include:

  * A national high-school exchange program in which students from different regions of the country live and study in another part of the U.S. for the school year
  * A national youth service program, similar to the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, that brings together young people from around the nation to work on projects that will benefit the whole nation, such as installing solar panels, building dams, or planting gardens.



However we do it, getting past the empathy wall is the only way we can bring civility back to our politics, restore public faith in democratic institutions, and rejuvenate the American Dream.
