## Part 4: Past and Present

So far, we’ve talked about how conservatives’ narratives about their own lives, communities, and their place in a changing society shape their political orientation. In particular, we’ve explored how deeply held notions of honor and hierarchy order the right-wing worldview and are the true animating force behind their fierce opposition to government and the welfare state.

**But while conservative attitudes may be driven by a reaction against changing economic, social, and racial systems, they have very deep roots in American history**. In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * How American history—and Southern history in particular—profoundly shaped how working-class white people saw their role within the nation’s social hierarchy
  * How the successes of the Civil Rights Movement and the social advancements of minority groups beginning in the 1960s contributed to the feeling of loss of place or status among many whites
  * How these historical forces carry forward today, coloring the political attitudes and resentments of white conservatives—and making them highly receptive to the appeals of a charismatic demagogue like Donald Trump



### The Weight of Southern History

We’ve analyzed the deep stories of several members of the Tea Party, giving us a glimpse into how they’ve arrived at their political positions—through their personal histories, their ingrained attitudes toward work, their feelings of honor and shame, and their religion.

But in discussing the political right in a place like Lake Charles, it’s important to acknowledge the unique history of the American South and how an awareness of that regional history shapes today’s political identities.

#### Poor Whites of the Antebellum South

**Before the American Civil War, the South was defined by the institution of Black chattel slavery, which infused the region’s political, economic, and social character.**

The poor white yeomen farmers of the South (who themselves owned few, if any slaves) saw an extraordinarily vivid gap between rich and poor on display in their daily lives. After all, they only needed to contrast the rich and opulent lives of the planters with the miserable and exploited existence of the Black slaves.

The presence of the planters provided an example of what a poor white farmer _could_ become if he applied himself; meanwhile, slavery reminded them of the region’s racial hierarchy—and, as white people (especially white men), of their relatively privileged place within that hierarchy. Their status as white men became an innate source of honor, contrasted as it was with the powerless condition of the Black slaves.

**The inherent advantages of whiteness and the wealth opportunities afforded by slavery in such a society led even non-slaveholding whites to identify with and defend the institution of slavery and the wealthy planters who dominated the region.**

The legacy of slavery and the racial politics of the region created a cultural framework in which white Southerners would be less receptive to populist, anti-rich political appeals and more receptive to pro-business messages.

This was despite the fact that poor whites were frequently economically exploited by the planters, who used their wealth to purchase the region’s best land, in the process pushing poorer whites onto more remote and less-productive land.

#### The Civil Rights Era

**The events of the 1960s, particularly the Civil Rights Movement, further shaped the political attitudes of conservative Southern whites.**

During this era, Black people—the South’s traditional underclass—marched, demonstrated, and organized boycotts, strikes, and sit-ins as part of a massive and ultimately successful effort to desegregate the region’s public and private accommodations. Meanwhile, landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped Black people achieve some measure of political, social, and economic parity with whites for the first time in Southern history.

While these advances are celebrated as crucial victories for justice in much of the rest of the U.S., white Southerners have a different perspective on them. They deeply resented white northern allies of the Civil Rights Movement (whom they saw as moralizing and condescending) descending on their communities to upend what they believed to be the traditional Southern way of life. In some instances, federal troops were even sent into Southern states to supervise integration efforts.

To many white Southerners, the erosion of the region’s traditional racial order represented a downgrading of their own status. Their whiteness itself had always protected them from ever being at the bottom of the social hierarchy. **Any movement toward Black equality—particularly one imposed and enforced by the hated federal government—was a deep threat to their status and honor.**

To white Southerners, it was a historical replay of the military occupation of the South by northern Union troops after the Civil War.

### A Loss of Identity

**This bitterness is reflected in the sentiments expressed by many Southern Tea Party supporters today, who resent the portrayal of white Southerners as racist, ignorant, and backward—the villains in the American story of progress.**

Their identity as white and Southern, once a source of great pride, was now something that the wider culture was denigrating. Celebrating your whiteness, they were now being told, made you no better than a Klansman or a Neo-Nazi. What was a source of _honor_ seemed now to be a source of _shame_.

The economic trends only intensified the feelings of alienation and loss of status. As automation and competition from foreign labor undermined domestic manufacturing, blue-collar conservative Southerners found they could no longer find pride and status in their occupations either. Now, when they are able to find jobs at all, they are increasingly finding work only in the service industry as retail clerks or healthcare workers—“unmanly” jobs traditionally reserved for minorities and women.

**Feeling disrespected, undermined, and unable to celebrate their white Southern identity, conservative Southerners seek _other_ sources of identity and honor**—through their celebration of traditional values, their commitment to their local communities, their deep religious faith, and their pride in their region.

Adding insult to injury, the castigation of white identity has come as other groups are embracing and celebrating _their_ identities—Black, Latinx, women, LGBTQ, and so on. Tea Party supporters, deeply imbued with an ideology that values hard work and self-reliance, resent what they see as a celebration of marginalization and victimization on the part of such groups.

If we recall Mayor Hardey’s phrase from Chapter 2, it seems to people on the right that the U.S. has become a “poor me” nation.

### Primed for Trump

These long-simmering historical resentments among white voters were a crucial factor in driving support for Donald Trump. Indeed, when Hochschild returned to Lake Charles both before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, **she found that Tea Partiers were nearly unanimous in their support for Trump.**

At first glance, the enthusiasm of these rural, religious conservatives for the brash, crude, and famously philanderous New York City businessman/celebrity might seem strange. But the source of Trump’s appeal to cultural conservatives runs far deeper than their surface differences with him.

#### Trump Voters and Emotional Self-Interest

**Liberals often deride conservative white working-class voters for voting against their own interest.** Why would non-rich people vote for a party committed to tax cuts for the wealthy, slashing regulation of big business, and the gutting of environmental oversight that results in their communities suffering from contaminated air and water? This is what we categorized in Chapter 1 as the conservative paradox that lies at the heart of American politics.

**But liberals take too narrow a view of what constitutes “interest.” Interests can be non-economic in nature.** For blue-collar conservatives, supporting Trump was powerfully in their _emotional_ self-interest. What they admired most about Trump was his willingness to give voice to their grievances and resentments in unvarnished terms.

With his inflammatory rhetoric toward Muslims (whom he proposed outright banning from the country) and the nation of Mexico (along whose border with the U.S. he proposed building a wall to stop illegal immigration), Trump skillfully activated conservative voters’ anger toward line cutters who they believed had usurped their rightful place in line for the American Dream.

Their support for Trump was not _in spite_ of his crudeness; it was _because_ of it. By being more willing than any other Republican candidate to antagonize and enrage through inflammatory rhetoric those whom Tea Partiers saw as their line cutters and enemies—liberals, environmentalists, immigrants, minorities—Trump helped to create a new emotional permission structure that enabled white conservatives to express long-simmering anger and thumb their noses at liberal “feeling rules” (the resentment toward which we explored in Chapter 2).

When Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” or encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters at his rallies, he was deliberately discarding the emotional rules that many conservatives feel have been imposed upon them by liberals—that they must only speak about marginalized groups in certain ways and be careful to always use whatever politically correct term is in vogue at the moment.

**Trump’s refusal to abide by liberal norms felt like the lifting of a great emotional burden for Tea Party conservatives** —and an affirmation that there was nothing shameful about their commitment to traditional values and identities. Trump has restored pride and honor to white conservative America once more.

For the Tea Partiers of southwestern Louisiana, Trump’s status as a businessman—instead of a politician—also made him all the more appealing. To them, he was a great American entrepreneur who had made himself rich through his own hard work and relentless pursuit of success. Now, they believed, he would bring those same skills to bear on behalf of America; and, specifically, on behalf of Americans like _themselves_.
