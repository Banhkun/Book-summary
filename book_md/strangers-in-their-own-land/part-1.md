## Part 1: The Plight of the Right

**Blue-collar conservative voters’ support for the pro-corporate agenda of the modern GOP often results in tragic outcomes for them**. In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * How conservative states like Louisiana have some of the lowest national rankings on crucial quality-of-life measures like health, education, income, and air and water quality
  * How these outcomes are often a direct consequence of these voters’ disdain for government regulation and support for politicians who are committed to gutting public services
  * How the emotional force that truly animates popular support for conservatism is a desire on the part of white conservatives to uphold their honor, dignity, and perceived rightful place in the social hierarchy—especially in the face of a liberal Democratic Party that conservative Louisiananans feel is hostile to their way of life



### The Conservative Paradox

If we’re going to overcome the empathy wall between liberals and conservatives, we need to first explore what appears to be an inexplicable phenomenon of American politics: that **the most conservative, heavily Republican states in the country are enduring immense suffering—often as a result of the pro-business, anti-tax policies favored by the politicians who represent them.**

This is the central paradox of American politics. Why do economically disadvantaged whites—especially those living in states with poor health, education, and social mobility rankings—enthusiastically support a Republican Party that opposes economic policies (including paid family leave, environmental regulation, and universal healthcare) from which they would clearly benefit?

Particularly in the Deep South, arguably the ideological nerve center of American conservatism and far-right Tea Party activism, states and counties lag behind the rest of the country across nearly every measurement of human development. This seeming disregard for their own economic self-interest on the part of conservative Republican voters seems maddening and incomprehensible to many on the left.

#### Public Disinvestment

**The state of Louisiana, where we’ll focus our analysis, ranks near the very bottom of all 50 states across most quality-of-life measurements** , including life expectancy, health outcomes, median income, educational attainment, and pollution. Here, Republican politicians offer minimal public investments in services like healthcare, social insurance, and education, while keeping taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals low.

Meanwhile, their anti-regulatory agenda allows the powerful oil and petrochemical industries to pollute the state’s air and drinking water, leading to some of the nation’s highest cancer rates for residents. It would seem that if any state would stand to benefit from a more activist government committed to investments in public goods and one less friendly to business interests, it would be Louisiana. The paradox runs even deeper when you consider the fact that, for all of the state’s anti-federal rhetoric, it is in fact highly _dependent_ on federal largesse—with a full 44 percent of the state budget coming from Washington.

But this is clearly not how Louisianans see it, particularly those living around Lake Charles in the southwest corner of the state—the epicenter of the state’s sprawling extraction industry. **Since 1972, Louisiana has voted Republican in nine out of 12 presidential elections, and it gave President Donald Trump one of his largest margins in 2016.**

### Corporate Abuse

In Louisiana, the GOP’s electoral dominance has resulted in a business climate that enables polluters to operate with a free hand. Because of the state’s fiercely pro-business, anti-regulatory politics, the petrochemical industry knows that it has little to fear from state regulatory agencies or the pliant and cooperative state legislature.

Because of this, ordinary Louisianans (most of them loyal Republican voters) have suffered extraordinary abuse at the hands of a largely unregulated corporate sector, including:

  * Pollution and environmental degradation
  * Labor exploitation and hazardous working conditions
  * An alarming rate of pollution-related cancer diagnoses



#### Example #1: Environmental Degradation

**According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and environmental watchdog groups, Louisiana is one of the most polluted states in the country.** The state’s wetlands, for example, are in an extremely vulnerable condition. Since 1930, Louisiana has lost an area of its wetlands equal in size to the entire state of Delaware.

This can largely be attributed to the power and influence of the extraction industry, particularly the oil and petrochemical industries. These sectors are notorious for hazardous working conditions where employees are routinely exposed to potentially lethal chemicals. Companies are also known to dump industrial waste into the streams and bayous.

**The ravages of Louisiana’s largely unfettered extraction industry have destroyed an entire way of life.** Since before the area was even part of the United States, generations of Cajuns (French Creole-speaking people, descended from 18th-century Acadians deported from Canada by the British), had been able to make a living from the land and water. Even today, older residents recall the days when they were able to live a self-sufficient life, growing beans and vegetables on their land and catching fish, turtles, and frogs from the nearby bayous.

**But with the arrival of companies like Firestone and Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) in the years after World War II, industrial pollution poisoned the land and water.** Instead of aquatic wildlife, the bayous began to yield industrial waste and bits of rubber from the tire plants. Agriculture and husbandry became impossible when farm animals began to die after drinking the fouled water.

Republican politicians and their pro-business, laissez-faire ideology have given these polluting companies a free hand to poison the drinking water and destroy a once-thriving commercial fishing industry, all in the name of free enterprise. Rather than using the power of government to rein in the reckless and dangerous behavior of the private sector, Louisiana Republicans—and the large majority of voters who support them—instead castigate “Big Government” and “overregulation” as the source of the state’s problems.

#### Example #2: Worker Exploitation

**The petrochemical industry is also well-known for its ruthless exploitation of employees**. One longtime Louisiana petrochemical worker-turned-environmental activist named Lee Sherman recounts numerous industrial accidents in which he saw coworkers gruesomely maimed or killed.**** The company for which he worked offered minimal compensation to these workers or their families.

The exploitation went even further. Sherman was frequently tasked with illegally dumping barrels of chlorinated hydrocarbon into a marsh, which fed into the water supply for wildlife and nearby residents. After he became chronically ill from years of exposure to dangerous chemicals, Sherman was fired by the company for alleged “absenteeism”—but the real reason, according to Sherman, was their desire to avoid paying his mounting medical bills.

#### Example #3: Cancer Clusters

Beyond just the loss of fishing and agriculture, **Louisiana’s environmental degradation has also brought soaring rates of illness and death to state residents.**

A well-documented “cancer cluster,” Louisiana boasts the ignominious distinction of having America’s second-highest cancer rate for men, and the fifth-highest male death rate for cancer. One resident of Bayou D'Inde named Harold Areno (who lives downstream from where Lee Sherman dumped his barrels of chemicals) has seen his sisters, brother-in-law, mother, and neighbors all die of cancer in their forties and fifties (he and his wife are themselves cancer survivors).

Notably, no members of the family from earlier generations developed cancer. The wave of sickness and death began with the arrival of industry.

### Anti-Government Politics

As one of the most strongly Republican states in the country, **Louisiana offers a mix of low-tax, low-regulation, anti-government, and anti-labor policies designed to lure businesses from other parts of the country (and around the world) to the state.**

Right-wing politicians claim that these corporations bring much-needed tax revenue, investment, and jobs to the state. One such figure was Republican former Governor Bobby Jindal, who was elected in 2007 and re-elected in 2011, each time by large margins.

Jindal campaigned as an explicitly anti-environment candidate, promising to slash the state’s already meager environmental regulations in order to entice more extraction industry firms to Louisiana. A centerpiece of his administration was a $1.6 billion “incentive” package for industry, consisting of massive tax cuts and direct public subsidies to companies. Unfortunately, Jindal’s showering of state largesse on corporations diverted resources from the state’s health and education systems, resulting in the layoff of 30,000 nurses, teachers, and safety inspectors, among other public servants.

#### A Race to the Bottom

**Jindal’s “race-to-the-bottom” approach to economic development, however, may prove to be nothing more than a massive giveaway of public resources to wealthy corporations, for scant returns in long-term growth.**

One major study funded in large part by energy industry giant Sasol made the case that towns like those of southwest Louisiana needed to _increase_ public investment in order to attract valuable, permanent white-collar engineering and chemistry jobs to the region.

The study argued that college-educated professionals want to live in places with high-quality public services like schools, hospitals, museums, and strong environmental protection—even if they have to pay higher taxes in order to live in such places. The private sector and public sector are not in competition. It’s more of a symbiotic relationship, and the private sector needs a robust public sector.

#### The Jobs Myth

**Conservative Louisiana politicians argue that the environmental degradation is a necessary price to pay for the jobs that the petrochemical companies bring to the state.** If the federal government were to crack down and pass more aggressive anti-pollution regulations, they claim, the companies would desert the state and leave hardworking Louisianans jobless.

This was the rationale behind Jindal’s pro-corporate agenda. It would also have the added benefit of keeping “Big Government” away from Louisiana. After all, if billions of dollars in new corporate investment were set to pour into the state, there would surely be no need for Washington, D.C. and its overspending ways.

But the numbers cast doubt on this approach and raise the possibility that the jobs vs. environment tradeoff is a myth. For all the rhetoric about oil jobs and investments, the industry only accounts for approximately 10 percent of all jobs statewide. As a result of automation, oil and petrochemical companies simply don’t require as many workers as they once did. One Oxford University study from 2013 shows that fully 91 percent of petroleum technician jobs are vulnerable to automation, a trend widely seen across the broader manufacturing industry.

The job-creation pattern in the extraction industry is often marked by an initial influx of construction jobs to build the plants (which are often filled by low-wage migrant workers), followed by a relative handful of permanent jobs once the project is complete. Often, these permanent jobs are for highly skilled engineers and technicians, not blue-collar workers.

#### Leaking Out, Not Trickling Down

**A common right-wing claim is that low taxes on corporations will lead to a trickle-down effect** , in which bigger corporate profits are shared throughout the economy in the form of dividends, jobs, higher wages, and increased state tax revenue.

But this appears to be another myth. Taxes on oil company revenues have failed to fill the state’s coffers, belying the promises of politicians like Jindal that their generous tax subsidies for these companies would pay for themselves. In reality, taxes on oil companies only account for 14 percent of state revenue.

Because the industry is dominated by a handful of international companies (who invest their revenues overseas) and migrant workers (who remit their wages to families in their home countries), very little of the money generated through petrochemicals actually finds its way into Louisiana’s economy.

**Instead of trickling down, Louisiana’s oil wealth leaks out. Louisianans get the pollution, but not the profits.**

### Regulation, Hierarchy, and Honor

It might seem baffling why Louisiana voters would keep electing politicians who allow oil companies to poison their air and drinking water, expose them to lethal chemicals, and wreak havoc on their state’s budget and social services.

**But if we’re going to overcome the empathy wall, we need to delve deeper and understand the deeper story behind _why_ these voters believe what they do. **The ire that conservative Louisiana politicians and voters reserve for regulation and “Big Government” is about more than fiscal policy and spending priorities.

**The emotional force that truly animates support for conservatism is a desire on the part of white conservatives to uphold their honor, dignity, and perceived rightful place in the social hierarchy.** Even though they would likely benefit from the more pro-worker, pro-regulation policies favored by the Democratic Party, conservative Louisiana voters feel culturally alienated from it.

Hochschild interviews voters in southwestern Louisiana who share their resentment toward urban, secular liberals who they believe sneer and look down upon rural conservatives like themselves as racist, sexist, Bible-thumping, bigoted reactionaries. For them, liberal values are an affront to their honor and dignity—and they believe that the Republican Party, for all its faults, better represents _their_ values.

#### Maintaining the Hierarchy

**In conservative states like Louisiana, pursuits and cultural totems associated with a certain form of white male masculinity are indeed lightly regulated.**

Highly individualistic, risk-taking behavior receives a light regulatory touch. Thus, state laws regarding the consumption and sale of liquor (even open containers in vehicles), the ownership of firearms, and the wearing of motorcycle helmets are indeed quite lax. For many Louisiana white men, being able to drink, own as many guns as you want, and ride your motorcycle without a helmet speak to the heart of what it means to be a man. They are near-sacred privileges and birthrights and any perceived infringement upon them represents a deep affront to their masculinity, pride, and honor.

While the white conservatives who champion these policies claim to be doing so in the name of freedom, it is a very specific _type_ of freedom they have in mind. It is freedom _to_ rather than freedom _from_. Louisianans may be free _to_ buy and openly carry firearms or not wear seatbelts. But they are not free _from_ environmental catastrophe, poverty, and poor health.

**On the other hand, Louisiana employs some of the nation’s most heavy-handed and harsh regulation when it comes to the rights and prerogatives of women and minorities.** For example, the state has some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country, with access to abortion practically unavailable for poor women (who are disproportionately Black). The state also incarcerates a larger share of its population than any other state—and those prisoners are also disproportionately Black.

#### Against “Big Government”

When we look at these deeper underlying attitudes, blue-collar conservative voting behavior begins to make more sense.

Despite Lee Sherman’s ordeal (which we discussed earlier in the chapter) and his outrage at his treatment by the petrochemical industry, he remains a living embodiment of the conservative paradox. **Although he is a direct victim of the unregulated capitalism that he so vehemently champions, he refuses to see himself or his life story in such terms.**

Instead, he is an ardent Tea Party supporter who canvasses for right-wing Republican politicians and rails against high taxes and a Democratic Party that he believes exists to steal his hard-earned money and give it to the undeserving and lazy poor.

#### Traditional Values and Political Loyalty

Like Lee Sherman, Harold Areno (who, as we saw, has witnessed nearly his entire family succumb to pollution-related cancer) remains trapped in the conservative paradox. While he dislikes big business and laments the loss of the natural environment and the old Cajun way of life at the hands of the petrochemical industry, he insists that he is grateful for the jobs and economic opportunity that these companies bring.

He and his wife say that **their faith in God and their belief in traditional family values are most important to them—and that their commitment to _these_ values is what cements their loyalty to the Republican Party.**

Instead of big business, Areno sees the federal government as the far bigger threat to his way of life. To him, liberal politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton represent a direct affront to his values, representing urban elites, secular ideals, and abortion on demand. For Areno, “Big Government” is not, and can never be, the solution. God—and only God—is the source of salvation.
