## Exercise: Find the Message for Your Story

One of the biggest lessons of _Unleash the Power of Storytelling_ is that a story provides you with a powerful way to convey a message. But before you can choose the right story, you’ll need to figure out the message you want to share.

* * *

Most of us are great at talking about ourselves. So to practice, think about the message you’d like listeners to come away with the next time you introduce yourself—a message about who you are or why you do what you do. Write that message down here.

Now try to think of that message in terms of a story. Think of yourself as a character: What is your goal? What are the obstacles that you encounter when trying to reach that goal? Write down your goals and obstacles here.

Think about what your listener might find relatable about you as a character. Which of your values are universal, or what situation do you find yourself in that others have also experienced? (The things you have in common with your listener are things you’ll want to emphasize when you create your story.)
