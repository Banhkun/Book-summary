## Exercise: Examine Your Assumptions

Each of us approaches life with an assumption of a basic set of rules—a set of standards and operating principles that govern our behavior. We may think of these as “the” rules but in reality they are really only “our” rules.

* * *

Think of the last time you felt “wronged” by feedback (maybe your boss told you you were too passive or your partner told you you weren’t considerate). What set of rules—values, assumptions, and habits of behavior—did he or she base this feedback on?

What rules of your own did this feedback refer to? (For example, what habits of behavior did it object to? What priorities or assumptions of value did it speak of?—Do you believe if your partner’s family is coming over, it’s _her_ job to prepare the house?)

Examine the two sets of rules between you. Instead of seeing how the other person is wrong, ask yourself why she abides by those particular rules or values. Look for why you two are different, instead of why you are right.

Now think through how you might have responded differently than you did during that conversation. How could you have made her aware of your differing assumptions underpinning her feedback? How could you have used that as a stepping stone to a resolution?
