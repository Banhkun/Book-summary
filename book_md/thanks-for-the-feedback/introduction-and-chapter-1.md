## Introduction and Chapter 1: Feedback Overview

Feedback is any information you receive about yourself. It’s how you’re ranked, thanked, described, and advised. It can be formal or informal, direct or implicit: performance reviews or restaurant reviews, a second purchase from a new client, or the way a friend quietly doesn’t finish the appetizer you brought.

Feedback can be difficult to hear because it lives at the intersection of two basic human needs: our yearning for acceptance and our desire to learn. There’s a tension inherent between these two drives. We want to learn about ourselves so we can improve, but we also want to be accepted for who we are. Managing that tension well is the key to accepting feedback properly.

In _Thanks For the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen, two of the co-authors of the bestseller _Difficult Conversations_ , walk you through how to become a better receiver of feedback, examining what feedback is and how it works, how we typically react, triggers that cause us to react badly, and specific techniques you can use to successfully discuss feedback and then incorporate it into your life. (Shortform note: to learn how to master hard conversations at work and at home, read our summary of Difficult Conversations.)

### Why Feedback Matters

Those who do well are rewarded well, and people do well only through conscious and purposeful effort. **A person’s ability to succeed depends in large part on her ability to seek, understand, and incorporate feedback into her life.** This is true on an individual level as well as an organizational level, and in both professional and personal life.

Professionally, individuals who actively seek out feedback have higher job satisfaction, performance ratings, and creativity, and are better able to adapt to new systems and roles. Organizations that foster a culture open to feedback develop talent better, have lower turnover and better morale, and are better able to coordinate their teams to solve problems.

On a personal level, people willing to closely examine their lives have happier, longer-lasting relationships. Conversely, being resistant to feedback has steep costs. If transaction costs involved in addressing even simple problems seem high, others are discouraged from being open and honest. Left unaddressed, problems fester and escalate. Other people start to avoid and ultimately isolate a person resistant to feedback.

### The Problem With Traditional Feedback Training

“Push” is the process of giving feedback; “pull” is the process of receiving it, and very often there’s a disconnect between the two. When we _receive_ feedback, we feel the giver isn’t good at giving it, or we feel the feedback is unfair or untrue. But when we _give_ feedback, we feel the receiver isn’t good at taking it. We feel our honesty is rarely appreciated, and that the person we are trying to coach often reacts by getting upset or defensive.

**When organizations try to improve their feedback systems to address this disconnect, they often invest in feedback training that focuses on how to _give_ feedback more effectively: the push. A better approach is to focus on how to _receive_ it better: the pull.** In any feedback transaction, it is the receiver who controls whether or not any given piece of feedback is understood, accepted, and adopted. Therefore, focusing on the giver doesn’t get at the root of the problem. When we properly master pull, we can manage our resistance to feedback and find insight even in feedback that feels wrong, enhancing our ability to learn and improve ourselves.

### How to Classify Feedback

Before you can become a better receiver of feedback, you need to understand the three types of feedback:

  * Evaluation: Here’s where you stand.
  * Coaching: You could fix this part.
  * Appreciation: Great job!



#### Evaluation

Evaluation is assessment. It accomplishes a number of things:

  * **It tells you where you stand,** how you rank, or how you are doing in relation to expectations and to other people. Report cards, performance reviews, medals, and even nicknames are all evaluations.
  * **It aligns expectations** between two people. Your performance review lets you know what your manager wants from you.
  * **It clarifies consequences**. Your rating determines your bonus.
  * **It guides decision making**. We decide whether or not to apply for the new position based on our understanding of how much our managers currently value us.



#### Coaching

Coaching is advice. **It is aimed at helping you improve, learn, grow, or change, either to meet new challenges or to correct an existing problem.** It helps you focus your time and energy where it matters, maintain strong relationships, and keep your efforts productive.

#### Appreciation

Appreciation is recognition and thanks. **It lets you know that your efforts are noticed,** making you feel worthwhile. It taps into our primitive need for acceptance. It can be motivating; the anticipation of being appreciated can encourage a person to put in extra effort. It can also be very personal; some people will look for appreciation from a formal recognition program while others will feel more valued after a good word from a mentor.

#### Feedback Types Should Be Separated

Feedback is often more effective when each of the three strands is offered separately. Offered together, one type can drown out another. If you receive evaluation along with coaching, you might get caught up processing the assessment and are less able to properly digest the advice. If you receive appreciation, it can feel tempered if it is partnered with coaching.

In general, evaluation feedback should come before either coaching or appreciation. **Before a person can accept coaching or appreciation feedback, she needs to know where she stands. Knowing where she stands puts all other feedback into context.** In the absence of clear evaluation, we try to use signals from coaching feedback or appreciation to determine where we stand.

For example, if your manager is giving you a lot of coaching, you might assume your standing is weak, but that may not be the case. If she gives thanks for a recent project you may deduce that your standing is strong, but that may also not be the case overall. Or you might be thanked for this project, but not for that one, and may then infer that your standing has lessened.

#### Be Purposeful About Which Type You Need

When seeking feedback, be clear about whether you are looking for advice, assessment, or appreciation. This will prevent you from getting frustrated or discouraged if you receive the wrong type. Sometimes your emotional responses to feedback are a reaction to a mismatch between which type of feedback you are expecting and which type you actually receive.

For example, if you are looking for encouragement on a project, but instead you get a list of things you did wrong (coaching instead of appreciation), or you are looking for specific ways to improve a project, but you get a vague “Not quite there yet” (evaluation instead of coaching), you are unlikely to be either happy or clear on what to do next.

#### Accept That Feedback Isn’t Objective

Regardless of which type of feedback you're receiving, and no matter how objective a giver of feedback tries to be, there is always, inherent in any feedback, an element of judgment and interpretation. But as much as we may value objectivity and strive for it when giving feedback, total objectivity is not actually the goal.

Proper judgments and interpretations are what moves us forward towards improvement. People who are skilled at giving feedback are valuable precisely because their judgments are sound.

**The goal of understanding feedback is not to eliminate judgments but to understand them so that you can discuss them:** Why is _this_ more important, why was _that_ excluded? Is coming in just above projections good, or should you have greatly exceeded it?

### Our Instinctive Reactions to Feedback

The primary difficulty in receiving feedback is that it tends to trigger emotional responses that cloud our judgment and prevent us from properly comprehending the feedback. Different people react to feedback with different degrees of sensitivity. Some people can take negative feedback, absorb it, be upset by it, and then bounce back to their typical sunny dispositions. Other people are floored by negative feedback and find it hard to bounce back at all.

Your individual reaction to feedback involves three variables:

  1. Your baseline: your default emotional state
  2. Your swing: the amount you move off your baseline when you receive feedback
  3. Your recovery: the duration of your reaction



The combination of these three variables together makes up your temperament.

#### Your Baseline

Though you are emotionally affected by individual events, these emotional adjustments happen against a more stable backdrop of your general state of mind: your baseline. Once the initial rush of an event has passed—the thrill of landing your first job or the sadness you felt when your dog died—you return to your general baseline. Each person has her own individual baseline and these can vary enormously. One person might seem perpetually grumpy while another seems inexplicably upbeat.

Your baseline affects how you receive feedback. People with happier baselines respond to positive feedback more strongly than do people with less-rosy baselines. People with lower overall satisfaction respond more strongly to negative feedback than do their rosier counterparts.

#### Your Swing

Some people will swing farther from their baselines than others in response to feedback; some stay within a relatively narrow emotional band while others react more strongly in either direction—positive and negative.

But whether or not we are highly sensitive or fairly even-keeled, “bad” typically registers more strongly than “good.” We respond faster and stronger to threats than we do to pleasures. This explains why we often focus on the one negative remark that’s sandwiched between ten positive comments.

#### Your Recovery

The final variable is the duration of your emotional swing is how long it takes you to return to your baseline. Again, there is a lot of individual variability. Some people recover quickly to even the most distressing feedback, while others might still be feeling the sting months later. Likewise, some people can maintain the glow of a positive review for the rest of the day, while for others, it fades within minutes.

Our recovery tendencies can affect the strength of our swings and vice versa, creating both virtuous and vicious cycles. Those who hold on to their positive feelings after a boost can find it easier to later ride out a bump. Those who have trouble recovering from a setback often have a weaker subsequent response to positive feedback.

#### Beyond Wiring

Innate wiring has a significant influence on how a person reacts to feedback. MRIs and other imaging technologies reveal different brain responses when different people react to stresses. People who bounce back quickly often have more neurological pathways in their emotional-regulation areas. People who hang onto their positive feelings have stronger releases of dopamine, the brain chemical of pleasure.

However, we do not operate completely at the whims of our brain chemistry. How we think about and interpret feedback can have an equally strong influence on our reactions.

The stories we tell ourselves about feedback are how we interpret what it means: what it says about who we are, how others think about us, and what’s going to happen to us because of it. **Our negative emotions can distort and exaggerate these stories: how we remember the past, think about the present, and imagine the future.**

  * **The past:** We remember every time we’ve similarly failed in the past. 
  * **The present:** We inflate the feedback’s reach. We hear, “Your co-worker has brought up this issue,” and we think, “Everyone on my team hates me.”
  * **The future:** We exaggerate the potential consequences of feedback, and believe that the emotion we feel at this present moment is going to stick around forever. “I messed up the pitch; I’ll never be successful. I will forever feel humiliated.”



To counter these distortions you need to understand the triggers that produce the emotions behind them.

### Three Triggers

“Triggers” are instinctive and usually negative knee-jerk emotional responses that cause us to dismiss feedback or get angry at it. Triggers make it hard to properly filter feedback, **causing us to discard feedback that could help us, or conversely, incorporate feedback that is best ignored.** Triggers fall into three general categories:

  1. **Truth triggers** are our emotional responses to feedback we feel is wrong, unhelpful, or unfair.
  2. **Relationship triggers** are our emotional responses to the person giving the feedback more than the content of the feedback itself.
  3. **Identity triggers** happen when feedback threatens our sense of who we are.



Understanding our triggers can help us locate the source of our resistance and better manage our reactions. We’ll explore these triggers in depth over the next chapters.
