## Exercise: Identify Switchtracking

In switchtracking, a conversation splits and starts following two entirely different tracks. One person offers feedback and the other person responds with reciprocal feedback, usually more aimed at the other person personally rather than the issue. The conversation then follows two paths and the people involved often don’t realize it.

* * *

Think back to your last argument. Try to remember any switchtracking that went on. Did you respond to the other person’s input with a different topic? Did that person do it to you?

What happened after it split into two tracks? Did you realize consciously that you were discussing two different topics? How did you address them each, or not?

How did you resolve the issue that had originally been brought up? If you didn’t resolve it, why not?
