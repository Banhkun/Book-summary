## Exercise: Discuss Your System Thoroughly

When rolling out a new performance evaluation system, you should promote its benefits but also address its tradeoffs. Address five points:

  1. The goals of the system
  2. The reason this system was chosen over others
  3. The potential costs as well as benefits
  4. The consequences of half-hearted participation
  5. An invitation for further discussion and feedback



* * *

Examine the five points listed above and think through how you might explain your particular system to your employees. What are the goals of your system?

Why was this system chosen over others?

What are the system’s benefits? What are its potential drawbacks?

What happens if employees don’t fully engage with the system?

How can employees reach out to you with feedback or suggestions? What are your policies regarding this? How quickly will you respond?
