## Chapter 3: What Are Genes?

(Shortform note: As you read, it’s worth keeping in mind that evolution, genes, and so forth aren’t conscious entities and therefore can’t “seek” or “want” anything. A gene doesn’t _want_ to replicate itself, nor does it actively look for the most efficient way to do so. Replicating is just what genes do.)

In this chapter, we’ll explore what genes are, how they’re formed, how they reproduce, and why all of that has such an impact on how organisms behave.

### Genes: The Basics

**To start at a basic level, the replicator that all complex life forms host is DNA.** DNA is a _nucleic acid_ , a polymer made up of many molecules called nucleotides. There are only four types of nucleotides in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Those nucleotides are identical no matter what kind of creature has them: You’ve got the same four nucleotides as your pet cat, or the birds outside. The only difference between different species is how those nucleotides are arranged. To a much lesser extent, they are also arranged differently between different people (except for identical twins).

Those nucleotides are then organized into genes. The genes are like blueprints for proteins, which are used for everything from creating tissue to regulating chemical processes. It’s a complex process to go from nucleotide to protein, but in simple terms, DNA is like a building plan for a living creature.

Whether a gene survives depends on whether the organism it helped create is able to survive and reproduce. How quickly “bad” genes die out depends on how strong the selection is—that is, how much of a disadvantage that gene will be.

In relatively safe environments, even disadvantageous genes can persist for many generations. For example, genes for albinism in humans have survived because, while they can cause serious health problems, the people carrying them don’t die in our current environment.

There are a number of factors that affect how long a given gene lasts, even if the creature does successfully reproduce. These are detailed in the next subsection. Theoretically, a gene could replicate itself through countless generations and “survive” indefinitely.

**In short, it could be said that genes are responsible for their own reproductive success.** Going one step further, it could be argued that replication is the very purpose of genes, dating back to those first primordial replicators.

### The “Paradox” of Sexual Reproduction

**If genes truly exist to replicate themselves, it would seem like sexual reproduction isn’t the best way to do it.** Sexual reproduction takes a great deal of time and resources and, most significantly, only allows each parent to pass on half of their genes. This apparent paradox leads many people back to the group-focused idea of evolution, wherein the good of the species is the ultimate goal.

However, if there are individual genes that do well in an environment of sexual reproduction (such as genes for qualities that help attract mates), that in itself could explain why sex exists and resolve the paradox. Therefore, from the viewpoint of a selfish gene, sexual reproduction may make sense after all.

Furthermore, **the diversity gained from sexual reproduction is favorable enough that it has become prominent in nature.** Remember the primordial atoms, randomly bumping into each other and combining until one molecule happened to be more successful than the others? This demonstrates that the more diversity there is, the more chances there are that something will succeed.

During sexual reproduction, chromosomes (collections of genes) can swap parts with each other to give rise to new combinations of genes, different from anything found in the parent. This is called _crossing over_. This process means that a sperm or egg cell contains a mosaic of that creature’s parents’ genes, rather than just direct copies of their chromosomes. Crossing over is a key method of increasing diversity in a population.

#### The Impact of Mutations

**The other main mechanism for diversity is _mutation_ , which can happen in various ways. _Point mutation_** is when a single nucleotide is swapped for another due to a replication error. _Inversion_ is when a piece of a gene detaches, becomes completely flipped around, and reattaches backwards. Sometimes, though rarely, it can even reattach in a completely different place.

Many mutations have no effect or are harmless, but some are devastating. For example, cystic fibrosis in humans is the result of a mutation. Sometimes, by pure chance, a mutation will be beneficial. For example, perhaps a muscle gets changed in a way that makes it slightly stronger or more efficient. Those mutations tend to pass themselves on and become part of the gene pool.

Smaller genes have fewer nucleotides, and therefore fewer chances to mutate. Since genes that mutate are no longer the same genes, it could be said that smaller genes have an evolutionary advantage over large ones—that is, they will survive through more generations.

### The Complications of Modern Genetics

**Sexual reproduction is complicated for many reasons, not least because it, too, seems to contradict the selfish gene theory.**

Some people believe that a gene-centric view of evolution is misguided because it’s the individuals—and all the thousands of genes they contain—that live or die, not the genes themselves. These people argue that biology should be examined at the individual level, not the gene level.

It’s true that, unlike primordial replicators, genes no longer succeed or fail on their own. An organism has thousands of genes contributing to its genetic makeup. Those genes overlap and interact in such complex ways that it would seem more reasonable to refer to them as a collective, like a gene network or something along those lines—in other words, an individual organism.

In fact, that _would_ make sense for everything except sexual reproduction, which gives rise to distinctly different organisms. However, while sexual reproduction rearranges genes, it doesn’t normally change them (there are a couple of exceptions to this, which we’ll get to shortly). Therefore, it’s an effective way for individual genes to survive through multiple generations.

Further complicating the process, at least in humans, is the fact that we have two versions of each gene. Human genes are arranged into 23 chromosomes, but we have two copies of each chromosome—one from each parent (except for X and Y chromosomes in males).

While each gene from each parent codes for the same type of trait, like eye color, the trait itself may be different, such as having brown vs. blue eyes. Different versions of genes that code for the same type of trait are called _alleles_. Conflicting alleles may result in one being dominant over the other, or in both being expressed to some extent in the organism.

**All of these apparent complications can be resolved with a simple comparison: Just as a successful sports team needs to be made of strong players, a successful individual needs to be made of strong genes:** genes that enable that creature to survive and reproduce.

### Altruism and Selfishness at the Genetic Level

**At the genetic level, altruism must be bad and selfishness must be good.** Alleles (different versions of the same gene, such as for blue vs. brown eyes) are in direct competition with each other. Therefore, by definition, alleles that succeed at the expense of others will tend to survive.

However, when it comes to genes that are not alleles to one another, the way they interact is extremely complicated. For example, there’s no single gene for “long legs.” Rather, there are many, and each of them has some sort of influence on leg length. In an environment where long legs are beneficial, all of the alleles which contribute to that trait will be favored by natural selection.

This isn’t an absolute truth—favorable alleles can still fail if they’re in an organism with other disadvantages, or simply due to bad luck. However, in the long term, the frequency of a given gene in the population is (usually) directly proportional to how beneficial that gene is—that’s how evolution works.

**There are very few genetic qualities that are _objectively_ good or bad. **For example, an herbivore with a gene for sharp, pointed teeth would be at a disadvantage, since such teeth aren’t as effective at tearing and grinding plant matter. A carnivore with that same gene would be much more successful. Most advantages and disadvantages are environmental. For a gene, the environment is other genes—such as what kind of animal a gene for sharp teeth is in.

Keep all of this in mind when considering altruistic or selfish behaviors in an individual. **The ultimate question is what effect those behaviors will have, in the long term, on the frequencies of certain genes in the population.**
