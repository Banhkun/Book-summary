## Chapter 13: The Far-Reaching Effects of Genes

This chapter is a bit of a smorgasbord—it talks briefly about several different topics that didn’t fit anywhere else in _The Selfish Gene_. First, it discusses the impact that genes have not only on the creatures they inhabit, but also on the world around them. Then it discusses a strange quirk of reproduction: How most organisms begin as single cells, and why that fact is important—possibly necessary—for stability and evolution.

So far we have discussed biology and behavior in terms of genes; but, of course, **there is a difference between a gene and an organism.** Most biologists make the mistake of focusing their questions and their studies on the organismal level: They ask why an _organism_ does something, or behaves a certain way.

In fact, it’s quite common for biologists to say that DNA and RNA are tools organisms use to replicate themselves—which, in light of what we’ve discussed so far, is the exact opposite of the truth. Organisms don’t replicate themselves at all (except in the relatively rare case of asexual reproduction). Given that the “purpose” of life is replication, it seems clear that **organisms are tools that _genes_ use to replicate themselves.**

Starting from the genetic level, one might ask why organisms as we know them should exist at all. (Shortform note: This key question is partially answered in Chapter 2.)

However, the simple truth is that organisms _don’t_ have to exist. They exist on Earth because that’s what evolution happened to favor in Earth’s particular environment. **The only thing that must exist in order for there to be life is some form of replicator molecule.**

It’s helpful to remember that, at the most basic level, we’re dealing with replicators that aren’t so different from those found in the primordial soup eons ago. The organisms that contain those replicators are simply vehicles doing all the things the replicators can’t: perceiving, eating, acting, and so on.

### An Extended Phenotype

To look at biology in a new way, starting from the genetic level, requires that we consider what might be called the _extended phenotype_. The usual definition of _phenotype_ is the effect that a particular gene has upon the body it’s housed in—for example, blue eyes or wrinkled peas. **However, phenotypes should really be considered in terms of the total effect they have on the world.**

It may be the case that a particular gene only impacts the body it’s in, but there’s no reason why that should be key to the definition of phenotype. Whatever effect genes have on physical characteristics is incidental—their real impact is on the chemical processes inside the body (remember that a gene’s true function is to act as a blueprint for a protein). Therefore, going one step further by talking about the effects of genes on the world around them is not as much of a stretch as it first seems.

Examples of phenotypes that extend beyond the bodies they’re in are bird nests and beaver dams. **Though it sounds odd to us, biologists should think in terms of genes “for” certain building materials and styles of nest, dam, and so on.** Genes that caused the organisms to build structures in those specific ways must have been selected for at some point, which is why those genes exist today. Therefore, a lake created by beaver dams should be considered a part of that phenotype as much as the beavers’ physical characteristics.

Some genes even influence _other_ living organisms, for better or worse. For example, there is a certain type of parasite that causes snails to grow unusually thick shells. While this thicker shell helps protect the snail (and therefore the parasite), it’s costly to make, and takes resources from the snail that it might otherwise have used to reproduce and pass on its genes. The parasite, of course, isn’t concerned with the snail’s reproduction, only its own. Therefore, causing its host to produce a thicker shell makes evolutionary sense.

However, if a “parasite’s” reproduction is aided by its host’s reproduction, as is the case in certain species of beetles, we could expect to see the relationship grow from parasitic to mutualistic or even symbiotic. **From a certain point of view, genes themselves could be seen as symbiotes with the body that contains them.**

As a side note, extended phenotypes and this idea of genes-as-parasites can also help establish once and for all why group selection isn’t a sound theory. Parasites only help their hosts when they reproduce by the same method—that is, helping the host reproduce also helps the parasite to reproduce. Animals in a group clearly do not have that kind of symbiosis; far from helping each other to reproduce, they often have to compete for the chance to do so.

Group selection, where some animals out-compete others for the good of the species, doesn’t make sense from the perspective of a selfish gene. For any given gene, there would always be the chance that it’s one of the ones that gets out-competed and eliminated from the gene pool. **Therefore, if the selfish gene theory is correct, group selection can’t be.**

However, even though group selection is a fatally flawed theory, it can’t be denied that extended phenotypes interact with and impact each other in countless ways.**** A great deal about the natural world can be explained in terms of selfish genes if extended phenotypes are taken into account.

### Cellular Bottlenecking

We’ll leave the topic of extended phenotypes for now, and consider an interesting quirk of reproduction. Basically, there are three key questions to consider when discussing how life evolved into the complex organisms we have today: Why did replicators group up into cells; why did cells group up into bodies; and why do bodies begin as single cells, with the purpose of creating more single-celled bodies? In other words, why is the life cycle bottlenecked down to a single cell at each end?

The first two questions have been addressed already. In short, complex organisms developed because that was the most stable strategy for their environments. The third question is related to the first two; clearly this bottlenecking strategy must be helpful, since it’s so ubiquitous.

**In fact, it could be argued that the genetic bottleneck is key to creating individual organisms as we know them.** For convenience’s sake, forget about sexual reproduction and all the genetic complications that come with it while considering this topic.

In an asexual species, any offspring should be exact clones of the parent, except for random mutations. If an organism did not reproduce by sending out single cells—for example, if it regrew from a broken piece of itself like many plants can—those individual mutated cells would be unlikely to have any impact on the offspring. Natural selection would be impossible under these circumstances, since it can only act when there’s diversity in the population. Furthermore, those mutated genes will now want to duplicate only themselves, rather than the entire organism they’re found in. In other words, the organism’s cells may end up competing against each other.

However, an organism that reproduces by sending out single-celled spores, for instance, would have that mutation copied in every cell of the new organism. **Natural selection and evolution would be possible in this case.** Also, since the cells within the organism all share the same genes, they’ll more readily cooperate with each other to make sure that organism survives and reproduces.

The orderly timeframes that are imposed by such a life cycle also make tight regulation of certain processes possible. It gives the organism clear phases of life, during which time-specific processes can happen. An organism that reproduces by breaking off and regrowing would not have such clear-cut life stages, which would make it difficult if not impossible for such processes to happen cleanly and efficiently. **The fact that an organism begins as a single cell, and develops as countless copies of that cell, may be the very reason why organisms exist as distinct individuals.**

#### From Gene to Ecosystem

In conclusion, let’s summarize the long path that life has taken, and why the gene should be considered the basis of all life. **The origin of life anywhere in the universe, no matter what form it takes, must be some sort of replicating molecule _._** That molecule will first be formed by chance, but then will copy itself indefinitely. On Earth, that molecule happens to be DNA, which arranges itself into genes.

The replication process isn’t perfect, and various mutations emerge. Some of these mutations end up being helpful, and the molecules possessing them replicate more effectively. Less effective replicators are eventually squeezed out of the population due to lack of resources.

Mutations build on top of mutations, and the vehicles that house these replicators become more and more complex. The effects of genes become more and more widespread, reaching beyond their vehicles to impact the world around them, and even other organisms. **Those countless extended phenotypes, which all originate with those ancient replicator molecules, create the living world as we know it.**
