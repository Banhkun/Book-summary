## Exercise: How Does the Protestant Ethic Show Up in Your Life?

According to Weber, the Protestant ethic gave rise to the lifestyle and moral beliefs of 20th-century capitalists. While that lifestyle has continued to change in the time since Weber wrote _The Protestant Ethic_ , its core features still show up throughout life today. Below, reflect and draw connections to your own experience.

According to Weber, part of the spirit of capitalism is adherence to a rigorous and systematic way of life. How does your own relationship to work and productivity relate to these ideas? (For instance, you might put a lot of effort into building good habits in order to be more efficient.)

Weber notes that to the early Protestants, idleness meant waste and sin because that time could be spent glorifying God instead of relaxing. Today, many people struggle to feel okay with time spent unproductively. On a usual day, how do you tend to feel about being unproductive?

If you struggle with taking downtime and being unproductive, it might help to know that it’s in part because you’ve inherited the echoes of a zealous, centuries-old religious doctrine. Knowing this, what specific action could you take to change how you relate to idle time? (For instance, you might remind yourself that rest is just as important as work, if you want a balanced life.)

Another major influence of the spirit of capitalism is our modern-day fixation on habits and systematic living. It’s easy to feel bad when we’re being less-than-perfect with our daily routines. However, people only started living like this in the last few hundred years. Knowing this, what specific mantra or reminder could you give yourself when you come up short with your habits? (For example, you might note that today, many of us build habits alone, while the Protestants had the pressure of an entire religious community to push them along.)
