## Exercise: Identify a Neutral Behavior

Sometimes, the idea of switching straight from a “bad” behavior to a “good” one can seem too difficult to achieve. Identifying a neutral behavior to practice instead can stop you from becoming overwhelmed.

* * *

Think of a bad habit that you’ve adopted. Describe the two behavioral extremes of this habit: the bad behavior you’re engaging in and its “good” alternative.

How confident do you feel about the idea of transitioning from this bad behavior to its positive alternative? Do you feel it's a change you could achieve with ease, or are you overwhelmed at the prospect of making such a big behavioral transition?

What’s a “neutral” behavior you could practice as you transition to your ideal behavior? (A neutral behavior is one that is neither harmful nor actively positive. Even if you already feel confident that you can switch to your ideal behavior immediately, it’s good to have a neutral behavior as a back-up if things get tough.)

Now that you’ve identified a neutral behavior, do you feel more confident in your ability to change your behavior and cut out your bad habit for good? Why or why not?
