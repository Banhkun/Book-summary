## Exercise: Communicate With Your Colleagues

Learn how to effectively communicate with your colleagues about the process of cutting out your bad habit.

* * *

When you start the process of changing your bad habits, it’s important to apologize to your colleagues for your previous bad behavior. Identify 3 to 5 colleagues who you think it’s particularly important for you to apologize to, and describe why you’ve chosen each colleague.

The next type of communication you need to have with your colleagues is announcing your intention to change. Describe how you plan to do this. (For instance, will you announce your intention to change in public meetings, or in private conversations with your coworkers?)

Your colleagues are more likely to believe that you’re going to change if you announce your intention to do so frequently and consistently. How will you make sure that you fulfill these criteria? (For example, you could set a weekly reminder to announce your intentions, or schedule a monthly meeting where you talk about your plans.)

As you make progress with your behavioral change, it’s important to follow up with your colleagues and ask them if they think you’ve improved. Likewise, you should request “feedforward”—advice on how you can improve even further in the future. List 3 colleagues who you think you could turn to for follow-up and feedforward, and explain why you’ve chosen these individuals.
