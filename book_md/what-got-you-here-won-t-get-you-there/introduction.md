## Introduction

Are you a professional who’s already seen a lot of success in your working life, but is struggling to progress any further? For instance, are you a middle manager who always seems to get passed over for promotion to the executive level? Are you a top executive who can’t seem to make the jump to becoming a CEO?

**Many people get stuck at a certain level of success**. This isn’t because of a lack of direction—lots of these professionals know exactly where they want to be. Likewise, it’s not because of a lack of self-esteem. Many successful people have excessive self-esteem and are arrogant. According to business coach and author Marshall Goldsmith, **the problem lies in successful people’s bad behavior**.

Goldsmith believes that as high-fliers chase and ultimately achieve success, they become so obsessed with gaining results and so convinced of their importance that **they slip into harmful behavioral habits**. In short, they start to treat other people badly. For instance, they become so focused on closing sales that they put extreme pressure on their team. They become so self-important that they refuse to listen to anyone else’s ideas and dismiss them outright.

Compounding this issue is the fact that **many people don’t even realize that their behavior is bad**. Instead, they see their flaws as the secrets to their success. For instance, they think that constantly interrupting people’s presentations is simply a way to give helpful feedback. Meanwhile, everyone else sees this behavior as rude and patronizing.

Ultimately, **to climb to the top of the corporate ladder, you need to have good people skills**. Executives and CEOs need to be able to lead and inspire people. They also need to be able to respectfully interact with their subordinates, important clients, and stakeholders. If you’re constantly irritating everyone with your bad behavior, your superiors won’t have confidence in your ability to fulfill these requirements. Therefore, you won’t get picked for these top-flight roles.

In _What Got You Here, Won't Get You There_ , Marshall Goldsmith explains how you can reach your full potential by eliminating harmful work behaviors. First, he explores the 21 bad habits that many professionals slip into and healthier alternatives to these problematic behaviors. Then, he discusses how to identify, overcome, and make amends for your bad habits. He argues that while engaging in these behaviors may not have stopped you from getting “here”—to your current level of success—they won’t get you “there”—to the heights of success that you ultimately aspire to.

(Shortform note: We’ve reordered and reorganized many of the book’s chapters to add coherency and avoid repetition. Likewise, we’ve split the 21 habits of successful people into five categories to clarify themes and make the habits easier to recall.)
