## Chapter 8: Discussing Your Behavioral Change With Your Colleagues

Once you’ve decided how you’re going to change your bad habit and kick-started the process of self-improvement, your next move is to frequently and repeatedly **discuss your behavioral change with your colleagues**. Specifically, you need to:

  1. Apologize for your past behavior.
  2. Announce your intention to change your bad habit.
  3. Follow up with your colleagues and request “feedforward” about how you can improve further in the future.



### Apologizing for Your Past Behavior

The first conversation you need to have with your colleagues regarding changing your bad habit is an **apology for your previous bad behavior**. Say you’re sorry to everyone who your actions negatively impacted.

Apologizing is an important step because it’s the easiest way to make clear to your colleagues that you know you’ve messed up and that you’re going to do better in the future. It shows them that you’re willing to take responsibility for your actions, and they’re likely to respect you for doing so.

Likewise, apologizing gives people closure about the bad behavior you’ve inflicted upon them. It indicates that this behavior is in the past now and won’t be repeated. Once people have closure, they can begin to move on—and they might even start to forgive you. You’ll have gained a small amount of ground in your mission to recover people’s goodwill and restore your reputation.

#### The Perfect Apology

When you say sorry to your colleagues for your past misdemeanors, it’s important that your apology be sincere and meaningful. The best way to achieve this is to **keep your apology simple**. Just say “I’m sorry. I’ll try to behave in a better way in the future.”

If you start to qualify or overcomplicate your apology—for example, if you try to justify why you acted in the way you did, or make a long speech about all of the events in your life that led up to you behaving badly—it’ll sound like you’re trying to explain away your behavior, not actually express regret and move on from it. Your apology will no longer feel sincere, and people will be less likely to accept it.

### Announcing Your Intention to Change

Once you’ve apologized to your colleagues, your next step is to **announce your intention to change**. Tell your colleagues exactly what you’re going to do to overcome your harmful habit and reassure them that you’re fully committed to doing so.

Crucially, you should announce your intention to change **frequently and consistently**. If you only tell your colleagues of your plan to overcome your habit once, there’s no guarantee that what you tell them will stick in their minds. However, if you tell your colleagues about your intention to change again and again, over days, weeks, or even months, the message is more likely to sink in.

Announcing your intention to change is important for two reasons. First, **it adds accountability to your journey of self-improvement**. If you tell your colleagues that you’re going to make a change, they’ll start to monitor your efforts to see if you actually follow up on your word. The knowledge that people are checking up on you and expecting you to make progress will add extra pressure to the process of changing. This pressure will motivate you to actually get started on improving your behavior.

Second, **frequently and consistently** **telling people you’re going to change further erodes their negative perceptions of you**. They’ll start to believe that you’re serious about making up for your past mistakes and really do intend to behave in a healthier way. Slowly, their perception of you will start to become more positive.

### Following Up and Requesting ‘Feedforward’

Once you’re a little way into the process of changing your bad habit, it’s time to instigate the next type of discussion with your colleagues: **following up and requesting “feedforward** ,” practical advice on what you can do to improve your behavior even further moving forward.

#### Following Up With Your Colleagues

Following up involves approaching your colleagues on a regular basis—say, once a month—to ask them how they think you’ve progressed in your attempts to change so far. For example, you could ask your colleagues the following question:

_“You might remember that last month, I made a commitment to make fewer harmful or hurtful comments to colleagues. In your opinion, how well am I doing in my efforts to change? Do you think I’ve made progress or not?”_

Following up with your colleagues has two major benefits. First, it gives you a way of measuring your progress so far. Based on your colleagues’ responses, you’ll be able to tell whether you’re heading in the right direction in terms of eradicating your bad behavior, or if you need to start putting a bit of extra effort into the process.

Second, following up helps to improve your colleagues’ opinions of you. By asking for their thoughts on your behavior, you’re demonstrating that you value their input. People are much more likely to think well of you if you make them feel valued and appreciated.

Likewise, following up with your coworkers gets them thinking about how much better your behavior has become—assuming it _has_ gotten better, of course—and helps to quash any lingering skepticism they may have about whether or not you can really change. Once your colleagues realize that you really _have_ improved upon your prior bad behavior, their opinion of you is likely to become more positive.

##### Following Up With Yourself

Goldsmith argues that as well as following up with your colleagues, it’s important to **follow up with yourself** —to constantly reflect on how _you_ think you’re doing with the process of change, possibly as frequently as daily. Doing this has two main benefits:

  1. It helps you to quickly identify if you’re slipping back into your bad habits, meaning you can swiftly take corrective action. 
  2. It helps you to track the small positive steps towards change you’re making each and every day. When you realize that you’re making this progress, you’ll be encouraged and motivated to continue to improve your behavior. 



If you think you’ll struggle to find the time to follow up with yourself or that you won’t be disciplined enough to regularly self-reflect, **enlist someone—someone who is supportive, and who you can easily get in contact with—to act as your** **self-reflection “coach.”** This “coach” could be a colleague, a manager, a friend, or even a family member. Their role is to contact you regularly—for example, Goldsmith’s coach calls him every day, but you could make it a once-or-twice a week meeting—and ask you how you think you’re doing with the process of changing your bad habit. This frequent questioning will force you to follow up with yourself and evaluate your progress.

#### ‘Feedforward’

At the same time as following up with your colleagues, you should ask them whether they have any “feedforward” for you. **“Feedforward” is practical advice on what you can do to improve your behavior even further moving forward.** It differs from feedback because while feedback focuses on identifying the mistakes of your past, feedforward considers how you can behave better in the future.

When soliciting feedforward, you should ask your colleagues to identify two actions they think you should take going forward to further tackle your bad habit. For example, you could say, “My bad habit is getting angry. While I’ve already improved a bit on this score, what are two things I can do in the future to avoid this behavior even more effectively?” The person’s response might be “First, use breathing exercises to remain calm in stressful situations. Second, leave situations that you feel are starting to aggravate you.”

**Goldsmith insists that you’re not allowed to respond to feedforward in any other way than simply saying “thank you.”** For instance, don’t pass judgment on how good the person’s ideas are, or argue with their suggestions for improvement if you think they’re bad. As you’ve already learned, responding in such ways are bad habits in themselves! Just show gratitude for your colleague’s input, note down the ideas they’ve given you, and move on.

##### The Benefits of Soliciting Feedforward

Soliciting feedforward has two main benefits. First, **it gives you access to the knowledge of your colleagues** : people who are probably full of good ideas on how you can further improve your bad behavior, but who won’t share these ideas unless they’re directly prompted to do so. They may worry that giving unsolicited advice, especially on such a sensitive topic as bad behavior, will come across as rude, arrogant, or uncalled for. Therefore, they’ll keep this useful advice to themselves unless you directly request it. Asking for feedforward gives your colleagues the opportunity to express their ideas in a socially acceptable way, thus giving you access to their insight.

Second, requesting feedforward forces you to**stop thinking about the past and instead focus your efforts on building a better future**. When you realize that you’ve been engaging in a bad habit and harming other people, it’s easy to spend a lot of time ruminating on the hurt you’ve caused and dissecting every mistake you made. However, this way of thinking isn’t that helpful in the long run. It won’t help you to figure out a positive path forward—it’ll just make you dislike yourself and your past actions. Meanwhile, feedforward encourages you to put the past behind you and instead implement people’s ideas about how you can improve in the future. It’s all about becoming a better person, not punishing yourself for who you were in the past.
