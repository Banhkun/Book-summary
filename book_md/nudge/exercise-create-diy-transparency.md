## Exercise: Create DIY Transparency

Bring transparency to your personal finances by carefully examining your current financial tools and comparing them with alternative options.

* * *

Do you have a credit card? More than one? List the number of credit cards you have and the amounts owed on each. (If you don’t have a credit card, you might list any other revolving debt obligations you have.)

Do you know the interest rates on each of your cards? If so, list them; if not, look them up and then list them. Also list any perks or special features of your cards.

Now take stock. Which of your cards offers the lowest rate? Is your debt ideally allocated (in other words, do you have too much debt on a high-interest card?) If you only have one card, spend some time researching alternative cards—are alternative companies offering better rates?

Reflect on transparency programs. Are there other ways credit card companies could improve their choice design or help anticipate delayed outcomes?
