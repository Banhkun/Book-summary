## Technique 1: Offer Defaults

The first of the four choice design techniques we’ll examine in detail is Thaler and Sunstein’s most versatile nudge: the _default_ —that is, **the choice that’s automatically made if the chooser does nothing**.

The theory underlying this style of nudge is people’s innate _status quo bias_. Thaler and Sunstein apply the default nudge to a number of areas, including **retirement saving, investment choices, and organ donations,** each of which is detailed below.

(Shortform note: While Thaler and Sunstein advocate using the default choice technique to nudge people toward their best interests, it can also be used to get people to act _against_ their interests and in favor of “nudgers.” For example, in the 2020 US presidential election, both parties came under fire for using an auto-checked box on online donation forms authorizing weekly recurring donations—which many donors failed to notice until they’d committed thousands of dollars.)

### Using Defaults to Improve Saving

Thaler and Sunstein note the troubling economic trend among Americans of declining savings. In 2005 (when _Nudge_ was written), thanks to abundant, cheap credit and low interest rates, Americans spent more, and **the savings rate was actually _negative_ for the first time since the Great Depression**. (Shortform note: Since then, Americans’ savings habits have improved considerably. Whereas in 2005 Americans saved at a rate of around 0% of disposable income, in 2021, they were saving at rates above 10%.)

Thaler and Sunstein contend that given the ever-growing strains on the Social Security system, Americans will need to save more _themselves_ to enjoy a comfortable retirement. But how do you get people to save more without infringing on the principles of economic liberty?

The authors recommend automatically enrolling employees in a retirement plan—that is, **making enrollment the default** —and offering an option to _opt out_ of the plan. They posit that due to people’s status quo bias and tendency toward inertia, **most of these employees won’t bother to disenroll** , thereby ensuring those employees at least _some_ personal retirement savings.

Research has shown this method to work. One study found that, under an opt-in approach—meaning employees have to _choose_ to enroll in their 401(k)—participation in a particular retirement plan was 20% three months after hire, growing to 65% within 36 months. **When the plan adopted automatic enrollment,new-employee enrollment jumped to 90% and grew to 96% within 36 months**.

(Shortform note: Some researchers have disputed the efficacy of auto-enrollment in retirement plans, finding that, in some cases, the retirement savings generated by auto-enrollment were offset by a rise in personal debt. The explanation for this finding could be that the auto-enrolled workers, because they felt like they had a safety net for the future, **thought they could spend more in the present**. Alternatively, they may have continued to spend as they always had even though they had less ready cash available to spend.)

#### Automatic Saving Programs

According to Thaler and Sunstein, auto-enrollment solves the problem of getting workers to begin saving for retirement. What it _doesn’t_ do, however, **is nudge workers to increase their retirement contributions as they move up the pay ladder**. (For example, a default initial enrollment contribution might be 2% of a worker’s income. Ideally that percentage will rise as a worker’s pay increases.) Again, workers generally don’t proactively increase their percentage contribution because of their **status quo bias and inertia**.

(Shortform note: Of course, as a worker’s salary increases, so too does the dollar amount of the 2% contribution. For example, if a worker is granted a raise from $100,000 to $110,000 and keeps her contribution at 2%, the contribution increases from $2,000 to $2,200.)

To address this, Thaler and Sunstein propose that employers ask people to commit to automatically increasing their contribution percentages when they first sign up for their retirement savings programs. In this way, the status quo bias and inertia can work in employees’ favor, making automatic increases tied to pay increases the default setting.

In the pilot implementation of such a program in 1998, researchers found that a large majority—nearly 80%—of employees who were resistant to increasing their savings rate immediately were amenable to the automatic increase option. As it turned out**, the workers who opted into the program ended up saving the _most_ among their colleagues; **and when they maxed out their allowable contribution under the terms of the plan, they simply left their contribution at that maximum rate.

> The specific program the authors reference is called the Save More Tomorrow program and was developed by Thaler in collaboration with another economist, Shlomo Benartzi. In 2018, Benartzi estimated that almost $30 billion had been added to Americans’ retirement accounts thanks to auto-enrollment and Save More Tomorrow programs.
> 
> **But he also acknowledged that more programs are needed to reach more people**. The Save More Tomorrow program is designed for workers with access to traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. However, gig workers such as Uber drivers or TaskRabbit contractors need other kinds of nudges to start saving. Benartzi has proposed encouraging people to save on a**_daily_ basis __ rather than _monthly_ or _annually_ , as it might seem less daunting to put aside smaller amounts at a time**.

### Using Defaults to Improve Investment Choices

Thaler and Sunstein note that not long ago, the most common retirement plan offered by employers was a “defined benefit” plan—that is, **one that made fixed payments to the beneficiary based on tenure and salary**. Now, the most common type of retirement benefit is a “defined contribution” plan, in which employees **make periodic** **contributions to a tax-sheltered investment account,** on the assumption that they’ll get back an increased return in later years.

(Shortform note: In 2020, 64% of private industry workers had access to a defined contribution plan while only 15% had access to defined benefit plans. In 1990, those numbers were 34% and 35%, respectively, showing that slightly more people used defined benefit plans in the past.)

This shift put a greater decision-making burden on workers: What level of risk am I willing to take, and how do I allocate my savings accordingly? Should I be investing in stocks or bonds or both? How often should I revisit my allocation of assets, and what real-world information should I be looking for to know when to change it?

According to classically trained economists, we should have no trouble making the right investment choices. This is because, in most economic models of human behavior, **people are thought of as eminently rational and self-interested actors who consistently make the best decisions for themselves** —that is, people are _homo economicus_.

> **The Critique of _Homo Economicus_**
> 
> Introduced by classical economists like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, the term _homo economicus—_ “economic man”—conceives of people as **predictably rational and self-interested, thus able to make the most beneficial economic choices for themselves**. (In more technical terms, when faced with a decision, _homo economicus_ makes the choice that “maximizes expected utility.”) In most of the economics research of the last century, people are modeled in just this way: **as able to maximize their own economic benefit**.
> 
> With the advent of behavioral psychology and economics, however, **researchers have established that _homo economicus_ is a fiction**—that people’s rationality is “bounded” by any number of cognitive and contextual factors. (In fact, one study determined that real people who meet all the criteria of homo economicus might be diagnosed as psychopathic.) Thus—at least according to proponents of people’s “bounded rationality”—**much of the economics literature rests on a flawed assumption** and so can’t be applied to real-world policy.
> 
> Debates are ongoing about the accuracy of economic models that rely on _homo economicus_. Some commentators find that people do in fact act consistently and self-interestedly when faced with decisions while others maintain homo economicus is a chimera. Thaler and Sunstein, for their part, fall into the latter camp, arguing that **“Econs”—or “economic people”—simply do not exist**.

Thaler and Sunstein argue that if people indeed met the criteria of _homo economicus_ , we would have no trouble (1) recognizing that stocks outperform bonds historically and (2) calculating our tolerance for risk based on the probability distribution of stock market returns. But, because we’re human,**the complexities and variability of defined-contribution plans cause us to make mistakes** that end up—quite literally—costing us.

One way to remedy these mistakes, they suggest, is with **better defaults** , specifically “target maturity funds” that automatically reallocate their asset mix based on a worker’s age. A target maturity fund will have a riskier asset allocation—more stocks, fewer bonds—when a worker is young and gradually recalibrate as the worker ages. By the time the worker retires, his portfolio will be heavily weighted toward fixed income assets like bonds.

(Shortform note: Nassim Nicholas Taleb explores the biases that make people bad at assessing risk in his book _Fooled by Randomness_ , in which he argues that when we make decisions, we are typically guided by our primitive brain, which runs on emotion, likes simplicity, and has trouble understanding abstract concepts. When investing, we therefore do things like act impulsively, sell a stock too soon if it’s doing poorly (even if its long-term prospects are good), and misjudge our abilities to play the stock market—in reality, it’s luck that rules the market and determines most success, not our skill in choosing stocks. Thaler and Sunstein’s solution of using targeted maturity funds to sidestep our natural impulses addresses Taleb’s concerns, as it takes the decision-making process away from our primitive brain and relies instead on rational algorithms.)

The authors contend that the most destructive cognitive bias when it comes to investing is **loss aversion**. Numerous studies—including Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk”—have shown that people, as mentioned earlier, tend to feel losses more strongly than they feel gains. Because of this, **we frequently make unideal decisions to avert losses rather than realize gains**.

> **Experimental Evidence of Loss Aversion**
> 
> A famous illustration of loss aversion comes from one of Thaler’s “Anomalies” columns in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. To test people’s economic decision-making, Thaler and his coauthors divided a large lecture class into three groups and had them pick prices for a souvenir coffee mug. The three groups were (1) “sellers,” who were given the mug and had to pick a sell price; (2) “buyers,” who weren’t given the mug and had to pick a buy price; and (3) “choosers,” who weren’t given a mug but could choose either the mug or the cash equivalent of its price. (There was a limited number of price options ranging from $0.25 to $9.25.)
> 
> The median price chosen by the sellers was $7.12, while the median prices chosen by the buyers and choosers were $2.87 and $3.12 respectively. In other words—as noted above—**the sellers overvalued the loss of the mug by a 2:1 margin**. (Thaler coined the term “endowment effect” to describe this phenomenon. According to this theory,**people price items they already own higher than they would if they were purchasing the item anew**.)
> 
> **Subsequent researchers have offered different interpretations of the mug experiment** , however. For example, one study found that loss aversion wasn’t the driving force behind the price disparities; rather, it was _inertia_ —that is, neither the buyers nor the sellers were sure what the mug was worth to them, so the prices reflect the necessary incentives to bother buying or selling the mug.)

Thaler and Sunstein write that when it comes to investing, loss aversion typically manifests itself in overreactions to short-term market fluctuations. For example, people will fixate on the monthly, weekly, or even daily movements of the market and potentially change their asset allocations on those bases—when, in fact,**these fluctuations belie the long-term upward trend of the market**. They point to a study of retirement plans administered by Vanguard that showed new enrollees allotting 58% of their account to stocks in 1992, 74% by 2000 (when tech stocks were booming), and 54% by 2002 (after the tech bubble burst). In other words, these employees bought high and sold low—the exact _opposite_ of what they should have done. **A target maturity fund, which reallocates over the long run, prevents us from indulging our bias against losses**.

> **A Nuance of the Vanguard Illustration**
> 
> Despite the strength of their argument, the authors may be presenting the Vanguard example in a slightly misleading way. The study only looked at how _new enrollees_ allocated their funds. It did not track their subsequent market movements. It did this because generally, due to inertia, once people have decided on a percentage of allocation, they don’t bother to change it, so the best way to track how the market’s current performance affects behavior is to look at times when people are actively making these decisions—generally, when they first join a company and fill out the forms. Thus, the authors’ assertion that people buy high and sell low is a little misleading—the study doesn’t actually say if they sold their holdings, it only says that they _bought_ _less_ when the market was low.
> 
> The effect, however, is essentially the same. People invested more heavily in the market when it was already inflated. Experts might further point out that an investor can buy high and still make money if they hold those assets. For example, if an investor had bought Amazon stock in December 1999, he would have paid around $90 a share. That investor would have seen the stock price plummet to single digits in late 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. But, if he continued to hold the stock through today, he would have seen the share price grow to over $3,000.

### Using Defaults to Improve Organ Donation

Thaler and Sunstein note that despite the fact that large majorities of Americans support organ transplantation and are willing to be donors when polled,**they frequently fail to inform their loved ones of their wishes or to register as organ donors themselves**.

Given the dire need of organs—as of February 2021, **there were over 107,000 Americans on organ waiting lists** —it’s vital for policymakers to engineer ways to transform Americans’ willingness to be donors into concrete action.

The authors recommend fixing this by changing the default—**making organ donation the default (“presumed consent”) and requiring people to opt out**.

In most states, organ donation is indicated on a person’s driver’s license; but, because the organ donation question is optional—or simply a box on the back of the license that one must check—many people simply neglect to answer. (Again: **inertia at work**.) And because most states have “nondonor” as their default, **“no answer” equals “nondonor.”**

Thaler and Sunstein’s solution is to make people’s _choice_ of organ donation**** a default requirement of acquiring their driver’s license—that is, **in order to receive a driver’s license, the driver _must_ choose** to be an organ donor or not to be one. Given Americans’ general positive sentiment toward organ donation, this strategy is likely to result in large increases in organ donors; **and it preserves freedom by giving people the choice to opt in or out**.

(Shortform note: Studies have shown that presumed consent systems of organ donation don’t necessarily increase the number of available organs. In addition, Thaler and Sunstein don’t consider the possibility that surveys about organ donation might be tainted by social-desirability bias—that is, the tendency for subjects to give the socially acceptable answer to a question, even when it’s not what they truly believe. For example, people know they _should_ be organ donors, but, **when it comes down to actually committing, they might prefer not to**.)
