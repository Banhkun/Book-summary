## Exercise: Design DIY Defaults

Design some personal defaults to defeat inertia.

* * *

List some examples of defaults in your own life (do you tend to always buy the same brand of milk, clothing, or car?).

Now write down how these defaults could be changed to improve outcomes. (Might you reach for a healthier afternoon snack as your default if fewer unhealthy snacks were on hand or if they were harder to access?)
