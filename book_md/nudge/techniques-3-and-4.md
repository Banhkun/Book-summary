## Techniques 3 and 4: Narrow the Field and Offer Incentives

The most versatile nudges Thaler and Sunstein suggest are _defaults_ and _transparency programs_ , so it should come as no surprise that those are the nudges that get the most attention in the book.

That said, Thaler and Sunstein also describe an array of additional nudges, among them (1) narrowing the field of choices and (2) offering incentives.

### Narrowing the Field

Thaler and Sunstein believe in people’s right to choose (hence the _libertarian_ half of _libertarian paternalism_). But they also recognize that **_too much_ choice can be overwhelming and counterproductive**. (Shortform note: Researchers refer to this as choice overload or the Paradox of Choice: We _want_ more options because we think it maximizes our chances of making the best choice, but having too many choices paralyzes us.)

Medicare Part D, for example, offered seniors an incredible breadth of choices—but too little direction in terms of discerning among them. Another example: When Sweden partially privatized its social security program in the 1990s, it went the maximization route, offering Swedes up to five choices of investment funds from a list of 456. (Shortform note: The Premium Pension System—the privatized part of Sweden’s pension plan—has at times hosted over 800 different funds.) Unsurprisingly, many Swedes, adrift in the sea of choices, opted for underperforming funds with high management fees.

(Shortform note: What Thaler and Sunstein couldn’t have known at the time of _Nudge_ ’s writing was that Sweden’s privatization reform would result not only in suboptimal investment choices by the Swedes but in fraud by some investment funds. In response to the private funds’ criminality, Sweden has had to deregister a number of private funds, compensate pensioners, and initiate reforms to regulate the private fund managers more tightly. One regulatory authority—seeming to take a page out of Thaler and Sunstein’s playbook—opined that the Premium Pension System should only feature 10-15 funds.)

One way to narrow the field is **simply to offer fewer options**. However, since this limits choices, which Thaler and Sunstein oppose (as it contradicts libertarianism), they propose another way of narrowing the field of options: **grouping and** **structuring the choices to make them more manageable**.

For example, **many retirement plans offer “tiered” investment choices** ; rather than hand enrollees a voluminous and undifferentiated list of funds to choose from, retirement plans will offer, say, three different tiers, each corresponding to enrollees’ level of investment interest and experience. In this kind of choice structure, Tier 1 might feature a single default target maturity fund; Tier 2, a small collection of funds, each with a different mix of assets to represent conservative, moderate, and aggressive positions; and Tier 3, the full complement of funds for the savvy investor who wants total control over her investments. In this example, **choices are structured but not limited**.

(Shortform note: Because choices aren’t limited in a tiered system, **it isn’t foolproof** : If an inexpert but risk-seeking enrollee wants to bet her retirement on the most aggressive and fee-laden actively managed fund, she’s free to do so, **even if it could result in catastrophe**.)

### Offering Incentives

Old-fashioned incentives, financial or otherwise, can also nudge choosers toward better decisions. The key to a successful incentive, argue Thaler and Sunstein, is to **make its benefits relevant and obvious to the person making the choice.** For example, if you make the cost of using something clear to the user each time they use it, they’ll be more aware of the costs than if they pay an up-front fee for it at, say, the beginning of the month. This is because people tend to forget an up-front fee but are very aware of ongoing fees. Thus, by highlighting per-usage costs, which make the benefits clear and relevant to the user (and thus offer clear incentives to adjust behavior), choice designers might successfully nudge people to use something less often.

> Economists have long noted the power of incentives in driving human behavior—the concept underpins a capitalist society. Most economists agree that the primary incentives that drive behavior are self-interested incentives. As outlined in Charles Wheelan’s _Naked Economics_ , when people work to benefit themselves, they generally benefit others as well (as when they work to earn a salary, what they produce raises the standard of living for others).
> 
> This is not always cut-and-dried, though—different people will be motivated by different wants, which makes an economist’s job difficult when picking incentives that will motivate large numbers of people. However, Thaler and Sunstein’s proposals aim to appeal to the majority through simplicity: No one wants to pay more than they need to for an item or service, and the authors’ nudges bank on that.

Thaler and Sunstein suggest that an area ripe for incentives is environmental policy, both at the individual and collective levels:

#### Environmentalism at the Individual Level

At the individual level, the authors propose to lessen excessive home energy use by redesigning thermostats to not only show temperature but **the dollar cost of whatever temperature the user selects**. (For example, the display might show a temperature, the kilowatt-hours that temperature requires, the per-kilowatt-hour cost, and the total cost.) This would make the costs of increased energy use more obvious to the user by presenting them in real time (unlike a price hike, which is only registered by the user when he receives his monthly energy bill).

(Shortform note: This recalls our earlier discussion of the effectiveness of nudges given before or after a decision. A thermostat that displays the cost of heating a room before the user has chosen the temperature at which to set it is probably more effective than a high energy bill that arrives a month later. Since _Nudge_ was published, there have been major advances in the smart appliances space that work toward this capability, and thermostats have gotten major upgrades. Google’s Nest learning thermostat, for example, programs itself based on your heating and cooling patterns. It can also track your movements: Once you leave for the day,**** it will automatically reduce your HVAC’s energy use, **eliminating the need for a nudge because it makes the choice for you**.)

#### Environmentalism at the Collective Level

At the collective level, Thaler and Sunstein advocate a “cap-and-trade” mechanism for reducing greenhouse gases.

In a cap-and-trade system, the government sets a ceiling (a “cap”) on a certain pollutant—say, carbon dioxide—and confers on industries and firms rights to pollute up to that amount. If a firm chooses to reduce its emissions below the cap, it can “trade” its excess cap space to other companies for cash. According to Thaler and Sunstein, **a cap-and-trade system meets the principles of libertarian paternalism** because it preserves choice while nudging firms—through economic incentives—to clean up their operations.

(Shortform note: While a cap-and-trade system in operation might meet the definition of libertarian paternalism, **its creation and implementation almost certainly don’t.** That is, there’s no way to “nudge” Thaler and Sunstein’s cap-and-trade model into existence—it has to be created by top-down government rulemaking (in other words, paternalism). Moreover, cap-and-trade, at least when instituted at the state level, has produced mixed results, leading many commentators to advocate for broader and more explicitly paternalistic interventions.)
