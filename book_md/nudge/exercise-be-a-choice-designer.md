## Exercise: Be a Choice Designer

Apply choice design in your own life.

* * *

Think about a choice that you’ve recently presented to someone in your life. (It can be as simple as asking someone what they want for dinner!) Write down the choice and to whom you offered it.

Now analyze the choice as a choice designer. Which of the six techniques did you employ? Did you use a default? Did you “map” the benefits of the various options for your chooser?

Think further about your choice design. Were the incentives—whether economic or otherwise—clear to your chooser? How or how not?

Now think about a choice you’ll need to offer someone in the near future. How might you use the techniques of choice design to lead the person to the best possible choice?
