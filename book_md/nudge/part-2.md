## Part 2: Designing Choices—Overview

According to Thaler and Sunstein, the most effective way for choice designers to influence choosers’ decisions is through the educated and purposeful design of choices. **They outline six techniques—anticipating error, offering defaults, emphasizing outcomes, drawing maps, narrowing the field, and offering incentives** —that can be applied to some of the most difficult and momentous choices people face to help them make better choices.

(Shortform note: In fact, all __ nudges are essentially a form of anticipating error: They respond to—and attempt to disrupt—particular habits in decision-making that lead us astray. The six techniques are tools to help manage that instinctive error.)

Parents use these six techniques intuitively. (Parents, whether they realize it or not, are seasoned choice designers.) How do parents nudge their children toward more healthy food choices, for example?

  1. They might _anticipate error_ —that is, their child raiding the cookie jar when the parents aren’t looking—and choose to hide the treats (or not keep them in the house at all).
  2. They might institute a healthy _default_ —for example, the child is always allowed fruit for dessert—which could mitigate requests for less healthy options.
  3. They might _emphasize the outcome_ of the child’s choices. For example, if a child isn’t eating her vegetables, a parent might warn her that she won’t grow up to be “big and strong” like her favorite athlete.
  4. If a child is having trouble connecting healthy choices to clear benefits, parents might _draw them a map_ that outlines how their healthy choices will lead to better outcomes. (For example, “When you eat vegetables, your muscles absorb valuable nutrients that help them grow, making you better able to run faster and jump higher.”)
  5. When there are many choices available, parents will _narrow the field_ to nudge their child toward the healthier choices. (For example, at a restaurant, a parent might allow their child to order pancakes _or_ dessert but not both.)
  6. They’ll offer _incentives_ to encourage healthier eating. (For example, a child might earn extra TV time for each piece of fruit he or she eats.) 



> **Choice Design and Paternalism**
> 
> The use of parenting as an analogue for Thaler and Sunstein’s choice designer points to the fundamental question the authors are at pains to address: **How is choice design different from straight-up paternalism?** Isn’t designing a choice system—say, a company retirement plan—to effect certain outcomes just like a parent mandating certain choices for his child?
> 
> There are two key aspects of choice design that **undermine its paternalism** :
> 
> **_First, (some kind of) choice design is inevitable_.** Picture any choice you’ve had to make, from the most commonplace (choosing which brand of AA batteries to buy) to the most consequential (deciding whether to undergo a particular kind of medical treatment). Each of these choices comes with a particular choice structure, whether purposefully designed or not: A store clerk just happens to put the Energizer batteries at eye level, or your doctor presents the therapeutic options in terms of their success rates rather than failure rates. Because of our innate cognitive biases and tendencies, **these choice structures influence the choices we make**. For example, if a doctor tells you that a procedure has a 90% success rate, you’ll probably opt for that procedure. If he tells you that 10 out of 100 people who get the procedure have debilitating side effects, you might think twice about the procedure even though the risk is exactly the same.
> 
> Thaler and Sunstein argue that because some kind of choice design is unavoidable, it’s not invasive or an overreach to _think_ about how certain choices are presented and to _change_ that presentation**** to encourage good choices.
> 
> **_Second, choice design never constrains choice_. **Traditional paternalism constrains choice by top-down, command-and-control means. (Two classic examples of paternalism are so-called “sin” taxes, which make unhealthy products like soda and tobacco products prohibitively expensive, and outright bans.) Choice design, however, doesn’t limit a person’s choices; **it just _orders_ or _organizes_ those choices **to urge the chooser toward the best choice.
> 
> For example, say a pharmacy decides to remove any candy products from its register areas—to discourage unhealthy eating habits—but continues to carry those products in its aisles. The pharmacy hasn’t limited its customers’ choice—customers can still purchase candy there—**but it _has_ changed the choice structure to promote a certain outcome**.

In the following chapters, we’ll discuss four of these techniques in detail: designing defaults, drawing a map, narrowing the field, and offering incentives.
