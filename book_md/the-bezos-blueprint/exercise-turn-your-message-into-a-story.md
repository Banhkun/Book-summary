## Exercise: Turn Your Message Into a Story

Of all the tools Gallo offers for improving your communication, storytelling is particularly useful because it combines other principles such as simplicity, getting to the point, and making information relatable. In this exercise, you’ll practice organizing your message into a compelling narrative using the three-act structure (setup, challenges, and resolution).

* * *

Think of a recent time when you explained a complex topic or tried to convince someone of a new idea. Describe what your central message was and how you presented it.

Now, we’ll shape that message into a story. Start with the _setup_ : What basic background information does the audience need? Who are the main characters? What’s the world’s status quo? (For example, what was your customer's typical day like, or your company’s initial status?)

What’s the _inciting incident_ in your story? What kicks the hero into action? What is the hero’s newfound goal or quest? (For example, what problem did your customer face? Or, what happened to your company to prompt action?)

What _challenges_ does the hero face along the way? What obstacles, setbacks, or opponents must the hero overcome? How does the hero tackle these challenges? (What made your customer’s problem more difficult? Or, did your company face competitive or regulatory challenges?)

Finally, how does the story _resolve_? How are the hero and the world improved after the hero accomplishes the goal? (How did your company, service, or product help your customer? Or, how did your company come through the challenge stronger?)
