## Part 5: Traveling to Cuba and Russia

In addition to his project in Peru, and some smaller side projects in the US, Farmer spent time traveling to raise money for his work in Haiti and helped develop a TB treatment program for Russia. Even in less-busy months, he spent ample time traveling the world to do this work.

### Cuba

Despite previously losing the backing of the Soviet Union and currently facing an embargo from the US, Cuba didn’t let lack of funding or a history of poverty affect its citizens’ health—the country made public health a priority and created one of the most renowned health care systems in the world.

For Farmer, it represented a glimmer of hope that even poor countries can develop a robust system to give people access to healthcare, bettering the people’s quality of life. He traveled to Cuba to attend a conference on AIDS in 2000. **While there, he attempted to gather leads on people that would be able to fund AIDS treatment, serve as doctors in Haiti, or help train Haitian medical students.** He cultivated a number of leads in anticipation of only 1-2 coming to fruition. Sometimes he got an answer right away: One doctor agreed on the spot to allow two Haitian medical students to study at a new Cuban medical school that year.

#### AIDS Crisis Approach: Cuba Versus the US

Farmer was inspired by how Cuba handled the AIDS crisis. Their approach was fundamentally different from the US’s approach. In Cuba, AIDS patients were placed in quarantine in a large estate under military supervision. They received meals and medical treatment, though treatment from soldiers may have been harsh at first. Gradually, patients were allowed to leave quarantine periodically if they committed to having safe sex. Eventually, the doctors opted to end the quarantine, but many patients chose to stay at the center because of the nice conditions it offered. During this period, the country also made HIV testing mandatory.

**By the year 2000, Cuba had the lowest per capita rate of infection in the western hemisphere.** In contrast, though the infection and death rate in the US had dropped, a larger percentage of people in the US were infected and died than in Cuba. For Farmer, this demonstrated that treating AIDS could be done even in a country with limited resources.

The US had run its own quarantine for Haitians infected with HIV at Guantánamo Prison in Cuba, and Farmer had gotten to interview them about their experience. They reported being offered spoiled food that had maggots in it, and being beaten if they refused shots of the birth control Depo-Provera. Farmer grew angry after reading an account that said that the US quarantine of Haitians with AIDS at Guantánamo was the same as the Cuban quarantine.

The US government ruled the quarantine unconstitutional, ending it in 1993.

### Russia

Farmer also traveled to Russia to help negotiate the terms of a World Bank loan to treat prisoners with TB. At the time, Russian prisoners’ risk of catching TB was 40 to 50 times higher than that of the rest of the country, and one-third of prisoners had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR). **In some instances, people were infected while waiting years in prison before sentencing, or were released while still battling the disease, furthering its spread.**

Russian prisoners with TB were already receiving treatment thanks to funding from George Soros, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist. However, just like Peru’s initial plan, Soros’s plan focused exclusively on treating TB patients, not MDR patients. If the patients did not recover—if they had drug-resistance—they’d be given hospice treatment to make their deaths easier.

Farmer criticized the plan, saying it wouldn’t help decrease rates of TB or MDR in the country, and Soros enlisted his help to develop a new one. Soros suggested negotiating a loan from the World Bank to support such efforts. Farmer hoped that creating an effective TB and MDR treatment program in Russia would bring attention to the plight of the poor around the world.

#### Terms of the Loan

Discussion of the loan terms centered on what portion of the funding should go to treat Russia’s prisoners versus non-prisoners. **Farmer thought that since the prisoners were at higher risk, and could endanger the greater population if left untreated, half of the money should go to treating them.** He’d spent the better part of a year meeting with World Bank leaders, trying to sway them.

But most of the World Bank negotiators thought that only 20 percent of the loan should go toward treating prisoners and the rest should fund treatment for the general population. They also didn’t like Farmer’s proposal to give prisoners with TB more food. **But one of the negotiators approached Farmer privately and told him to ask for funding for vitamins for the prisoners, which could be used for food later instead.** The negotiators agreed to the new proposal, which ultimately gave extra food and 50 percent of the loan to prisoners.
