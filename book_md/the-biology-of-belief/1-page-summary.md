## 1-Page Summary

In _The Biology of Belief_ , developmental biologist Bruce Lipton challenges the notion that genes determine our destiny. He argues that we have more control over our health and genetic expression than previously thought. Drawing on decades of research in cell biology and epigenetics, he explains how **our beliefs and thoughts can have a profound impact on how our genes are expressed, and therefore on our physical and mental health.**

Bruce Lipton is a cellular biologist who is best known for his groundbreaking stem cell research at Stanford Medical School and his work in the field of epigenetics (how your behavior and environment can affect the functioning of your genes). He’s taught at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and St. George’s University in Grenada. Lipton is also the author of _Spontaneous Evolution_ (2010), which explores the connection between biology and consciousness, and _The Honeymoon Effect_ (2014), which takes a look at how quantum physics and biochemistry can help us navigate romantic relationships.

In this book, Lipton presents evidence from his research on cellular life to support the idea that **we create our reality by how we interpret and react to our environment**. The key ideas from this book offer a new perspective on the relationship between our minds and our bodies by suggesting that we can use this knowledge to improve our health and well-being.

Lipton begins by providing an overview of the traditional view of genetics and biology, which holds that our genes determine most of our characteristics. He argues that this view is outdated and limited, as it doesn’t take into account the many environmental factors that can affect gene expression. He then explores the relationship between our beliefs and our physical health, presenting evidence that **our thoughts and beliefs can have a powerful impact on our bodies, influencing everything from our immune systems to our hormones.**

Finally, Lipton delves into research on energy and brain waves to examine how our unconscious programming influences our behaviors. He argues that we spend 95% of our lives acting from a subconscious program that was instilled in us in early childhood. He explains that this subconscious programming is the basis for how our brains interpret the world around us, and that our brain’s interpretations of the world create chemical signals that direct all of our cells’ behavior. Lipton says that if we can change our beliefs and thoughts, we can change our physical health and ultimately take more control over our lives.

(Shortform note: Many other well-known books, such as _The Secret_ , _Think and Grow Rich_ , and _The Power of Now_ , emphasize the power of our thoughts to transform our lives. These books are based on the principle of the _Law of Attraction_ , which some critics dismiss as magical thinking. Lipton’s approach draws similar conclusions regarding the connection between our minds and material realities, but he attempts to ground the principle in scientific research, which suggests a different angle from which to consider The Law of Attraction.)

This book was originally published in 2005 and was updated in 2015; this guide is based on the updated edition. In the guide, we’ll follow the general organization of the book, explaining how Lipton came to his insights through his knowledge about the functions of cells. Along the way, we’ll explore resources that offer some actionable guidance, and we’ll also compare Lipton’s ideas to additional books and research that examine the mind-body connection.

### Scientific Paradigms as Dogma

For much of his career, Lipton says he has found himself at odds with the scientific community because his ideas have challenged prevailing scientific paradigms. In particular, he proposed the principles of epigenetics long before it was an established field of study. As time goes on, however, he says research has continued to support many of his ideas. The problem, as he explains it, is that the scientific community can be dogmatic in holding on to established paradigms.

In this section, we’ll look at how some of the most prominent theorists of the scientific world—namely, Darwin and Descartes—may have been mistaken. And we’ll explain why Lipton believes that**rigid adherence to outdated worldviews has stunted scientific progress.**

#### Darwin vs. Lamarck: Setting the Stage for Understanding Genetics

One of the foundations of the modern scientific worldview—particularly in the biological sciences—is Darwin’s theory of evolution. This is a model based on competition for survival and genetic determinism, or the idea that your genes have a high degree of control over your fate. Lipton says Darwin’s theory has shaped the modern Western worldview to our detriment. He explains that **the science of epigenetics, established in the 1990s, has shown that the environment plays a much bigger role in shaping us than was previously thought.**

(Shortform note: Epigenetics is “the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.” Research has found that genes can be modified by things like diet, exercise, and other behaviors. For example, smoking can cause changes in a specific gene associated with lung function, and quitting smoking can actually reverse this genetic expression.)

##### Darwin’s Theory of Evolution

Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection (published in 1859) says that **individuals within a species compete for survival, and those with the characteristics most favorable to survival pass on those characteristics to their offspring through heredity.** For example, consider a species of bird that lives in an aquatic environment and eats fish. The individuals whose feet have more webbing will be able to swim better and therefore find more food. This means they’ll be more likely to survive and reproduce, and they’ll pass on the webbed feet to their offspring. Over generations, this will result in a species that has fully webbed feet. Lipton explains that scientists would later find that genes encoded in DNA were the mechanism for heredity, confirming Darwin’s hypothesis about the heritability of characteristics through reproduction.

But Darwin’s theory led to what Lipton considers an overemphasis on hereditary mechanisms _controlling_ everything about us, as well as the idea that all of life is in constant competition. He says both of these ideas overstate the case and skew our understanding of the world and ourselves.

##### Lamarck’s Theory

Lipton says the scientific community had prematurely rejected some important observations that others had made before Darwin. A French biologist named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a theory of evolution in the late 18th century that stressed the importance of _cooperation_ for survival and of environmental influences in shaping characteristics. So **Lamarck thought an individual’s characteristics could change in response to their environment, and those acquired characteristics could then be passed onto offspring.**

Using the above example, Lamarck believed that an individual bird’s feet could become more webbed over its lifetime as it spent time swimming. Then the webbed feet would be passed to offspring. This idea was widely rejected by the Church and consequently by the scientific community at the time. And it continued to be soundly rejected until recent work by epigeneticists recognized the degree to which the environment _can_ influence our characteristics and even our genetic expression, although not exactly in the way Lamarck had imagined. Lipton says **both Darwin and Lamarck were partially right and partially wrong** , but that the scientific world fully embraced Darwin and fully rejected Lamarck.

> **The Politics of Evolutionary Theory**
> 
> In _On the Origin of Species_ , Darwin does pay homage to Lamarck, acknowledging that Lamarck laid the groundwork for his own ideas. Darwin credits Lamarck for being the first scientist to propose that species evolved from other species and to suggest natural laws by which this happened, in opposition to the creationist ideas that prevailed at the time.
> 
> Lamarck was a Deist, meaning he believed in a God who initially created life but then left the world to operate according to natural laws—a belief that sees God and evolution as compatible. However, the Christian church espoused the belief that all species were created in their present form by God and that humanity was created in the image of God, as a higher life form. Therefore the ideas of evolution, and particularly the suggestion that humans could have evolved from “lower” life forms, were considered heretical.
> 
> **These opposing ideas were then associated with political positions** —the Church representing a conservative and authoritarian worldview, and the evolutionist perspective representing a progressive worldview that threatened the social order. It was at least partially this association with “radical” politics that led to the stigmatizing of Lamarck and his work.
> 
> Fifty years later, drawing upon Lamarck’s work, Darwin faced much of the same opposition from the Church, although Darwin intentionally attempted to divorce his work from politics. Doing so may have been, in large part, what allowed Darwin’s theory to receive more widespread recognition than Lamarck’s.

Scientists now know that in most cases, genes don’t _determine_ whether we’ll get any particular disease, for example. Even if your parents have passed on a gene associated with breast cancer to you, your environment determines whether that gene will be “activated.” Lipton says the vast majority of diseases are not the result of any single gene, but instead involve complex interactions between genes and the environment.

Epigenetic research has revealed that **our environment—including nutrition, exposure to toxins, stress, and our emotions—can alter our genes, and in some cases those modifications can be passed on to our offspring.** To understand how this works, let’s look at how Lipton came to these conclusions through his research on cells.

(Shortform note: Studies on mice have shown that epigenetic information can pass from mother to babies simply through behavior. For example, very nurturing behavior by mother mice influences the genetic expression of their pups—observable on their DNA—to make those pups become nurturing mothers themselves. In this way, the mother’s behavior imprints information directly onto the pups’ DNA, rather than passing it on via the reproductive gametes.)

### Cell Behavior Is a Microcosm of Human Behavior

Lipton says his research on cells since the 1970s has shifted the way he thinks, not only about biology but about life. His research has taught him that **cells have intelligence and live in cooperative communities, working together in response to the signals they get from their environment.** He sees cells as a microcosm of the human world, from which we can learn a great deal about ourselves, our relationships, and our societies.

(Shortform note: In her book _Secrets of Your Cells_ , biologist Sondra Barrett argues, like Lipton, that every cell in your body is an intelligent being. She says our bodies are composed of “trillions of sentient entities cooperating to create a sanctuary for the human soul” and that we can take wisdom from our cells about how to best live our lives.)

#### The Brain in the Membrane

Perhaps the most revolutionary theory Lipton proposes about cells is that **the cell’s “brain” lies not in its nucleus but in its membrane, the outer layer that envelops it.** This is an important concept underlying all of his work because it explains why the cell’s environment is the force driving its behavior.

Traditional cell biology says that DNA provides the “program” that directs a cell’s behavior, and**** all of your cells act according to this program to determine almost everything about you. Each of your cells contains a copy of your DNA, which resides in the nucleus of the cell. So cell biologists assumed that the nucleus of a cell must be its central controlling mechanism, akin to its brain.

However, Lipton observed that when you remove a cell’s nucleus, it doesn’t immediately die—it continues to function. The only thing the cell can’t do without its nucleus is reproduce. He concluded that **the nucleus of the cell is more akin to the body’s reproductive organs**. If it were akin to the brain, the cell would be unable to live without it.

Lipton noted that the cells of the simplest organisms, like bacteria, don’t even have a nucleus, and yet they live and behave much like more complex cells (they just reproduce differently). But the one feature characteristic of the cells of all living things is that they have a membrane. This insight led him to observe that **the cell’s membrane interprets and responds to signals from its environment, in much the same way our brains interpret what’s going on around us and decide how to respond.**

Lipton concluded that the membrane of the cell is actually directing its behavior, based on environmental information. The environment of your cells is your body chemistry. **Your cells react to the chemical and energetic signals in your body, many of which are created by your thoughts, beliefs, and emotions.** And this can actually affect the expression of the genetic material inside the cell’s nucleus.

> **The Brain-Membrane Comparison Is Controversial**
> 
> Lipton’s claim that the cell’s “brain” is its membrane has been met with some criticism. One critique is that Lipton sets up a straw man argument by asserting that scientists believe the nucleus is the brain of the cell, and then he sets out to debunk that idea. However, critics say scientists have never claimed that the cell’s “brain” is the nucleus and have long recognized the complex interaction of the parts of the cell in directing cell behavior.
> 
> It can also be argued that the comparison between the cell membrane and the brain is a stretch. One important difference is that the brain has the ability to learn and adapt to new information through a process called _plasticity_. Plasticity allows the brain to change by altering connections in its networks. Without plasticity, we wouldn’t be able to learn or adapt to our environment. By contrast, the cell membrane’s responses are more fixed and determined by its physical properties.

#### Your Thoughts Contribute to Your Cells’ Environment

The idea that thoughts can have a direct effect on the material world has been largely rejected in the scientific worldview since the 1600s, when **French philosopher Descartes proposed that the mind and body are distinct realms**. The suggestion that your beliefs can affect your body has typically been dismissed as magical thinking, and Lipton recounts facing such reactions himself. But he says **science now solidly confirms the inseparability of mind and body.**

Lipton explains that the mind-body dynamic works like this:

  * Your mind perceives what’s happening around you.
  * Your brain cells interpret that information and respond by secreting chemicals. 
  * Those chemicals circulate through your bloodstream to your whole body, becoming the environment in which all of your cells operate.
  * How your cells operate in response to those chemical signals influences how you’ll behave and determines your overall health and well-being. 



Lipton explains that the neurochemicals created in your brain are constantly affecting your cellular community. **One of the ways this can negatively impact you is through the toxic chemical environment created by chronic stress.**

> **Mind Over Matter**
> 
> Studies have shown that thoughts alone can improve cognition, vision, fitness, and strength.
> 
> For example, in one study, researchers asked two groups of people to answer questions on a computer. One group was told that the answers would be briefly flashed on their screens before each question, while the other group was told that the flashes simply signaled the next question. In reality, both groups were shown a random string of letters instead of the answers. However, **the group that _believed_ they were being shown the answers performed better on the test.**
> 
> Other research shows that **our thoughts can even improve our vision and physical strength**. For instance, when people were put into the mindset of an Air Force pilot by being placed in a flight simulator, their vision improved.
> 
> These kinds of studies show that our thoughts and expectations can have a significant impact on our abilities and suggest that by using our thoughts more intentionally we may be able to improve our performance in various areas.

##### Stress and Fear Create a Toxic Environment for Our Cells

Stress is the body’s response to any kind of threat, real or perceived _._ This means **the stress response can be seen as a direct link between mind and body**.

As Lipton describes, **a threat is perceived and interpreted first by the mind, which then sends chemical signals to the body’s systems for a response.__** When the brain perceives any kind of threat, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands (“HPA axis”) secrete hormones, including cortisol _._ And the sustained release of cortisol throughout your body has damaging health consequences.

According to Lipton, when your body is flooded with cortisol on a sustained basis, your cells are constantly receiving messages that their environment is hostile. This changes the way the cells behave because they have to direct energy toward self-defense mechanisms rather than toward healthy function and growth. This is why chronic stress inhibits your immune system, for example. The body directs all its energy toward the threat response, leaving it depleted of energy for other functions.

The problem, Lipton explains, is that the “threats” we tend to perceive in the modern world are often not the kinds our bodies are evolved to deal with. What’s worse is that we’re usually not even consciously aware of what the problem is, or we’re not in a position to fix it—often because it’s a result of subconscious programming, which we’ll discuss later.

> **Chronic Stress Is Killing Us**
> 
> _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ by Robert Sapolsky and _When the Body Says No_ by Gabor Maté explore the connection between stress and disease. Both authors argue that chronic stress can have a devastating effect on our physical and mental health.
> 
> Sapolsky explains that while animals like zebras experience acute stress in response to immediate threats, such as having to outrun a lion, humans in modern society tend to experience chronic stress from sources such as traffic or poverty. This **chronic activation of the stress response can lead to a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more.**
> 
> Similarly, Maté argues that when we are unable or unwilling to say “no” to pressures in our life, our body may do it for us by creating illness. He suggests that many chronic illnesses are linked to stress caused by our modern lifestyles, our conditioning as children, and our psychological coping mechanisms.
> 
> Both authors suggest that by being mindful of our thoughts and beliefs and finding ways to manage stress, we may be able to improve our physical health.

##### The Placebo Effect

Lipton points out that for over 50 years, scientists have known conclusively that the mind affects the body’s health. This mind-body relationship first became clear through research on the placebo effect—a phenomenon in which people experience healing when given a fake medication with no active ingredients. This means that **for some people, simply believing in a medication is enough to heal them.**

Lipton goes on to explain that studies of antidepressants routinely show that the drugs work only minimally, if at all, better than the placebo effect. In fact, these studies have demonstrated that some portion of participants experiences relief from their depression after taking a pill containing no medication at all. Lipton points out that, based on this, some psychiatrists have actually suggested that a placebo should be the first line of treatment given to those suffering from mild or moderate depression, because if this works for some people, then there's no reason to subject them to the potentially harmful side effects of the real drugs.

In a 2002 study, patients were even healed after being given a placebo _surgery_. Patients with debilitating knee pain were divided into three groups. The first two groups were operated on using two different techniques to determine which was more effective. For the third group, the surgeon made the typical incisions and then stitched them back up, so it would appear that the patient had had surgery, but he performed no surgery at all. The results shocked the surgeon: All three groups reported the same degree of improvement. At a follow-up two years after the surgery, the participants who had not received the surgery were still not aware, and they all continued to have increased mobility and decreased knee pain.

Lipton suggests that science needs to concentrate more effort on understanding this phenomenon because**if we could learn how to intentionally leverage the placebo effect, we could heal many more patients without pharmaceutical or surgical intervention.**

> **Harnessing the Power of Placebos**
> 
> It would likely be considered unethical for a doctor to prescribe placebos deceptively to patients, but some argue that it’s equally unethical to prescribe antidepressants, since research has shown that they often don’t perform any better than placebos in trials. This means antidepressants effectively _are_ placebos—meaning if the same percentage of people get better with antidepressants as with placebos (as studies show), then those on antidepressants are likely experiencing the placebo effect, not an actual physiological remedy. And since antidepressants often come with much more potentially severe side effects, including increased suicidality, it could be more ethical to simply prescribe placebos.
> 
> But since the deception of patients is not generally acceptable, it has also been suggested that **doctors could prescribe placebos non-deceptively by telling patients they’re getting a placebo. **The assumption that placebos must be presented deceptively in order to be clinically effective has been debunked by recent trials. Non-deceptive presentation of placebos, accompanied by an explanation of their effectiveness, has proven to lead to successful outcomes.
> 
> A 2017 study looked at five different trials in which patients were prescribed placebos non-deceptively for irritable bowel syndrome, depression, allergic rhinitis, back pain, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In these trials, **doctors told patients the medication they were getting was a placebo with no active ingredients and explained to the patients that placebos can be very powerful and effective.** In all five studies, those given the placebos improved at a higher rate than those who received no treatment.

### Energy Influences Matter

Perhaps more controversially, Lipton argues that**it’s not only your body chemistry that influences your cells—it’s also your body’s electromagnetic energy.** He says the Western scientific worldview tends to ignore the role of energy in health because it’s often not measurable and quantifiable. He points out that although research has shown that living matter does energetically influence other living matter, scientists tend to reject this research as unscientific because they can’t conclusively explain how it works.

Lipton says that energy affects almost every aspect of cell behavior. **Every biological process in your body is affected in some way by different frequencies and patterns of electromagnetic energy** —including DNA regulation, cell division and differentiation, nerve growth, and hormone secretion. This is why stimulating the brain with electrical current, such as with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), can be useful for mental health treatment.

(Shortform note: Although scientists don’t know how ECT works, they know that electrical stimulation to the brain causes seizures and changes the electrical and chemical functioning in the brain, leading to therapeutic effects. ECT has been shown to have antidepressant, antimanic, and antipsychotic effects, but the precise biological mechanisms are still under investigation.)

Lipton says **every living organism interprets its environment by sensing energetic signals around it.** This is observably true of cells, plants, and animals. Humans, however, have evolved to rely so heavily on verbal communication that most of us have lost conscious touch with our energy-sensing ability. Lipton points out, though, that some indigenous peoples who still live their traditional lifestyles have retained this ability and demonstrate hypersensitivity to the energy around them.

(Shortform note: While it’s essential to avoid generalizations about indigenous peoples, anthropological research does show that our lifestyles can affect our sense perception. For example, a recent study showed that the Himba people of Namibia who live a more traditional land-based lifestyle have much better visual acuity and attention to detail than people living in modern urban societies.)

Lipton emphasizes the importance of understanding that brain wave states are energy operating at different frequencies, and these contribute to your health and well-being. **When your brain wave state changes, Lipton explains, you can change the communication and environmental signals happening throughout the body.** In particular, he stresses that understanding brain wave states is crucial for tapping into the subconscious mind, where most of our problems actually originate.

#### Your Subconscious Program Is Running the Show

**Lipton argues that your mind, rather than your DNA, is the source of your behavioral programming.** More specifically, he says the most influential force in your life is the beliefs embedded in your _subconscious_ —programming that was firmly in place by the time you were six or seven years old.

Lipton explains that our brains are particularly programmable before age seven because children at this age are generally in a different, more receptive, brain wave state than adults. Our brain waves change throughout life like this:

  * Birth to age two: Babies’ brains are in a _delta_ wave state for most of their first two years of life.
  * Ages two to six: Children in this age range have increasing periods of _theta_ wave states.
  * Ages seven to 12: _Alpha_ wave states tend to dominate.
  * After age 12: We spend most of our waking lives in _beta_ wave states.



The __ theta __ wave state is associated with hypnotism and deep meditation. This is when information can go directly to the subconscious mind. So because children are often in this state before age seven, they absorb everything around them and it becomes stored in their subconscious. This means that **we live the rest of our lives based on beliefs that were instilled in us by other people before we were even seven years old.**

The problem with that, Lipton argues, is that many of those beliefs are negative and limiting, cause us stress, and they conflict with what we consciously want to do with our lives—especially if we’ve experienced trauma in childhood. Most children at some point absorb messages that the world is unsafe and threatening, that they’re unloved or unworthy, that many possibilities are not open to them, or that the world is full of illness, violence, and death.

Lipton clarifies that parents aren’t to blame for this—most parents love their children and do the best they can with the programming _they_ received. Children absorb these messages from the social environment as a whole, even when they do have loving parents.

Recall that your mind is constantly interpreting your environment and sending signals to all of your cells. Lipton says it’s largely your subconscious mind that’s doing this interpreting. This means that **where you may consciously perceive no threat at all, your subconscious mind may be reacting to information programmed into you as a child and interpret the world through a lens of fear and insecurity.** This can drastically affect your health by causing chronic stress.

Lipton says that while you may consciously believe you’re competent and intelligent, you may have been subconsciously programmed to believe you’re stupid and incapable of success. This will undermine your confidence and your chances for success in life without your even being aware of it. He believes that most of our disease, suffering, and inability to achieve what we want in life is because this subconscious programming controls us much, even more so than our genes and our conscious mind.

> **Change Your Brain Waves to Change Your Programming**
> 
> In _Becoming Supernatural_ , Joe Dispenza explains brain wave frequencies as follows:
> 
>   * **Beta waves:** In your regular, waking consciousness, your brain tends to be in a beta wave state most of the time. This can include:
> 
>     * **Low-range** beta waves: when you’re relaxed and not perceiving any threat in your environment, but you’re still alert—for example, when you’re chatting with a friend or playing with your child.
> 
>     * **Mid-range** beta waves: a more alert state when you’re slightly aroused but not terribly stressed—for example, when you’re driving in an unfamiliar city or doing a presentation at work.
> 
>     * **High-range** beta waves: when you’re in a high-stress state, such as road rage or in fear because you feel threatened.
> 
>   * **Alpha waves:** Your brain is in an alpha wave state when you’re very relaxed, calm, and creative. You may slip into alpha wave states throughout your day if you engage in meditative or creative practices that allow you to get out of your thoughts and into a calm “flow” state.
> 
>   * **Theta waves:** Your brain slips into theta wave state when you’re in that zone between waking and sleep—or when you’re in deep meditation.
> 
>   * **Delta waves:** This is the brain wave state you’re in when you’re asleep, but very adept meditation practitioners can also go into delta wave states while awake.
> 
>   * **Gamma waves:** Dispenza calls this brain wave state a “superconscious” state. It’s associated with intense focus and transcendental and mystical experiences.
> 
> 

> 
> Dispenza explains that**** to tap into your subconscious mind, you must train your brain through meditative practices to drop into the lower-frequency brain wave states. This is because those are the states in which you access your deepest subconscious programming. He says **when your brain waves change from beta to alpha, theta, and delta, your autonomic nervous system reacts differently to the world.** Rather than responding to the world with stress and fear, it responds in a healthy way, which will keep you from responding to life through the lens of the past.
> 
> In terms of frequency, **gamma brain waves are the highest-frequency wave** , followed by beta, alpha, theta, and delta (the lowest-frequency wave). Most people only ever experience brief fleeting moments of gamma waves, lasting less than a second—for example when you have a momentary experience of blissful surprise, like the first bite of a delicious food. But some very experienced meditators have been shown to stay in gamma wave patterns throughout their whole day. This indicates that they exist perpetually in a different state of consciousness than the average person.

### Implications for Healing

You may feel defeated after learning that your actions are triggered by unconscious programming that’s been embedded in you since early childhood. But Lipton says he’s optimistic about our individual and collective capacity for change. He ends the book by saying **we have the capability to reprogram our minds and to do better for our own children, and that we should join together as a global community in our healing efforts.** In this section, we’ll look at the advice Lipton offers based on what he’s learned from his work with cells.

(Shortform note: While joining together as a global community is a worthy goal, it would require explicitly addressing cultural, social, and economic disparities that hinder collective progress. This would mean tackling systemic inequalities built into social institutions to ensure more lasting and equitable improvements. For example, UNESCO argues that investing in education can be a way to overcome inequalities by teaching skills that foster mindsets of adaptability, inclusivity, appreciation for diversity, and social responsibility.)

#### Individual Healing: Programming and Reprogramming

On the individual level, Lipton offers two major pathways for healing: 1) approaches to parenting that **program our children’s minds** in healthy ways, and 2) ways to **reprogram our own minds** with mindfulness and “energy psychology” techniques.

##### Program Your Children’s Minds

The most obvious way we can do better for future generations is by being more conscious and intentional about the programs we’re embedding in children’s minds. Lipton says to try to remain consciously aware that you didn’t just pass on your genes through the reproductive process—**you’re actually genetically engineering your children during their childhoods.** What you embed in your children’s minds has the capacity to influence the way their genes are expressed throughout their lives.

So if you have, or plan to have, children or grandchildren, here are a few things Lipton suggests:

  * **Begin with a healthy prenatal environment.** Your influence on your children begins _before_ they’re born. Lipton cites studies that link physical and mental disorders such as osteoporosis, psychosis, and mood disorders to prenatal and perinatal environmental influences. Expectant mothers should be aware that their behaviors and moods influence the environment in which their child is forming. 
  * **Create as calm, supportive, and safe an environment as possible for your children.** Your children will pick up on negativity, such as anger and fear, in their environment, and their own bodies will respond to this by producing the associated chemical environment. 
  * **Give ample physical love and nurturing affection.** Lipton points out that anthropologists have noted that the most peaceful societies tend to indulge their children when very young, holding them most of the day. By contrast, those that don’t show much physical affection to children tend to be more violent. 
  * **Encourage creative and cooperative play over competitiveness.** This fosters the natural human instinct toward cooperation for survival, and engaging in creative pursuits can encourage the brain to move into a state of “flow,” which are associated with theta waves. 



> **Early-Life Stress Impairs the Brain and Immune System**
> 
> The field of _psychoneuroimmunology_ studies the complex interactions between psychological processes, the nervous system, and the immune system, exploring how these systems influence each other and impact our health and well-being. Research in this field has found that early-life stress can affect immune system development and brain functioning. A 2016 study explains that this is because **the brain and immune system are not fully formed at birth but continue to mature in response to the environment after birth.** So, this allows childhood stress to affect immune system development, which can then affect brain development and functioning.
> 
> The authors of this study suggest new strategies, such as anti-inflammatory compounds for boosting immunity, that could be used to reduce the impact of childhood trauma before symptoms appear. These strategies could also potentially be used in treatment of psychiatric patients with a history of childhood trauma.

##### Reprogram Your Own Mind

Whether you have children or not, addressing your own subconscious programming is also crucial. Lipton says there are many techniques to rewrite your mental programs, including mindfulness techniques and some newer “energy psychology” methods.

**Practice Mindfulness**

Mindfulness is essentially a process of bringing your conscious and subconscious minds into harmony. Lipton explains that we don’t have to be at the mercy of our subconscious programming, because our conscious minds have the capacity to step in and direct the show. But that takes hard work because our conscious minds are used to wandering much of the time.

As Lipton explains, when your conscious mind is busy thinking about the past or the future (which is most of the time), your subconscious is left in control of the present. This means it’s constantly making decisions and interpreting the world based on your childhood programming. Your conscious mind is only in charge when it’s fully engaged in the present moment. So, Lipton says, **undertaking a mindfulness meditation practice can help you train your conscious mind to stop wandering and take charge of the decisions you make.**

Mindfulness practice is helpful for learning how to temporarily override your unconscious programming and choose different reactions to life situations. But Lipton emphasizes that for far-reaching effects, you’ll need to actually _overwrite_ the programming that’s already in place, not just learn to manage it better. This is where energy psychology comes in.

> **Meditation Is Training for Mindfulness**
> 
> Many people think of mindfulness and meditation as the same thing. But **mindfulness is a state of being, while meditation is a _practice_ you use to train yourself to become mindful. **
> 
> Mindfulness has two main components: attention and acceptance. The attention piece is about tuning into your experiences and focusing on what’s happening in the present moment. This means becoming more consciously aware of your thoughts and feelings, the physical sensations in your body, and what’s happening in your immediate environment. The acceptance piece involves observing those feelings, sensations, and external conditions without judgment. Instead of responding or reacting to them, you aim to note them and let them go.
> 
> To do mindfulness meditation, find a quiet space to sit and settle in. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and relax. Focus on your breath and stay focused. When thoughts try to pull your attention away from the breath, come back to your breath. You can also focus on each part of your body, in order, from toe to head or head to toe. You can find many guided mindfulness meditations online, for example on the Insight Timer app.

**Explore Energy Psychology Techniques**

The term “energy psychology” applies to several different techniques and methods for reaching into your subconscious mind—for example, hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), and kinesiology (the study of body movement) are among them. Lipton doesn’t discuss many of these methods in detail, but instead directs the reader to his website for more information.

The important thing to know about these methods is that they use implicit messaging (sometimes called “subliminal” messaging) to reach your subconscious and overwrite the existing programs. As mentioned above, this is most effective when one is in a theta brain wave state. The theta state is associated with deep meditation and hypnosis, so energy psychology methods often involve an attempt to shift your brain waves from their normal alpha state to the lower-frequency theta state.

However, Lipton points out that you have access to a theta wave state every day—just as you are falling asleep at night, you slip into theta waves before you drop into the delta wave sleep state. **This offers you an opportunity every night to get some implicit messaging into your brain.** You can do this by listening to meditations and affirmations designed to imprint positive thoughts into your brain as you enter this programmable state.

> **Use “Tapping” to Relieve Fear and Anxiety**
> 
> The website of the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology (ACEP) includes a page of “Resources for Resilience.” On this page, you can click on the psychological issue you’re confronting—for example, anxiety, fear, anger, or confusion—and you’ll be directed to a collection of resources for dealing with that issue. These include videos and downloadable instructions for different energy psychology techniques, such as breathing patterns, postures, eye movements, and tapping specific points on the body.
> 
> One of the techniques included here is called Trauma Tapping Technique, also sometimes referred to as the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). **This is a method of tapping on specific acupressure points on your body while focusing on the issue you wish to treat**. In this video, Nick Ortner of The Tapping Solution shares an introductory, three-minute EFT tapping technique you can do anywhere to reduce stress and even stop a panic attack.

#### Collective Healing: Hope for the Future

Finally, Lipton says he’s optimistic about the future of humanity, based on the history of life on the planet and how resilient it can be when it joins together in cooperative communities. He says **we can learn a lot from cells about how to move forward as a global human community.**

Life on Earth consisted only of single-celled organisms for billions of years before they began joining together to form multicellular clusters, which eventually became the complex higher life forms we have today. Lipton suggests that **it was likely some sort of environmental change that created pressure for those single-celled organisms to join together to increase their chances of survival**. Cooperation in this way helped them survive because when they were joined, their collective membrane surface area increased, giving them greater ability to detect and respond to environmental threats. He says **cells give us a model for understanding how joining together in cooperative community may give us our best chance for survival.**

Lipton points out that humanity’s survival is threatened because of our own destructive behaviors. We’ve radically altered the environments we evolved in, so that means we’re now living in an environment we’re not adapted to. And when that happens to any living organism, it has only two options—die or change. Lipton suggests we join together as a global community and make the necessary changes to ourselves. At the cellular level, we’re all exactly the same—human. We must let go of the false concepts that divide us and, like our single-celled ancestors, join together as one to find a new way to thrive.

> **Are We on the Brink of an Evolutionary Leap?**
> 
> Lipton’s book _Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (And a Way to Get There from Here)_ offers more specific information about how we can all participate in conscious evolution. In it, he teams up with philosopher Steve Bhaerman to argue that **humanity is on the brink of an evolutionary leap and that we can join together as a global community to facilitate it.**
> 
> This idea was suggested in the 1970s by psychologist Clare W. Graves, who wrote an article for _The Futurist_ magazine in 1974 titled “Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap.” Philosopher Steve McDonald summarizes and expands on Graves’s work in his 2011 article “Human Evolution: Who Are We Becoming?” He explains that Graves described an impending change in human consciousness that would be the most difficult, but also the most exciting, transition the human race has faced to date.
> 
> In Graves’s model, human development is characterized by progressive movement upwards through increasingly complex stages. This upward movement is an adaptive response to changing life conditions, and leaps to higher stages are preceded by major crises and chaos, which are then followed by renewal and a new system. McDonald argues that observations of the current modern world suggest that in 2011 we were in (or entering) stage six—“Preparing for the Leap”—of the eight stages. Stage eight is the endpoint, which he calls the “Neo-Tribal Revival,” when humanity will re-embrace a tribal identity, but that tribe will be all of us.
