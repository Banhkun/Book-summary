## Exercise: Discover Your Limiting Beliefs

Lipton says that our early-life subconscious programming often underlies limiting beliefs that hold us back in life. Uncover your programming by reflecting on your limiting beliefs and behaviors.

* * *

Think about the different areas of your life, such as career, relationships, finances, health, and so on. In which areas do you regularly feel stuck or struggle to succeed? Describe some examples that come to mind.

Now explain _why_ you think you have a blockage in those areas, and then reflect on your reasoning. Somewhere in that “why” is probably a limiting belief. Look for a story you’re telling yourself that might not be based in fact. For example, you might think you’re stuck in your career because you didn’t go to college.

Now reflect on your childhood—where might you have learned that story? For example, maybe your parents stressed the importance of college and career success.
