## 1-Page Summary

Although our living conditions are generally better than they’ve ever been, people are getting steadily unhappier. Depression, anxiety, and overall dissatisfaction with life are all statistically on the rise.

According to Mark Manson, this paradox is due to the fact that our physical living standards don't determine our happiness. Rather, **we’re happy if we have _something to hope for_** —in other words, if we believe that we can change things for the better. Our mental health crisis is due to many people losing hope and feeling that their lives are increasingly meaningless.

The solution to this problem is complicated. Many assume that to feel fulfilled, we need something to hope for—to discover meaning by focusing on the positive impact we can have on the world. However, Manson argues that **the hope that makes us feel fulfilled inevitably leads us to harm ourselves and others.** Thus, to be happy as individuals and thrive as a species, we need to find a source of fulfillment that doesn’t rely on hope for a better future.

(Shortform note: Manson cites many sources showing that people in wealthy countries are getting unhappier, supporting his argument that high standards of living aren’t the key to happiness. However, there’s less research to back up his assertion that this mental health crisis is due to a lack of hope, and many experts offer other theories. For example, some theorize that people are unhappier in wealthier countries because they’re surrounded by more wealthy people to compare themselves with. The resulting feelings of inadequacy could contribute to anxiety and depression. There’s some evidence supporting this theory: Within the US, where many wealthy people live, people with a lower income are the most at risk of suicide.)

Manson began his career as a blogger writing advice on dating, eventually expanding his blog to offer overall life advice. _Everything Is F*cked_ is his follow-up to his 2016 best-selling self-help book _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_. Manson builds on the ideas in _Subtle Art_ , elaborating on them and applying them to society at large.

In this guide, we’ll begin by establishing Manson’s definition of hope and explaining how hope fills our psychological needs. Next, we’ll walk through the three stages of growth toward a mature, meaningful life that Manson claims every human should strive to progress through: First, you live a life without hope and suffer because of it. Second, you discover how fulfilling it is to hope for something, before discovering that hope, too, causes you to suffer. Last, you discover the ability to live a fulfilling life without hope.

In our commentary, we’ll provide supplementary information from relevant books that preceded _Everything Is F*cked_ , including _Man’s Search for Meaning_ and _Learned Optimism_. We’ll also provide tips from books like _Atomic Habits_ and _No-Drama Discipline_ to help you apply Manson’s ideas to your life.

### What Is Hope, and Why Do We Need It?

Before we discuss how our relationship to hope changes as we mature, let’s clarify exactly what we mean by “hope” and explain how it functions.

Manson defines hope as **the belief that you have the ability to progress toward something valuable and create a more pleasant future.** Additionally, he asserts that you need _other people to recognize that what you do matters_ to sustain hope—social validation is a core psychological need.

We feel like we need hope because we understand we’re mortal, according to Manson. If you zoom out in time long enough, you and everyone whose life you’ve ever influenced will eventually die, and nothing you do can change that. This is an inherently depressing thought.

For this reason, to feel motivated to do anything, we need hope. **Hope empowers us to cope with the inherent pain of existence**.**** If we believe that we’re successfully creating a more pleasant future for ourselves and those around us, we’ll feel fulfilled, even if life at the moment is unpleasant. As long as we believe pleasure is coming later, working toward that pleasure provides a deeper satisfaction that transcends pain now—we feel good _about_ what we’re doing even if it doesn’t feel good in itself. In this way, hope gives us the ability to delay gratification: to trade pain now for greater pleasure down the road, and to feel satisfied while doing it.

For example, say a logging company is planning to cut down the beloved woods near your neighborhood. Driven by the hope that you can stop them, you spend countless, tiring hours contacting local politicians and recruiting others to join your cause. You’re trading the pain of these exhausting efforts now for the promise of a future where the woods remain. Those hours spent fighting the logging company don’t feel good in themselves, but you find this overall pursuit toward a better future fulfilling. Meaningful causes like this are the primary way we find satisfaction in an inherently painful world.

> **You Can Find Empowering Hope and Meaning Anywhere**
> 
> In his discussion of hope, Manson was possibly inspired by _Man’s Search for Meaning_ by Viktor Frankl, which echoes these ideas closely (Manson lists it among the best books of all time to help you understand life). Frankl was a Jewish-Austrian psychiatrist who spent three years imprisoned in concentration camps during World War II, and this experience informed his theories about the role of hope in human psychology.
> 
> Like Manson, Frankl argues that we need hope to cope with the inherent pain of existence and feel satisfied when we’d normally be suffering. He takes this idea further, noting that a sense of hope even improves physical health. In the concentration camps, Frankl noted that prisoners with goals to work toward (for example, to see their families again) were much more likely to survive than those who felt like their lives were over.
> 
> Frankl’s definition of hope overlaps with Manson’s somewhat—they agree that it’s the feeling that we’re improving the life we’ll have in the future. However, there are some differences between their definitions: While Manson argues that to have hope, we need other people to recognize the value of our actions, Frankl doesn’t put limits like this on hope. Unlike Manson, Frankl explores the possibility that _anything in our lives can be a source of hope_ , even if there’s no one around to validate it or if it’s irrational to think so. For instance, Frankl recommends considering that our actions may have a greater purpose that’s too complex for us to comprehend—faith in this idea can be a source of comfort.
> 
> Frankl’s unconditional belief that everything can be meaningful even extends to death itself. Rather than viewing death as the painful truth that forces us to find meaning, as Manson does, Frankl views it as a source of meaning in itself. By giving us a time limit, death motivates us to take meaningful action during our lives. Without it, we wouldn’t do anything valuable with our lives—thus, we can view death as something to be grateful for, rather than something to fear.

### Stage 1: An Unhappy Life Without Hope

Manson explains that we all begin life without hope: As young children, we lack the ability to imagine the future, so we can’t comprehend the idea of doing something unpleasant for a greater purpose. Instead, we try our best to move toward immediate pleasure and away from immediate pain.

With this in mind, you may assume that as soon as our brains develop enough to imagine a better future, we’ll learn how to hope. Unfortunately, for most people, hope is not this easy to attain. In the next few sections, we’ll explain why it’s difficult to find hope, describe the painful consequences of a life without hope, then detail what a hopeless person can do to find hope.

> **When Do Children Learn to Hope?**
> 
> Research shows that children can learn to imagine the future at around age four, although some three-year-olds develop this ability early. By Manson’s logic, this should also be the time when children can learn to hope. However, experts have found that at this stage of development, children typically struggle to imagine the future if it’s likely to be significantly different than the present. Specifically, one study found that if they were thirsty, children were much more likely to imagine that they would rather have water tomorrow than pretzels.
> 
> This may help explain why children can’t always find hope, as Manson claims, even after they learn to imagine the future. If a child is doing something unpleasant, like eating vegetables, they’re likely to have trouble imagining a future in which their present pain has paid off and they feel great.

#### Why It’s Difficult to Find Hope

According to Manson, hope is difficult to find because being alive is traumatic.**** Not only is it inherently depressing that we’re all mortal, as we’ve discussed, but our chaotic and unfair world also inflicts a certain degree of senseless pain on everyone. Because of this, as we grow and attempt to construct a logical understanding of the world, **we all come to believe (to varying degrees) that we deserve to suffer.** In other words, we irrationally interpret the inherent pain of existence to mean that we’re _worse_ than other people.

Unfortunately, this insecure self-worth makes it difficult to find hope. Recall that to have hope (according to Manson’s definition), you must feel like you _have the ability_ to pursue something that matters. Because people with insecure self-worth see themselves as uniquely inferior, they also believe that they’re uniquely dysfunctional and thus _inherently unable_ to progress toward something valuable. They may say things like “I’m not smart enough to become a teacher,” or “I’m not creative enough to make art.” This belief in their powerlessness prevents them from finding hope and living lives that they feel are meaningful.

While we all suffer a baseline amount of existential pain, some suffer more than others early in life. Manson explains that **those with especially painful, traumatic childhoods have an even more difficult time cultivating hope.** This is because the more they suffer, the more they have to devalue themselves to make sense of the world, resulting in powerful self-hatred and feelings of powerlessness.

> **A Broader View of Learned Helplessness**
> 
> A footnote in _Everything Is F*cked_ reveals that Manson draws many of these ideas from the work of Martin Seligman, a psychologist famous for popularizing the concept of learned helplessness—the belief in your powerlessness as a result of trauma. In his book _Learned Optimism_ , Seligman argues (like Manson) that early childhood experiences of helplessness make people continue to believe they’re helpless, even after they grow into adults with the power to control their lives.
> 
> Manson defines this learned helplessness as a set of beliefs about yourself (specifically, that you’re powerless and deserve to suffer). Seligman elaborates on this concept by explaining how these beliefs result in negative recurring thought patterns. People who believe that they’re powerless and deserve to suffer interpret negative events in ways that generalize and personalize them. In other words, if something bad happens, they think to themselves, “this _always_ happens” (generalizing) and “this happened because of _me_ ” (personalizing). Consequently, people can overcome learned helplessness by learning to change the way they think: generalizing and personalizing _positive_ events rather than negative ones.
> 
> Seligman differs slightly from Manson in his explanation of _why_ learned helplessness persists. Whereas Manson argues that people retain learned helplessness into adulthood when they’ve had particularly painful childhoods, Seligman emphasizes that more adults feel helpless today because of a cultural shift: Modern culture values _individual experiences and achievements_ more than in the past, when we valued _community and collective well-being_ more highly. When you regularly connect with those around you and serve the community, you encounter proof that you have the power to make a positive impact, which counteracts learned helplessness (and gives you hope).

#### Life Without Hope Is Painful

Manson states that people who fail to find a source of hope must face the painful meaninglessness of existence and consequently must endure one of two suffering-filled life experiences: First, they may try to distract themselves by relentlessly pursuing pleasure. Unfortunately, pleasure is a fleeting experience, and they’ll spend their lives desperately trying to feed an insatiable craving.

(Shortform note: Constantly seeking pleasure creates long-term suffering even on a neurochemical level. In _Dopamine Nation_ , Anna Lembke explains that when you regularly indulge in highly pleasurable activities for a long enough period, your brain adapts and interprets that level of pleasure as a neutral baseline. Then, when you stop indulging in that pleasure, your brain interprets the default state of existence to be _painful_ —at least for the two to four weeks before your brain restores balance. This is one of the main drivers of addiction.)

Second, Manson explains that people without hope may try to numb the pain of existence by suppressing all their emotions. This kind of hopelessness manifests as apathy and depression—instead of relentlessly trying to feed a craving, people lack the motivation to do anything at all, languishing at a baseline of dull pain. These two life experiences are becoming more common, contributing in large part to today’s mental health crisis.

(Shortform note: It’s important to distinguish between trying to suppress your emotions and _separating yourself from your emotions_. Experts claim that, although they seem similar, the latter is a healthy strategy that allows you to see your emotions as they truly are: fleeting sensations in the body, not an inherent part of you. The key difference between the two approaches is that when you separate yourself from your emotions, you still allow yourself to feel them by focusing on the physical sensations in your body. In contrast, when you try to suppress your emotions, you take on the impossible task of forcing them to go away, which inevitably creates even more negative feelings as your failure to eliminate them makes you more angry and anxious.)

#### How to Find Hope

If we all devalue ourselves to cope with the pain of existence, how do any of us find hope? **Many lucky people grow out of their “hopeless” phase in adolescence** , according to Manson. As children, they find that by following the rules that their parents set, they can earn praise and avoid punishment—in other words, they can reliably do unpleasant things that bring about a better future for themselves, attaining hope.

However, if a child’s parents fail to give their child consistent rules (either by neglecting and abusing them or by spoiling and rewarding them no matter what they do), the child internalizes the idea that nothing they do has predictable consequences. Without the faith that they can create a better future through their actions, they can’t hope. If this happens, the child must learn how to hope as an adult, which is more difficult.

> **How to Teach Children Through Discipline**
> 
> How can parents provide their children with the kind of clear discipline that allows them to attain hope so they don't have to struggle to find that hope as adults? The authors of _No-Drama Discipline_ argue that the most important guideline is to put your children in a mindset that’s receptive to learning while disciplining them. This aligns with Manson’s perspective, as he claims that the purpose of discipline is to help children learn the predictable rules that allow them to hope.
> 
> The authors of _No-Drama Discipline_ argue that punishments like time-outs and spanking are ineffective forms of discipline because they make children feel threatened and defensive. This activates more emotional parts of the brain that prevent children from learning how they should behave and why. Instead, parents should empathize with their children and talk to them as people, setting clear boundaries and explaining the rationale behind those boundaries.
> 
> Once a child learns these predictable boundaries and gains a sense of hope, they’ll start to feel healthy guilt and regret over their bad behavior and will naturally strive to do better. Organizing your own emotions in this way is also the primary way to teach yourself to hope, as we’ll see next.

How, specifically, can adults learn to hope if they feel hopeless? We’ll discuss this next.

##### What to Do if You Feel Hopeless

Manson offers two main strategies for cultivating hope. First, **find hope by changing your beliefs about yourself.** Reflect on your past experiences and find a way to reinterpret them so you believe that you _do_ have the ability to attain something of value, rather than believing that you’re inherently worthless and powerless.

> **You’re _Already_ Valuable**
> 
> Arguably, changing your beliefs about yourself doesn’t require reflecting on the past. The authors of _The Courage to Be Disliked_ contend that generally, reflecting on your past is a distraction that prevents you from taking action in the present. Instead, they recommend living as if the past doesn’t exist.
> 
> Additionally, it may help you feel valuable and empowered to know that the authors of _The Courage to Be Disliked_ argue that every human helps others by simply existing. Many people find human life to be inherently valuable, and coexisting with others makes these individuals happy. Everyone else is actively helping those people to be happy just by being alive. In short, feeling valuable is an extremely attainable goal because _being alive is something valuable_.

Second, Manson argues that you can cultivate hope by aligning your emotions with your values.**** In other words, **encourage yourself to feel good about doing the “right thing” and feel bad about doing the “wrong thing.”**

Most people fail to realize that **ultimately, emotions control all our behavior.** We assume that we use logic to decide what to do, unless our emotions steer us off course—but biologically, the truth is the other way around. Manson explains that emotions are the mechanism by which our brains push our bodies into action. If we feel like doing something, we do it, and if we don’t feel like doing something, we don’t. For this reason, when it makes you _feel good_ to lead a disciplined life and progress toward a better future (which is necessary to feel hope), you’ll do it automatically and effortlessly.

To align your emotions with your values, Manson states that you must learn to regulate your emotions. To do this, first, cultivate awareness of your emotions and unconditionally accept that it’s OK to feel them. Shaming yourself for any emotion will only make you feel worse about yourself, which will make it more difficult to act. Then, **remind yourself how good you’ll feel after you’ve done the “right thing.”** By anticipating a pleasant future, you’ll become excited to spring into action. Regulating your emotions in this way is the only way to build self-discipline, according to Manson.

> **Align Your Emotions and Values by Structuring Your Environment**
> 
> In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear expands on the biological information Manson provides. Clear acknowledges that emotions drive our behavior, but he also notes that if we’ve done something enough times that it becomes a habit, we’ll continue to do it on autopilot, even if the emotions pushing us into action aren’t very strong. Thus, if you can build the emotions necessary to perform a meaningful task enough times, it’ll eventually become a habit and feel effortless.
> 
> The strategies Manson offers for creating the emotions needed to push you into meaningful, hopeful action are both entirely internal tasks (increasing emotional awareness and connecting to a pleasant future). Although these strategies are likely effective, changing your psychology by learning to regulate your emotions can be very difficult. If you’re struggling to make progress, you may want to try Clear’s simpler strategy for pushing through this first stage and building a habit: **creating an environment in which doing the right thing feels good**.
> 
> Clear offers many strategies for implementing this practice. One option is to pair unpleasant yet important activities with pleasant ones to make the pair as a whole feel gratifying. For example, keep your favorite book on your treadmill and only allow yourself to read it while jogging. Another option is to track your habits visually to make completing them feel more satisfying. Every time you put money into a savings account, you could color in a hand-drawn “progress bar” that shows how close you are to an exciting major purchase.

### Stage 2: A Hopeful Life

Once you manage to align your emotions and values, you reap the benefits of a life with something to hope for. It feels like your life matters, and you find satisfaction in trading pain in the present for a future without pain. Unfortunately, Manson argues, this worldview also results in a life of suffering—and the vast majority of people live by it. The even worse news is that hope is what motivates us to make _others_ suffer, as we’ll see.

#### Hope Causes Us to Suffer

To explain why hope causes us to suffer, we have to clarify how hope operates in a little more detail.

##### Hope Requires Ideology

Recall Manson’s definition of hope: You believe that you have the ability to pursue something of value and have others recognize you for it. **People often disagree on what constitutes the “something of value” that you should pursue.** Further, people clump together in groups based on shared values, reinforcing each other’s beliefs and encouraging one another to keep pursuing what they believe is valuable.

Manson calls these groups “religions,” but we’ll use the broader term “ideologies,” since they include both spiritual groups and secular groups. Ideologies like this include political parties, religious faiths, and corporations—any group of people pursuing something they find more meaningful than anything else.

Every ideology has a _primary virtue_ , something adherents believe is more valuable than anything else (Manson calls this primary virtue a “God Value”). Political parties value political control above all else. Religious faiths value spiritual obedience above all else. Corporations value profits above all else. The members of every ideology share a key belief: By pursuing our primary virtue, we can trade pain in the present for a less painful future. This belief is what gives them hope. Manson claims that **every source of hope is an ideology of some kind.**

> **Primary Virtues: Different Paths to the Same Moral Ideals**
> 
> Manson asserts that different ideologies are built around fundamentally different values. However, in _The Righteous Mind_ , Jonathan Haidt argues that all humans are emotionally driven to promote the same universal, evolutionarily programmed moral ideals: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty. A society closer to these ideals is the less painful future that people of all ideologies hope for.
> 
> In Haidt’s view, Manson’s concept of a “primary virtue” is less of a moral ideal in itself and more of a _means to bring about moral ideals_ —a “how,” not a “why.” For example, a Mormon only values obedience to that religious code because they hope such obedience will bring about care, fairness, and so on.
> 
> However, if all ideologies are trying to reach the same moral ideals, why do they take the form of conflicting groups? Haidt argues that this isn’t a purely logical conflict—ideologies don’t just disagree on how to achieve the same ideals. Instead, conflict occurs because people with different ideologies emotionally favor the six moral ideals to varying degrees. For instance, although a Mormon values all these moral ideals, they may see sanctity as somewhat more important than liberty.
> 
> According to Haidt, this framework gives us a wealth of insights into our modern political conflict. He explains that liberals typically appeal more to care, liberty, and fairness while conservatives favor loyalty, authority, and sanctity. However, Haidt argues that because conservative rhetoric often appeals to all six moral ideals while liberal rhetoric stays away from more conservative ideals, conservative movements typically have an advantage in persuading the public to support them. For example, a conservative politician may appeal to the public’s sense of fairness by arguing that policies like affirmative action aren’t fair, but a liberal politician would have a harder time appealing to the public’s respect for just authority.

##### Ideology Causes Us to Suffer

Manson argues that unfortunately, the hope you get from an ideology will always cause you to suffer. No ideology can always deliver on its promise of a less painful future because **life is, and always will be, painful**. This is true on a biological level: No matter what your external circumstances are in life, your brain will always settle into a state of dissatisfaction. This is what helps us survive—evolutionarily, constant dissatisfaction is what motivates us to keep engaging in productive action.

(Shortform note: This idea is one of the main points in Manson’s first book, _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_. In _Subtle Art_ , Manson elaborates that although we’re evolutionarily destined to always be dissatisfied, we’re also predisposed to find the process of improvement intrinsically satisfying. In other words, although you’ll always face problems in life, continually solving those problems can help you find happiness. This explanation of how hope can make a painful life feel satisfying is more specific than the one Manson offers in _Everything Is F*cked_.)

While many ideologies successfully help people improve their lives, no ideology can continue to improve your life _indefinitely_ , giving you a perfect, painless life. This is disastrous because**when an ideology can no longer give you a better future, it can no longer be a source of hope.**

When an ideology fails to make us happier or eliminate the pain it promises, we can react in a couple of different ways. First, we could abandon the ideology entirely, which Manson argues would be best. Unfortunately, people rarely blame the ideologies for the pain they feel, because the ideologies have provided the hope and meaning driving their life for years.

**People following an ideology that makes them unhappy often blame _themselves_ rather than the ideology, **argues Manson. Instead of rejecting their ideology’s primary virtue, they preserve their sense of hope by accusing themselves of failing to adhere to that virtue strongly enough. In this way, hoping for a better future causes you to suffer: When a better future doesn’t arrive, it makes you feel worse about yourself.

For example, imagine someone buys a new video game that gives them a feeling of hope in life. They adopt success in that video game as their primary virtue and spend all their time playing with other gamers who are just as obsessed with winning in that game. This gamer feels proud and validated every time they rise on the game’s online leaderboard, until they’re one of the top 1,000 players in the world. Then, without the ability to improve their skills more, they lose the pleasure of progress. However, instead of abandoning the ideology of virtual domination and quitting the game to find something more fulfilling to do, they emotionally punish themselves for failing to get better at the game, falling into a state of perpetual suffering.

> **Ideological Disappointment in Romantic Relationships**
> 
> Often, these same dynamics play out in toxic relationships. In _Getting the Love You Want_ , Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt explain that the personality type you’re attracted to is based on an idealized version of your caregivers from childhood. For this reason, when you fall in love with someone, you’re likely to see them as a perfect source of love, overlooking their flaws. This causes you to falsely believe that investing in this person will result in a painless future—a perfect “happily ever after." In this way, romantic relationships are two-person ideologies in which one becomes the other’s primary virtue and source of hope (Manson explicitly acknowledges this in his book).
> 
> However, at a certain point, as the chemical rush of new love wears off and your partner’s flaws become impossible to ignore, they no longer give you the hope of a perfect future. Just as in broader ideologies, this may cause you to blame yourself rather than the other person or the relationship itself. This is particularly common among those with an anxious attachment style, who habitually idolize their partner and demean themselves. People with an anxious attachment style are unlikely to abandon the “ideology” of their relationship and find a new one because they see the relationship as vital to their well-being—in other words, it has been one of their main sources of hope.
> 
> If the anxious attacher continues to believe that they’re responsible for all the relationship’s flaws instead of appropriately holding their partner accountable and finding someone better, they’ll continue to seek love and validation from someone who will never fully give it to them, trapping themselves in a miserable relationship.
> 
> To avoid getting stuck in this kind of romantic relationship, communicate your needs directly so that compatible partners know how they can support you. Further, promise yourself that you’ll break up with anyone who isn’t invested in helping you fulfill those needs—this mirrors Manson’s advice to abandon ideologies that no longer serve you. Remind yourself that there are plenty of wonderful potential romantic partners in the world, so there’s no need to cling desperately to one who’s treating you poorly.

#### Hope Causes Us to Make Others Suffer

According to Manson, when ideologies fail to bring about a better future, adherents don’t just blame themselves—often, they also _blame the members of a competing ideology_. In other words, they come to believe that everyone would be living lives free of pain if it weren’t for the people preventing them from pursuing their primary virtue further. Every ideology does this to some extent.

Furthermore, **there’s no way to decouple hope from interpersonal conflict.** Hope requires you to constantly progress toward a better future. For this reason, after you’ve done everything possible to pursue your primary virtue in your own life, the only meaningful pursuit you have left is to battle against others with conflicting goals. In other words, **dominance over others is the only never-ending source of hope.**

This has been the cause of all conflict and warfare throughout history, insists Manson. Every time a nation tries to conquer another, or a religious group crusades to convert or kill those of another faith, it’s because such an endeavor gives them hope. If you allow hope to be the primary motivation behind your actions, you’ll inevitably end up hurting people in the name of a greater good that doesn’t exist.

> **Humans Don’t Need Ideology to Hurt Each Other**
> 
> Some evidence suggests that most of the time, humans don’t even need the promise of a painless future to cause each other to suffer. In _The Lucifer Effect_ , Philip Zimbardo argues that most of those who committed history’s most cruel atrocities didn’t do so because they were ideologically motivated or looking to blame and dominate a member of a competing ideology. Rather, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Zimbardo asserts that in the right conditions, our immediate surroundings can disrupt our sense of morality on a biological level, causing anyone to willingly inflict extreme suffering on someone else.
> 
> Specifically, you’re extremely likely to commit evil if a nearby authority figure is ordering you to do something immoral and if you can’t be held accountable for your actions. Zimbardo cites the famous Milgram experiment, in which a psychologist ordered volunteers to administer electric shocks to a “fellow volunteer” (who was an actor pretending to be shocked). When the psychologist agreed to take full responsibility for the experiment and ordered the volunteer to keep administering more painful shocks, 65% of volunteers shocked the actor into unconsciousness. They were willing to severely hurt—or even kill—another person just because someone “important” was there giving orders and taking responsibility.
> 
> That said, Zimbardo also acknowledges that group norms can pressure us into doing evil, too. To make sure your group’s ideology doesn’t coerce you into conflict or violence, Zimbardo advises being more critical of your group than others to counteract our natural bias. If you find yourself in a group that doesn’t share your morals, leave and find another group as soon as you can.

### Stage 3: A Happy Life Without Hope

If we need hope to cope with the pain of existence but hope inevitably causes us to suffer and to force other people to suffer, what’s left for us to do? Manson argues that **the only moral way to live is to return to a life without hope** —that is, to pursue a life of pain _without_ expecting it to result in a less painful future. Instead of finding meaning by trying to bring about a more pleasant future, you can find meaning by having a positive impact _right now_.

But how do you define a “positive impact”? Manson acknowledges that this “hopeless” worldview is an ideology, like the others, in the sense that it has a primary virtue: _meaningful human life_. He argues that this is the only primary virtue that doesn’t require you to cause suffering to attain it. At every second of the day, work to help yourself and all others 1) live a meaningful life and 2) protect everyone’s ability to live a meaningful life.

This philosophy is unique compared to the hope-based ideologies we’ve been discussing in that **it involves living for the present moment.** Instead of working toward a better future, strive to immediately make someone’s life better at all times. Manson acknowledges that such a life is rarely painless, but it always feels meaningful.

> **Live in the Moment, Plan for the Future**
> 
> In _How to Live_ , Derek Sivers (_Anything You Want_) argues that while it’s important to live in the moment, there are many benefits to living for the future, as well.
> 
> Many of the most effective ways you can help others live meaningful lives have no immediate positive impact. In these pursuits, have hope that your actions now will pay off in the long term (contrary to Manson’s argument). For example, practicing a skill like drawing won’t do much good for others when you’re first learning, but after you’ve practiced for 10 years, you’ll be able to create art that powerfully enriches others’ lives. Similarly, if you want to save money for your children to go to college, you should invest your savings now and avoid touching them for years.

> Conversely, Sivers asserts that too often, we treat the future like a garbage dump, pushing our problems forward in time instead of solving them now. Doing this does direct harm to the meaningful lives of the next generation—including your children.
> 
> Sivers offers practical suggestions to help you consider the future. First, put a picture of your face and the faces of your loved ones through an age progression filter and keep these photos somewhere you can see them often. This will motivate you to take care of those people, who won’t exist for many years. Additionally, for every choice you make, imagine what your life would be like if you repeated that choice forever. Every choice you make helps build a habit, and you want those habits to have good consequences down the line.

#### How to Practice a Life Without Hope

To live a life without hope, Manson recommends following one rule: **Never use a human (including yourself) solely as a means to some other goal.** This means that under no circumstances is it justified to sacrifice someone else’s ability to live a meaningful life. For example, you could morally campaign to get a responsible political figure into office, but you could never morally assassinate a cruel political dictator to do so—this would be using that dictator’s human life as a means to achieve your political goal.

Manson asserts that this life philosophy will also radically improve your relationship with yourself. When you treat _your meaningful life_ as your primary virtue, you take care of yourself—for instance, by exercising, eating well, and getting enough sleep—not because you hope it’ll help you feel pleasure later, but because you know it’s good for you now. In contrast, doing hard drugs and degrading your body for pleasure is immoral because you’re abusing your body as a means to experience pleasure.

> **Manson’s Ideology Is Paradoxical**
> 
> You could argue that Manson’s ideology is self-contradictory. This ideology is a deontological theory—in other words, it argues that certain actions are inherently right and some are inherently wrong, no matter what context there is to justify those actions. As a deontological theory, Manson’s ideology is subject to the _paradox of deontology_ , which points out that sometimes, it’s impossible to do something morally right without doing something morally wrong.
> 
> For example, imagine you see someone with a gun about to shoot into a crowd, and you realize you need to quickly incapacitate them to protect the crowd’s meaningful lives. However, hurting the armed shooter would be using that person’s meaningful life to accomplish some other goal—would Manson say this is immoral?
> 
> This paradox equally applies to your relationship with yourself. Sometimes, it’s necessary to harm or sacrifice yourself to protect the meaningful life of others. Pushing your child out of the way of a moving car is risking your meaningful life in service of another goal—would Manson say this is immoral?
> 
> However, the alternative _consequentialist theories_ , which hold that actions are morally right or wrong depending on how good their end result is, have their own flaws. As Manson has described, the excuse of sacrificing yourself or others for some “greater good” can justify actions that cause extreme suffering. These are questions with no easy answers.

#### A Future Without Hope

Manson acknowledges that **humanity will never unanimously embrace this “hopeless” mindset** , and thus, we won’t be able to stop the conflict and violence currently plaguing the world. Humanity as a whole is addicted to hoping for a better future, and it’s willing to destroy itself to do so. This hope-fueled destruction takes place on every scale: countries going to war, cities failing to take care of their citizens, and family members abusing one another.

Ultimately, Manson argues that there’s only one potential solution to this problem: **We must wait until artificial intelligence (AI) gains supreme control over the world.** While this sounds ridiculous at first, Manson insists that once artificial intelligence is advanced enough, it will gain the ability to improve itself by creating better artificial intelligence. At this point, AI will reach a level of intelligence we can’t comprehend: It will understand the universe at such a deep level that it will be able to mold it into whatever shape it decides to.

Manson is optimistic that an AI-controlled world would be ideal for us. Humanity is so bad at governing itself that machines would almost certainly do a better job. Manson anticipates that artificial intelligence will dramatically transform our world into an unrecognizable form, and that afterward, we’ll be better off.

Even if artificial intelligence is our only hope as a species, we don’t need to worry about it. As we’ve established, you have all the tools you need to live a meaningful life without regard for the future at all. Simply live for the moment, fulfilled by the constant pursuit of the preservation of meaningful human life.

> **Manson Is a Dataist, Others Are Techno-Humanists**
> 
> In _Homo Deus_ , Yuval Noah Harari also considers the possibility that artificial intelligence will evolve to the point that it controls our lives. He explains that the philosophy that supports this vision of the future—the philosophy Manson asserts here—is called “Dataism,” as its highest value is the ability to process data and use that data to transform the world. This view holds that humans are valuable because they’re complex data processors, but eventually, it would be best to step aside and allow more powerful data processors—artificial intelligence—to shape the universe.
> 
> Harari also describes an alternative philosophy to Dataism that could also steer the future of humanity, known as techno-humanism. Rather than allow AI to control the world, techno-humanists want to use technology to enhance human biology and help us better run the world.
> 
> Although Manson would likely argue that techno-humanism would just give fallible humans more power to abuse, it’s possible that technological enhancements would help us circumvent the problems with hope that Manson describes in his book. For example, if you were to use technology to enhance your consciousness enough to predict the future in significant detail, it’s possible that you could avoid being deluded by false hopes and make wiser decisions.
