## 1-Page Summary

Do you want to cultivate a healthy relationship with your child? Do you wish you had the tools to understand them better? In _The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read_ , Philippa Perry offers guidance for strengthening your bonds with your child and raising an emotionally secure individual. She argues that you can improve your parent-child relationship no matter your child’s age by examining how _your_ parents’ style of parenting impacts your own, listening to your child, and meeting them with respect and understanding.

Perry is a British psychotherapist, writer, and TV and radio presenter. She worked in the mental health field for 20 years before being published, and she raised a daughter. Her other books on therapy and relationships include _How to Stay Sane_ , _The Book You Want Everyone You Love to Read, _and the graphic novel _Couch Fiction, _which her daughter illustrated _._ Additionally, she writes a weekly advice column for _The Guardian_ called _Ask Philippa_ where she answers reader-submitted questions about life and relationships.

In this guide, we’ll discuss how to foster a strong, loving parent-child relationship. Additionally, we’ll explore ways to positively influence your child’s behavior, including the way they treat themselves and the way they learn to resolve conflicts. In our commentary, we’ll examine parenting advice from other authors and look deeper into some of the psychological principles underpinning Perry’s ideas.

### Developing Your Parent-Child Relationship

**According to Perry, you shouldn’t view a child as someone to manage, but rather as an individual with whom you plan to maintain a close bond for the rest of your life.** Maintaining this bond full of love and connection requires you to regularly confront your emotions, understand how your past affects your present, and recognize how your actions affect your child.

> **Characteristics of a Strong Bond Between Parent and Child**
> 
> According to some parenting experts, the following are characteristics of a strong parent-child relationship:
> 
> **1) Showing your child that you love them unconditionally.** If they don’t feel like they have to earn your love, they’ll be able to make mistakes, learn, and grow in a healthy way. To do this, you must be emotionally available for them (which means confronting your own emotions and past experiences, as Perry suggests).
> 
> **2) Offering your child respect.** This means listening to their needs, setting clear expectations with them, and explaining the consequences when they don’t meet those expectations. Finally, recognize the effect of your own actions and admit when you’re wrong (as Perry suggests).
> 
> **3) Being flexible in your parenting.** Your child will change as they grow, and so will their wants and needs. Parent based on your child as they are now, not based on who they were or who you want them to be. Additionally, recognize that different parenting techniques work for different children—there’s no one-size-fits-all approach.

In this section, we’ll explore some of the areas of parenting Perry identifies as particularly important for securing your parent-child bond: addressing how your upbringing affects your relationship with your child, creating a secure attachment bond with your child, teaching your child to process their feelings, and making amends for your mistakes.

#### Area #1: Addressing How Your Upbringing Affects Your Parenting

Perry argues that **your upbringing affects how you relate to your child.** Emotions related to any harm your parents caused you will probably return in your experiences raising your child. This happens when your child’s actions remind you of something you did or experienced around the same age. You’ll likely relive the emotions you felt when your parents didn’t give you the attention, love, or support you needed when you exhibited the same behavior.

(Shortform note: You may not only feel emotionally triggered by your child’s behaviors that remind you of _your own behavior_ as a child. You may also experience strong emotions when they exhibit behaviors that directly mirror how your parents acted when you were young. For example, if your parents often yelled at you growing up, you might respond with aversion, fear, or anger if your child raises their voice at you. Additionally, everyone involved in raising your child will be triggered by different things because you all had different experiences growing up. This can sometimes cause conflicts between parents, as the different ways you were raised lead you to respond to your child’s behavior differently.)

Often, instead of processing these emotions from past experiences—such as sadness that your parents didn’t give you what you needed—you’ll experience another strong, negative feeling toward your child. This might be anger, disgust, frustration, envy, resentment, or fear. You might not know why you’re reacting that way, but you can’t help it. For example, maybe your child becomes deeply interested in dinosaurs, and he wants to tell you facts about them around the clock. For reasons unknown to you, you find this annoying. It becomes so grating that you eventually snap at him, even though you know it’s unfair.

**These negative emotions are defense mechanisms you’ve developed to avoid reliving what you went through at the same age.** Your need to avoid the emotions you experienced in the past leaves you unable to empathize with your child, instead driving you to focus on an emotion that’s easier to feel (like anger).

(Shortform note: Why is anger so common as a defense mechanism against more difficult emotions? First, anger is by nature protective—it speeds up your heart rate, increases blood flow to your hands, and prompts the release of energy-fueling hormones like adrenaline, all of which prepare you to take action against danger. When you experience a more vulnerable, raw emotion such as sadness or fear, you might perceive that emotion as a danger to your well-being. Maybe it makes you vulnerable to another person in a way that’s uncomfortable, or it represents a truth you aren’t ready to face (such as a bad childhood experience). Once you perceive this danger, anger steps in to defend you.)

##### Putting It Into Practice: Decipher Where Emotions Belong

Perry states that**your past doesn’t _have_ to rule your relationship with your child**—if you examine and reflect on your childhood and allow yourself to feel the accompanying emotions, you can avoid passing the same issues down the family line.

Every time you feel an unpleasant emotion resulting from your child’s behavior, take it as a cue to think about any other possible sources for that feeling. Pause instead of expressing the emotion, step away from the situation, and take some time to reflect. Ask yourself if the emotion fits the present situation or if it’s related to something that happened to you in the past. What’s preventing you from understanding and empathizing with your child’s perspective? This will help you avoid acting on the negative feelings and emotionally harming your child in the process.

For example, after snapping at your child to stop talking about dinosaurs, you feel bad, so you think about where your annoyance stems from. Upon reflecting, you remember that when you were the same age, your parents rarely took the time to listen to what you were interested in—they always brushed you off or shushed you so they could continue talking about their interests. Instead of snapping the next time, you engage your child in a conversation about dinosaurs so he knows you’re interested in what he cares about.

(Shortform note: This process that Perry describes reflects healthy emotional self-regulation—our ability to control emotions and impulses, rather than immediately acting on them. It’s important for our mental and social well-being. People who aren’t emotionally self-regulated may display emotional outbursts, frequently overreact, experience prolonged negative emotions, and have mood swings. Luckily, it’s a skill that anyone can practice. The basics of an emotionally regulated response follow the same pattern as Perry’s exercise: Notice the intensification of your emotions, pause to assess the consequences of responding in different ways, and choose a path forward that will lead toward a positive outcome.)

> **How to Observe Feelings Mindfully**
> 
> As you note down strong feelings you experience, consider using these three tips to observe them with curiosity. These techniques will help you understand the source of the emotions and help you pause so you don’t act on them rashly:
> 
> **1) Observe the feeling as if you were an outsider looking in.** Has the feeling intensified at any point? Are you having any physical sensations as you experience the emotion? This technique reminds you that your emotions don’t control you—you can act as a spectator.
> 
> **2) Name what you’re experiencing out loud.** For example, you might say something like, “I observe frustration. There’s tension in my forehead and I’m clenching my teeth.”
> 
> **3) Remind yourself that the feeling isn’t inherently good or bad** —it’s simply there.
> 
> In addition to identifying negative emotions related to your child’s behavior, look for automatic negative thoughts, which appear based on a stimulus and without conscious thought. These thought patterns may give you more insight into where the emotion is coming from and help you reframe it.
> 
> For instance, along with your annoyance as the parent of the dinosaur-loving child, you might experience the automatic thought, “He should know when to stop talking. He’s going to annoy other people, and it’ll be embarrassing.” Instead of accepting that thought as truth, recognize it and refute it. Remind yourself that he’s just excited about his interests, and his excitement indicates positive traits like curiosity and passion. Additionally, you can teach him to give space for others to talk, but other than that, it doesn’t matter what other people think.

#### Area #2: Understanding Attachment Styles

Perry argues that **another important aspect of developing a strong, lifelong parent-child bond is helping your child form the right attachment style.** According to attachment theory, babies are born with the ability to bond with other humans, and they take their cues for how to do this from their parents. The way their parents interact with them in this early stage of life—when they’re learning _how_ bonds are formed—determines how they’ll relate to others throughout their lives.

(Shortform note: Attachment theory was first developed by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s. In _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , Jonathan Haidt describes how Bowlby studied maladjusted and orphaned children in post-World War II Europe. He found that love was paramount to a child’s development. Children who’d been deprived of the love of a parent because of the war struggled to form healthy relationships. They were either cold and distant or tended to form close attachments to anyone who showed them the slightest attention.)

When you’re consistently offered affection, fed, comforted, and attended to as a baby, you tend to form a **secure attachment style**. You grow up able to trust and connect with others, and you believe in people’s goodness. This generally makes relationships and other aspects of life much easier.

(Shortform note: In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk states that in addition to forming healthy relationships, securely attached individuals are more resilient in the face of life’s challenges. They understand when they have control over a situation and when things are out of their hands, and they have a sense of agency. This sense of agency gives them confidence that they have control over their emotions and can change their circumstances.)

If you weren’t cared for consistently as an infant, you may develop an _unhealthy_ attachment style, such as the following:

  * **Insecure attachment:** If you had to cry for long periods to get your parents’ attention, you’ll likely grow up feeling like the only way to get others’ attention is to be bold and forceful when expressing your needs.
  * **Avoidant attachment:** If your cries went unanswered, you probably eventually stopped trying to get your parents’ attention. You may develop a sense of isolation, believing that you won’t be heard or understood by anyone. Therefore, you grow up feeling like there’s no point in letting people get to know you well.
  * **Dismissive attachment:** If the attention you received was harmful or abusive, you might grow up feeling like other people are always a threat to you. 



> **A Closer Look at Unhealthy Attachment Styles**
> 
> Van der Kolk expands on the three unhealthy attachment styles in _The Body Keeps the Score_ :
> 
> **Anxious/insecure attachment:** He uses the term “anxiously attached” for the individuals Perry calls insecurely attached. Anxious attachment is a _type_ of insecure attachment. He states that people with this attachment style tend to be victims of bullying by their peers.
> 
> **Avoidant attachment:** According to van der Kolk, this is also a type of insecure attachment. Avoidantly attached individuals become adults who aren’t in touch with their feelings or others’ feelings, and they often become bullies as children and adults.
> 
> **Disorganized/dismissive attachment:** What Perry calls dismissive attachment, van der Kolk calls disorganized attachment. It forms when a baby fears their caregiver—they’re stuck between needing that caregiver for survival and being scared of them. Therefore, the baby doesn’t know how to engage with their caregiver.
> 
> Children with disorganized attachment often become aggressive or disengaged and exhibit related physical symptoms, including increased heart rate, high levels of stress hormones, and weakened immune systems. As adults, people with disorganized attachment can’t distinguish whom they can trust from whom they should fear, so they may be overly affectionate with strangers or distrustful of everyone.

##### Putting It Into Practice: Consider Your Own Attachment Style

Perry states that **the ideal is to create a secure attachment with your baby.** To do this, think about what _your_ attachment style might be. Do you form close, secure attachments with people, or do you struggle with this? If your experience is the latter, you may need to be more mindful about forming your relationship with your baby to create a secure attachment with them.

(Shortform note: If you’re unsure where to begin when discovering your attachment style, consider taking an online assessment. This could give you a baseline for understanding what your traits and behaviors indicate. You can also speak to a therapist to learn more about your attachment style. Many therapists use attachment theory in their practice because of the interconnected nature of mental health and relationships.)

##### Putting It Into Practice: Respond to Your Baby’s Cries

Second, Perry states that **the best way to create a secure attachment is by consistently responding to your baby’s cries.** Babies can only express themselves by crying out. They can’t soothe themselves, nor do they have object permanence (our ability to discern that something exists when we can’t see it). Therefore, they can’t reason with themselves and know that you’re still close to them if you’re not within their sight. When no one responds to them, they feel alone and scared.

(Shortform note: Other parenting experts agree that consistently responding to your baby’s cries is an important way to ensure your baby feels safe and cared for. This is especially important in the first few months of life—babies don’t begin to develop object permanence until seven or eight months old. Another way to instill a sense of safety in your baby is by talking to them. They may not understand what you’re saying, but your voice will be calming and reassuring. Additionally, babies learn about the world through touch, so give them a lot of cuddles and kisses when soothing them.)

Responding to babies’ cries is how you show them that they’re safe—they learn how to soothe themselves when you’re consistently comforting them and showing them that you’re there for them. If, in contrast, you frequently let your baby cry for long periods without going to them, Perry argues that they’ll eventually stop crying because they’re suppressing the feelings that make them cry—not because they’ve learned to calm down in a healthy way.

(Shortform note: Babies learn self-soothing from their parents at the neurological level. Neural pathways that deliver soothing neurochemicals form when babies experience parental soothing. When babies are left unattended for long periods when crying, these pathways may not form in the same way, making it more difficult for them to manage their emotions, anxiety, and behavior throughout their lives.)

#### Area #3: Teaching Your Child to Acknowledge and Name Their Emotions

According to Perry, **recognizing, naming, and respecting your child’s emotions is a key way to form a strong bond with them and raise them to be mentally healthy individuals.** By doing this, you teach them how to understand, regulate, and express their emotions in a healthy way, which is an important part of their development.

(Shortform note: The practice of noticing a child’s emotions and using them as opportunities for teaching and intimacy is called emotion coaching. Years of research suggest that children are healthier and more successful in all aspects of life when their parents employ this technique with them. If you want to start emotion coaching, consider using specific prompts that validate and soothe your child's emotions—you can find numerous examples online.)

##### The Different Ways We Deal With Emotions

Perry states that typically, **parents who have trouble handling difficult emotions fall into two categories: They suppress their feelings, or they react disproportionately.** If you tend to suppress your feelings, you’ll be more likely to do the same to your child, either by dismissing their feelings or telling them they should feel something different. Because this makes the child feel like their emotions are insignificant or undesirable, they’ll likely avoid expressing feelings to you in the future.

If you tend to react disproportionately, you might become overwhelmed by your child’s emotions, getting upset and crying with them. You take on their emotional state. In this case, your child may stop expressing their emotions to you because they feel like they’re upsetting you too much or you’re unfairly seizing their feelings.

(Shortform note: To avoid becoming overwhelmed by your child’s emotions, consider using the following steps. First, take a deep breath to center yourself before you engage with your child. Second, remind yourself that your primary goal is to help your child calm down and to build a closer relationship with them, not to add to their emotional turmoil. Third, refrain from taking your child’s feelings personally, especially when they’re upset with you—they’re not fully developed and aren’t capable of self-regulating their emotions like you are. Fourth, use a mantra to calm yourself down. For example, you might tell yourself, “This is not an emergency, but an opportunity to help.”)

Ideally, you recognize and respect your child’s feelings by naming and affirming them (which we’ll further discuss below), instead of denying them or making the emotions your own. When you’re able to do this, your child will feel understood and comforted instead of criticized. Over time, as you continuously show respect for their feelings and offer them love and understanding, they’ll learn to work through their emotions and comfort themselves.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that as you’re working on letting your child feel all of their emotions and helping them through the experience, you should remember that limiting your child’s behavior isn’t the same as limiting their emotions. Behavior is separate from emotions, and you should teach your child that though it’s OK to feel any emotion, not all forms of expression for those feelings are OK. For example, you might teach them that it’s OK to be upset, but it’s not OK to hit someone to show them that you’re upset with them. You set the behavioral limit that hitting isn’t OK, but there’s still no limit to what they’re allowed to feel.)

> **How Hiding Your Negative Feelings May Affect Children**
> 
> Expressing negative emotions in a healthy way is better than suppressing them in front of children, according to some research. A study conducted on 109 parent-child pairs found that suppressing stressful emotions made parents less positive partners during a collaborative task.
> 
> First, the parents completed a public speaking task and received negative feedback, which was meant to induce stress. Then, researchers directed them to complete a Lego project with their child. The children had written instructions but weren’t allowed to touch the Legos, and the parents had to put the Legos together—this meant the pairs had to work closely with each other.
> 
> Researchers told a random selection of the parents to suppress their feelings of stress from the public speaking task during the Lego activity. These parents didn’t offer as much help or warmth to their children, and the children in these pairs were less responsive to and positive with their parents. This suggested that the children picked up the negative emotions more strongly when their parents tried to hide their feelings instead of expressing them.

##### Putting It Into Practice: Name Your Child’s Emotions

**Perry says to practice naming your child’s emotions when they’re upset to show that you understand them and to show them how to do it for themselves.** As you do this, remember to consider their age and how it affects their ability to express themselves.

Your child may react in a way that seems irrational to you, but their feelings are as valid as anyone else’s. For example, say your child falls and hits their knee. They have a small scrape, but you can tell they aren’t seriously hurt. Still, they begin to cry inconsolably. You might feel tempted to tell them not to cry or that their scrape is no big deal because it hurts you to see them so upset. However, this likely won’t comfort them since to them, the injury feels like a real danger. They might stop crying to please you, but they won’t feel understood.

Instead, acknowledge their feelings by saying something such as “You hurt your knee and I see that made you feel scared.” This shows them that you’re in tune with their feelings, they’re allowed to feel that way, and you’re there to support them. Over time, they’ll learn to name their emotions themselves.

(Shortform note: There are many different ways to respond empathetically to your child and help them name their feelings. For example, you might state what you perceive they’re feeling outright: “You’re feeling [emotion] because of [event or circumstance].” Alternatively, use the phrase, “It sounds like you’re feeling…” to acknowledge that you might not be right in your observation.)

> **How Children Express Emotions at Different Ages**
> 
> As Perry notes, children express their emotions differently depending on their age. From the time your child is born to the age of nine months, they’ll primarily use vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to communicate their emotions and needs to you. For instance, they might cry to indicate discomfort or squeal to indicate joy.
> 
> Between seven and 18 months, they’ll likely begin expressing themselves more intentionally. For example, they might push away food that they don’t like, or they might hug you when they’re scared or want to show affection.
> 
> Between 16 and 24 months, they’ll probably start using a mix of gestures and language to express their emotions, such as smiling, clapping, and verbally expressing pride about something they accomplished.
> 
> By the time they’re 21 to 36 months, they may start describing and naming emotions themselves. Additionally, they’ll likely start acting out emotions while they’re playing pretend and demonstrating more complex emotions, such as guilt.

#### Area #4: Making Amends When You Make a Mistake

Perry argues that, though you should strive for the emotional stability and empathy displayed in the above strategies, being a good parent isn’t about behaving perfectly all the time. You’ll occasionally react in an unhelpful way, hurt your child’s feelings, or misunderstand your child. **What’s most important for your parent-child relationship is that you acknowledge your imperfections and make amends for the harm you cause.**

Some people think that to feel safe, a child needs to believe their parents don’t make mistakes. However, this belief is faulty—children need you to model honesty and humility for them, not perfection. If you act as if you’re always right and never acknowledge your mistakes, you risk making your child feel like you don’t care about their feelings or that they’re responsible for your moods.

Your child’s intuition will likely tell them when you’re wrong, but your refusal to acknowledge it will make them question the validity of their feelings, increasing the likelihood that they’ll suppress them later. This may negatively affect the way they relate to other people, leading them to accommodate other people’s needs over their own.

> **Why You Shouldn’t Ignore Your Mistakes (And Why You _Should_ Admit Them)**
> 
> As Perry suggests, ignoring your mistakes as a parent can have serious consequences for the way your child relates to others. If you make a habit of never acknowledging or actively denying any time you’re wrong, that can become gaslighting—a manipulation tactic that conditions victims to doubt their perceptions by consistently refuting them. No matter how good your intentions are toward your child, this pattern of behavior can make them more susceptible to emotional manipulation and gaslighting in their other relationships, since they’ve become used to doubting their reality. This leaves them vulnerable to abusive relationships.
> 
> There are several benefits of admitting when you’re wrong as a parent beyond demonstrating honesty and validating your child’s feelings. For instance, when your child sees you admitting your mistakes, it makes them feel like they can make mistakes too. This reduces the chance they’ll become a perfectionist, which can lead to anxiety, difficulties in school and work, and low self-worth. Additionally, admitting your mistakes makes you stay accountable as a parent and a person—when you acknowledge wrongdoing, you’re less likely to repeat the same behavior.

##### Putting It Into Practice: Change Your Behavior and Apologize

**To make amends for mistakes, Perry says to start by apologizing to your child and explaining what you did wrong, why you did what you did, and what you’d do differently.** Then, change your behavior—figure out what prompted your unfair reaction or the misunderstanding, and act differently the next time a similar situation arises.

(Shortform note: When making amends with your child, the following tips from parenting experts may be helpful: First, acknowledge any hurt feelings they may have. For example, you might say, “I’m sorry, I know I upset you.” Second, explain the circumstances behind your reaction. This isn’t making an excuse—it’s giving your child the context they need to feel compassion for you and see that you’re human. For example, you might tell them that you snapped at them because you had a hard day at work, but that doesn’t make it OK. Third, be specific when telling them what you’ll do to ensure that the same thing doesn’t happen again. For example, you might promise that you’ll take a deep breath before reacting the next time.)

### Shaping Your Child’s Other Relationships

In the last section, we discussed different methods for forming a close bond with your child. In this section, we’ll explore two areas of parenting Perry identifies for helping your child develop healthy relationships with themselves and others:

  1. Assessing how you speak about yourself and how that might influence your child
  2. Modeling healthy conflict resolution so your child feels safe and secure



#### Area #1: Assessing How You Speak About Yourself

**According to Perry, the way you speak to yourself has a big impact on your child’s relationship with _themself_. **Children model their behavior on the behavior of their parents, so if you tend to speak negatively about yourself, your child will likely develop that behavior as well.

For example, say you have an inner belief that you’re not very smart. Even if it’s not true, it makes you feel deeply insecure. Therefore, anytime someone compliments you for your cleverness or skills, you make a self-deprecating comment diminishing your intelligence. Likewise, anytime you make a mistake, you take it as evidence that confirms your self-assessment.

You don’t treat or think of your child the same way, so you don’t think about how your comments about yourself affect them. However, over time, you might notice they stop trying very hard in school, they’re afraid to make mistakes, or they frequently minimize their intelligence. By watching you put yourself down, they’ve learned to do the same.

(Shortform note: Some psychologists assert that you should think of your child as if they’re an alien observing and cataloging everything that you do. When your child arrives in this world, they (like an alien) have no inherent understanding of language or social customs—they learn it all from you. They learn how to fit in by imitating the behaviors they see in you because that’s what they perceive as normal. This includes negative self-relationships.)

##### Putting It Into Practice: Address Negative Self-Talk

**To set your child up to have a positive self-relationship, you must address the negative ways you treat and speak to yourself.** Perry states that the first step is to recognize your patterns of negative self-talk. These patterns often go unnoticed because they’re embedded in your self-image, so it’s important to consciously identify them. Start by writing down every negative thought you have about yourself for a day.

Once you’ve identified a negative thought, don’t try to reason with it—engaging with it will take up too much of your energy and be unproductive. Instead, acknowledge the thought and pretend it’s an uncomfortable comment made by a person whose opinion you disagree with. Remind yourself that they can share their opinion, but you don’t have to listen.

(Shortform note: One way to take power from your inner critical voice is to give it a name as if it’s a person. This will help you visualize it as something outside of yourself, as Perry suggests. Additionally, ascribing a silly name to it will make it seem less threatening, making the thoughts seem silly as well.)

Then, prove the thought wrong by doing something it claims you can’t do. By doing the thing that feels impossible, you build your confidence and create evidence to look back on when you begin to question yourself again. For instance, returning to our previous example, you might start working on the book you’ve always wanted to write despite the negative thoughts that tell you you’re not smart enough to be an author.

(Shortform note: You can also collect evidence against negative thoughts by moving your attention away from them and toward positive things you’re already doing. Praise yourself for five things you do well a day, whether for simply getting out of bed, exercising, having a nice conversation, and so on. Praising yourself consistently will help reframe your thoughts away from constant criticism.)

> **Examples of Common Negative Thought Patterns**
> 
> Negative thought patterns can be difficult to recognize since they’re so automatic. Look for these common patterns, and write it down any time you observe one in your thoughts:
> 
> **Overgeneralizing.** This is when, in response to a situation, you think that something bad _always_ happens to you or something _good_ never happens to you. These thoughts contribute to a defeatist mindset that precludes positive change.
> 
> **Ignoring positive experiences.** This leads you to always feel inadequate or underappreciated since you can never recognize when something is going well for you.
> 
> **All-or-nothing perspective.** In this thought pattern, you see everything in extremes. If something isn’t perfect, then it’s a failure.
> 
> **Jumping to conclusions.** This is when you have a negative thought or a feeling and you form a conclusion based on it, even if there’s no evidence to support it.

#### Area #2: Modeling Healthy Conflict Resolution

Just as it’s important to teach your child to interact with themselves in a healthy way, Perry argues that it’s important to teach them how to treat others, especially during conflicts. It’s inevitable that there will sometimes be conflicts in a household, whether between two parents, between a parent and a child, or between two other people. Having conflicts isn’t inherently an issue—it’s the way you _approach_ these disputes that matters.

Conflict resolution has a large effect on your child’s feelings of security and safety. If conflicts are consistently handled in nonconstructive, dysfunctional ways, a child may feel emotionally insecure in their home space—unable to relax because they never know when the next conflict will happen. As they’re always on alert, they may find it hard to be open and curious when interacting with the rest of the world.

> **How Handling Conflict Predictably Helps Children**
> 
> Resolving conflict predictably makes a child feel emotionally and physically safe, according to Nathaniel Branden in _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_. The rules don’t constantly change, and the parents act relatively stably. (In the context of conflict resolution, this might mean consistently using the same methods for handling disagreements and not reacting volatilely.)
> 
> Growing up in a predictable environment supports the development of self-efficacy: If children can accurately predict what will happen in their home, they learn that their mind is useful and trustworthy. When they trust their mind, they grow confident in their judgment, and they can approach new people and new things with curiosity instead of fear.

To model healthy conflict resolution for your child—whether you’re in a disagreement with them or with someone else—Perry suggests paying attention to your language.

##### Putting It Into Practice: Avoid Accusatory Statements

**According to Perry, when bringing up an issue, it’s best to avoid accusatory statements about what the other person did wrong.** Using accusatory language can make them feel as if you’re creating a narrative and you’re unwilling to hear their point of view.

Instead, use first-person pronouns and focus on how the situation makes you feel. For example, instead of saying, “You never help with the laundry, and that’s why the house is a mess,” say, “I’d appreciate it if you helped more with the laundry because it’s hard for me to keep everything tidy myself.”

> **Further Benefits of “I Statements” and Advice for Conflict Resolution**
> 
> Non-accusatory “I statements” have additional benefits beyond showing that you’re open to other points of view. First, these statements help you assert your needs without making the other person feel blamed or defensive. They also show that you’re in control of your emotions. Additionally, they’re solutions-focused: Instead of sending the message that there’s something wrong with the other person and they need to fix it, you’re sending the message that you have a problem you’d like to find a solution for together.
> 
> Finally, “I statements” can help move a conflict along by prompting reciprocity. We have a psychological tendency to reciprocate what someone gives us, including communication. This means that if you speak in a non-confrontational, feelings-focused manner, the other person will likely mirror your behavior.
> 
> Additionally, when working through a conflict in front of your kids, ensure that you resolve the conflict in front of them too. If the resolution happens where they can’t see it, they won’t get the full benefit of seeing you work things out, and they won’t be able to learn from it. Likewise, they won’t get any closure on the disagreement, so they might worry that it’s still happening.
