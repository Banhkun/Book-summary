Do you think the world can still be organized into two classes, Proletariat or Bourgeoisie, or the oppressors and the oppressed? Why or why not?

What are the pros of the Communist viewpoint? What are the cons?

Are there situations in which the pros outweigh the cons? Why or why not?

Do you think any of the criticisms of Communism are valid? Why or why not?

How do Communist principles address the problems of modern-day capitalism, such as wealth inequality and extreme poverty? If you don't think Communism can address modern-day problems, what are some alternative ways to address them?
