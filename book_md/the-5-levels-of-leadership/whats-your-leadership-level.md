## What’s Your Leadership Level?

You’re only as good as the lowest level of leadership you’ve mastered. Use this assessment to gauge where you are on your leadership journey.

(Shortform note: We’ve created our own short assessment to quickly find what level of leadership you’re on. You can take Maxwell’s four-part assessment here or in the book.)

Read the following statements and determine if each one is true for you. Before you do this exercise, think about the one person on your team whom you have the most work conflicts with. You’ll think about how this person perceives you.

#### Level 1: Title-Based

  * I never justify decisions I make for my team by declaring that I have the final say as the boss.
  * I am honest about my areas for improvement and open to learning as much as I can to become a better leader.
  * I step out of my office to meet my team members where they are, showing my interest in and appreciation for them.
  * ****____**** (my problem person) sees me as their leader and trusts my authority.



If all the statements are true, then you’ve probably started moving up to the next levels of leadership. If not, Level 1 might be the starting point of your journey.

#### Level 2: Relationship-Based

  * I make the effort to get to know people whether or not I’m a people person.
  * I treat people as I want to be treated, giving them praise and encouragement, and including them in decisions that affect them.
  * I don’t wait for my team members’ annual evaluation to address issues or problems and instead give them feedback as the need arises.
  * ****____**** would say I know about their lives outside of work.



If all the statements are true, then you can move on to the next level. If not, continue with the next questions, but understand that your true level of leadership is still the lowest level at which you still have weaknesses, even if you have competencies at higher levels.

#### Level 3: Results-Based

  * I know what strengths I need to leverage or develop to help my organization achieve its goals.
  * I clearly and frequently communicate a well-defined vision to my team members.
  * I am always thinking of ways to develop my team members and finding the best roles where they can maximize their strengths.
  * ****____**** has shown improvement since becoming part of my team.



If all the statements are true, move on to Level 4.

#### Level 4: Empowerment-Based

  * I can spot talent and have a good gauge of people’s potential and willingness to grow.
  * I give my team members the tools and resources they need to do their jobs well and grow in their roles.
  * I regularly mentor the top performers on my team.
  * I have team members who have been training and mentoring other team members as a result of my mentorship and influence. 



If all the statements are true, move on to Level 5.

#### Level 5: Legacy-Based

  * I help others hone their leadership skills and give them the opportunity to lead.
  * I have a succession plan in place.
  * I act according to the legacy I want to leave behind.
  * I have someone on my team who can replace me if needed—and do well at the job.



Tally your answers to see the number of “yes” answers you have in each level. The more “yes” answers you have, the stronger you are in that level, but Maxwell mentions that you’re only as strong as the lowest level of leadership you’ve mastered. This means that, if for some reason, you score equally on both Levels 2 and 3, your starting point should be Level 2.

(Shortform note: This assessment also serves to give you an overview of the areas where you’re weak. If you score high in Level 3 but low in Level 2, for example, it might mean that you’re good at getting results, but you have to work on developing relationships with your team members.)

> There are many other leadership assessments to gauge different areas like strengths, weaknesses, style, and relationships. Here are some you can try, based on your current level of leadership:
> 
>   * **Level 1** —try this test if you’re new to leadership and are still trying to determine your style.
> 
>   * **Level 2** —communication is crucial to building relationships. This assessment will help you deepen your understanding of yourself and others and improve your interactions.
> 
>   * **Level 3** —find out if blind spots can be getting in the way of your team’s performance.
> 
>   * **Level 4** —your implicit biases might be getting in the way of people development. Take this test, developed by Harvard, to determine if you have biases that you may not be aware of.
> 
>   * **Level 5** —just because you’re at the peak, it doesn’t mean there’s nothing left for you to learn. Evaluate and improve the way you perform under pressure with this quiz.
