## Exercise: Become a More Productive Leader

Go from being just a high-production worker to a high-production leader.

* * *

List all the qualities you look for in your team members, then do a self-check. For each quality, determine if it’s something you already have or something that you need to improve. Write an action statement for each desired trait that you have to work on. For example, beside “detail-oriented,” write, “Re-read all documents before I send them out.”

List all your responsibilities. Which of them make up the 20% that produces 80% of your results and therefore deserves most of your focus?
