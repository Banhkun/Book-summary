## Shortform Introduction

**What makes a good leader?** Some say you’ll know one when you see one; others confuse being a leader with simply having a title. In this book, author John C. Maxwell gives a shape and form to something seemingly indefinable. He culls his knowledge and experience to come up with **the 5 Levels of Leadership, a** **roadmap to help you reach your full leadership potential.**

### The Book’s Publication

_The 5 Levels of Leadership: Proven Steps to Maximize Your Potential_ was published in 2011 by Center Street. The book references principles from _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ , one of Maxwell’s most popular books.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

In the first chapter, Maxwell writes that he started thinking about the importance of leadership in 1976. It took him five years to come up with the framework for the 5 Levels of Leadership, and it became the most sought-after topic for his lectures. He states that he has taught the concept to all types of organizations in over 120 countries. In response to the interest from lecture attendees, Maxwell gathered the principles into a book.

#### Intellectual Context

Maxwell isn’t the only author to write about “Level 5 leadership,” the highest form of leadership in his system. Jim Collins devotes a chapter to the topic in his book _Good to Great_. While Maxwell references Collins’s work in _The 5 Levels of Leadership_ , it’s unclear whether one inspired the other. _Good to Great_ was published in 2001, 10 years ahead of _The 5 Levels of Leadership_ , but Maxwell states that he began developing his concepts in 1976. There is no mention of Maxwell in Collins’s book.

Both authors state that Level 5 leadership is about leaving behind a legacy, but their hierarchies differ. Maxwell applies his five levels only to management and doesn’t take individual contributors (non-manager employees) into account, while Collins starts with individual contributors, works his way up to management in Level 3, and discusses leaders in Levels 4 and 5. Maxwell also believes that you build on preceding levels, so it’s not possible to go from Level 1 to Level 4 without mastering Levels 2 and 3. In contrast, Collins writes that it isn’t necessary to move in sequence, but he does believe that you need to embody all levels to be considered a Level 5 leader.

Below is a comparison of the two authors’ concepts:

| **Maxwell** | **Collins**  
---|---|---  
**Level 5** | **Legacy-based leadership:** Has a reputation for developing strong leaders and organizations  | **Executive:** Funnels personal ambition into company success   
**Level 4** | **Empowerment-based leadership:** Develops other people  | **Inspiring leader:** Motivates subordinates to perform better in pursuit of a vision   
**Level 3** | **Results-based leadership:** Gets things done  | **Effective manager:** Organizes people to achieve objectives   
**Level 2** | **Relationship-based leadership:** Has earned people’s trust  | **Productive team member:** A team player who uses individual skills to achieve team objectives   
**Level 1** | **Title-based leadership:** Has been given a role  | **A capable individual contributor:** Contributes through knowledge and skills   
  
We’ll continue comparing Maxwell’s and Collins’s concepts of the levels throughout the guide.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Reviewers who appreciate the book say that it’s a quick and easy read, and that it clearly breaks down the different levels, offering tips that you can immediately apply.

Reviewers who are critical of the book argue that it doesn’t present anything new and that it can be repetitive. Some take issue with how the book tells readers _what_ to do without going into detail about _how_ to do it. (For example, Maxwell tells readers to channel personal productivity into leading a productive team without giving concrete ways to help team members become more productive themselves.) Others point out the lack of scientific basis, as the principles are based largely on anecdotal evidence and on Maxwell’s own experience, which some see as limited to his career as a pastor.

Maxwell’s definition of leadership has also received some criticism. Maxwell believes that leadership is influence—the more influence you have, the more effective you are as a leader and the higher up the leadership ladder you can go. He doesn’t delve deeply into the topic of influence in this book, perhaps because he’d already covered it in an earlier book, The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. Here, he writes that you can only be a leader if you have followers, and you can only have followers if you have influence. While he discusses the factors that make up influence (character, knowledge, intuition, experience, past success, and ability), he never defines what it is. A _Harvard Business Review_ article offers a definition that seems in line with Maxwell’s idea of influence: using a strong emotional connection to affect the character, development, or behavior of others.

Even though Maxwell devotes a chapter to discussing influence and leadership in _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ , it’s his snappy one-word definition that has become mainstream. However, some experts take issue with this oft-quoted definition, saying it’s an oversimplification. For example, coach, speaker, and professor David Burkus argues that it’s too broad, using a salesperson—someone who can influence others to make a purchase—as an example of a non-leader. Similarly, bestselling author Kevin Kruse points out that a mugger with a gun also has influence over his victim. In both instances, the kind of influence that people wield isn’t the kind associated with leadership.

Burkus goes further, saying that Maxwell’s definition doesn’t differentiate between good leaders and bad leaders. If leadership is merely influence, he says, then there are no bad leaders, and there’s no difference between Martin Luther King Jr. and Adolf Hitler.

Both critics thus expand Maxwell’s definition to include the pursuit of a goal. For Burkus, leadership is “the process of influencing others to work toward a mutually desired vision,” which eliminates non-leader influencers like salespeople, and weeds out bad leaders whose followers are just reluctantly going along. Meanwhile, Kruse narrows down the type of influence to _social_ influence, adding that it should be used to maximize the efforts of others to accomplish a goal.

Perhaps Maxwell recognized that his original definition was lacking and sought to expand it as well. In a blog post, The John Maxwell Team acknowledges that influence can work either positively or negatively and writes that being a great leader “is all about having a genuine willingness and a true commitment to lead others to achieve a common vision and goals through positive influence.”

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_The 5 Levels of Leadership_ starts with Level 1, positional leadership, which is the type of leadership that comes with a job title. This assumes that readers have already worked their way up to a title. While some tips are general enough to be applied by anyone at any level, Maxwell doesn’t have any advice for those who wish to gain a foothold in the first rung of leadership.

As is typical of books in the leadership genre, _The 5 Levels of Leadership_ cites ideas and anecdotes from other books to support its concepts. The book’s strength lies in its ability to give a clear picture of the leadership hierarchy and what it requires. It also breaks down some leadership concepts like building self-awareness, nurturing relationships, and communicating effectively into more concrete, actionable tips.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Maxwell writes that you first have to master one level before moving on to the next, saying that you build upon the previous level. The book thus follows this logical flow, moving from the foundational principles of Level 1 leadership to Level 5 leadership, which encompasses all the leadership behaviors and qualities of the previous four levels. Each chapter covers one leadership level and discusses:

  * **Upsides** —the positive aspects of each level
  * **Downsides** —the negative aspects of each level; the higher you go, the fewer downsides there are
  * **Best behaviors** —how to make the most of each level
  * **Laws of leadership** —the related principles from _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_
  * **Beliefs to help a leader move to the next level** —ideas that you must embrace to be able to progress
  * **Guide to growing through the level** —actionables to help you get to the next level



The final chapter of the book is a portrait of a Level 5 leader, Coach John Wooden, a basketball Hall of Famer who led the UCLA Bruins to 10 NCAA titles in his last 12 seasons as a coach.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Similar to Maxwell’s organization, this guide begins with the foundational qualities of Level 1 leadership and progresses through the wider circles of influence to Level 5. For additional clarity, we’ve synthesized and reorganized the section material. In particular, we’ve combined the sections “best behaviors,” “beliefs,” and “guide to growing through the level” to merge similar points and address overlaps in their principles. Because the Laws of Leadership are not always directly related to the leadership level being discussed, we’ve only referenced them where they’re particularly applicable. We also didn’t include the final chapter about Coach John Wooden. While a good demonstration of Maxwell’s Level 5 leader, the information presented in the chapter doesn’t further develop any of the principles.

When exploring Maxwell’s principles, we’ve sought to address the criticism that the book is heavy on the _what_ but not on the _how_ by linking his principles to ideas in other works that either add the _how_ or give Maxwell’s principles greater depth. We’ve also included findings from other works, such as Collins’s _Good to Great_ , that offer counterpoints to Maxwell’s ideas to give an expanded view of leadership.
