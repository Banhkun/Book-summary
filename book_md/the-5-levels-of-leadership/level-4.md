## Level 4: Empowerment-Based Leadership

Maxwell says that people are an organization’s greatest asset. Tap into their potential and bring out the best in them, and you also bring out the best in the organization. This is why at Level 4, which he calls People Development, **you shift your gears from being a producer to a developer of people**. The time you spend developing others will pay off not just by multiplying production but also by giving you the greatest fulfillment.

(Shortform note: Collins finally calls those at Level 4 “leaders” and shares a similar view that those on this level inspire their subordinates to perform better. But to him, this is all in pursuit of a vision—there is no mention of personal fulfillment.)

### Pros of People Development

Maxwell writes that the upsides of developing people are:

**1\. It puts you ahead of the pack.** Businesses have a fairly even playing field when it comes to physical resources—they can purchase the same equipment and continuously upgrade it to stay in step with their competitors. But what businesses can’t copy is their competitor’s people. If you invest in developing skilled, dedicated employees, your organization will come out ahead of the competition.

> **The Best Companies Invest in Their People**
> 
> If you need proof that investing in people yields great results, look no further than some of the most enduringly successful companies. In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins gives examples of visionary companies that have invested heavily in training their people:
> 
>   * IBM built a 26-acre Management Development Center where employees learn about the IBM Way.
> 
>   * Marriott built a fully equipped Learning Center where new employees took part in total immersion training programs and managers joined refresher courses.
> 
>   * Disney has Disney University, where every employee attends “Disney Traditions” seminars to train them in all things Disney.
> 
> 


**2\. It makes growth sustainable.** If you had to go on sabbatical, would your team be able to stay productive? Would they be able to keep going at the same pace without you around? If your answer is no, then that means that production lives and dies with you—and that’s no way for an organization to grow. When you don’t train others to become leaders, you limit the organization’s potential. Your productivity may bring your organization success, but it’s your development of other leaders that will sustain it. Learn to recognize people who can do what you’re doing, then coach, encourage, and inspire them to take on more responsibility.

(Shortform note: While Maxwell recommends training people to do what you do, Simon Sinek argues in _Start with Why_ that succession shouldn’t necessarily be about skills or current position. He believes that successors should be chosen based on their alignment with the organization’s _why_. Otherwise, they won’t be able to communicate the organization’s values and mission to other people, which will eventually lead to stagnation.)

**3\. It empowers others to unlock their potential.** There are two ways people can be limited as leaders: Either they’re a leader only in name and lack the drive or skill to empower their people, or they’re driven and skilled but choose not to share responsibility with anyone else. Both put a cap on an organization’s growth.

If you’ve already proven your competence as a Level 3 leader, you need to start recognizing that sharing your load gives others the opportunity to fulfill their own leadership potential. This will benefit not only your people, but also the organization (which will have more competent leaders) and you (as sharing the load will lighten the weight of your responsibility). Throw everything you have into developing your people, from providing training to giving them the right tools and environment to grow, but also be clear that you can’t do the work for them—they need to commit to the process.

> **How to Empower Your Team Members**
> 
> In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano writes that financial rewards aren’t enough to motivate team members to perform better. Instead, you have to make them feel engaged and autonomous. He gives some actionables for you to help employees feel more empowered:
> 
>   * Regularly ask them what kind of resources or training they need to become more successful.
> 
>   * Ask employees about their onboarding experience, and improve training for new hires accordingly.
> 
>   * Ask employees for input about policy or process changes that would give them more leeway to act.
> 
>   * Encourage knowledge-sharing by holding workshops where employees can coach each other.
> 
> 


**4\. It gives you time for more important work.** When you’re caught up in the daily grind, you don’t have time to think about ways to make an organization better. But when you develop leaders and cede some responsibilities to them, you free up quality thinking time, which you can then use to refine the vision, improve your strategies, and find more ways to grow your organization. It’s a paradox: By letting go of something, you gain something greater.

It’s natural to feel hesitant when you’re considering sharing the load, but it’s the only way forward. Ease your worries by using the 80% rule: Entrust tasks to those who can do them at least 80% as well as you do. Done is better than perfect, so as a leader, you’ll need to let pragmatism rule.

(Shortform note: If you’re having a difficult time letting go of perfectionism, research suggests that you might want to limit it to self-oriented perfectionism—setting very high standards just for yourself. Having other-oriented perfectionism may disrupt team dynamics, putting pressure on those who feel you have unrealistic expectations.)

**5\. It makes you feel fulfilled.** Developing people isn’t one-sided. While others will benefit from your guidance, you’ll also get a great amount of joy, satisfaction, and a sense of community from helping others.

> **How to Find Fulfillment**
> 
> In _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey writes that you can only feel fulfilled when you satisfy four fundamental needs:
> 
>   * **Physical.** You need to keep both your body and your finances in good shape.
> 
>   * **Social.** You need to develop deep, intimate relationships.
> 
>   * **Mental.** You need to continuously grow and learn, even after you’ve completed your formal education.
> 
>   * **Spiritual.** You need to embrace the principles of reciprocity and service, and find meaning in helping others.
> 
> 


### Cons of People Development

Developing people entails maturity and commitment on your part. Maxwell lists the challenges you’ll need to overcome in Level 4:

**1\. You have to think beyond yourself.** Level 4 leadership requires you to give up self-centeredness. You have to start thinking about other people, shifting your mindset from, “How can I get ahead?” to “What can I do to help others get ahead?”

(Shortform note: This requires you to become what author Liz Wiseman and researcher Greg McKeown call a multiplier: a leader who uses her intelligence to bring out the intelligence and abilities of everyone else. You assume that your team members are talented, knowledgeable, independent, and good decision makers, and find ways to tap into their talents. Read more about how to become a multiplier instead of a diminisher in our guide to Multipliers.)

**2\. You need to let go of insecurity.** Maxwell writes that insecure leaders are constantly worried that someone will replace them and so they’re not interested in developing other people. To determine if insecurity is holding you back from being a Level 4 leader, reflect on the following areas:

  * **Ego.** Do you happily listen to other people’s ideas? Accept when their ideas are better than yours? Give credit to others when your team experiences success? Take accountability for your team’s failings? If your answer is no, then you need to learn to keep your ego in check.
  * **Control.** Do you micromanage? Insecure leaders are very controlling because they’re worried that their people will make mistakes, but you can’t break new ground if you’re unwilling to take risks. Change your mindset and think of mistakes as learning tools that can aid in your team’s growth.
  * **Trust.** Insecurity breeds distrust, and it’s hard for a team to do good work when there’s an atmosphere of distrust. You can’t take risks and make big strides if you’re always worried that someone will drop the ball. And once you lose trust, it’s very hard to get it back. 



> **Keep Your Ego in Check**
> 
> The book _Ego Is the Enemy_ defines ego as an unhealthy belief in your own importance. If you’re occupying a leadership role, you might have a bloated sense of self-importance, which can get in the way of success. Author Ryan Holiday offers some tips to manage your ego:
> 
>   * **Never stop learning.** When you feel like you’ve made it, you might think you know it all. But the skills and knowledge that got you to your current level won’t be enough to keep you there or to propel you to the next level.
> 
>   * **Keep your eye on the prize.** New roles come with new opportunities, which may or may not help you reach your goals. Whenever something new comes your way, evaluate whether it will contribute to or distract from your priorities.
> 
>   * **Don’t feel entitled.** Remember that the only things you’re entitled to are the ones you already have.
> 
>   * **Learn to delegate.** You might want to control everything because making decisions makes you feel important. But micromanaging takes your time and focus away from the bigger things that contribute to your goals.
> 
>   * **Maintain a balance.** Find the sweet spot between being relentlessly ambitious and complacent.
> 
> 


**3\. You need to be committed.** Maxwell writes that Level 4 leaders can’t coast. They have to perform consistently and excellently, build and train a team, empower other potential leaders, and be invested in their development. It’s hard work that requires 100% from you.

(Shortform note: Author Daniel H. Pink writes that extrinsic rewards like higher pay and awards may not be enough to keep you going, so you’ll need to tap into some intrinsic motivation. In _Drive_ , he writes that this inner motivation is made up of three components: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.)

### Maximizing People Development

Maxwell writes that only those with leadership experience can develop other leaders. That means you need to first work your way through Levels 1 to 3 before you can implement these Level 4 best behaviors:

**1\. Recruit the best people.** You can’t create a winning organization if you don’t have strong players who are willing to grow and who are a good fit for the organization. To gauge people’s potential, consider:

  * **“Fit”** Do you like this person enough to invest time in mentoring him? Will he get along with the rest of the team? 
  * **Character** —Can this person align his actions with his intentions?
  * **Bandwidth and Abilities** —Can this person handle stress? Does he have the necessary skill, thinking ability, leadership, and positive attitude? Can you motivate and train him so that he can reach his potential?
  * **Contribution** —Will this person go above and beyond his job description? Will he help the people around him perform better? 



(Shortform note: In _First, Break All the Rules_ , Marcus Buckingham asserts that when hiring people, you should prioritize talent—something they’re inherently good at—over knowledge and skills, which come from experience and education. To find the best people to fill positions in your team, Buckingham recommends thinking about the talents that your team needs to improve their collective performance. Maxwell says something similar, stressing that it’s important to know exactly what kind of person you’re looking for. You shouldn’t hire someone who’s exceptionally talented in a role that you don’t require.

  * Example: If you’re a basketball coach and your team isn’t winning because you don’t have good shooters, you won’t go out and recruit a great defensive player, even if he’s the best you’ve ever seen.) 



**2\. Know where to put them.** Aside from recruiting the people that your team needs, you also need to position them strategically. It’s a process, so take your time and don’t be afraid to move people around. This is similar to one of the best behaviors in Level 3, which is about making sure that you put people in places where you can maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses.

(Shortform note: Sometimes a promotion or a new role means being put in charge of an entirely new team where you had zero input in the hiring process and have zero knowledge of their skills. In this situation, Buckingham says that you first need to figure out what talents you need in specific roles. Then observe your team members to determine their strengths and weaknesses—you can save time by asking team members directly. And finally, assign roles based on their strengths. Read our guide to First, Break All the Rules to learn how to build a stronger team.)

**3\. Give your people the tools to do their jobs well.** Don’t just tell them what to do. You can help them grow into their role by following these steps:

  * Step 1—Be competent at the job yourself.
  * Step 2—Show them how to do the job.
  * Step 3—Let them do the job while you’re there to coach them.
  * Step 4—Leave them to do the job. This is where empowerment comes in. You trust and believe in them, while holding them accountable.
  * Step 5—They come full circle and now show someone else how to do the job.



> **Help Future Leaders Develop Other Virtues**
> 
> If you want to develop other leaders, go beyond helping them become more productive. _The Ideal Team Player_ lists three essential virtues to help them improve:
> 
>   * **Humility.** Encourage them to compliment other people and to admit when they’re wrong.
> 
>   * **Hunger.** Don’t wait until their annual evaluation to give them feedback about their performance. Inspire passion by showing them how their work has an impact on others, and encourage them with praise when they start showing more motivation.
> 
>   * **People skills**. Have those with strong people skills coach those who need work in this area.
> 
> 


**4\. Don’t just focus on their work life.** There’s more to life than work. As a Level 4 leader, you need to recognize the importance of helping your people develop life skills so that they’ll achieve success in all areas of their life.

(Shortform note: This may be especially crucial for the younger workforce—according to author Yuval Noah Harari, today’s schools put an overemphasis on teaching technical skills, neglecting to teach the “four Cs” of communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. Read our guide to 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to learn how to navigate today’s challenges.)

Maxwell says that you can evaluate any weaknesses and help your people overcome them by:

  * Assessing—Are there any holes in this person’s life skills? Are there any negative influences in this person’s life? In what areas does this person seem to need help? If you’ve established yourself as a Level 2 leader, you should be able to spot areas for improvement.
  * Challenging—If you’ve gained their permission to lead them and have modeled success, they’ll be more open to accepting challenges to help them improve. These challenges can include reading books, attending conferences, and meeting with you for mentoring.
  * Supporting—Keep an open-door policy, letting people know that they can come to you for mentoring.



> **Should You Get Involved in Your Team Members’ Personal Lives?**
> 
> According to research, nearly half of employees say that personal problems affect their work performance. Does this mean that you need to step in and get involved? Yes—but only to an extent. Here are some tips to help both of you handle the situation:
> 
>   * Determine if work is adding to employee stress, and see if there’s anything you can do to address it.
> 
>   * Focus on work performance instead of delving into the personal issue, and ask them to seek assistance if necessary. Some workplaces might have support services for their particular situation.
> 
>   * Show compassion, but keep in mind that you’ll have to extend the same assistance to other team members who may be going through the same situation.
> 
> 


**5\. Gauge where they are on their leadership journey.** How can you tell if your people are ready to handle being empowered? One way to measure it is by determining how independent they are. When something happens, do you:

  * Have them report to you and you decide what to do?
  * Have them report to you, along with their recommendations?
  * Have them inform you what they plan to do, and wait for your go signal?
  * Have them inform you what they plan to do, and give them the freedom to go ahead unless you say no? 
  * Trust them to take action, then let you know what they did?
  * Trust them to take action without your involvement?



Your goal is to be able to trust them to take action without your involvement.

> **When Empowerment Might Not Work**
> 
> Empowerment—trusting employees with decision-making and seeking their input—is often associated with better performance and job satisfaction, but a Harvard Business Review article argues that it has its limits. Empowerment is more effective when you want to boost employee creativity and increase trust in the leader. It also seems to work better on newer employees, as they’re more eager to impress. On the other hand, empowerment doesn’t make a difference when it comes to improving the performance of routine, core tasks and may even be harmful—employees may feel burdened by the additional tasks. Employees who have been at their jobs for longer are also less receptive to it.

**6\. Prioritize people with potential.** Many leaders find themselves spending much of their time managing the “problem children” in their team—the bottom 20% who may be underperformers or troublemakers. Switch it around and instead start focusing your attention on the top 20%, because they are the key to growth. Once you’ve identified those with the most potential, start dedicating as much as 50% of your time to developing them.

(Shortform note: You might think that spending more time with your high performers is unfair to the other employees. But in _First, Break All the Rules_ , the author argues that fairness isn’t about giving everyone the same amount of attention, but giving attention proportionate to a person’s output and success.)

**7\. Make it a clear-cut process.** While Level 4 leaders change and tailor their mentorship according to people’s skills and personalities, it’s just as important to have some clear guidelines that are applicable to everyone:

  * Mentorship should take place every day.
  * It should be quantifiable—there must be some verifiable measures of success.
  * It should motivate them.
  * It should tap into your strengths. You can’t teach them something you’re not good at. Encourage them to find other mentors for areas that aren’t in your areas of strength.
  * It should fit in with their “why.” 



(Shortform note: While your approach to mentorship may vary from person to person, some mentorship practices are universal. The following tips apply to everyone: Be present and stay actively engaged, give honest feedback, motivate them to go outside their comfort zone, and treat them with respect.)

**8\. Be open, humble, and transparent.** When your people feel like they can approach you, they’ll be more open to learning and taking risks. Maxwell writes that being humble also means staying open to growth—just as you’re taking emerging leaders on a journey, you’re also going through your own journey, so you should keep learning.

(Shortform note: According to a _Harvard Business Review_ article, organizations benefit most from humble leaders—those who act in service to their employees. This means you should inquire and listen, be a mentor instead of a boss, and respect each employee’s contributions.)
