## Exercise: Build Anticipation With Three Content Pieces

According to Walker, building anticipation is a crucial part of launching a product. We’ve learned how three pieces of marketing content can be more powerful than one. For this exercise, think about a product or a service you might be interested in selling and practice planning out your three content pieces.

* * *

Describe a product or service you’re interested in offering. Is it a physical product or are you offering a service?

For your first piece: _Why_ should people buy your product or service—what change or transformation are you offering? (For example, if you’re offering vegetable gardening classes, you’ll be helping people _become_ healthier eaters and _transform_ their backyard into a beautiful space.)

What makes you an authority in providing your product? (You might have a degree in horticulture or run a successful community garden.)

For your second piece: _What_ value can you offer your customers? (For example, you could give a quick tutorial with expert advice on how to plant tomatoes.)

For your third piece: _How_ will your product help your customers meet their goals? In what ways can you showcase that? (For example, provide a video tour of a successful garden that someone started from scratch by following your tutorials.)
