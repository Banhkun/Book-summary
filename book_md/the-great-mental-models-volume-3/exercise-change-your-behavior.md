## Exercise: Change Your Behavior

Many of the mental models in this book are concerned with behavior—how it works and how to change it. Let’s look at how you might put these models to work to modify your own behaviors.

* * *

Think of a behavior you want to change or a new habit you’d like to adopt. What feedback loops and/or algorithms drive your **current behavior**?

What feedback loops and/or algorithms could you put in place to lead to your **desired behavior**?

How do you hope your new behavior will compound to create bigger gains in the future?
