## Principle 2: The Cottleston Pie Principle

In the world of Pooh, the Cottleston Pie Principle represents the Taoist ideal of _Inner Nature_ , which encompasses the unique aspects inside everything. Everyone and everything has characteristics inside that differentiate them from others, similar to the way that no two snowflakes are the same. Inner Nature is difficult to comprehend through language, but the ideas are more approachable through the meaning held within Pooh’s song _Cottleston Pie_.

(Shortform note: Although the song is much longer, for the sake of understanding the principle, we’ll only cover the relevant lines.)

Stanza 1—“A fly can’t bird, but a bird can fly.”

Stanza 2—“A fish can’t whistle and neither can I.”

Stanza 3—“Why does a chicken, I don’t know why.”

The three lines translate into the three main principles of Cottleston Pie.

**1\. Allow things to be what they are.**

Everything on earth, including people, have their own purpose and place in the world. When you listen to your Inner Nature, you’re always where you’re supposed to be. But people often try to fit a square peg in a round hole. When you ignore the power of your purpose, you end up where you don’t belong. Think of all the people stuck in jobs, marriages, and environments that don’t serve them. **When you understand who you are, you can find your specific brand of beauty and authenticity that has value in the right circumstances.**

> A story from the writings of Chuang-tse, the second major writer on Taoism, exemplifies this principle:
> 
> A man complains that a large gnarled tree on his property is not suitable for lumber or any use because of its shape and thickness. In his eyes, the tree is useless. But Chuang-tse suggests that the tree is only useless to someone who sees it only as a means for wood to be used elsewhere. This person is missing the benefits the tree provides simply by being a large tree. The large size makes the tree useful for shade. The dense branches could provide shelter from a storm. The intricate shape can be gazed upon for its beauty. The tree is only useless if someone wants it to be.

**2\. Everyone has limitations.**

Your limitations or weaknesses can be blessings when you acknowledge them. **When you recognize and understand your limitations, you can work with them in the right way to make them beneficial and turn them into strengths.** In contrast, ignoring limitations creates trouble for you and everyone around you. When you force yourself in directions or situations you aren’t designed for, you disrupt the natural order of life, which has ripple effects.

An example from the world of Pooh is Tigger’s assertion that tiggers are capable of anything. Tigger tells Roo that he can climb trees better than Pooh, and to demonstrate, he climbs to the top of a tall tree. But once in the tree, he is unable to come down and gets stuck. Everyone else must come and risk their safety to help Tigger get down from the tree.

Acknowledging limitations doesn’t mean you aren’t capable of rising above them. But you must be realistic about what you have to start with. For instance, if you are physically weak, you can grow stronger through any number of activities. But you must accept the present limitations of your muscles to know the right path to move down.

The Chinese have a saying: “One disease, long life. No disease, short life.” Translated, this saying means that **those willing to acknowledge their ailments will take care of themselves, whereas those unwilling to admit that anything is wrong won’t and will perish**.

**3\. Some things cannot be known.**

There are some aspects of life that simply have no explanations that are discernable. Yet, scholars and scientists seek to find answers and labels for everything. And when something about human nature or the world is revealed to have no discernable answer, they call it “instinct.”

You do not need to explain every phenomenon in the universe. You don’t need to ask superfluous questions and force empty explanations. **You simply need to understand the Inner Nature of everything and be willing to trust that things are as they are for a reason.**

### The Problem with Cleverness

In the world of Pooh, Rabbit represents cleverness. But as seen in the example of Pooh, Rabbit, and Piglet lost in the forest, cleverness is rarely suitable for understanding the nuances of life.

Cleverness is inadequate as a method for understanding life. It is knowledge that exists on the surface of things and can be quickly dispensed as judgments or evidence of intellectual supremacy. But life changes deeply at times, and shallow cleverness cannot always keep up. **When you focus on being clever, you miss many significant aspects of life, such as your Inner Nature.**

An example of the failings of cleverness is when Kanga and Roo first come to the forest. At first, Rabbit sees that they are different and dislikes them. Being clever, he devises a plan to get rid of them. But as time passes, everyone sees how much Kanga and Roo have to offer and welcomes them into the group. Rabbit’s clever plan is thwarted, and he has to readjust his initial opinion because of what their Inner Natures revealed.

Rabbit’s inaccurate judgments are reminiscent of many seen in our society. We are easily persuaded into believing that differences are only skin deep, and we concoct clever remarks or ways of separating ourselves from each other. Others become manipulated or influenced by the cleverness of others because they, too, are not looking deeper than the surface. **When you ignore Inner Nature, you make it easier for lines to be drawn between yourself and others. When you accept that Inner Nature exists in all of us, cleverness takes a backseat to acceptance and understanding.**

You must also turn this lens toward yourself. There are always going to be things you don’t like about who you are, but those things do not define you and are not permanent. Every part of who you are is worthwhile in the right context. Once you know who you are, you can decide what to do with it. **Finding alternative uses for your unwanted characteristics is easier than ignoring them or getting rid of them.**

For example, humans work hard to avoid negative emotions because they are painful and jarring. But you can always reshape negative emotions into something positive. Think of feelings like piano keys. When you pound them, you create a chaotic and disturbing noise. But removing the keys leaves you without any music at all. When you play the keys in the right configuration, you can create something beautiful.

This focus on the negative is best represented by the _Eeyore Attitude_. Eeyore focuses on the negative side of everything. He uses knowledge to understand what there is to complain about and cleverness to express his pessimism. For instance, when Pooh wishes Eeyore a good morning, he replies, “Good morning, Pooh Bear, if it is a good morning, which I doubt.”

You may become stuck in the Eeyore Attitude when knowledge and cleverness fail to support the results you want. **Until you are open to seeing what lies beneath the surface of life, you will never understand the true nature and power of the people and world around you and, thus, will never be satisfied.**
