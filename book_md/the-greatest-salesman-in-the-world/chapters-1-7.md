## Chapters 1-7: Background and Hafid’s Life Story

Og Mandino’s 1968 parable _The Greatest Salesman in the World_ preaches 10 principles that can make anyone a great salesperson and give them the opportunity to create vast wealth. The book’s title is slightly misleading—you’ll find no strategies for how to negotiate a cold call or close a deal. Instead, the story “sells” the premise that **becoming a great salesperson means developing a better, stronger version of yourself through good habits, discipline, perseverance, and self-control.** Whether you’re in the sales business or not, these self-development efforts may improve your life.

Half of _Greatest Salesman_ recounts the story of Hafid, a lowly camel boy who yearns for wealth and believes he can acquire it by mastering the art of selling. Hafid builds a vast financial empire based on the teachings inscribed on 10 leather scrolls bequeathed to him by his mentor, a wealthy merchant known for his masterful selling. The book’s other half reveals the scrolls’ lessons, one chapter per scroll. Each lesson serves double-duty as a broader life lesson, which gives the book a broad appeal extending beyond the realm of sales and marketing.

_Greatest Salesman_ is set in the Middle East around the time of Jesus Christ’s birth. Some readers may find the book’s Biblical references off-putting, but you don’t need to subscribe to any particular religious beliefs to benefit from its character-building lessons. Its core message is that **improving your sales numbers—or your life—requires making positive changes to your attitudes, habits, and actions.**

(Shortform note: The word “salesman” was commonly used in the 1960s when Mandino was writing but is considered sexist today. In this summary we substitute “salesperson,” which is better suited to current norms.)

### Hafid Prepares for His Death

Hafid, a wealthy old man nearing the end of his life, asks his bookkeeper to account for the total amassed wealth in his treasury and warehouses, then convert it into gold and donate it to the poor. Hafid wants to keep only enough so he can comfortably live out his remaining days.

The bookkeeper knows that Hafid has always given money to the needy, but this request seems extraordinary. Still, he does as he’s instructed and liquidates Hafid’s empire. Afterward, the two men go to a secret room in Hafid’s palace, where Hafid shows the bookkeeper a cedar chest filled with 10 leather scrolls, each containing a secret lesson that, when studied, could teach anyone how to become the greatest salesperson in the world and earn untold wealth. Hafid has used these scrolls’ lessons to make himself rich.

As a young man, Hafid was given the scrolls by his mentor, but they came with strict stipulations. Hafid had to swear to give away half of his profits to the poor, and he was not allowed to share the scrolls’ secrets. He was instructed to study the scrolls and use them to his benefit, then keep them hidden away until a special person came along—someone who desperately needed their teachings. Hafid would recognize this person by a mysterious sign and know it was time to pass on the scrolls.

Hafid needs to fulfill the promise he made to his mentor before he dies, but his successor—the scrolls’ new owner—has not yet come.

### Flashback—How Hafid Obtained the Scrolls

Hafid recalls how he came to possess the scrolls. As an orphaned young boy, he works as a camel attendant for a great trade merchant, Pathros. Hafid tells Pathros he wants to move up from his “lowly position” to become a seller of goods, someone who can make money to support the family he will someday have.

Pathros tries to discourage Hafid, telling him that material wealth is not as important as it seems, that what matters most is loving others, being loved, and finding peace and happiness. Hafid agrees, but confesses that he has fallen in love with a girl, the daughter of a wealthy man, and being a lowly camel boy, he has no chance of wooing her.

Hearing this argument, Pathros relents and agrees to give Hafid the chance to learn how to sell. But Pathros says Hafid’s path will not be easy; a salesperson’s life is difficult and lonely and the job is filled with challenges and obstacles. Hafid will need to prove himself worthy.

Pathros tells Hafid to report to the caravan’s baggage wagons to pick up a red goat-hair robe from the vast inventory of goods. Then Hafid must travel by donkey to Bethlehem to sell the robe for a minimum of one silver denarius, and he must do it within four days. Pathros’s parting advice to Hafid is a refrain that echoes throughout the book: **If your will to succeed is strong enough, you will not fail.**

#### Hafid’s Quest to Sell the Robe

On Hafid’s fourth day as a robe seller in Bethlehem, he is despondent. He has not sold the robe, and no one will listen to his sales pitch. He starts to doubt himself, thinking he should give up his dreams and return to his job as a camel boy. But when he remembers the girl he loves, he renews his resolve to become a successful merchant. He decides to get up before dawn and work harder to sell the robe.

As Hafid heads to the cave where he intends to sleep for the night, he encounters a young couple with a newborn baby. They’re shivering from the cold, and the parents don’t have enough clothing to keep themselves and the baby warm. Hafid hesitates, then decides he must do the right thing—he takes his precious goat-hair robe and wraps it around the baby. The grateful mother kisses him.

A strangely bright star lights up the night as Hafid heads back to Pathros’s merchant caravan, but Hafid barely notices it because he dreads facing Pathros. Hafid believes he has failed his master by giving away the robe instead of selling it.

#### Hafid Confesses to Pathros

But when Hafid reaches the caravan, Pathros is outside his tent, staring up at the brilliant star illuminating the sky. He remarks on this bright star and asks Hafid what occurred in Bethlehem. Hafid relates his story, and to his great surprise, Pathros doesn’t chastise him. Instead, he looks up at the star and kindly tells Hafid he has not failed.

Moved by the young boy’s generosity and the amazing celestial event, Pathros believes that Hafid is the rightful heir to Pathros’s secret treasure—10 leather scrolls spelling out how to be a master salesperson. Pathros gives Hafid the scrolls and sends him out into the world to make his fortune.

As Chapter 7 ends, Hafid is alone in Damascus, opening the box of scrolls for the first time. He is filled with fear and doubt that he can’t live up to Pathros’s legacy, but then he remembers his mentor’s advice: **If your will to succeed is strong enough, you will not fail.** Hafid begins to read the first scroll.
