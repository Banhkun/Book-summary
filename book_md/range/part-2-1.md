## Part 2.1: The Generalist Explores and Experiments

By now, you’ve seen why the traditional path to excellence—early specialization—is misguided and outdated. Luckily, Epstein has outlined a new path to excellence—a formula to help us thrive in the modern world. He argues that this generalist approach is effective _even for narrow domains in which hyperspecialization seems necessary,_ such as sports or music.

Instead of picking one skill and trying to stick with it for your whole life, Epstein suggests that you:

  * Explore and Experiment
  * Specialize Inefficiently
  * Be Prepared to Pivot



In Part 2 of this guide, we’ll examine each of these life stages in turn.

Epstein asserts that the first step to mastery is an era of exploration and experimentation with different activities—a “sampling period,” as he calls it. Musicians, entrepreneurs, and athletes alike benefit from a period of early exploration.

This exploration provides you with two valuable benefits: It gives you a broad range of experience and ensures that you’re a good fit for the activity you decide to pursue.

#### Benefit #1: A Broad Range of Experience

Epstein establishes the principle that **broad learning teaches transferable skills**. Basic training in a wide range of activities teaches a unique kind of skillset—one founded on instincts and principles that apply across disciplines rather than habits that apply in only one context.

A period of broad exploration provides robust expertise that is transferable to unfamiliar situations. In some cases, it even leads to greater skill than someone who narrowly specialized. To prove this, Epstein dives into the world of professional musicians.

One of the greatest groups of musicians in history was the _figlie del coro_ , a classical ensemble in 17th-century Venice comprised entirely of orphaned girls. The _figlie_ performed for royalty, had pieces composed specifically for them by greats such as Vivaldi and Haydn, and were widely regarded as the finest musicians in the world. The _figlie_ ’s success wasn’t due to extreme amounts of deliberate practice.

Epstein recounts that the girls only had formal lessons three days a week, although they were allowed to practice in their spare time—which wasn’t much. The orphanage eventually devoted more time to music practice after the _figlie_ became famous, but at first, **the orphans were only allowed to practice for an hour a day** , in between schoolwork and chores.

According to Epstein, **what made the _figlie_ ’s training uniquely successful was the number of different instruments they were required to learn. **The girls were encouraged to learn every instrument the orphanage owned, and many achieved virtuoso-level skill on multiple instruments.

This same phenomenon has been studied among modern-day musicians. A study conducted at a high-level music boarding school found that the highest-performing students didn’t practice more than others, took fewer formal lessons, didn’t start playing at a younger age, and didn’t even come from musical families. **Instead, what set them apart was the number of instruments they knew how to play.** The most**** exceptional students typically spread their practice time across three instruments.

> **The Limits of Transferable Learning**
> 
> While there is evidence in favor of broad learning across musical instruments, it’s important to note that there are limits to how “broad” transferable learning can be.
> 
> Back in 1923, psychologists distinguished between “near transfer” and “far transfer” of learning, based on the principle that experience can transfer proportionally to the number of similar elements shared by two activities. For example, you can use your knowledge of how to drive a car to learn how to drive a bus—near transfer. Similarly, Epstein asserts that near transfer allowed the _figlie_ to transfer their musical skills across surprisingly dissimilar instruments, for instance, from singing to the violin. The two skills have enough in common for near transfer to function. Far Transfer, on the other hand, would be like transferring your chess experience to better learn mathematics, and it’s been largely debunked.
> 
> In the 19th century, Latin was a core component of an American schoolchild’s education because it was assumed that learning Latin would make children “smarter” overall. Many people still hold the belief that learning something like chess or piano will somehow enrich your overall cognitive faculties, and some studies have confirmed this assumption.
> 
> However, in 2016, a couple of researchers conducted a meta-analysis of these studies and found that many of them fell prey to a common fallacy—they mistook correlation for causation. Successful students enjoy playing music or chess because they’re stimulating activities; it doesn't necessarily make them smarter. When these studies were adjusted under more narrow conditions, the correlation all but disappeared.
> 
> Still, as we’ll see in the rest of this guide, there are plenty of reasons to practice generalism, even if most of your specific skills don’t transfer from one discipline to another.

Epstein suggests that broad learners create “abstract models” based on the commonalities across activities, internalizing skills that apply in multiple contexts. Narrow specialists, on the other hand, merely learn to repeat what they’ve already seen done.

For example, children learn to talk by hearing the rules of grammar implicitly applied in a broad variety of contexts. They don’t learn by repeatedly practicing selected sentences over and over, like formal music students do in deliberate practice. In the same way, musicians that learn multiple instruments discover a greater understanding of music that applies in all contexts.

> **Does Knowing Two Languages Help You Learn a Third?**
> 
> Recent science shows that, just as it’s easier to learn a third musical instrument after you’ve played two, it’s easier to learn a third language if you’re already bilingual.
> 
> A study from Israel compared two groups of sixth-graders—one group of immigrants from the former Soviet Union that spoke both fluent Russian and Hebrew, and one group of natives who only spoke Hebrew. Interestingly, the kids who spoke Russian were not only better at learning English, they were more proficient in Hebrew than the native speakers who only spoke Hebrew.
> 
> Additionally, if you learned your second language later in life, you gain the additional advantage of discovering which language-learning strategies best work for you, whether that be a focus on reading and writing, conversing with native speakers, or even watching foreign movies.

#### Benefit #2: You’ll Discover a Good Fit

Epstein emphasizes the importance of what psychologists call “match quality”—whether an activity is a good fit for an individual or not. **An activity that’s a good fit for you is one that suits your inherent talents, and more importantly, it’s something you’re excited about pursuing.**

Epstein argues that taking time to explore your options is worth it to discover a life direction that suits you. To demonstrate this, he cites a study that compared match quality between education systems in Great Britain. At the time, students in England and Wales were required to pick a specialty before they went to college, while Scotland required its students to explore multiple fields throughout the first two years of college. How did the two groups compare?

English and Welsh students were far more likely to switch career fields than Scots, since they weren’t given the chance to find a good fit earlier in their education. This shows that they were significantly dissatisfied with the careers they picked in high school—enough to sacrifice the years of specialized knowledge they had accumulated. **Finding a good fit was more valuable to them than the money and success they could earn with specialized skills.** Early exploration allows us to discover activities that are more likely to make us happy.

> **Attempts at Broad Learning Outside of Scotland’s Universities**
> 
> Scotland’s emphasis on broad learning isn’t restricted to its universities. Since 2010, students in Scotland aged 3 to 18 have been taught according to the “Curriculum for Excellence,” notable for the freedom given for individual schools to design their own curriculums and its minimal standardized testing. These changes were intended to put greater emphasis on critical thinking rather than test-oriented narrow memorization.
> 
> However, a 2021 OECD report declared the current implementation of this curriculum a failure, prompting another wave of reform. The main problem, according to the report, is the lack of effective administrative oversight. As we discussed earlier, it’s difficult to standardize an education in non-disciplinary thinking. Simply providing students the freedom to stumble upon subjects with high match quality isn’t enough.

Extending this idea, Epstein suggests that parents should nurture exploration in their children, allowing them to discover what’s a good fit for themselves. Eager parents try to get their kids to skip the era of exploration by choosing lifelong pursuits for them as early as possible—often a particular musical instrument or sport.

However, an externally-imposed specialization is far less likely to be a good fit than one you choose for yourself. A study of 1,200 musicians showed that kids who had their destinies chosen for them were far more likely to quit later down the road.

Speaking more broadly, the fewer limitations put on children, the better. Epstein cites a study showing that children who grow up to be extremely creative have fewer rules imposed on them at home than average. In these families, parents are more likely to allow their children to make their own decisions and offer judgment after the fact.

> **Balancing Exploration With Discipline in Parenting**
> 
> One of the rules in psychologist Jordan Peterson’s _12 Rules for Life_advises parents to set strong boundaries for their children and discipline them as necessary to get them to live within those boundaries. In his words, “Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.” His argument is that if a child’s parents don’t teach them to behave within the rules of society, the cold, unforgiving world will eventually cause them far more suffering than early discipline would have. For example, the other kids at school won’t want to be friends with someone who knows nothing about mutual respect.
> 
> However, Peterson agrees with Epstein that parents shouldn’t set any more rules than they need to. He argues that if disciplinarian parents set too many unnecessary rules, children won’t respect the rules that matter. They shouldn’t prescribe a specific path like violin lessons for their children if they don’t want to take them. Instead, parents should limit themselves to being “proxies for society.” The only necessary restrictions are those which allow children to avoid being rejected by society—which, counterintuitively, allows them to more freely explore the world and develop competence in a good fit of their choice.
