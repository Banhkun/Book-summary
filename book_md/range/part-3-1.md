## Part 3.1: Generalists Are More Creative Thinkers

Now that we’ve compared the traditional specialist’s path to excellence to Epstein’s new model for generalists, we’ll compare how each group performs in the professional world.

First of all, Epstein argues that, by and large, **generalists are more likely to come up with successful creative ideas than specialists**. We’re going to discuss various strategies generalists use to come up with fresh ideas and solve problems they’ve never seen before—analogical thinking, the use of familiar patterns in new situations; lateral thinking, the use of old information in new situations; and playful curiosity, the openness necessary to discover solutions by accident.

While specialists succeed by being one of a rare few who understand something, **generalists are uniquely good at using less knowledge in more effective ways**. Generalists try to limit themselves to only the information relevant to the problem at hand, and they draw that relevant information from a bevy of unlikely sources.

Epstein asserts that, due to rapid advances in scientific research, the mass of discovered human knowledge has been growing exponentially over the last several decades, and it’s now outpacing our ability to interpret, combine, and apply that knowledge to solve problems. The skills of generalists have never been in greater demand.

> **Generalists’ Pareto Principle**
> 
> This is an instance of the now-ubiquitous Pareto Principle, otherwise known as the “80/20 Rule.” It’s a near-universal truth that a set of inputs yields extremely imbalanced outputs—in many cases, 20% of customers account for 80% of sales, 80% of your success comes from 20% of your work, and 80% of your stress is caused by 20% of your problems.
> 
> Generalists are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this kind of imbalance. If 80% of results come from 20% of ideas, deep, specialized knowledge isn’t always required. Generalists prioritize the quality of ideas over quantity of ideas, and as a result, often find more success than specialists despite knowing far less.

#### Analogical Thinking Yields New Ideas

Epstein asserts that one of the most valuable tools generalists have is analogical thinking—the ability to use analogies to discover commonalities between dissimilar situations. For example, a start-up CEO struggling to decide whether to sell her rapidly growing company could inform her decision by studying 20th-century farmers who discovered massive wealths of oil underneath their land.

**Analogical thinking is effective because seemingly unrelated problems often have the same underlying structure, enabling similar solutions**. Research has shown that generalists’ diverse background experience makes it easier for them to identify this kind of deep structure and make valuable connections.

To prove the value of analogical thinking, Epstein cites a study in which a psychologist observed the problem-solving brainstorming meetings of research labs. The most successful labs were made up of scientists with diverse background experience in a number of different fields, all offering a multitude of analogies. The best group posed an analogy every four minutes on average.

(Shortform note: Kevin Dunbar, the psychologist who conducted this study, reveals that when he asked the researchers how they arrived at their conclusions, they forgot they had used any analogies at all. This shows that even when they aren’t consciously seeking out analogies, thinkers with wide-ranging backgrounds use them instinctively.)

> **The Danger of Faulty Analogies**
> 
> While analogies are an invaluable tool in creative problem solving, they can also be a potent weapon for rhetoricians. Writers and speakers use analogies to ostensibly strengthen the rationale of their position, but faulty analogies can easily create the illusion of logic where there is none.
> 
> The reason analogies can be such powerful rhetorical devices is that they can transfer feelings attached to one concept to something entirely new. Karl Marx’s analogy comparing the proletariat class to slaves in chains gives his argument a specific, powerful emotional tenor. It takes far less careful reasoning to make a powerful analogy than it does to dissect one and tease apart exactly why two concepts aren’t as similar as they appear.
> 
> In order to detect whether or not an analogy is valid, ask yourself these two questions, identified in the textbook Writing Analytically: First, “Are the basic similarities greater and more significant than the obvious differences?” Second, “Am I over-relying on surface similarities and ignoring more essential differences?" These questions force us to slow down and consider the logic of an argument instead of being swept away by our initial emotional response.

Intuition would tell us that a single, closely related analogy would provide the most useful, relevant information to any given problem, but according to Epstein, this isn’t the case.

For example, if you wanted to create a successful app, your instinct might be to look at Uber’s early business plan and copy it as closely as possible—but this isn’t ideal. Often, distant analogies can offer more useful insights. If your idea is for a new anonymous dating app, you may be better off comparing it to the masquerade balls of Renaissance Italy than Uber. The more superficially unrelated an analogy is, the more likely it is to spark new ideas.

Additionally, Epstein asserts that it’s best to consider a wide range of many different analogies. If you study too many details about any one situation, you’re more likely to overanalyze and draw inaccurate conclusions than if you studied a wider range of examples. For example, if you only studied Uber while making your app, you may overvalue the 5-star rating system. Considering multiple analogies also helps inspire a greater number of ideas than considering just one.

> **Artists Use Analogies**
> 
> In _Steal Like an Artist_ , Austin Kleon collects and condenses widely accepted advice about creative inspiration. He writes, “You are a mashup [...] of what you choose to let into your life.” Since all art is essentially trying to do the same thing—evoke a reaction in its audience—each piece of art can be seen as an analogy for your own work. Each idea that inspires you is another way an artist has tackled your problem, and you’re free to adopt this strategy yourself.
> 
> Just as a wide range of analogies can help you figure out what works and what doesn’t, a wide range of creative inspirations helps you determine what is worth including in your own art. “Your job is to collect good ideas,” writes Kleon, “The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose to be influenced by.”
> 
> Epstein’s logic applies here, too—the more superficially distant an artistic inspiration is from the situation at hand, the more likely it is you’ll come up with something original and effective. The screenwriter of _Groundhog Day_ was inspired by a novel about vampires (_The Vampire Lestat_ by Anne Rice), which got him thinking about what people would do if they lived forever.

#### Lateral Thinking Yields New Ideas

In contrast with “forward thinking,” “lateral thinking” refers to any use of pre-existing knowledge in a new context. Specialists assume that new, undiscovered knowledge and technology is the key to innovation, but Epstein argues that this isn’t necessarily the case. Often, old ideas used in a new way are more valuable than cutting-edge discoveries. For example, the construction workers who popularized duct tape were simply repurposing an older tape they had used to seal ammunition boxes during World War II.

Lateral thinking is much more difficult to cultivate than specialized efficiency. Epstein argues that specialization is sometimes a shortcut around the need for fresh ideas—for instance, when video game companies compete for better graphics instead of more engaging gameplay. However, the evidence shows you can’t buy innovation—a study of private Research and Development teams (who are hired solely to innovate) found no correlation between funding and performance.

Instead, **the key to lateral thinking is to get rid of perceived constraints on ideas** —back away from the cutting edge and draw from a broader range of experience.

> **Creativity Requires Inefficiency**
> 
> This intentional distance from the cutting edge is one of many counterintuitive strategies that have proven to be successful at fostering creativity and innovation. Often, the management strategies that yield the most creative ideas are the opposite of those required for efficient procedural work. Robert Sutton, author of _Weird Ideas That Work_ , concludes that the most innovative organizations are “inefficient (and often annoying) places to work.”
> 
> Sutton offers another piece of counterintuitive advice: Managers of creative teams should reward employees for success _and_ failure and only punish employees for _inaction_. Quantity, not quality, is the path to creative success.
> 
> Here’s another: Companies that want innovation should hire employees that often refuse to listen to bosses or coworkers. The Xerox employee who invented the laser printer was someone like this. He was working at a research and development lab, an organization whose sole purpose is innovation, yet when he suggested they look into the blossoming new potential of laser technology, he was dismissed by his coworkers and ordered to stop looking into it by his boss. Fortunately, he complained to someone higher up, got transferred to a new lab, and revolutionized the printing industry.

##### Lateral Thinking From Non-Experts

Epstein writes extensively about cases in which outsiders with less expertise and less information about a given situation solve problems that have stumped teams of experts for years. This speaks to the value of lateral thinking—sometimes, specialists are simply looking for answers in the wrong places.

Epstein describes a company called InnoCentive that allows organizations to post descriptions of problems and challenges they’re facing and crowdsource solutions from strangers on the Internet. Examples of problems solved by InnoCentive users include NASA’s inability to predict solar particle storms and the Oil Spill Recovery Institute’s struggle to clean oil out of their recovery barges.

One advantage unique to amateurs is not knowing enough to believe that an idea is ridiculous. For example, NASA employees scoffed at the idea to predict particle storms with telescopes built to detect radio waves—until it worked.

> **When Crowdsourcing Goes Wrong**
> 
> Crowdsourcing like InnoCentive has become a popular problem-solving strategy in recent years. However, research has shown that it’s only successful when it’s designed in a specific way. Crowdsourcing works best when it’s directed at a single solvable problem and only attracts the right kind of people. Netflix’s 2006 “Netflix Prize” is a prime example: The company offered to pay $1 million to whatever team could improve their suggestion algorithm by 10%. The nature of the technical problem ensured that those posing solutions had at least some degree of expertise, and the quantitative nature of the solution made it easy for Netflix to sort out ineffective solutions.
> 
> Compare this to the crowdsourcing disaster of the BP oil spill. More than a hundred experts at BP were forced to sort through _123,000_ potential solutions purporting to help clean up the millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Out of these, only 470 were deemed potentially useful, and just 30 were put to use, most of which were minor improvements on existing techniques. Overall, it was declared a waste of time, due to the fact that the proposals attracted ineffective problem solvers and couldn’t be easily filtered.

It’s important to note that a team entirely comprised of outsiders wouldn’t succeed. Epstein admits that most groups require a certain amount of specialization. Researchers studying engineers have found that specialists and generalists are evenly matched in terms of innovation. Specialists are better at solving difficult technical issues, and generalists are better at lateral thinking.

The most innovative team members, however, are _polymaths_ —whom Epstein defines as those who possess both broad knowledge in many areas and heavily specialized knowledge in at least one area. Polymaths represent the best of both worlds. They’re generalist enough to generate unique ideas and specialized enough to implement those ideas at a high level.

> It’s easier than ever before to become a polymath and find success, for a number of reasons. The Internet has proven to be an invaluable resource for people who want to educate themselves to a professional level. When Michael Sayman was 13, he learned how to code online and released an app that became one of the top 100 in the world.
> 
> Additionally, as human knowledge expands into more and more domains, the number of unique potential combinations of knowledge between those domains grows exponentially. This increases your chances of mastering a skillset that no one else in the world has—“quantum biology,” for example, only rose to prominence in the last couple of decades.

#### Playful Curiosity Yields New Ideas

The final way generalists come up with creative ideas is by deliberately cultivating a sense of playful curiosity.

Epstein argues that when professionals loosen up and temporarily abandon the need to accomplish anything serious, they often make wild breakthroughs that would never have normally been discovered. By freeing themselves from the constraints of serious work, they’re more likely to explore uncharted territory with unexpected value.

Because generalists largely only pursue things they’re excited about, through short-term planning and fearless pivoting, it’s easier for them to produce work for the intrinsic joy of exploration. Obviously, you need rules and direction to get most work done, but a healthy amount of playful curiosity can be surprisingly valuable.

For example, Epstein recounts how Nobel-winning physicist Andre Geim schedules “Friday night experiments”—time dedicated to fooling around in the lab with whatever interests him, regardless if he thinks it’ll amount to anything. One Friday night, he unexpectedly discovered that the water in a frog’s body was magnetic enough to levitate a frog in midair. On another, he found out that Scotch tape was able to strip off extremely thin layers of graphite, directly leading him to discover how to isolate graphene, a nanomaterial that’s one atom thick and two hundred times stronger than steel—which won him the Nobel.

> **The Power of Detachment**
> 
> The defining characteristic of Geim’s Friday Night Experiments is detachment from outcomes—full acceptance of the possibility of failure and waste. In fact, this detachment is precisely what makes them so successful.
> 
> Detachment from the outcomes of your actions at first sounds just like giving up. However, it can be a powerful tool to achieve your goals, as well as an invaluable blessing for your mental health. Detaching from the outcome doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t care about the outcome. Instead, you’re simply becoming less hostile toward unfavorable outcomes. This mental shift provides a number of pragmatic benefits.
> 
> Being less desperate for a specific outcome gives you more power in negotiations and makes you appear more competent. It keeps you oriented toward future opportunities instead of tunnel-visioning into whatever is in front of you. It preserves your emotional energy for the tasks that really matter. Attaching yourself to a single outcome blinds you to everything else in the world, and in creative fields, this makes your job infinitely more difficult.

Efficiency-obsessed specialists would see Geim’s Friday night experiments as a waste of time, but they’re another example of why efficiency shouldn’t be your highest priority.

Epstein mourns that today’s science is far too concerned with efficiency. Research grants are more likely to be doled out if the research can prove that it’s worth the resources, but only funding research that looks promising is the quickest way to stifle new discoveries.

Epstein cites the example of HIV—before the AIDS epidemic, scientists believed that retroviruses were an insignificant phenomenon found only in animals. Curious scientists studied them anyway, amassing a body of knowledge that led to the speedy development of treatment for AIDS. Curiosity for its own sake needs to be preserved for science to operate effectively.

> **Roll the Dice on Research Funding**
> 
> Epstein isn’t the only one criticizing today’s efficiency-obsessed system of funding research. Multiple studies have shown that grant reviewers are extremely subjective, unreliable judges of potential research. On top of this, they’re biased toward research that _appears_ promising instead of what’s _actually_ promising. One researcher claims that this funding structure “is turning scientists into entrepreneurs and managers” as they compete based on appearances. The desire to bring back curiosity-driven research without pre-ordained outcomes has inspired some creative suggestions for reform.
> 
> The idea to have random chance decide what research gets funded was first suggested in 2016 by microbiologist Arturo Casadevall and his team, whom we introduced back in Part 1 of this guide. The proposal is to allow reviewers to reject any research that seems entirely worthless and enter the rest into a lottery in which randomly selected research is funded. Theoretically, this would allow unpredictably valuable research, like the retroviruses that helped doctors treat HIV, to once again become possible.
