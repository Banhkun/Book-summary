## Part 3.3: Organizations Benefit From Range

Just as the most versatile individuals have accumulated a wide range of experience, Epstein argues that the most robust organizations cultivate a wide range of perspectives.

First, we’ll argue that the greatest weakness of narrowly specialized organizations is self-destructive conformity and show how robust organizations overcome this fatal flaw. Then, we’ll conclude this guide by explaining how diversity among team members enables innovation within an organization.

### The Conformity of Specialist Organizations

In the same way narrow-minded specialists assume their area of expertise applies to everything, narrow-minded organizations make the mistake of assuming that all problems can be solved in the same way.

To support this argument, Epstein draws heavily on an analysis of the 1986 _Challenger_ space shuttle explosion. He argues that this disaster was due to NASA’s over-reliance on a single guiding principle, specifically, to ignore unreliable human intuition and make decisions based on objective quantitative data.

This principle is a good one—human intuition is sometimes dead wrong, and when it’s your job to build rockets, the idea that you would trust a gut instinct instead of data from rigorous testing is laughable. However, Epstein argues that **this guiding principle didn’t fit the situation at hand**.

The engineers were aware of a malfunctioning seal in the rocket’s booster and suspected that it was related to low air temperature. They made reasonable judgments based on a photo of the rocket’s interior—there was more soot on the wall after a cold day’s test launch than on a warm one, indicating that the cold was hardening their sealant, causing a leak. Unfortunately, since all they had were photos, with no conclusive data linking cold temperature to failure, the higher-ups at NASA felt the engineers’ argument wasn’t strong enough to justify canceling the launch.

Even though the engineers’ logic made perfect sense, NASA employees were in the habit of ignoring reason without data. In Epstein’s eyes, relying on a single solution for a problem it couldn’t solve is what caused the disaster.

> **An Alternative Lesson From the _Challenger_ Explosion**
> 
> In _Think Like a Rocket Scientist_ , NASA scientist-turned-lawyer Ozal Varol offers an alternative takeaway from the Challenger disaster. Both the _Challenger_ and the similar 2003 _Columbia_ explosion were preceded by a series of successful test flights, giving the teams at NASA unwarranted confidence in the safety of the next flight, despite evidence to the contrary.
> 
> Every success makes us more likely to take bigger risks and make careless mistakes. One study showed that successful financial analysts become overconfident, ironically making their future predictions less accurate than someone with a less successful track record.
> 
> Varol points out the principal logical fallacy at work here—just because a system functioned correctly doesn’t mean that every part of that system functioned correctly. Additionally, just because a strategy worked doesn’t mean it’s infallible, or even the best strategy available. People are far less likely to dissect what they did wrong after a success than a failure, even though it’s unlikely that they did everything perfectly.
> 
> After beating the odds and landing a man on the moon, NASA began to grow complacent. NASA engineers were so confident, they neglected to include an escape system for the crew of the _Challenger,_ resulting in seven deaths. Its “quality assurance” team was cut from around 1,700 to 505 from 1970 to 1986. Success made them reckless. We should learn from this: pay attention to the parts of your successes that go wrong, and try to objectively evaluate each decision you make.

#### The Benefits of Balanced Ideals

In contrast, the best organizations embrace the idea that there’s no one solution to every problem.

Epstein notes that it’s common advice for managers to foster “congruence” by aligning their organizations under a single guiding principle. This is based on the idea that mixed messages within an organization lead to confusion and counterproductivity. For example, a manager who tells his team to exercise more autonomy but refuses to stop micromanaging everyone is creating an unreliable, contradictory organization. This certainly isn’t healthy.

However, Epstein argues that organizations built around a single core value are likely to get stuck in one way of thinking. Instead, **organizations, as well as the individuals within them, should strive to achieve the seemingly impossible task of embodying multiple conflicting ideals at once**.

For example, one common conflict that many organizations struggle to balance is between protocol and intuition, as we saw happen at NASA. Both of these elements are valuable to a certain degree, and Epstein argues that organizations need to recognize this, even if it means embracing contradiction. Conflicting values put a healthy pressure on team members to question their own decisions and learn from their mistakes.

> **How Ray Dalio Resolves the Conflict of Ideals**
> 
> In _Principles_ , hedge fund manager Ray Dalio describes a unique way that he was able to balance trust in the organization and individual intuition at his company, Bridgewater. He describes a hybrid form of management that allows for either protocol or individual judgment to reign depending on the specific situation: “Believability-Weighted Decision-Making.”
> 
> Anyone is allowed to make a suggestion or weigh in on a decision at Bridgewater. But the influence each person has on the eventual outcome depends on their _believability._ Dalio breaks this quality down into two parts—someone who is “believable” has 1) a proven track record of success with this type of problem, and 2) the ability to logically articulate the rationale behind their opinion. When groups of employees are asked to vote on a given decision, their votes are mathematically weighted according to their believability.
> 
> This strategy prevents teams from becoming slaves to protocol, as any serious challenge to the protocol must be considered. The strategy is also protected from the biases of human intuition, as illogical and unproven arguments are devalued by default. Dalio’s decision-making process is proof that it’s possible to reconcile conflicting values with an elegant, non-contradictory solution.

### Team Diversity Enables Innovation

Epstein argues that another way organizations should cultivate range is by bringing together diverse teams of members from different backgrounds.

As we discussed earlier, innovation is all about bringing together ideas in new ways. **Team members with diverse backgrounds bring together diverse ideas** , making it more likely that they’ll come up with something new. Epstein notes that for this reason, scientists who have worked abroad at some point in their lives, on average, make more impactful discoveries.

Diverse team members are also more likely to bring conflicting values which, when expressed constructively, contribute to a healthy tension, as we just discussed. The diverse superforecasting teams we mentioned earlier are particularly good at this.

Epstein asserts that diversity can be discovered even within a single organization. In the most effective organizations, team members frequently work with new collaborators, assisting departments outside of their specific area of expertise. In contrast, clustering into small teams that rarely interact or exchange members stifles creativity.

> **Reconciling Differences**
> 
> True diversity of ideas in the workplace necessarily requires a constructive approach to conflict and dissent. It’s easy for differences between people to spark division and hurt rather than innovation. In the seminal 1999 work _Nonviolent Communication_ , psychologist Marshall Rosenberg offers a detailed step-by-step guide to ensuring that conflicts are resolved in a compassionate and productive way.
> 
>   * Express your own needs without making demands
> 
>   * Identify the other person’s needs
> 
>   * Verify that each of you understands the other’s needs
> 
>   * Express empathy for the other person’s pain or frustration
> 
>   * Propose solutions that meet each person’s needs
> 
> 

> 
> As these steps indicate, the heart of nonviolent communication is human connection. Mutual understanding and compassion put greater emphasis on both parties’ similarities than their differences, taking some of the friction out of diversity.
