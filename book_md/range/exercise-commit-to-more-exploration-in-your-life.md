## Exercise: Commit to More Exploration in Your Life

Epstein has shown us the benefits of exploration, but we’re left with the question: What to explore? An exercise answering this question called the “List of 100 Dreams” has become popular in recent years. The goal is to identify fulfilling new experiences to fill your free time instead of spending it on cheap leisure like TV by default.

* * *

List as many “dreams” as you can think of. Anything that you’re curious about experiencing in life should make the list. They can be big, like “write a book” or small, like “sleep outside.” Try to get to 25, no matter how bad some of your ideas are.

What item on your list excites you the most? Did you come up with anything that surprised you?

Now that you’re inspired, how much time per week do you want to devote to exploration? What priorities can you shift to allow this to happen?
