## Exercise: Do You Need to Pivot or Cultivate More Grit?

It’s difficult to strike the right balance between commitment to difficult goals and the flexibility to pursue exciting new opportunities. Take some time to reflect on whether you need more grit in your life or the courage to pivot and reset.

* * *

Write about a long-term goal you’ve set for yourself. Does it still seem worthwhile, or does a different goal sound more appealing?

Imagine your life five years from now. Would you rather be living the life where you’ve successfully accomplished your goal, or one where you’ve succeeded doing something totally different?

If you think you want to pivot, brainstorm new goals here. What sounds exciting to you, and what concrete steps can you take to get there?

If you want to stay on your current path, try to bolster your grit by writing about what’s motivating you. What do you want to get out of this goal? Who, specifically, are you trying to help?
