## Part 2.2: The Generalist Specializes Inefficiently

After an era of exploration in which they’ve built up a broad base of experience and found an activity that’s a good fit for them, generalists _do_ engage in specialized practice, but they do so a little differently than traditional specialists.

On average, generalists have slow “inefficient” starts, but end up outpacing specialists in the long run. This comes down to _the way they learn_ , which is more complex than the typical idea of deliberate practice. Epstein argues that **we shouldn’t optimize learning for efficiency—the most effective learning is slow and difficult.**

Specialists assume that all you need to master piano scales or trigonometric formulas is the discipline to work as many hours as it takes. But spending a massive number of hours studying isn’t going to cut it, as _not all hours spent learning are created equal._

(Shortform note: This part of Epstein’s argument overlaps with general consensus. Several of the most popular books on learning, including Anders Ericsson’s Peak, _Ultralearning by Scott Young_ , and _Make It Stick by Peter C. Brown_ , emphasize the fact that _how you learn_ matters far more than how much time you spend learning.)

We’re going to take a look at several forms of slow, difficult learning that hinder short-term retention but pay off years down the line. First, we’re going to distinguish between two categories of educational content—How Questions and Why Questions—and explain why the more challenging of the two is more valuable. Then, we’ll take a look at a few brain tricks that make it easier to retain information that’s difficult to learn. Finally, we’ll learn about an unusually difficult method of skill acquisition that enables new heights of mastery.

#### Learning Strategy: “How” Questions Versus “Why” Questions

Epstein distinguishes between two types of problems given to students in educational settings—what psychologists have termed “using procedures” questions and “making connections” questions. We can more simply describe them as “How” questions and “Why” questions.

For How Questions, students are asked to carry out specific instructions—for example, reducing a fraction to its simplest form—while for Why Questions, students are asked to analyze a situation and determine for themselves what procedures they need to use—for example, calculating how much money to tip at a restaurant.

Epstein notes that to solve How Questions, students just need to memorize how to do something—tactics which are best learned through repeated practice. To solve Why Questions, however, students need to understand why specific procedures are helpful in a broader context that more closely approximates the real world—they need strategies that require generalist understanding.

Both types of questions are necessary for effective learning. You need to know the rules of basic math in order to calculate a tip at a restaurant. However, **because they’re slow and difficult,** **Why Questions are drastically underrepresented in most schools, leaving students unable to use what they’re learning in real life.**

Epstein bases his argument on a study that filmed and analyzed hundreds of elementary school math classes from a wide range of countries around the world. He emphasizes one recurring mistake made in many countries. Even though Why Questions were included in the curriculum to force students to think conceptually, teachers who were unable to quickly or easily teach students these difficult concepts would instead give hints until Why Questions were stripped down into How Questions. Students would guess at which procedure to use until they got it right, and the teacher would move on without ever establishing a deeper level of understanding.

For example, imagine if a teacher asked the students to write a mathematical expression to describe the area of one slice of a pizza divided into fourths. The teacher tells the class to use “ _a_ ” to represent the pizza’s area, hinting to the class that they need to use “ _a_ ” somehow. The students guess “4/a” and “4a” before landing on the correct answer of “a/4” without ever considering _why_.

In the United States, around one out of every five math problems began as a Why Question, but by the time the class solved it, _zero percent_ of them remained Why Questions.

Japan, on the other hand, was the most successful country at teaching Why Questions. Epstein recounts how students in Japanese classrooms sometimes spent entire periods solving a single problem, trying out different conceptual strategies and learning why procedures worked the way they did. **Japan’s schools were successful because they embraced the need for education to be slow and difficult.**

> **Education Around the World**
> 
> As Epstein’s study shows, education differs widely in countries around the world. As Epstein describes, a Japanese child’s education is uniquely rigorous from the very beginning. Kindergarteners have to study in order to pass elementary school entrance exams and often attend after-school tutoring to ace them. University entrance exams are life-and-death in such a work-obsessed industrial culture, and many high school students spend late nights at “cram schools.” 44% of these high schoolers fail their first attempt at university exams and become _ronin_ , “samurai without a master,” studying on their own for a year before trying again.
> 
> This rigorous education system has been a mixed bag for Japan. After World War II, Japan implemented its highly competitive mandatory testing to prepare its students for the workforce, skyrocketing the nation to become the second-largest economy in the world. However, Japanese growth ground to a halt in the 90s, provoking reform in Japanese schools, including a reduction in Saturday classes.
> 
> Some attribute Japanese stagnation to the school system’s de-emphasis of valuable creative and critical thinking skills in favor of specialized exam prep. Others argue that the work-obsessed culture has pushed the Japanese people to their limits, leading to unproductive and unfulfilling social isolation. Still, they consistently rank among the top nations of the world in reading literacy, math, and science.
> 
> On the opposite end of the spectrum, Finland imposes far less academic rigor on its youngest students, yet they too rank among the highest scorers worldwide. For every hour of class, students get a fifteen-minute recess to play outside. They don’t start formally learning math or reading and writing until they’re seven years old. Instead, young children focus on developing social skills and “play-based learning”—teachers direct their students’ play with the deliberate intent of cultivating focus and problem-solving. For example, one assignment given to a class of first-graders was to go outside, collect fifty rocks and acorns, and organize them in groups of ten. Most importantly, Finnish teachers try to give students the “joy of learning” and help them learn to motivate themselves.
> 
> Classes are small enough for teachers to form deep connections with their students. When a student falls behind, teachers consult one another to come up with the best way to catch them up. Nearly 30% of students in Finland receive some kind of individual help in grade school. The Finnish mandate just one standardized test to high school seniors, and don’t ascribe much value to it. They don’t assign much homework, either. It’s a counterintuitive success story that shows there’s more than one way to teach deep understanding.

##### Why Questions for Adults

This problem doesn’t just exist at the elementary level. Epstein cites a study that observed undergraduate-level calculus classes at the Air Force Academy. Over the course of a decade, researchers studied the performance of more than ten thousand students and a hundred different professors, who all taught the exact same curriculum.

Some professors posed more Why Questions and emphasized broad, interdisciplinary understanding, while others emphasized efficient mastery of specific procedures that would be on the test. At first, it looked like the deep learning prompted by Why Questions was unnecessary. The professors who didn’t bother to teach Why Questions yielded students with higher test scores and earned more positive student evaluations than the professors who emphasized general knowledge.

However, once the students advanced to Calculus II and more complex math classes, **students of deep learning vastly outperformed their procedurally-minded peers**. Epstein uses this to argue that Why Questions requiring deeper understanding result in more robust, practical knowledge over the long term, but far too often, they’re downplayed in the name of specialized efficiency.

> **Educational Peers at the Air Force Academy**
> 
> Difference in teaching styles isn’t the only significant factor influencing students’ performance at the Air Force Academy. One study found a strong correlation between a freshman’s GPA and the average SAT scores of the other members in their squadron, indicating that spending time with studious peers has a significant influence on academic performance.
> 
> However, when some squadrons were specifically assembled to match together low performers and high performers, the low performers actually performed _worse_ than low performers in fully random squadrons. Researchers concluded that the gulf between the high and low performers was so great that the two groups didn’t want to mix, resulting in separate cliques within a single squadron. This indicates that attempts to “inspire” low performers in schools by manipulating their peer groups could easily backfire.

#### More Slow and Difficult Learning Strategies

Epstein describes several other slow, difficult learning methods that stick. The “generation effect” refers to the well-documented psychological phenomenon that someone struggling to come up with the answer to a question will retain more knowledge for a longer time when the answer is revealed, even if they completely failed at coming up with an answer. The generation effect attests to the effectiveness of unpleasant, difficult learning methods, such as frequent testing without the benefit of multiple choice.

The “spacing effect” is a similar phenomenon—people retain more knowledge if there are lengthy gaps between study sessions on the same information. In the long run, someone who studies the facts about a historical battle will retain more information if they’re tested in a month than if they have to take the test on the same day. The more time that’s passed since you reviewed the information, the harder it is to recall—which is exactly the point. **It’s the struggle of a difficult test that makes the information easier to remember for years to come**.

(Shortform note: Because of the spacing effect, the best way to learn anything is to create a long-term review schedule. The review sessions don’t have to be long—30 minutes is plenty—but they should be spaced out over a long period of time. Use longer intervals as you get better at retaining the information in order to keep recall difficult, and eventually you’ll remember it indefinitely.)

Epstein’s last technique for effective learning is called “interleaving.” Interleaving is when multiple kinds of problems are mixed together in review—for example, a cumulative math test in which consecutive problems are drawn from different chapters of the book. **Interleaving works because it requires learners to analyze each problem before determining how to solve it** , which engages their abstract strategic mindset. This is more difficult than if all the problems of one type are “blocked” together, but it vastly improves retention.

(Shortform note: Because interleaving is meant to train the specific skill of distinguishing between similar kinds of problems, you shouldn’t weave together types of practice that are completely unrelated. Flipping between Spanish, math, and history homework, for example, wouldn’t provide the benefits of interleaving.)

> **How People Learn Incorrectly**
> 
> These difficult learning strategies are all discussed at length in Peter C. Brown’s _Make It Stick_. Interestingly, like _Range_ , _Make It Stick_ contradicts the accepted wisdom surrounding deliberate practice by specifically condemning the use of immediate feedback. While immediate feedback makes the learning experience more enjoyable, Brown argues that it acts like “training wheels,” hindering learning by never allowing the learner to struggle in the absence of the right answer. Instead, feedback should be delayed in order to make use of the generation effect and keep the learning difficult enough to stick.
> 
> After covering the learning methods cited by Epstein, Brown argues that one of the biggest mistakes learners make is misperceiving their own level of competence. There are many factors at play that make it difficult to accurately estimate your own knowledge. For example, the _fluency illusion_ is when we assume that because learning feels easy, we know far more than we actually do. For example, if you smoothly grasp all the ideas of a TED Talk on organic chemistry, you could falsely estimate that you have at least an undergraduate level of chemistry knowledge—unaware of all the complex ideas the presenter left out.
> 
> To accurately gauge your proficiency, Brown suggests that you test yourself on how easily you can recall information after an extended period of time and rephrase the learned concepts in your own words. Frequently interacting with peers and teachers can also ensure that you have a realistic idea of your own knowledge.

#### Learning Strategy: Self-Teaching

When it comes to skill acquisition, Epstein makes the case that _slow, directionless exploration_ provides more robust skill than the specialist’s style of learning through intense, efficient drills.

To illustrate, Epstein examines the life stories of world-class jazz musicians from the very start of their musical training. He finds that, after exploring and discovering their preferred instrument, **many jazz legends taught themselves how to play, without formal lessons, through an excruciatingly inefficient process of trial and error.**

Many of the greatest jazz musicians learned through “osmosis,” discovering on their own how to mimic the music they heard around them. The struggle of aimlessly fiddling around gave these musicians a deeply ingrained familiarity with their instruments that formal training could never intentionally teach. Just like the other learning methods we’ve been discussing, this untutored learning style is much slower and less effective at first, but in the long run, it provides the foundation to achieve top-level performance.

By teaching themselves, these musicians also discovered the unique skill of effortless _improvisation_. Epstein argues that because they were forced to painstakingly generate their own techniques instead of simply learning to read sheet music (translating something that’s already been written), **the self-taught jazz musicians developed a creative instinct that classically trained musicians never could**. For this reason, master improvisors are often able to learn and perform classical arrangements, but classically trained musicians are fundamentally unable to improvise.

Epstein implies that **the slow struggle of experimentation provides its own unique _,_ lasting skills in any pursuit.** All the time you spend learning and every mistake you make add up to invaluable mastery down the road, even if you can’t see it immediately. There’s no need to worry if you’re not progressing as quickly as specialists expect—they don’t realize that the most effective learning is slow and difficult.

> **The Strengths and Weaknesses of “Overlearning”**
> 
> Countering Epstein’s argument that efficient specialists miss out on the depth of inefficient practice, recent research has identified the benefits of “overlearning”: practicing a skill after you’ve already achieved proficiency. If specialists can continue to train their existing skills indefinitely, the efficient path to mastery doesn’t seem to miss much. However, research shows that overlearning in narrow specialized domains may limit these specialists in a different way.
> 
> In one study on overlearning, two groups of subjects were trained to identify subtle striped patterns embedded in static on a screen. One group was assigned to overlearn, practicing for twenty minutes after both groups had already learned to pick out the correct pattern. The next day, the overlearners were able to complete their task far better than those who didn’t overlearn. However, when asked to perform a new task—identifying a slightly different pattern in the static—**the overlearners actually performed _worse_ than the control group**.
> 
> What does this tell us? The researchers concluded that the overlearners’ weakened performance was a side effect of their “resilient” experience with the first task. They had learned the first skill so well that they found it difficult to stray from the procedure. In other words, **overlearning narrow skills hinders the application of those skills in new contexts.**
> 
> When specialists attempt to learn adjacent skills, like classical musicians attempting to improvise, their overlearning of narrow procedures may do more harm than good.
