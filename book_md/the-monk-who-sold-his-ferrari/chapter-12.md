## Chapter 12: The Roses—Helping Others

**The roses that awaken the sumo wrestler in Raman’s fable represent service to others.** They reference an old Chinese proverb, which says that a bit of perfume will stay on the hand that gives away a rose. In other words, by being kind to others you’ll improve your own life as well.

Sharma argues that quality of life doesn’t come from a big home or a fast car. You had nothing when you were born, and—no matter how rich you become—you’ll have nothing after you die. Therefore, working only for yourself is pointless. Rather, true quality of life comes from what you give back to the world, and the real reason you exist is to serve others.

**You’re born crying while the world celebrates; you should die celebrating while the world cries.** In other words, live a life that you’ll be happy with, and that others will be sad to lose.

> Sharma cites an old Chinese proverb that a sweet scent lingers on a hand that gives away a rose. In other words, when you do good deeds for others (like giving them flowers), you also benefit personally (the scent stays on your hand).
> 
> The sumo wrestler from the fable—who fainted when he realized that his time was limited—smells some nearby flowers and immediately wakes up, showing even more energy and vigor than he had before. This is because **he now knows what to do with his limited time: help others.** He’s energetic because he’s happy with his new purpose, and excited to get started on it.
> 
> Thus, Sharma’s saying that you can live a happy and fulfilling life by devoting yourself to doing good deeds for others.

### How to Help Others

Sharma maintains that you don’t have to give up your job or your possessions like Julian;**** however, **you should see yourself as part of the world, not just as an individual living in it.**

Therefore, take some time each day to think about the good you can do for others. These can be very small things, like letting a car pass you during a traffic jam, or giving a compliment to someone who isn’t expecting it. Sharma says those small gestures will add up to increased happiness for yourself and those around you.

**One of the best ways to do this is to help your friends and keep your relationships strong.** Your friends, in turn, will enrich your own life. Friends make your good times better and your bad times more bearable.

> It would be impossible to tell you exactly how to help the people in your life. Everyone has different needs, and different talents to help meet those needs.
> 
> That’s why this chapter emphasizes relationships, rather than specific actions—by maintaining your friendships, doing kind gestures for one another, and practicing open, honest communication, you’ll come to understand the best ways to help each other.
> 
> In chapter 4 of _How Will You Measure Your Life? _Clayton Christensen applies financial theory to relationships with two main points:
> 
>   * Some people over-invest time and energy in their careers, and under-invest in their relationships. This imbalance leaves them (and their friends and family) feeling unhappy and unfulfilled.
> 
>   * It’s important to invest your time and energy into relationships that will experience long-term growth, rather than short-term payouts. For example, finding a loving spouse will net you a much better “return” than a one-night stand.
> 
> 

> 
> Sharma isn’t using financial terminology, but he’s suggesting the same thing: **Working to develop your relationships with others will enrich your own life.**
