## Chapter 10: The Cable—Self-Control

We now return to Yogi Raman’s fable of the garden and the next metaphor. **The sumo wrestler’s pink wire cable represents discipline.**

Wire cables are made of many thin wires wrapped around each other. Together, these weak wires become very strong. Discipline is like a wire cable: Many small actions and habits reinforce each other to create immense inner strength.

Sharma argues that you need discipline and willpower to keep your commitments and build your character. They’re what will enable you to perform the Ten Rituals every day, and they’ll give you the mental fortitude to handle life’s everyday challenges and unexpected problems.

(Shortform note: You might already have some of the wires that will eventually form your cable. If you’ve started practicing some of the Rituals for Health and Happiness, or if you have other habits that keep you fit and focused, then you’ve already begun building your wire cable of discipline!)

### How to Build Discipline

Sharma believes **anyone can build discipline and willpower relatively quickly.** Even simple chores like making your bed and doing the dishes are effective exercises to build discipline.

Small victories like doing your chores every day will form the building blocks of larger, life-altering victories like letting go of fear.**In other words, making small changes will give you the momentum and motivation to make larger changes.**

At first, Sharma says, you’ll be tempted to fall back into your old habits. Beware of thoughts that urge you toward laziness or procrastination. Keep pushing yourself (remember kaizen) and you’ll keep improving; those lazy thoughts will intrude less often and less powerfully.

> Sharma essentially suggests that you build up your willpower through brute force: Just power through whatever fatigue or stress is making it difficult to do your work, and eventually you’ll get stronger, as if you were lifting mental weights.
> 
> Sharma’s method works to build good habits, and to move past the mental roadblock of waiting to do your work until you “feel like it.” However, it may also be helpful to understand _why_ you often don’t “feel like it.”
> 
> Kelly McGonigal’s book _The Willpower Instinct_ offers several possible explanations, any or all of which may apply to you. McGonigal examines the connections between willpower and your physical health, your mental health, and even how you’re feeling that day. She also suggests ways to bolster your willpower:
> 
>   * **Meditation.** Like Sharma, McGonigal suggests meditation as a way to train your mind and gain better control of your thoughts—in this case, better control over the thoughts that tell you to be lazy, or put off doing your work.
> 
>   * **Exercise.** Your physical health has an impact on your energy, and therefore your willpower. Exercise also helps to relieve stress.
> 
>   * **Get more or better sleep.** Fatigue drains willpower—if you’re fighting just to stay awake, then you’ll have much less energy to stay focused and productive.
> 
>   * **Rest and breathe.** When you need a quick boost, McGonigal suggests that you simply lie down and focus on your breathing. Ten minutes of relaxation and deep, slow breathing will help you re-energize and refocus.

##### John’s Mantra

To get John started on building discipline, Julian suggests a mantra for John and tells him to repeat it at least 30 times a day. The mantra reminds John that he’s more than he seems to be; that he has all the power of the universe inside him. This mantra will help him tap into reserves of willpower he doesn’t know he has.

> Here we see Julian giving John the first wire of his cable: a mantra, as described in the Eighth Ritual for Health and Happiness. John’s mantra is designed to remind him that he has the strength and willpower to accomplish anything he wants to do.
> 
> In fact, this mantra will help build John’s discipline in two different ways:
> 
>   * Performing the Eighth Ritual every day will exercise John’s willpower
> 
>   * The mantra will reinforce John’s belief in his own inner strength
