## Chapter 7: The Garden—Your Mind

**The garden from Yogi Raman’s story is a metaphor for your mind.** Gardens must be properly cared for and cultivated in order to grow, and the same is true of minds.

However, many people’s mental gardens are contaminated with their fears and insecurities. Therefore, just as gardeners fiercely protect their gardens, you must stand guard over your mind and let only the right kinds of thoughts enter. In short, **managing your mind is the key to managing your life.**

> Gardens are typically metaphors for paradise: beautiful places that are free from pain. The most famous example of this metaphor is the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve lived in perfect happiness before the fall of humanity.
> 
> However, while Eden was a garden that God created and maintained, Sharma makes it clear that you’re responsible for your own mental “garden.”
> 
> Thus, Sharma uses the garden metaphor to deliver two messages at once:
> 
>   * Your mind can be a paradise, _but—_
> 
>   * You have to work to make it one
> 
> 


(Shortform note:**** From this point onward, we’ll focus more on teaching lessons than on explicitly telling Julian’s story. For those sections when we return to the story, we’ll explicitly name one of the characters in the heading.)

### Find Your Happiness by Finding Your Focus

According to Sharma, **concentration is the core of mental mastery.** You must be able to take all of your mind’s power and focus it on a single task.

Once you understand concentration, you are one step closer to finding happiness. **The secret to happiness is to find what you love doing, then concentrate all of your energy on doing it.** When you find what you really want to do, your work will seem like play, and it will energize you instead of draining you.

> Sharma discusses the importance of passion, but he doesn’t offer much advice on how to learn what you’re passionate about. _Minimalism_ , by Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, explores that topic in more detail: They provide some exercises to help find your passion and identify some roadblocks that might be keeping you from pursuing it.
> 
> For example, you can start exploring your passions by answering these four questions:
> 
>   * What were five times when you felt really, truly excited?
> 
>   * Why were you excited at each of those times?
> 
>   * What experience left you excited for the _longest_ time?
> 
>   * Is there a common thread between the experiences that you’ve listed?
> 
> 


Sharma maintains that that doesn’t mean you have to quit your job, sell everything you own, and go searching for your passion like Julian did—but try shaking things up. Leave your comfort zone and do something out of the ordinary. **Stop being so practical and logical, and try some of the things you’ve always wanted to do.**

> **Purpose and Focus Are Common Spiritual Themes**
> 
> Julian teaches John that finding his purpose, and focusing his energy on that purpose, is crucial to living a happy and fulfilling life. Other philosophical traditions—some of which are quite different from the Buddhist-based teachings that Julian’s sharing with John—also emphasize the importance of purpose and focus. Thus, it’s clear that **many different types of people thought those lessons were worth learning.**
> 
> For example, purpose and focus are also two key elements of Stoicism, a philosophy that seems to be the polar opposite of Julian’s new philosophy. Whereas Julian says that John should let go of his rigid rationality, Stoicism argues that rationality is the most important thing in the world.
> 
> Stoicism teaches that emotions are distractions, so you must set aside your feelings and approach every situation with unclouded rationality. By doing so, you can devote every moment of your life to fulfilling your duty (whatever that duty might be)—in fact, Stoicism’s dispassionate workaholism resembles Julian’s old life more than his current one.
> 
> If you’re interested in Stoicism’s approach to finding your purpose and your focus, check out our guide to Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations.__

#### John Learns to Exercise His Focus

While listening to Julian, John confesses that he has little control over his own thoughts these days. He’s stressed, and he feels like he’s constantly pulled by one task after another.

Julian agrees with John’s assessment, and he says that the mind is like a muscle: You have to exercise to make it stronger. He promises that a single month of dedicated effort will be enough for John to see huge changes in his life—just **10 minutes a day spent meditating on his current circumstances, how he’ll make the next day better, and his purpose in life is enough to start.** Also, Julian mentions that the less John worries about results, the faster he’ll get them.

> Julian repeats the one-month timeframe, and this time adds that John can start by taking small steps (like meditating for just 10 minutes each day).
> 
> Small steps leading to big outcomes is another lesson that you’ll see in many different schools of thought; therefore, it’s something that people with a wide variety of backgrounds and ways of thinking can all agree on.
> 
>   * In _Minimalism_ , the authors repeatedly stress that making small improvements each day will lead to the happy, fulfilling life that you want.
> 
>   * The famous proverb “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” comes from the _Tao Te Ching_ , a core book of Taoism.
> 
>   * In Chapter 9, Sharma himself will discuss _kaizen_ : the practice of making daily, incremental improvements. Kaizen originated in Japanese business after World War II, most notably Toyota.
> 
> 


##### Exercise #1: The Heart of the Rose

John asks for practical techniques that he can use, so **Julian teaches him a meditation technique called the Heart of the Rose**. You can do this exercise yourself, with nothing but a rose and a quiet space.

Take your rose and stare at the center of the flower. Think of nothing but the rose. Notice its color, shape, scent, and even its texture.

Other thoughts will intrude at first. Accept them, and return your attention to the rose. With practice, those intrusive thoughts will come less frequently, and eventually stop completely as you strengthen your mind and your focus.

> The Heart of the Rose is Sharma’s take on the classic candle meditation.
> 
> In a candle meditation, you light a candle and stare at it. While doing this, you focus completely on the candle’s flame; any thoughts that aren’t related to observing the candle should be acknowledged, and then immediately dismissed. Over time, you should find that fewer and fewer thoughts intrude on your meditation.
> 
> Whether you’re looking at a flower or a candle flame, the purpose is to practice focusing on a single thing while shutting out unrelated thoughts.

##### Exercise #2: Opposition Thinking

A second powerful technique Julian teaches John is _Opposition Thinking:****_ Whenever a negative thought occupies your mind, **dismiss that thought and replace it with a positive one.** It’s a simple exercise, but it requires persistence and vigilance to be effective.**** Try not to let even a single negative thought take root in your mind.

> **Opposition Thinking Application: Multitasking vs. Flow**
> 
> Opposition Thinking works because the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time—studies show that **multitasking is a myth**. Opposition Thinking takes advantage of that fact by intentionally focusing your attention on positive thoughts, rather than negative ones.
> 
> If you’d like more detail on how to practice Opposition Thinking, note that it’s a simplified version of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). CBT is a process where you learn to recognize and examine irrational negative thoughts (for example: “I failed that test, so I’m stupid and worthless”) and to replace them with more positive, realistic thoughts (like, “One test doesn’t define my life; I’ll do better next time”).
> 
> With CBT, you examine your thoughts using questions like:
> 
>   * What evidence is there that this thought is true? What evidence is there that it’s false?
> 
>   * How else could I think about this situation?
> 
>   * If a friend had this thought, what would I say to him or her?
> 
> 

> 
> Opposition Thinking is a more streamlined process; you simply recognize the negative thought and dismiss it by thinking of something else, effectively skipping all of the in-between steps of CBT. However, if you find that you’re truly struggling to control your negative thoughts, you may find it useful to go through the full process of CBT—with professional help, if necessary.

##### Exercise #3: Visualizing Your Ideal Self

Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and simply breathe until you feel calm and your mind is clear. Then visualize, as clearly as you can, the person you want to be. For example, if you want to be happy, see yourself laughing and smiling. If you want to be brave, see yourself acting boldly at a decisive moment.

This exercise is grounded in the idea that **your mind attracts what you think about.** Therefore, if there is a lack in your life, it’s because there is a lack in your thoughts. This exercise is designed to make sure that you’re attracting the right things.

While teaching Julian, Yogi Raman called this phenomenon of attracting what you think about _joriki_ , which means “concentrated mind.”

> **Joriki and the Law of Attraction**
> 
> _Joriki_ is a concept in Zen Buddhism. It describes the ability to act instantly and correctly, apparently without thought, when your mind is fully focused on a single objective or idea.
> 
> Sharma is merging joriki with the _Law of Attraction:_ the idea that positive thoughts attract positive experiences. The Law of Attraction came from the New Thought movement of the late 19th century; more recently, Rhonda Byrne repopularized the idea with her 2006 movie _The Secret_ , and the book of the same name, published in 2007 _._
> 
> In combining the concepts of joriki and the Law of Attraction, Sharma is saying that by focusing your mind entirely on one specific thing that you want, you’ll attract that thing into your life.
> 
> However, others argue that you don’t “attract” the things you think about—you simply start to notice them. For example, in his book _Limitless_ , Jim Kwik talks about setting your brain to look for relevant information by asking a _dominant question_. Kwik says that whatever you’re looking for has always been there, but dominant questions prepare your mind to notice it. Some readers may also recognize this principle by its more scientific name, the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.).

### Don’t Judge Your Experiences

So far we’ve discussed focus, but, according to Sharma, in order to properly maintain the garden of your mind, you must also develop _clarity_. Clarity of thought means that you see and understand your experiences for what they are, rather than getting distracted by your feelings about them.

You can start developing clarity by recognizing that **there’s no such thing as objective reality.** For example, one person’s favorite food might be disgusting—or even dangerous—to someone else. Similarly, what seems like a tragedy could actually be a great opportunity, like Julian’s heart attack.

Therefore, Sharma argues that**it’s important to stay focused on your experiences themselves, rather than your judgments of those experiences.** Any judgments you make will inevitably be flawed, because there’s no objective truth to base those judgments on. Therefore,**** don’t think of your experiences as “good” or “bad;” just live them, and accept what they have to teach you.

Sharma believes this lesson applies even to the most mundane experiences. For example, if you try a new food and don’t enjoy the taste, now you know that you don’t like that food. Thus, your experience has taught you something. However, there’s no sense in dwelling on how bad it tasted; simply accept the lesson and move on.

> **Various Schools of Thought on Accepting Your Experiences**
> 
> Many different philosophical traditions, including several that we’ve already discussed, teach that **you shouldn't try to judge your moment-to-moment experiences as good or bad.** Instead, you should simply accept the present moment for what it is.
> 
> The reasons they give for that conclusion vary:
> 
>   * Stoicism (e.g. _Meditations_) says that your experiences are what the gods and Nature have decreed for you. Since a human can’t hope to resist the will of the gods, it’s better to just accept whatever happens.
> 
>   * Hinduism (e.g. the _Bhagavad Gita_) says that everything we perceive and experience is illusory, and that God is the only true reality. Since our experiences are unreal and temporary, we mustn’t let ourselves be affected by them.
> 
>   * Buddhism teaches that we should welcome our experiences, but not let them rule us. In other words, our experiences don’t affect our thoughts or our actions. Tara Brach explores this topic from a Buddhist perspective in her book _Radical Acceptance._
> 
>   * Less religious schools of thought might talk about the benefits of “living in the moment,” or similar phrases; that is, being fully present instead of lost in thought. For example, Eckhart Tolle’s book _The Power of Now _teaches that being fully present in each moment is the _only_ way to find happiness, peace, and fulfillment in your life.
> 
> 

> 
> Whatever the given reasons, it’s clear that a wide variety of philosophies value accepting your experiences for what they are, instead of trying to judge or control them.
