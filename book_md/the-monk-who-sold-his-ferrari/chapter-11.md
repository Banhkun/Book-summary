## Chapter 11: The Watch—Time

**The watch from Yogi Raman’s story symbolizes time.** Specifically, it represents the understanding that your time is limited and precious.

Sharma maintains that those who use their limited time wisely and productively will lead rich, full lives.

> Clocks are a symbol of time, for obvious reasons. Specifically, they’re often a metaphor for _limited_ time—Sharma is saying that your life is finite, and therefore so is the time that you have to work with.
> 
> When the sumo wrestler from the fable picks up the stopwatch, he immediately faints; he’s overwhelmed by the realization that his time is limited. The way to avoid the overwhelm that he experienced is to **make the most of what time you have,** and**live a life that you’ll be satisfied with** (as you’ll see with the next metaphor, the roses).

### How Julian Manages His Time

John mentions that he once heard the busiest people are the ones with time to spare. Julian agrees, saying that **the most productive people aren’t the workaholics, but the ones who manage their time well.**

Julian offers three strategies to manage your time more effectively:

#### Prioritize

People say that **80 percent of what you achieve comes from 20 percent of what you do.** Think about all the things you do in a day, then think about which of those things will have a lasting impact on your life. Most likely you’ll only come up with a few things that actually matter in the long run.

Important activities might include:

  * Connecting with friends and family 
  * Improving professional relationships 
  * Studying to expand your knowledge base 
  * Meditating and improving your inner life 
  * Resting to heal your mind, body, and spirit 



These are only examples. Sharma emphasizes that you need to find what will be important to you in the long run, and devote your time and energy to those things.

> **The 80/20 Rule and the Size Instinct**
> 
> In _Factfulness_ , Hans Rosling explains that the 80/20 Rule (also known as the Pareto Principle) applies to everything from causes of death to items in a budget—20% of the items in each dataset cause 80% of the results in that dataset. One scientific study even suggests that the 80/20 Rule might be a result of the natural law of entropy.
> 
> Rosling also says that we recognize the 80/20 Rule when we overcome the _size instinct._ The size instinct is the human tendency to overestimate how important a single fact or piece of data is when it’s presented without context.
> 
> For example, if someone told you that Amazon’s stock price had dropped by nearly $15 yesterday, that would sound like an enormous amount of money to lose in a day. However, if they then told you that was only 0.45% of the stock’s value, you’d recognize that drop for the minor fluctuation that it really is.
> 
> Therefore, when you examine your own day-to-day life, look for the few things you do that have the greatest impact—and don’t get distracted by contextless events. For example, if you made an extra $50 one day from selling something on eBay, consider the time you spent and the money you made in the context of your entire day, and your entire income. How much of a difference did that sale _really_ make, and how much time did it cost you?

#### Plan

Sharma suggests that, rather than spend a stressful day scrambling to catch up on all the things you have to do, you take 15 minutes the night before to plan your next day—or, better yet, take an hour on your day off to plan your week.

Figure out what you have to do professionally, personally, socially, and spiritually, and allot time for all of your daily tasks. **Write down your schedule, and then stick to it.**

Procrastination is human nature, so you’ll naturally want to avoid or put off unpleasant tasks. However, remember that the happiest people are the ones who will accept short-term discomfort for long-term benefits.

Also, Sharma warns, be wary of people who try to steal your time. Protect your time ruthlessly. Don’t be afraid to tell people _no_ when they try to intrude on time you’ve allotted for something else.

> _The 12 Week Year_ suggests making the most of your time through “time blocking,” which means creating solid stretches of time where you focus on only one thing (remember the myth of multitasking). However, in order for this to be effective, you have to add three time blocks to your usual weekly schedule:
> 
>   * **Strategic block.** This is a three-hour stretch of time where you focus 100% on whatever will bring you closer to your goal. One hundred percent focus means that you don’t take phone calls, check emails or text messages, or get distracted by other tasks during that entire three-hour block.
> 
>     * According to _The 12 Week Year_ , you can maintain perfect focus for about three hours each week. The strategic block is designed to make the most of those three hours by planning out when you’ll use them, and what you’ll use them for.
>   * **Buffer block.** This is a pre-set time block where you take care of all the things that would normally distract you throughout your work day. This is a time to answer emails, make phone calls, check travel arrangements, or handle whatever else might be weighing on your mind.
> 
>   * **Breakout block.** This is time that you commit to resting, relaxing, and having fun. Success-driven people tend to overlook this block in favor of scheduling more time to work, but it’s important to give yourself time to recover as well.
> 
>     * Remember Julian’s life at the beginning of _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari._ Julian never scheduled any breakout blocks, so he was constantly stressed and exhausted—issues that culminated in his heart attack.

#### Assume Failure Doesn’t Exist

We’ve previously discussed how failure is an excellent teacher. However, to make the most of your time, Sharma says **you should act as if failure doesn’t even exist.** Dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about future ones is a waste of your precious time.

Don’t set limits on yourself; let your imagination go where it will. Have no doubt in your mind that you’ll achieve all of your goals: professional, personal, and spiritual. Most of all, don’t be ashamed of your past, or afraid of your future.

> Prioritizing and planning are obvious ways to make better use of your time, but this third subsection might seem out of place at first glance. What this section’s really saying is that **it’s better to take a chance than to try to eliminate any chance that you’ll make a mistake.**
> 
> In _Daring Greatly_ , Brené Brown discusses how we hold ourselves back through shame and fear—we’re afraid to be vulnerable, and we try to avoid shame by never making mistakes. Therefore, we never take chances in our relationships, our careers, or any other aspect of our lives.
> 
> To find the courage to act as though failure doesn’t exist, Brown offers these solutions:
> 
>   * Counteract shame with _awareness_ and _connection_. Whenever you feel shame, identify what triggered it. Then, try to determine whether that shame is rooted in something reasonable, or in impossible expectations and perfectionism. Once you understand your shame and where it came from, reach out to someone you trust and discuss the experience; this is an important step toward overcoming shame and developing feelings of worthiness and belonging.
> 
>   * Counteract fear with _self-compassion_. Rather than trying to avoid ever making mistakes, or berating yourself for your imperfections, recognize that you’re doing your best and that it’s enough.
>
