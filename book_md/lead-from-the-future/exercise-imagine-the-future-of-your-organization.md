First, think about what the future likely holds for your organization's sector in five to 10 years. Are there any major shifts or disruptions on the horizon?

Next, consider your organization's current state. Are there any key aspects of your organization that will fare well in the future? What are the key challenges to relevancy and growth that your organization will likely face in the future?

Think about the capabilities and competencies that your organization will need to develop in order to achieve its stay relevant in the future. What steps can you take to build and develop these capabilities over time?
