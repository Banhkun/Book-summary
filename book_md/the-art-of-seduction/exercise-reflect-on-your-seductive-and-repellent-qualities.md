## Exercise: Reflect on Your Seductive and Repellent Qualities

Greene says that identifying your natural tendencies is a foundational element for successful seduction. Reflect on your traits, both seductive and repellent, to set up your game.

* * *

Which of the seducer types do you most identify with? How do you think you could hone some of the qualities to polish your seductive image?

Now revisit the repellent qualities Greene identifies. Do you recognize any of these qualities in yourself? List any that you think might crop up in your behavior.

Reflect honestly on those repellent qualities you identified. Has anyone ever said something to you about exhibiting any of these behaviors, and was it positive or negative? Do you think it's better to fix these qualities or accept them, and why?
