## Introduction

**Many features of the human body are just complex versions of those in simpler creatures that, at first glance, seem totally unlike us**.

In _Your Inner Fish_ , Neil Shubin, a professor and paleontologist who studies fish fossils, explains that understanding how a shark’s head, a reptile’s brain, and a fish’s fins developed helps make sense of complicated and confounding human anatomy.

Shubin’s exploration of our primitive connections started in the Canadian Arctic, where he and colleagues discovered a key link in the chain from the earliest creatures to humans: a 375-million-year-old fossil fish, _Tiktaalik,_ that had features for living on land.

**Ancient fossils like _Tiktaalik_ , plus embryos and DNA, provide clues to a story of human development stretching back 3.5 billion years**.

Casting new light on the human family tree, _Your Inner Fish_ became a popular PBS series.
