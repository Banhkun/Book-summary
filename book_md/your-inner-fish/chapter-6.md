## Chapter 6: Body Design

**Humans share their basic body design with nearly all other creatures**. It starts with embryos, which go through the same early stages of development, regardless of the animal type. This chapter explains how embryos develop key body structures.

Animals as diverse as humans, fish, lizards, birds, amphibians, and mammals all have symmetrical bodies of the same design, with a front/back, top/bottom, and left/right, plus a head, spinal cord, and organs in specific places. Heads and feet point forward in the direction we move and the butt points the opposite direction.

When you look at embryos there are many more similarities among animals than differences.

### The Common Plan

In the 1800s, biologist Karl Ernst Von Baer was struck by the similarities in embryos. Further, he discovered that all organs in an embryo, whether it’s a chicken, fish, mammal, or amphibian, originate in one of three layers of tissue called germ layers. For example, every type of animal’s heart forms from the same layer. He concluded that all animals develop by the same stages.

For the first few days after conception, an embryo is a ball of cells called a blastocyst, which attaches to the wall of the uterus. The cells rapidly divide and move, causing tissues to fold and form a tube with a swelling at each end. Three layers—the germ layers—take shape:

  1. **Ectoderm** : an outer layer, which becomes hair, skin, nervous system
  2. **Endoderm** : an inner layer, which becomes the guts or inner structures of the digestive system and glands
  3. **Mesoderm** : a middle layer, which becomes the body cavity plus tissue, skeleton, and muscles



All animals with a backbone have gill arches and notochords and look like a double tube in the early embryo stages. Distinctive features, such as a bigger brain in humans, shells on turtles, and feathers on birds, develop later.

### Experimenting With Embryos

In an effort to learn more about how embryos develop body structures and organs, early scientists experimented with them by cutting, grafting, and treating them with chemicals.

In 1903, German embryologist Hans Spemann determined that more than one individual can come from a single egg—he pinched apart a newt embryo making two clumps of cells. Each clump formed a newt, showing that embryonic cells can build a whole body.

In the 1920s, another researcher, Hilde Mangold, grafted a bit of newt embryo tissue containing all three germ layers onto an embryo of another species. The transplanted tissue developed a full newt body on the back of the second embryo. Scientists called the bit of tissue, which directed other cells to form a complete body, the Organizer.

Another researcher figured out how to label cells so their development into body parts could be traced. This led to an embryo map showing where every organ begins.

**All mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians have Organizers, which initiate the bodybuilding process, telling each clump of cells in the embryo to follow the body plan for that animal**. The key is that the Organizer contains DNA with the recipe—shared by humans and all animals—telling cells how to build bodies.

### HOX Genes

Modern embryologists studying fruit flies learned that genes in the Organizer called _Hox_ genes control the development of tissues and bodies.

Fruit flies are a good study subject because they often develop mutations—scientists have been studying them for over a hundred years. For instance, sometimes a leg develops where an antenna should, or there’s an extra set of wings or missing body segments.

By comparing chromosomal differences between normal flies and mutated flies, scientists identified the genes responsible for various mutations. They’re arranged in a sequence in order of the body part they affect—for example, the genes in the middle of the sequence affect the middle part of the fly.

This DNA sequence is called a homeobox and the genes comprising it are called _Hox_ genes. All animals have _Hox_ genes, with complex animals having more. Every _Hox_ gene is a version of the same basic template. They direct the construction of the body from front to back in all animals. They control body proportions and development of organs, limbs, and genitalia. Changes in these genes result in deformities. For example, if a _Hox_ gene controlling the middle section of a fly is missing, the fly lacks that segment.

#### DNA and the Organizer

Further study of _Hox_ genes led scientists back to the Organizer, which, in addition to containing _Hox_ genes, was found to contain several other types of genes that interact to affect body development.

A gene called the _Noggin_ directs the embryo to make a head. It works with another gene called _BMP-4_ that forms the bottom or belly side of an animal. Where _Noggin_ is active, it turns off _BMP-4_ in cells so they can’t develop into bottom cells—instead, the cells become top cells. Genes interact with each other this way at all stages of development.

### An Inner Sea Anemone

Our body design has echoes not only in mammals, frogs, and fish, but even in a more primitive creature, the sea anemone, a jellyfish relative. These creatures show how the body’s front/back axis or head-to-anus line develops. This axis defines our direction of movement.

An anemone is shaped like a tree with a long trunk and tentacles at the top. It has a top/bottom, or oral-aboral, axis from its mouth to base. While it lacks a front/back axis, using one opening to both take in food and expel waste, it still has primitive versions of genes that establish the head-to-anus line in humans. These genes are active along the anemone’s oral-aboral axis, meaning that this primitive axis is genetically equivalent to our head-anus axis.

Further, when an anemone is cut open, it clearly has left and right sides, and thus has an axis directing its movement.

Sea anemones also have a version of the _Noggin_ gene that forms the back or upper side of a frog. When scientists injected sea anemone _Noggin_ into a frog embryo, the anemone _Noggin_ created extra back structures in the frog (in other words, it worked the same way a frog’s own _Noggin_ worked), further demonstrating the genetic similarities between vertebrates and more primitive creatures.

**All animals, including humans, draw on the same basic genetic recipe—but they enhance it over eons, like improving a recipe for a cake as it’s passed to subsequent generations**.
