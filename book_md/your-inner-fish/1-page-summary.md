## 1-Page Summary

**Many features of the human body are just complex versions of those in simpler creatures that, at first glance, seem totally unlike us**.

In _Your Inner Fish_ , Neil Shubin, a professor and paleontologist who studies fish fossils, explains that understanding how a shark’s head, a reptile’s brain, and a fish’s fins developed helps make sense of complicated and confounding human anatomy.

Shubin’s story starts in the Canadian Arctic, where he and colleagues discovered a key link in the chain from the earliest creatures to humans: a 375-million-year-old fossil fish, _Tiktaalik,_ that developed features for living on land. _Tiktaalik’s_ rudimentary joints, including a head free of the shoulder, are precursors to those of amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals—and humans.

Casting new light on the human family tree, **ancient fossils like _Tiktaalik_ , as well as embryos and DNA, provide clues to a story of human development stretching back 3.5 billion years**.

### Fossil Clues to Human Development

Fossils are one of three major types of evidence for how human bodies developed and how they work; the others are embryos and genes.

To understand the origins of land animals and their connection to humans, Shubin set out to find evidence of the first limbed animal, or fish that walked on land.

In 2004, after four expeditions over six years in the Canadian Arctic, he and his team found a fossil skeleton of a transitional creature between fish and land animals. Like a fish, it had scales and fins with fin webbing, but like a land animal, it had a flat head with eyes on top and a neck. Also, the fins contained bones corresponding to salamander-type shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, giving it the ability to propel itself on land.

The land-fish, called _Tiktaalik,_ is as important to human history as the African hominid fossil Lucy. Through Lucy, we trace our primate history; _Tiktaalik_ tells us our history as fish. **The story of the development of human anatomy through small changes over millennia can be read in fossils, as well as in our genes through DNA—starting with our “inner fish**.”

### A Skeletal Pattern for Limbs

This book shows how scientists can trace bones, teeth, the DNA recipe, and the biological process for building organs from early creatures to humans. **These similarities show that the world’s diverse creatures are variations on a theme**.

Fish like _Tiktaalik_ carried the pattern or blueprint for our hands and feet, which would continue to develop and be refined over hundreds of millions of years through a progression of fish, amphibians, and reptiles.

For example, in the 1800s, scientists found that nearly all animals with limbs (wings, flippers, bones, or hands) have the same structural limb design, although the shape and size of the bones vary. In this shared limb design, one bone connects with two, which attach to an array of small knucklebone-type “blobs,” which connect to digits.

_Tiktaalik’s_ fin was a primitive version of a limb—a wrist bone with spaces for four other bones. Its hand-like fins likely enabled _Tiktaalik_ to move along the bottom of streams or ponds and flop its way across mudflats.

### A DNA Recipe for Limbs

**Just as echoes of our bone development can be seen in earlier animals, our genetic recipe also traces back to other creatures.**

All cells contain the same DNA. But organ and tissue cells develop differently because certain genes (stretches of DNA) in the cells are active while others are turned off.

In an embryo of any animal, the genetic switches for making limbs activate between the third and eighth weeks, and limbs start developing. First, tiny buds protrude from the embryonic body, then the tips develop into paddles. A patch of tissue in the paddles’ tips, called the ZPA, controls development of the bone pattern of limbs by varying the concentration of a molecule in the cells building the limb.

In the 1990s, researchers identified the mystery molecule dictating limb development, which they called the _Sonic_ _hedgehog_ gene (named for a video game character). Experiments manipulating the gene to produce limbs in chicken, mouse, shark, and skate embryos showed that all appendages, whether fins or limbs, share the same DNA recipe.

### A Pattern in Our Heads

**The complicated assemblage of bones, tissue, muscles, arteries, and nerves that comprises our head is based on a simple plan found in sharks** , with echoes of even earlier structures in headless worms.

The human head begins forming at the base of the embryo at about three weeks. Four swellings called arches develop in the area that will be the throat. Specific cells in each arch form bone, muscle, and blood vessels.

Cells from the first arch form the upper and lower jaws and two of the ear bones. Cells from the second arch form the third ear bone, a throat bone, and facial muscles. Third-arch cells form bones, muscles, and nerves in the throat that are used to swallow. Finally, cells from the fourth arch form the deep part of the throat, including the larynx and its surrounding muscles and vessels.

Our head reflects the same pattern as those of sharks, fish, and salamanders. The arches of the human embryo look much like the gill slits in the throat area of sharks and fish, although human gill slits are sealed by the plates of the skull before birth. The arches in sharks and humans develop comparable body systems.

These patterns stretch back even further than sharks—to worms that don’t really have heads. A worm called _amphioxus_ lacks a skull but has a notochord—a nerve cord and jelly-filled rod like a primitive version of a backbone. Human embryos also have a notochord, which breaks up to become jelly-filled disks between our vertebrae.

### A Body Design

Just as we share common designs for our hands, limbs, and heads with other creatures, we share our basic body design with other creatures as well. It starts with embryos, which go through the same early stages of development, regardless of the animal type.

**Animals as diverse as humans, fish, lizards, birds, amphibians, and mammals all have symmetrical bodies of the same design** —with a front/back, top/bottom, and left/right, plus a head, spinal cord, and organs in specific places. Heads and feet point forward in the direction we move and the butt points the opposite direction.

When you look at embryos, there are many more similarities among animals than differences.

Every animal’s organs start in one of three layers of tissue called germ layers. For example, every type of animal’s heart forms from the same layer. The layers are:

  1. **Ectoderm** : an outer layer, which becomes hair, skin, nervous system
  2. **Endoderm** : an inner layer, which becomes the guts or inner structures of the digestive system and glands
  3. **Mesoderm** : a middle layer, which becomes the body cavity plus tissue, skeleton, and muscles



All animals with a backbone have gill arches and notochords and look the same in the early embryo stages. Distinctive features such as a bigger brain in humans, shells on turtles, and feathers on birds, develop later.

#### Body Building Blocks

In simplest terms, a body is a group of cells that perform different individual functions (have a division of labor) but together create a greater whole. To form bodies, cells have to be able to: 1) attach to each other to create specific materials like bone, and 2) communicate with each other.

**1) Sticking Together:** Some of the earliest bodies were multi-celled creatures that lived in the seas 600 million years ago. They were made of the same type of “glue” (collagen and proteoglycan) that allows human body cells to stick together to build materials and organs. In our bodies, this glue is a mix of molecules that differs depending on the organ it’s forming—for instance, a bone versus an eye. Without the molecule mix attaching cells to each other, bodies couldn’t be formed.

In addition to the molecule mix, cells stick together by using various types of molecular rivets. Some work like contact cement gluing the outsides of two cells together. Other rivets bond only to cells with the same kind of rivet, a mechanism that enables cells to organize and ensures that bone cells stick to bone cells, skin cells stick to skin cells, and so on.

**2) Communicating:** To build bodies, cells must communicate so they know when to divide, make molecules, and die.

They communicate by sending out molecules with messages. A cell sends a signal or molecule, which attaches to the outside of a receiving cell. This sets off a chain reaction of molecules within the cell as the message travels from the outer membrane to the nucleus. As a result, the cell receiving the information changes its behavior.

One of the simplest bodies is a _placozoan_ , a live blob first found on aquarium glass in the 1800s. It has a plate-shaped body with only four types of cells, yet they have a division of labor and rivet connections, and they communicate.

### The Human Family Tree

Humans have parts that _resemble_ parts of other creatures, we have certain parts _in common with_ every other animal, and we have parts that are _unique_ to us. Scientists can build a human family tree that shows the order in these features.

Our family tree looks something like this:

  * **Multicellular animals:** animals with bodies composed of many cells; this group encompasses all animals.
  * **Bilateria:** multicellular animals with a body plan like ours, plus a front/back, top/bottom, and left/right symmetry; this includes every animal from insects to humans.
  * **Vertebrates:** animals with a body plan like ours, plus a skull and backbone.
  * **Vertebrate tetrapods:** animals with a body plan like ours, a skull and backbone, plus four limbs. 
  * **Mammals:** animals with a body plan like ours, a skull, backbone, and four limbs, plus a three-boned middle ear. 
  * **Humans:** animals with a body plan like ours, a skull, backbone, four limbs, and a three-boned middle ear—who walk on two legs and have a large brain.



Fossil data also show the developmental order: the first multi-celled fossil at 600 million years old is older than the first fossil with a three-boned middle ear (200 million years old). The three-boned middle ear fossil is in turn older than the first fossil that walked on two legs (4 million years old).

Our bodies are time capsules, containing features from ancient animals that mark key moments in the history of life. From our commonalities, we have the potential to learn what makes us human and find cures for many of our ills.
