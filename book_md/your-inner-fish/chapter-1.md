## Chapter 1: Your Inner Fish

Finding important clues to our human past in fossils seems improbable when you consider that:

  * 99% of species are extinct.
  * Only a fraction of these are preserved as fossils.
  * We find only a fraction of all fossils.



Nonetheless, for hundreds of years, scientists like Shubin have been uncovering **fossils of worms and fish that, combined with clues from DNA studies, go a long way toward explaining the structure of our bodies.**

Not just curiosities, fossils are an important part of the story of our development. This chapter explains how scientists determine where to look for fossils, how they categorize what they find—and how Shubin knew where to find the fish that foreshadowed human limb development.

### Fossil Clues to Human Development

In 2004, on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic, Shubin’s team found a 375-million-year-old fossil fish with a neck, a flat head, and fins capable of propelling it on land, making the creature a key link in the evolutionary chain from fish to land animals.

But understanding its significance as a clue to human development several billion years later requires understanding how scientists find and interpret fossils in the first place.

#### How Scientists Find Fossils

Fossils are one of three major types of evidence for how human bodies developed and how they work; the others are embryos and genes.

**While fossils are sometimes stumbled upon accidentally by scientists and laypeople, their locations often can be predicted with surprising accuracy**. Finding them is a matter of both planning and luck: scientists use sophisticated mapping, plus rock-dating and radiographic scanning technology, to identify promising sites. Then they depend on luck and the physical yet delicate work of digging in the right spots.

Though fossil sites are rare, scientists can predict where important fossils lie. They look for locations meeting three criteria:

  1. Rocks the right age
  2. Rock types conducive to preserving fossils
  3. Rocks that are exposed



Rocks can be dated because they’re arranged in layers going back billions of years, with the oldest rocks in the lowest layers and more recent ones on top. Earthquakes and faults can push some older layers over younger ones, but scientists can usually figure out the correct order.

The fossils in rock layers also follow a progression from the oldest on the bottom to younger fossils in higher layers. The lowest layers show little evidence of life; then there’s a progression from jellyfish-like creatures; to animals with skeletons, limbs, and organs such as eyes; to vertebrates.

#### Lessons from the Zoo

**Every species fits into a complicated classification system or taxonomy that helps paleontologists identify what they’re looking at and predict what they’ll find**.

A trip to the zoo illustrates how the system works. The system organizes species and organisms by grouping them according to traits they share, like a set of Russian nesting dolls with smaller groups encompassed by larger ones.

Every species in a zoo has a head and two eyes; another group or subset has a head, eyes, and limbs; additional subsets have a large brain, walk on two legs, and so on. Each subset adds a feature. The more unique a group is, the younger or more recent it is. Scientists would look for fossils with a head and eyes in rocks far below fossils with a head, eyes, and limbs.

With computers, scientists can analyze thousands of species, their characteristics, and their DNA. Fossils provide information to help to refine the groupings, as well as to build a catalog of rock layers by time period and fossil type.

### Finding the Earliest Land Creature

To understand the origins of land animals and their connection to humans, Shubin set out to find evidence of the first limbed animal, or fish that walked on land. To choose where to look, he applied the three fossil-finding criteria this way:

1) **Rocks the right age** : He focused on finding rocks 375 million years old. Researchers had found 365-million-year-old rocks containing amphibian fossils and 385-million-year-old rocks with standard fish, but there was a gap in the fossil record between 365 million and 385 million years. Shubin hypothesized that the missing link was the limbed fish.

2) **Rocks of the right type** : Shubin looked for sedimentary rocks because they’re the best type for preserving fossils. These rocks are formed when lakes, rivers, and oceans—habitats in which the first fish with limbs could live—deposit layers of sediment.

3) **Rocks that are exposed** : The last step is finding rock of the right age and type that’s also exposed, with little soil, vegetation, or human disturbance. Shubin found conditions meeting these three criteria in the Arctic.

After four expeditions over six years, Shubin and his team found what they were looking for—a complete fossil skeleton of a transitional creature between fish and land animals.

Like a fish, it had scales and fins with fin webbing, but like a land animal, it had a flat head with eyes on top and a neck. Also, the fins contained bones corresponding to salamander-type shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, allowing it to propel itself on land. Researchers called the land-fish _Tiktaalik,_ meaning large freshwater fish in the Inuit language.

**_Tiktaalik_ , with its rudimentary joints, including a head free of the shoulder, shares this structure with amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals—and us**.

It’s as important to our history as the African hominid fossil Lucy. Through Lucy, we trace our primate history; _Tiktaalik_ tells us our history as fish. **The story of the development of human anatomy through small changes over millennia can be read in fossils, as well as in our genes** through DNA—starting with our “inner fish.”
