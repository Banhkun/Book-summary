## Chapter 5: The Pattern in Our Heads

The complicated assemblage of bones, muscles, arteries, and nerves that comprises our head—and makes our eyes, ears, and nose function—lacks a discernible pattern or logic to anyone trying to learn it. However, this chapter explains that while it seems complicated, our head’s structure is based on a simple plan found in sharks, with echoes of even earlier structures in headless worms.

### A Pattern in Our Heads

The head’s components are difficult to see because they’re contained by the skull, which consists of plates, blocks, and rods.

  * The plates fit together, covering the brain.
  * The blocks are a platform holding the brain, with arteries and nerves running through it.
  * The rods are bones in our jaw, ears, and throat; they start out as rods but change shape.



The skull has compartments for our brain, eyes, parts of our ears, and nasal system. There are also muscles allowing us to move our head and eyes. Twelve cranial nerves make things function. Some have simple paths—for instance, attaching to the eye (optic nerve) or ear (acoustic nerve). But four cranial nerves have complicated functions and routes. The most confusing are the trigeminal and facial nerves.

The trigeminal nerve affects muscles for chewing, muscles in the ear, and sensations in the face and the teeth. The facial nerve affects facial expressions and muscles in the ear. These two nerves seem to duplicate functions by going to some of the same places, which doesn’t seem very efficient. But, like the wiring of an old house, the reason for the setup can be found in the history of how the system started and was subsequently updated. Our head’s history starts in the embryo.

### Early Development

The human head begins forming at the base of the embryo at about three weeks. Four swellings called arches develop in the area that will be the throat. Specific cells in each arch form bone, muscle, and blood vessels:

  * **First arch** : Cells from the first arch form the upper and lower jaws and two of the ear bones. 
  * **Second arch** : Cells from this arch form the third ear bone, a throat bone, and facial muscles. 
  * **Third arch** : These cells form bones, muscles, and nerves in the throat that are used to swallow. 
  * **Fourth arch** : This arch forms the deep part of the throat, including the larynx and its surrounding muscles and vessels.



The arches dictate the routes of the key cranial nerves. The trigeminal nerve serves the body systems (jaw and ear) formed by the first arch. The facial nerve serves structures developed by the second arch. The nerves corresponding with the third and fourth arches follow the same pattern.

The human body is segmented. Each vertebra in the body represents a segment. The nerves corresponding with each body system exit the spinal cord at a specific point, according to their segment. For example, our leg muscles are served by nerves exiting the spinal cord at a point below the nerves serving our arm muscles. The head is also segmented, as determined by the arches. This is why, for instance, both the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve travel to the ear. They’re not redundant—each evolved with a different purpose. But this pattern can only be seen in the embryo, when the head is less complicated.

#### Your Inner Shark

Besides mapping the way our head is put together, the arches also trace back to sharks.

**While the human head is complicated, it follows a pattern common to the skulls of sharks, fish, and salamanders**.

The arches of the human embryo look much like the gill slits in the throat area of sharks and fish, although human gill slits are sealed by the plates of the skull before birth. The arches in sharks and humans develop comparable body systems.

The first arch forms jaws in both; in humans, it also forms ear bones. The second arch forms the bones of the upper jaw in sharks; in humans, it forms inner ear and throat muscles. The third and fourth arches support the gills in sharks; in humans, they form the muscles we use to swallow and talk.

In the first three weeks after conception, many genes turn on and off in the arches, as brain tissue begins to develop and the genes direct cells to form other parts of the head.

Each arch has a different set of genes called _Hox_ genes, which tell the arch what to become. (_Hox_ genes are explained in detail in Chapter 6.)

### Our Headless Ancestor

Patterns seen in the human head stretch back even further than sharks—to worms that don’t really have heads.

A worm called _amphioxus_ lacks a skull but has a notochord—a nerve cord and jelly-filled rod like a primitive version of a backbone. Human embryos also have a notochord, which breaks up to become jelly-filled disks between our vertebrae. When you rupture a disk, leaking jelly can pinch nerves and hinder movement.

Fossil impressions from 500-million-year-old rock show the same type of worm with gill arches—meaning that the basic structure of the human head traces back to worms that didn’t have heads.

Like our teeth, limbs, and genes, the basic structures of our head are modified and repurposed versions from earlier creatures. In the fossil worm, gill arches filtered food from water; in humans, they evolved into jaws, ear bones, and parts of the larynx.
