## Chapter 3: How Genes Develop Limbs

**Just as echoes of our bone development can be seen in earlier animals, our genetic recipe also traces back to other creatures.** DNA research answers questions about our development that fossil study can’t answer because variables can be manipulated in animal embryos to see what happens.

DNA contains the “recipe” that builds human or animal bodies from an egg. By experimenting with DNA in animal and shark embryos, scientists have shown that **all appendages, whether limbs or fins, develop the same way from the same DNA recipe**. This chapter looks at the experiments, starting in the fifties and sixties, that led to this understanding.

Although the human body is made up of hundreds of different kinds of cells, which make our bones, organs, nerves, and tissues function differently, all cells contain the same DNA.

Organ and tissue cells develop differently because certain genes (stretches of DNA) in the cells are active while others are turned off. The active genes make a protein affecting what a cell looks like and how it behaves.

Understanding the on-off mechanism explains what genes build which parts of the body and how they work, whether building a limb or a fin.

### Forming Hands

Our hands are three dimensional, with a top/bottom, thumb side/little finger side, and base/tip. Understanding the genes that make the thumb different from the little finger or fingers different from arm bones is a key to the genetic recipe that builds hands and the rest of our bodies.

In an embryo, the genetic switches for forming limbs activate between the third and eighth week after conception and limbs start developing. First, tiny buds protrude from the embryonic body, then the tips develop into paddles. The paddles contain millions of cells that ultimately become the limb’s skeleton, nerves, and muscles.

To learn about the process, scientists experiment with genetic mutations that make limbs malform. In the fifties and sixties, scientists experimenting with chicken embryos uncovered a key mechanism—a patch of tissue—that controls development of the bone pattern of limbs. **By removing the patch, they could stop limb development at various points.** They called the patch, which causes the little-finger side of a hand to differentiate from the thumb side, the ZPA, or zone of polarizing activity.

Moving the ZPA from the little-finger side of the limb bud to the thumb side caused the embryo to develop a duplicate set of digits mirroring the normal set on that side.

The ZPA controls development of fingers and toes by varying the concentration of a molecule in the cells building the limb. The cells nearest to the ZPA have a high concentration of the molecule and make a little finger. The cells farther away from the ZPA have a lower concentration of the molecule and make a thumb. The cells in between have varying concentrations and make second, third, and fourth fingers.

### The DNA Recipe

In the 1990s, with new molecular techniques, researchers looked at DNA in flies to identify the mystery molecule dictating limb development.

In studying fruit fly development, which occurred from front to back as genes were turned on and off, they found a gene that made body segments, the front and back ends of the fly’s torso, look different from each other. They called it the _hedgehog_ gene because flies with a mutated version of it developed bristles.

Researchers then found the _hedgehog_ gene in chickens, mice, and fish. In chickens, scientists called it _Sonic hedgehog_ after a video game character. They noticed it had a function similar to that of ZPA tissue, then realized the gene existed only in the ZPA and was involved in ZPA signaling.

Scientists soon found the _Sonic hedgehog_ gene in every limbed creature, including humans, meaning that **we all share the same genetic recipe for building upper arms, forearms, wrists, and digits.**

### From Fins to Hands

Further experiments traced the _Sonic hedgehog_ gene and the other gene activity that builds limbs all the way back to fish.

Researchers in Shubin’s lab found the _Sonic hedgehog_ gene in shark and skate embryos.

Since an effect of the _Sonic hedgehog_ gene in more complex animals is to make limbs different from each other, they wondered how it would work in creatures that don't have limbs. Sharks and skates were good test subjects because while they have "paired appendages" (fins), they don't have limbs.

Skates have cartilage rods in their fins that all look alike. Inserting _Sonic hedgehog_ protein from a mouse into a skate embryo resulted in rods that looked different from each other the way fingers do.

The experiments with sharks and skates showed that fins and limbs share the same DNA recipe. Rather than new DNA, the evolution from fins to limbs likely involved using genes of ancient origin in news ways.
