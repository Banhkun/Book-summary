## Exercise: Propose Improvements to the US Justice System

Stevenson argues that the US justice system suffers from various flaws, leading it to consistently deliver unjust punishments. In this exercise, analyze possible flaws and propose improvements to them that would better the justice system.

* * *

Of the issues discussed by Stevenson (racial biases in the justice system; flawed legal processes; extreme punishments of children, intellectually disabled and mentally ill people, veterans, and women), which do you think is the most pressing? Why?

What reforms would you suggest to address this issue? How do you think these reforms could be useful?

Do you agree with Stevenson that greater awareness of the roots of our justice system alone would help remedy injustice, or do you think it calls for a different approach? Explain your answer.
