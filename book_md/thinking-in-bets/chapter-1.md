## Chapter 1: Vetting Your Beliefs

Your beliefs play a major role in the decisions you make. This chapter goes over why we're prone to forming beliefs based on false information, how your existing beliefs affect the way you process new situations, and how you can make a habit of constantly challenging and updating your own beliefs—which in turn will make you a better decision-maker.

### Uncovering the Beliefs That Drive Your Decisions

#### Betting Against the Future

Betting involves a degree of risk, usually financial. There's something at stake for you. The same is true of most of the decisions you make in your life. **You’re choosing between "alternative futures," as Duke puts it, and betting that you'll be happier in one future than the other.**

When you decide to move to a new neighborhood, you're making a bet in which you hope to gain something (an easier commute to work, closeness to friends or relatives, a house that better suits your family’s needs). If it doesn't work out in your favor (your new neighbors are loud, the house needs more renovation than you thought, construction begins on the next street and forces you to take a different route to work), then you've lost not only those potential rewards, but also the option to stay in your old home. You could wind up better off, but you could also end up worse off.

Extend this thinking to your other day-to-day choices. A choice to exercise every week is partly about choosing a healthier future. A choice to travel around the world is partly about choosing a future of adventure and broadened horizons. A choice to get married is partly about choosing a future with one specific person over any number of potential futures with other people.

But you're not only choosing a different future. **You're choosing a different version of yourself:** the self that you _could_ become if you advance your career, start a family, or leave behind your material possessions and spend a year globe-trotting. Your life could branch out in any number of directions, but when you make one choice, you leave behind others.

**The decisions you make are ultimately driven by beliefs.** You _believe_ that job will be more fulfilling than this one. You _believe_ you'll like living in a big city better than your small town. You _believe_ cardio is good for your heart and you _believe_ that you'll live happily ever after with your partner.

Some of these beliefs are based on our direct experiences. But you might be surprised by how often false beliefs creep into our heads and stick there. Making a habit of interrogating your beliefs is essential to making good decisions.

#### The Science Behind the Formation of False Beliefs

False information seems to catch on and spread like wildfire, so much so that you could spend your whole life trying to combat the most commonly held misconceptions and likely never run out of material. Think of the popularity of _MythBusters_ (a television program that ran for over a decade where popular “myths” were tested and frequently debunked through experimentation) or Snopes.com (a fact-checking website). Why do misconceptions spread so quickly and linger even when the information needed to disprove them is readily available by doing a simple Google search?

It comes down to how we’re wired. Our early ancestors had to trust their senses in order to survive. **Our belief-forming apparatus is predisposed, then, toward credulity rather than doubt.**

With language, humans developed the ability to form beliefs with second-hand knowledge, based on things other people tell us. But we still lean toward accepting new information as true right away, rather than doubting it, even though it's being delivered by something other than our own senses. **A series of experiments by a Harvard psychology professor showed that we tend to process information as true even if it is explicitly presented as false, especially if we're under pressure.**

Unless we're given a reason to question those beliefs, vet them, and do the research necessary to acquire the facts, those wrong beliefs stick—and sometimes they'll stick even after they've been debunked.

#### Old Beliefs Affect Our Absorption of New Information

**Our beliefs can even affect how we perceive shared experiences.** That effect can happen on a small scale—how many times have you viewed another person’s innocuous comments or actions in a negative light simply because you already dislike them based on an unrelated, past experience?

But your beliefs can also influence how you process objective facts on a larger scale, as a pair of psychology professors from Dartmouth and Princeton observed in a study of how students from each of their schools viewed a football game between their teams. Because of the deeply entrenched rivalry between them, emotions ran high, and sharply different narratives emerged from each set of students (as well as the school newspapers that covered the game). Students noticed and remembered more penalties committed by the opposite team, and fewer committed by their own. They projected aggression and pinned blame on the opposition, and downplayed the infractions committed by the team they supported. They’d all watched the same game, but they came away with conflicting narratives about what had happened.

And that's just college football. Consider the ways that this belief-based processing of what should be objective information affects how we view things like news events and politics.

**When old beliefs color our perception of new information, that feeds back into our existing biases and intensifies them. This cycle is called "motivated reasoning."** That's why the phenomenon known as fake news is so insidious, and so effective. It's not converting anyone to a brand new way of thinking—it's designed to reinforce existing beliefs. If those beliefs were suppressed or buried, that extra fuel can bring them to the surface. And the algorithms in our social media feeds and search engines, designed to cater to our existing preferences, ensure that we're fed a stream of information that reinforces the way we already think and feel rather than challenging it.

Similarly, every few years, news articles claiming there's no scientific proof that flossing is necessary go viral. Many people are eager to share and believe these articles without researching beyond the headlines. Why? Because they just don't like flossing. They're biased in favor of anything that makes them feel less guilty about not flossing often enough. Dentists do continue to recommend flossing daily, and the claims that "science" doesn't support a need to floss have many caveats attached. But the articles still get written and shared, not because they're revelatory, but because they reinforce existing feelings and beliefs.

With our own natures and the very technology that’s supposed to make our lives easier working against us in this way, we have to make a conscious choice to check ourselves and the beliefs that we’re internalizing.

(Shortform note: For more on how bias can impact your life, read our guide to Biased.)

### How Uncertainty Can Make You a Better Believer

It's easy to become defensive when our beliefs are challenged—even minor beliefs—because we don't like to feel like we're wrong. That's why hearing that a belief we hold is incorrect can feel like a personal attack. But there are strategies you can use to get into the habit of vetting your own beliefs and being intellectually flexible.

1.**Imagine you had to place a bet on every belief you hold.** If being wrong about something suddenly came with an immediate financial penalty, you'd be a lot more likely to examine that belief, second-guess yourself, and do some fact-checking. The reality is that you won't have to pay for most of the misconceptions you might hold in cold, hard cash, but many beliefs do carry a penalty when they influence your choices: the alternative futures you might have had if you'd made a different decision.

2\. Acknowledge that there's likely some uncertainty in most beliefs you hold. **The more you scrutinize your beliefs, the more you'll start to realize there aren't many things you feel confident enough about to bet money on, and that's okay.** Even scientific concepts are constantly being updated or disproven. You don't have to be completely sure of every belief you hold, but it's good to think about _how_ sure you are. There can be a range of certainty, differing levels of confidence, for every belief you hold.

There are concrete benefits to allowing room for uncertainty in your beliefs.

  * It makes you less likely to fall prey to motivated reasoning: believing or disbelieving new information based on existing biases. 
  * It helps you become more open-minded. 
  * You're less likely to become defensive if you receive information that casts doubt on an existing belief. 
  * It becomes easier to change your mind when you're moving between levels of uncertainty rather than going from “right” to “wrong” (switching between two extremes). 
  * If you openly acknowledge your uncertainty about a topic when discussing it with others, you make yourself sound more objective and therefore more trustworthy—someone who allows for the possibility that they don't have all the answers is more likely to care about the truth than someone who speaks in absolutes. 
  * Your listeners will then be less likely to become wrongly indoctrinated with a false belief that you’ve unknowingly expressed, because by acknowledging your uncertainty, you trigger the belief-vetting process in others, too. 



### Example: The Reproducibility Project

The Reproducibility Project: Psychology is a study that showed how thinking in bets can produce more effective decisions.

The team behind the project asked scientists to bet on the likelihood that the results of an experiment could be replicated. They provided those scientists money to use in a betting market, and then they attempted to recreate some of the studies (and the results produced) found in top psychology journals.

When betting, those scientists were right 71% of the time about whether or not the replicated experiments would produce the same result, in comparison to the 58% accuracy found when experts gave their opinions via peer review. The discrepancy can be chalked up to the fact that **even scientists can fall prey to resulting and motivated reasoning** , and they can be biased against or in favor of a study depending on whether they are ideologically aligned with its findings. By betting, they were forced to be more critical and more objective.

It's not that those scientists who participated in the Reproducibility Project cared more because money was at stake; it's that**the project highlighted the risk involved in getting something wrong.** There is always risk in peer review—risk to the reviewers’ reputations, as well as the risk of accidentally spreading false information that could affect policy decisions and, ultimately, people’s lives. The Reproducibility Project just put that risk at the front of their minds.
