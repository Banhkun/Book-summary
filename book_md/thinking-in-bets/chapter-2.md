## Chapter 2: Evaluating Your Decision-Making Process

We’ve discussed the role of uncertainty and bias in the formation of your beliefs, and how interrogating your beliefs can help you build a stronger foundation on which to base your decisions.

Now we’ll examine the decision-making process itself, and how you can reframe your usual ways of thinking about it. **The goal is to create a mindset that moves away from absolutes and toward intellectual flexibility, objectivity, and rationality.**

We’ll cover the role uncertainty plays in our decisions, the need to judge our decisions based on our reasoning and not just the results we achieved, and the importance of thinking in shades of grey as opposed to extremes of “right or wrong.”

### Separating Process From Outcomes

Before you can get better at making decisions, you have to get better at learning from the decisions you’ve made in the past. The key to that is making sure that you’re actually learning from the _decisions_ themselves, and not thinking solely in terms of results or outcomes.

#### What Is “Resulting”?

**“Resulting” is a poker term that refers to our habit of judging a decision based solely on the outcome it produced.** It’s dangerous because it can lead you to believe you have to change your decision strategy based on one bad outcome. What if the bad outcome was due to luck, rather than the quality of your decision? In that case, changing your approach won’t help in the long run; it’ll just make you confused and erratic.

**Making good decisions isn’t just about achieving the best outcome: It’s about having a decision-making process that is sound regardless of what the final outcome is.**

For example, imagine that you have an appointment coming up. It’s raining and you guess that traffic will be slower, so you leave early. But an accident on the highway, caused by the slippery roads, leads to a traffic jam; you get stuck there for an hour and miss your appointment. While you’re waiting, the storm clears up. You realize that if you hadn’t bothered leaving early, you’d have missed the storm altogether. Or if you’d left even earlier, you might not have gotten stuck behind the accident.

But that doesn’t mean you made a bad decision. You paid attention to conditions on the road, predicted that the commute would take you longer, and took action to avoid being late. You didn’t know there would be an accident or that the weather would clear up soon, and you can’t make a decision based on information you don’t have. In general, leaving early to make your appointments is probably a practice that will serve you well, and not something you should abandon because of one bad outcome.

Before you blame a negative outcome on poor decision-making, **analyze the factors that led you to make the choice you made.** You can’t control your luck, but you can control your skill and the soundness of your thought process. You can make sure that you considered alternatives, took steps to lower your risk, and thought through all the possible outcomes.

Being a good decision-maker means staying rational in the face of losses, because some losses are inevitable. You won’t always be right, but you can always be working toward objectivity and away from emotional or biased decision-making.

Consider the reverse: bad decisions that lead to positive outcomes. Picture a college student deciding to skip an early morning class, only to belatedly remember that they have an exam that day. They race to the lecture hall, rehearsing excuses the whole way there—and find it empty. After quickly checking their email, they find out that class has been unexpectedly canceled and the exam delayed. The outcome was good, but their decision to skip class was still bad.

If we can separate positive outcomes from negative decisions, we should be able to do the same with negative outcomes that result from what could have been good decisions. **Avoid falling into the trap of “hindsight bias”—which is how, once we’ve learned the outcome of a decision, we’re prone to thinking it was obvious and we should’ve predicted it beforehand.** It only _seems_ obvious because, as the saying goes, “hindsight is 20/20.” But in the moment, things are never that simple.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how to avoid hindsight bias, read our guide to Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

#### Getting Your Deliberative and Reflexive Minds to Work Together

Duke cites psychologist Gary Marcus's labels for the different types of brain functions that are responsible for decision-making: the "reflexive mind" and the "deliberative mind." The reflexive mind makes rapid, instinctive decisions. The deliberative mind, which is associated with the prefrontal cortex, is where logic and careful consideration lie.

It would be nice if we could get our deliberative mind to take point on all our decisions, but that's not possible. In fact, the reverse is true. **It's actually our reflexive mind that handles the bulk of our decisions.**

There's an evolutionary reason for that: The snap decision to run at the sound of a strange noise in the wilderness may have saved our early ancestors from predators or other dangers, ensuring the survival of our species. In other words, irrational decision-making is in our DNA. By understanding our limitations, though, it's possible to find ways to work around them.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how to use your deliberative mind to mitigate the errors of your reflexive mind, read our guide to Thinking, Fast and Slow. For a different perspective, read our guide to Blink and learn why Malcolm Gladwell thinks reflexive decisions can lead to better outcomes than deliberate decisions.)

Poker forces you to balance your reflexive and deliberative thinking, which is one of the reasons why the game can teach us valuable lessons about rational decision-making. Players have to make fast decisions under sometimes immense pressure, depending on how much money is at stake. This means they must find ways to reconcile the instantaneous decision-making of their reflexive mind with the deliberation required to strategize in the midst of a game. To get really good at poker, you also have to be able to reflect on all those fast, in-game decisions later and figure out if a loss came down to a bad move, or just bad luck despite perfectly sound reasoning.

### How to Deal With Uncertainty

As you start to break down all the factors that go into making a particular decision, you’ll probably be forced to confront the element of uncertainty. Accept that uncertainty, and use it to change the way you think about “right and wrong” in the context of decision-making.

#### What Game Theory Can Teach You About Decisions

Game theory is a field of study that involves using mathematical models to analyze decision-making. There's more to it than that—it's a complex field that examines the interaction between multiple decision-makers, taking into account chance and other factors. But we’re going to focus on the fact that scientist and mathematician John von Neumann, whom Duke names as "the father of game theory," modeled it after poker. **That's because poker—unlike games such as chess—involves luck, hidden or incomplete information, and players who deliberately try to deceive each other.** Uncertainty is part of the game.

In chess, all the information is available on the board, and the result of the game comes down to the moves that you and the other player make. Strategy, not luck. **Life is a lot more similar to poker than chess** in that you can do everything right and lose anyway if luck is working against you. Accepting that harsh reality will get you a step closer to being able to evaluate your decisions fairly and objectively, both before and after the outcome.

#### Decisions Exist on a Right-to-Wrong Spectrum

**Black-and-white thinking—when you view things as being either totally right or totally wrong—can sabotage your decision-making ability.** Taking uncertainty into account can help you avoid that trap.

In a bet, you know that even if the odds are in your favor, there's a chance you could lose. Betting means knowing you don’t have all the information; you have to use your best judgment in the face of risk and uncertainty.

Decisions are the same; you weigh the odds and hope for the best outcome. In the ideal decision-making process, you evaluate your choices and pick the option with the highest chance of success. You may also take measures to reduce the possibility of failure even if you can't get rid of it completely.

If the less likely, unfavorable outcome is what you get, it could mean that you got unlucky, didn’t have any good choices, lacked important information, or took a risk because you thought the potential reward was worth it. It could also mean that you didn't make the best possible choice, but you didn't make the worst choice, either—you picked something in between for reasons that made sense to you at the time.

None of these factors means that your process was bad or your decision was “wrong.”

Just as it's important not to immediately blame yourself for being "wrong," it's also good practice not to give yourself too much credit for the times when you're right. **Even if you achieved the desired outcome, you still benefit from evaluating your decision-making process.** How much of your success was due to luck? Is there something you could do differently in the future to avert disasters, limit the influence of whatever isn't in your control, and make your success more of a certainty?

Going back to an earlier example about skipping class: Even though the student didn’t miss their exam, they probably recognize that they won’t get that lucky every time they unthinkingly decide to sit out a lecture. They might think twice before skipping again, or at the very least, the near-disaster might inspire them to start keeping a calendar with all tests and other important dates marked.

##### How Unsure Is Too Unsure?

It can be difficult to build a habit of self-evaluating a positive outcome because research shows that **failure carries more weight for us than success**. We feel the sting of a loss more strongly than the high of a victory. That's why you're better off freeing yourself from the concept of winning or losing altogether, when possible, and embracing the fact that most decisions and outcomes fall somewhere in between. And if all the choices available to you carry a degree of uncertainty, a chance of failure, **you can learn to evaluate which one is the _least_ likely to fail.**

You do this mental math every time you choose between two different jobs, two different homes, two different strategies in a poker game. Each option carries the chance that something will go wrong; you pick the choice you _think_ will turn out the best, even though you can’t be sure.

For example, maybe you choose the better-paying job out of two options. After weighing the pros and cons, you determined that being able to save up for your long-term goals was a priority. You’re aware that the hours will be longer and the responsibilities heavier, but that’s a trade-off you’re prepared for. You’re not guaranteed to succeed at the job or enjoy it. There’s a chance you’ll wind up hating the company culture and leaving in a few months, or that you’ll get fired. But you can’t know that will happen until you’ve tried. All you can do is pick the choice that you think is more likely to work out for you.

**Measuring your uncertainty can make you a better decision-maker because you'll be better at guessing the odds.** By thinking about not only whether you're unsure, but also _how_ unsure you are, your guesses become more educated.
