## Exercise: Separate Luck and Skill

Practice outcome fielding by applying it, right now, to events in your life. Start by thinking about something good that you experienced recently. It can be anything—a promotion, a fun night out with friends, a new favorite movie.

* * *

List _one_ aspect of that good thing that was out of your control—something you can attribute to luck or other forces.

Then, name _one_ thing about that experience that you did have power over—something you can attribute to skill. (For example: Maybe you had time to watch that amazing new movie because you stayed caught up on your work all week.)

Now, think of a negative event or result that you experienced recently, and repeat the exercise. What about it was completely out of your hands?

And what was a mistake you made or something you could have done differently?
