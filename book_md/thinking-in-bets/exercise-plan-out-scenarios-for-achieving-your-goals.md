## Exercise: Plan Out Scenarios for Achieving Your Goals

Use scenario planning to envision different outcomes related to your goals, and map out all the routes that could lead to those outcomes.

* * *

Picture one of your goals for the next five years. This could be a career goal, a fitness goal, a personal goal. It could involve anything from getting a promotion to crossing an item off your bucket list. Imagine a future where you’ve achieved that goal.

What are three steps that your future self might have taken to make that outcome happen?

Now, imagine a future where you _haven’t_ achieved that goal. What are three barriers that might have prevented you from getting where you were hoping to go?

Finally, think of one way you could overcome each of those three barriers or at least reduce the risk they pose.
