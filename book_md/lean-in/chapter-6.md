## Chapter 6: Speaking Your Truth

Honest, authentic communication in the workplace is critical for professional relationships and career growth. If you don’t have authentic communication, bad situations (such as unfit managers) don’t get better because what’s really happening never comes to light.

But being truthful at work is tricky. Adults have been conditioned to be appropriate and polite, protecting themselves. The hierarchical structure of a workplace means someone is always above you, watching and rating your performance, so people in low-power positions are less likely to speak up.

For women in particular communicating honestly can be a landmine. They don’t want to be seen as _not_ a team player. They don’t want to appear negative or critical. Plus, women carry the fear of calling attention to themselves, which hearkens back to “impostor syndrome.”

### Being Delicately Honest

The best communication is where opinions are shared freely but feelings aren’t hurt. It’s being **“delicately honest”** as opposed to “brutally honest,” understanding that you have your truth and the other person has their truth.

One tool of effective communications is **stating your opinion as opposed to stating a fact.** For example, saying, “You never take my suggestions seriously!” puts the other person on the defensive, triggering a disagreement. But saying, “I am frustrated that you haven’t responded to my last 4 emails, leading me to believe that you don’t take my suggestions seriously,” can spark useful discussion.

Using simple language is important when communicating hard truths. We hedge and add caveats when trying to explain a tough problem; often the message is lost. For example, when Mark Zuckerberg was learning Chinese he would spend time with Chinese-speaking employees. One tried to communicate a problem, but Zuckerberg couldn’t understand and kept asking her to use simpler language. She finally blurted out, “My manager is bad!” He got the message.

LIstening is as important as speaking; hearing and understanding what the other person is saying is critical to authentic communication.

### Be Prepared for Honest Feedback

As a leader, you need others to tell you when something is going wrong -- and when _you’re_ wrong. Being aware of a problem is the first step to solving it. But getting honest feedback can hurt. **To take feedback correctly, understand that it’s not an absolute truth -- it’s one person’s perception based on what was revealed to them.**

It’s critical for leaders to solicit and accept feedback _well_ , be open to hearing the truth, and take responsibility for their mistakes. Persuading people to share their honest views leads to improvement in yourself and the company.

Since no one wants to offend the boss, **leaders can encourage authentic communication by speaking openly about their weaknesses**. For example, Sandberg is impatient. She’s open about this with colleagues, giving them permission to bring it up, point it out, and joke about it, knowing they won’t offend her.

Another way to foster authentic communication is to publicly reward the honesty of others. For example, Sandberg had plans to open a foreign Facebook office; a security team member told her doing so in that particular region was a terrible idea. She publicly thanked him to encourage others to call her out when she has a bad idea.

### Emotions in the Workplace Are OK

Sometimes honesty in the workplace can give way to emotion, which has long been considered taboo. But sometimes emotions _do_ show up in the workplace, and that’s OK. For example, Sandberg erupted in tears to Mark Zuckerberg after a hearing a cruel rumor about herself. He let her speak and gave her a hug. This type of compassion leads to deeper relationships, creating better partners, managers and peers.

**Honest, authentic communication means bringing our whole selves to work, not having a professional persona and a real persona.** Sometimes professional decisions are emotionally driven, and it’s important to be honest about this. For example, when Sandberg refused a dream job in DC she didn’t make up an excuse. She was honest that her divorce made living there too painful. A year later, she was able to take advantage of the opportunity because of her original honesty.

A shift toward accepting emotions in the workplace is good news for women because it means they don’t have to try so hard to come across as stereotypically male. It’s good news for men too, because it also releases them from the stereotype. Perhaps the compassion and sensitivity that have held some women back will make them better leaders in the future.
