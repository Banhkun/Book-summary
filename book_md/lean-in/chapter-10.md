## Chapter 10: Keep the Discussion Going

True equality can be achieved only when more women are in leadership positions. To get more women in these roles, men and women alike have to understand the biases and stereotypes that have been perpetuating the status quo.

It’s time for everyone to cheer on girls who want to sit at the table and lean in to their careers. Men, too, need to be supported and respected for contributing within the home and supporting their partners.

### Women Supporting Women

For gender equality to prevail, women have to stop sabotaging other women. When women turn on other women, we all lose. Women need to support and stick up for women in order for true equality to prosper.

For example, when Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo and announced she’d be taking just a few weeks maternity leave, which she would work through, she was roundly criticized by women for setting unreasonable expectations. Her individual choice was not respected.

The “Queen Bee” phenomenon still exists. **Women in power often discourage other women from gaining power, as if there’s only so much to go around.** This attitude was born of self-preservation in a male-dominated workforce in the past, but still lingers. Data shows that once a woman achieves success, her capacity to see gender discrimination is actually reduced. Worse, when women view other women negatively, that viewpoint is respected because a lack of bias is assumed.

**The “mommy wars,” which pit stay-at-home moms against working moms, are hurting all women.** Each group judges the other because they have mixed feelings about their choices and hold that discomfort against women who remind them of the path not taken. Guilt and insecurity make us second-guess ourselves and resent each other, and this has to end.

### Opportunities for Everyone

There’s evidence that attitudes among women and men are changing. A survey found that high-level women are starting to “pay it forward” by supporting the careers of junior women.

When women help one another, we help ourselves. Acting as a coalition makes everyone stronger.

This coalition has to include men. Men need to take an active role in encouraging talented women in the workforce and advocate for their career advancement. Men also need to commit to changing the leadership ratios in organizations.

We are working toward a world where the old social norms don’t exist and both women and men have more choices based on their passions, talents and interests, not their gender.

Workplace change is our more immediate problem. There’s a lack of sick leave and vacation pay for working mothers. Maternity leave pay is not standard. Work standards are inflexible and unfair, penalizing working moms and dads. Families can go into debt or poverty as a consequence of these policies. These policies have to change.

Sandberg wrote _Lean In_ to encourage women to dream big, power through obstacles, and reach their full potential. When more women lean in, we change the power structure of our world and expand opportunities for all. Having more women in power will lead to fairer treatment for all women.

In the future there won’t be female leaders and male leaders, there will simply be leaders.
