## Chapter 4: Take Risks With Your Career

Now that women are aware it’s ok to be ambitious, how should they plan for their career trajectory?

Times have changed since Sandberg’s grandmother worked. The “ladder to success,” where people join a company and spend years moving up to higher positions, isn’t today’s reality, where people have an average of 11 jobs from age 18-46.

Jungle gyms are a much better metaphor for a successful career, symbolizing creative exploration, more risks, and many ways to get to the top.

### Long-Term Dreams and Short-Term Plans

While a career path doesn’t need to be mapped out, setting two types of plans is key:

  1. **Long-term dream**. This doesn’t need to be specific or even realistic. It could reflect a desire, for example you want to travel, have free time, or to win a prize. Even a vague goal provides direction. Sandberg’s advice: **Don’t think about what you want to be; think about what you want to do**. (Her long-term goal was to change the world.)
  2. **18-month plan** : Set goals on 2 fronts:
     * Targets for what your team can accomplish professionally. Employees who focus on results become valuable to the company -- this is communal thinking as well as good business. 
     * Learn new personal skills as they relate to your career. Everyone has room to improve. For example, if you talk too much or too little, you can seek help to correct the tendency. If you’re missing a skill, go learn it.



### Seek Out Growth and Take More Risks

In any field, there are jobs and companies with more potential for growth than others. Women in particular must take more career risks because diverse experiences prepare you for leadership. **Stability too often comes at the price of growth opportunities.**

For Sandberg, the opportunity to join Google seemed ideal -- its mission “to provide the world access to info” appealed to her long-term goal of changing the world. But Google was a wildcard -- a new company without clear direction; other more traditional companies had offered her more clearly defined opportunities.

Eric Schmidt told her “not to be an idiot.” He said potential for growth should be the only criteria for job selection. “If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don’t ask what seat. You just get on.”

Sometimes women miss out on a great opportunity because they’re too focused on the level or title, fearing a career setback. But **if the move means learning new skills, you’re actually moving forward**. When Sandberg eventually left Google to become Facebook’s COO, she passed up offers from other companies willing to hire her as CEO. She took a lower position because she prioritized potential for growth and the company mission over levels and titles.

### Women Are Risk-Averse

It’s often hard for women to take the necessary risks for professional growth. They are more likely to accommodate a partner’s career, and relocating may not be an option when relationships and families are the priority.

Being risk-averse also means women are reluctant to take on challenging tasks in their current job. While men look for “stretch” assignments, women tend to hang back doing what they do best, worrying if they have the skills for a new role. Since skills are acquired on the job, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. **Data shows that women apply for a job only if they meet 100 percent of the criteria. Men are comfortable applying for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the criteria** ; they figure they’ll learn the rest on the job.

Women are also risk-averse when it comes to applying for a promotion. **They believe a good job performance will naturally lead to advancement; they shouldn’t have to advocate for themselves.** This is termed the “Tiara Syndrome”: women think if they do a good job, someone will notice and place a symbolic tiara on their head, rewarding them with respect.

In a perfect world performance would be automatically rewarded. **But in our world, advocating for yourself is necessary.** Women have to take great care when advocating for themselves so they don’t hurt their likeability, as discussed previously, but it has to be done.
