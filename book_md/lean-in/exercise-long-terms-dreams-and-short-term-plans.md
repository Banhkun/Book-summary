## Exercise: Long-Terms Dreams and Short-Term Plans

Become a stronger leadership candidate.

* * *

Sandberg advises women to figure out their long-term dream to provide direction for their goals. Her long-term dream was simply “making the world better.” What is your long-term dream?

An 18-month goal can help you develop skills in an area where you’re lacking. Sandberg worked on not blurting out her opinions. What is a skill you need to work on in the workplace? What can you do to correct an unhelpful tendency and build a better habit?

What is an opportunity you’re excited about but are worried you’re not fully qualified for? Why not go for it? What’s the worst that could happen?
