## Part 1: Problems With Traditional Negotiation

The authors identify **three criteria for successful negotiation** that apply to any method:

  * The resulting agreement must be wise, meaning that it meets the interests of each side, and it’s fair and lasting.
  * The process must be efficient, producing results without wasting time.
  * The process must strengthen the relationship between the parties — or at least not damage it.



Positional bargaining falls short on all three counts.

### Bargaining from Positions

**In positional bargaining, each side starts with a position, argues and defends it, and bargains** to reach a compromise. A classic example is when you haggle with a seller over the price of something.

Positional bargaining involves each side offering a series of positions and concessions, which takes considerable time. Each can clearly see what the other wants and the process usually leads to an agreement that both sides accept. But the agreement it produces doesn’t meet the three criteria (wise, efficient, and friendly).

Specifically, arguing over positions is problematic because:

**1) Positional bargaining produces bad outcomes** : Negotiators become rigid in their positions. The harder you try to convince the other side of the rightness of your position, and the more you defend it against attack, the more strongly committed to it you become. You feel compelled to maintain consistency with your past positions and to save face by not giving in.

For example, the 1961 U.S.-Soviet negotiations over a proposed nuclear test ban failed because of rigid positions on each side. Talks were bogged down over how many on-site inspections would be done annually — the Soviets wanted three and the U.S. ten. They got stuck there without having even defined the inspection procedure (for instance, how many inspectors could be sent into the other’s territory and for how long). An agreement on the inspection process might have addressed both sides’ desire for minimal intrusion and the U.S. interest in verification, while avoiding the arms race that ensued.

The greater the emphasis on positions, the less attention is paid to what each side really wants (the interests underlying their positions) and the less likely they are to reach a good agreement. Instead, the agreement will reflect a splitting of differences rather than addressing the valid interests of the parties. Both sides may end up dissatisfied and will have missed the opportunity for a good agreement.

**2) Positional bargaining is inefficient** : The give-and-take of standard negotiations, even when the parties aren’t hostile, is time-consuming. The process has built-in features that slow things down, such as starting with an unreasonable position and making incremental concessions. These common tactics work against a prompt settlement. Negotiation requires multiple individual decisions on offers, rejections, and concessions, each of which is an opportunity to stall. On top of that, negotiators can use deliberate delaying tactics and tricks such as threatening to walk out.

**3) Positional bargaining undermines the ongoing relationship between the parties** : When negotiations become a struggle of wills with each side trying to force its position on the other, anger and resentment build. The bad feelings can linger, hindering implementation and the ability of the two sides to work together in the future.

**It works especially poorly for multilateral negotiations** : When you have multiple sides in a negotiation, the inefficiency of the positional bargaining method is magnified.

For example, in United Nations talks where as many as 150 countries may be negotiating, all of them have to say “yes” for talks to proceed, but just one can stop the process by saying “no.” It’s hard to come up with a common position and even harder to change a position. Coalitions (East-West, North-South) tend to form around symbolic rather than substantive interests. Also, the various sides have to keep checking with higher authorities.

Sometimes negotiators try to mitigate the confrontational aspect of standard bargaining by being “nice,” that is, making overly lenient offers and concessions that don’t serve their interests in order to avoid conflict. They achieve an agreement, but not necessarily a good one. Being nice — prioritizing the relationship — is the approach most often used by family or friends. It’s especially risky if the other side plays hardball, in which case the nonaggressive bargainer is likely to lose his shirt.

### The Alternative to Positional Negotiation

You don’t have to choose either aggressive or soft bargaining along with their attendant problems. In contrast to the traditional adversarial approach, **principled negotiation (which can also be called negotiating on the merits) is designed to generate fair agreements efficiently and civilly.**

It can be used in almost any circumstances and it’s straightforward: the two sides work toward agreed-upon mutual interests rather than having hidden agendas. In short, it’s a different game.

There are four components (more details follow below, and each element will be addressed in an individual chapter):

  1. **People** : Separate personalities and emotions from the issue being negotiated.
  2. **Interests** : Focus on the interests of each side — the reasons underlying their positions — rather than on positions.
  3. **Options** : Come up with multiple options based on mutual interests.
  4. **Criteria** : Base the agreement on an objective (fair and independent) standard.



#### Separate Emotions from Issues

People get emotional, they have trouble communicating clearly, and their perceptions vary. How they feel gets mixed with what they think about the merits (facts) of an issue. They hold stubbornly to positions due to ego. When the other side makes concessions, it can reward this behavior.

Before negotiators can make headway on addressing the issues, they need to address people’s mindset and behavior. Both sides must see themselves as working together alongside each other, attacking a problem rather than each other.

#### Talk about Interests Instead of Positions

**You can overcome the flaws of positional bargaining when you focus on the underlying interests (what you both really want) that led to taking the positions**. Because the negotiating positions that are taken often obscure these interests, compromising doesn’t generate an agreement that addresses the reasons people take the positions that they do.

#### Generate Options Serving Mutual Interests

When negotiating under pressure, it’s hard to come up with great solutions serving both sides. It’s better for each side to set up a separate time to brainstorm creative solutions that address each side’s interests while accommodating differences. Another approach is for both sides to brainstorm together.

#### Use Objective Criteria

You can avoid arbitrary agreements by demanding that the results meet objective standards independent of either side — for instance, market values, legal standards, average salaries, expert opinions or data, or customary practices. Instead of arguing about what either side is willing to accept, agree to objective standards that will serve as the rationale for the specifics in the agreement. That way, neither party is imposing their say-so for what’s fair on the other.

### Stages of Principled Negotiation

Principled negotiation has three broad stages, and you deal with the four elements (people, interests, options, criteria) in each stage: analysis, planning, and discussion.

  * **Analysis** : In this stage, assess the situation. Gather, organize, and weigh information. Anticipate personality or emotional issues that might influence the process — for instance, feelings, biases, and communication styles or problems (the people element). Identify and list your interests and what you think the other side’s interests are (the interests element). Identify any options already on the table and any standards already suggested as a rationale.
  * **Planning** : In this stage, go through the four elements again. Decide what you’ll do about each people problem, what interests are your top priorities, and what your objectives are, as well as several options and potential criteria.
  * **Discussion** : In this stage, look toward agreement. Communicate with each other about potential human issues (for instance frustrations and perceptions on each side), identify common and differing interests, generate some mutually beneficial options, and agree on objective standards.



To sum up, in contrast to adversarial bargaining, practicing principled negotiation allows you to treat people with empathy, work toward a wise agreement that’s fair for both parties, negotiate efficiently without deliberate delays, and end the process on a positive note that bodes well for your future relationship.
