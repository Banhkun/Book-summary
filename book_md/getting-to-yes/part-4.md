## Part 4: Challenges in Negotiations

Two types of challenges that can stymie principled negotiation are:

  * Dealing with the human element when you can’t separate people and their emotions from the substance because people _are_ the problem.
  * Negotiating successfully when there’s a power imbalance — when the other side is more powerful than you are.



### Handling Human Problems

**People’s defensive or reactionary behavior is often a reason that negotiations fail**. Dealing with the human element of how you’re treating the other side and how the people are reacting is critical to success. Whether you’re focusing on a specific human issue, or people are just one concern of negotiation, follow these guidelines:

  * **Build a good working relationship** that’s separate from the substance of the negotiations. A good relationship makes it easier to get a good outcome and good outcomes make a good relationship even better. But don’t entangle the relationship with substance. For instance, don’t make concessions in order to save the relationship and don’t try to force a concession by threatening the relationship, for instance by saying something like, “If you really cared, you’d accept the proposal.” 
  * **Negotiate relationship issues**. If human problems stymie negotiations, negotiate the human issues on their merits (facts and evidence). Without judging, state your concerns, perceptions, and feelings about the other’s behavior and ask for theirs. Propose fair standards for how you should deal with each other. 
  * **Don’t treat them the way they treat you** , or you’ll encourage further negative behavior. Demonstrate by example the kind of behavior you prefer.
  * **Respond rationally**. If others are behaving irrationally, continue trying to be rational yourself. Question your assumptions about their behavior. They may see the situation differently. Try to learn and understand their reasoning and you may be able to help them change it.



Human problems in negotiation can crop up around issues of personality, gender, or culture. While people share certain basic needs, such as being loved and respected, we differ on many other levels. Here are some guidelines for recognizing and adjusting to differences.

  * **Get in sync**. Be aware of and adapt to the perceptions, values, customs or norms, and feelings of the people you’re dealing with. To influence them in negotiations you need to understand where they’re coming from. Differing preferences and styles may include: whether the atmosphere is relaxed or formal, how close to each other people sit, whether the conversation is direct or indirect, whether the relationship extends beyond business, and who serves as spokesperson for each side.
  * **Adapt this book’s general advice to your specific situation**. Use the approach but adapt the principles to the context. For instance, consider where you are (environment, community, or country) and local or industry customs. 
  * **Be aware of differing beliefs and customs, but don’t stereotype**. Individuals’ attitudes and characteristics may differ from those of their group (for instance, not all Japanese prefer indirect communication). This applies to genders as well. It’s insulting to make assumptions based on the group to which someone belongs.
  * **Question your assumptions**. Be open to learning that others are different from what you expected. Everyone has special interests and qualities that don’t fit any mold.



### Extreme Negotiating

For most of us, negotiations involve typical things like jobs, real estate, divorces and other civil matters, or labor contracts. Principled negotiation works well in these circumstances, as well as in higher-level matters between countries. But **what happens when the other side is decidedly _unprincipled_ , for instance a Hitler or group of terrorists**? Principled negotiation can still work, but involves somewhat different considerations.

However nasty the other side, unless you have a better alternative than negotiating, it makes sense to negotiate. The key question is how.

#### Negotiating With Terrorists

In the case of terrorists, even if you’re not talking to them, you’re negotiating with them — by words and actions, even from a distance, you’re trying to influence their decisions and they’re trying to influence yours. The question is whether to negotiate indirectly from a distance or more directly. You’ll have greater influence if your communication is strong.

Negotiation doesn’t mean giving in. It may allow you to convince the other side they won’t get a ransom. You also may learn of some legitimate interest they have that you can use in a deal where neither side gives in. For example, in the resolution of the Iran hostage crisis in 1981, the interests of both sides were served and neither side gave more than the other side was entitled to: Iran released the hostages and paid its debts, and upon payment, the U.S. returned the funds it had seized.

Countries often refuse to negotiate with terrorists on the theory that it rewards them with attention and status. However, you can avoid giving terrorists public attention by taking a lower-profile approach using low-level officials or professionals as negotiators. Also, professionals can be highly successful. Police negotiators often succeed in getting hostages released and taking criminals into custody.

#### Negotiating With a Hitler

Whether to negotiate with someone like Hitler depends on the alternative. Sometimes war — fighting and dying — is better or more honorable than negotiation. On the other hand, war has huge costs and offers no guarantee of good results. If you can substantially meet your interests through negotiation, it deserves consideration.

From a Western point of view, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin was as bad as Hitler, employing aggression, genocide, and a similar ideology. But war, with the availability of the hydrogen bomb, wasn’t a viable option for getting rid of him or his ideology. Nor were there principles involved that justified war. Instead, the West opposed Soviet communism by applying other kinds of pressure and it eventually collapsed on its own.

Even with a Hitler or Stalin, negotiating may have the potential to produce results that serve our interests better than the alternative of war.

When the other side is acting out of religious conviction, they still may be influenceable through negotiation. While they’re not going to change their religious ideology, they may have interests that can be served by an agreement that doesn’t compromise either side’s principles.

Governments often mistakenly overvalue their alternatives to negotiation. They may imply that if other means fail, they always have a military option. But sometimes, military options aren’t viable. For instance, raids to rescue hostages have a high risk of failure. The question is what decision you want the other side to make, and how military force could influence them to make it.

### Dealing with a Power Imbalance

Sometimes there’s a significant power imbalance between your side and the other side in a negotiation. They may be richer, have more physical and human resources, have connections with people in power, or have power (social, political, or economic) themselves. But even though it seems like they have all the leverage, you still have options. The biggest risk you face is being too quick to agree in order to end the process.

When facing a power imbalance, you should strive to meet two objectives:

  1. Avoid making an agreement you should reject.
  2. Make the most of the assets you have, so the agreement will satisfy your interests as well as possible.



#### 1) Protecting Yourself

To avoid being too accommodating, **negotiators often determine a bottom line, or worst acceptable outcome, in advance**.

  * If you’re a buyer, it’s the highest price you would pay.
  * If you’re a seller, it’s the lowest price you’d accept.



For instance, a couple asking for $300,000 for their house might agree to accept no less than $250,000. With a bottom line, you can more easily resist pressure. It also limits the authority of someone acting on your behalf, such as a broker or lawyer.

There are downsides, however. Because your bottom line can’t be changed, you can’t benefit from information you get during negotiation. Bottom lines tend to be too high or too low. Having a bottom line inhibits coming up with a creative option that’s better. And it focuses on only one measure of success, although there are likely multiple measures that should be considered.

So while having a bottom line can protect you from a bad agreement, it can also stand in the way of a better agreement. **There’s an alternative to a bottom line, however — knowing your BATNA, or best alternative to a negotiated agreement.**

#### How a BATNA Works

Typically when you’re deciding your minimum price for selling a house, you’re thinking of what you should be able to get. However, a more important question is what you’ll do if you’re not able to sell it by your deadline. The answer is your **BATNA — the most attractive alternative to negotiation if negotiation falls apart**.

You may have an alternative that’s better than selling it for $250,000 — for instance, if the market is trending upward, you may get a better price by waiting and selling it later. On the other hand, selling it for $240,000 may be better than paying the costs of holding onto it indefinitely.

The purpose of negotiating is to get better results than you’d get without negotiating. So when negotiating to sell your house, you need to know your best alternative to negotiation in order to know whether to accept an agreement.

**Any proposed agreement should be measured against your best alternative or BATNA**. It will protect you from accepting a bad agreement, as well as from rejecting a good agreement. Unlike a bottom line, it’s flexible enough to allow you to explore additional options. Instead of rejecting a proposal that doesn’t meet the bottom line, you can compare it with your BATNA to see if it better satisfies your interests.

If you haven’t thought seriously about what you’ll do if you don’t reach an agreement, you’re negotiating blindly. For instance, you may reject an agreement because, in the abstract, you think you have many other choices without fully appreciating their downsides. However, the greater danger is that you’ll be overly committed to reaching an agreement because you’re afraid of what might happen if you don’t.

Another test you can use in addition to a BATNA is a trip wire — a less-than-perfect agreement that’s still better than your BATNA. Before accepting anything worse than your trip wire agreement, you should step back from negotiation and reexamine the situation. You should have wiggle room between your trip wire and BATNA.

#### 2) Making the Most of Your Assets

Besides protecting you from accepting a bad agreement, your BATNA will help you make the most of your assets to reach a good agreement. The stronger your BATNA, the greater your power.

While wealth and connections enhance negotiating power, the power of each side also depends on the strength of their alternative. If you have a stronger alternative — for instance, the ability to get a better price elsewhere — you can walk away from an agreement, which gives you leverage.

Here’s an example of how a small town with a strong BATNA overcame a power imbalance in negotiation with a large company. The town was negotiating with a corporation that had a factory outside the town limits to increase its goodwill payment to the town from $300,000 to $3.2 million. The town’s BATNA was that if it couldn’t reach an agreement with the company for more money, it would expand the town limits to include the factory and tax it for even more than it was requesting as a goodwill payment. Because of its stronger BATNA, the town had the greater leverage in negotiations.

#### How to Develop a BATNA

Generating a solid BATNA involves:

  * **Developing a list of actions you might take** if an agreement isn’t reached. Consider things you might do if, for instance, you don’t get a satisfactory job offer.
  * **Improving some of the better options** , and converting them into viable alternatives. For example, if one of your alternatives to an adequate job offer in your current city is moving to Chicago, try to make that more viable by exploring jobs there.
  * **Selecting your most realistic alternative to a negotiated agreement**.



Measure every offer against your BATNA. If it’s strong, you can negotiate more confidently.

It may or may not make sense to disclose your BATNA in negotiations. For example, it could be to your advantage to do so if you have another customer waiting in the next room, or if the other side thinks you don’t have a good alternative to accepting an agreement. But don’t disclose your BATNA if it’s worse than other side thinks.

It’s also to your benefit to think about the other side’s alternatives or BATNA. The more you know about their options, the better you can prepare for negotiation and the more accurate you can be about what to expect.

If they seem to be overestimating it, you may want to help them rethink their expectations. If their BATNA is actually better than negotiating on the merits, consider what you can do to change it. If both sides have strong BATNAs, the best outcome may not be agreement.

#### Enhance Your Power

When the other side is more powerful, many factors, especially specific negotiation skills, can strengthen your hand. For example:

  * Taking an optimistic approach: Even when something isn’t a sure bet, it’s often worth striving for. The higher you aim, the more you may get.
  * Recognizing multiple sources of power: For instance, power comes from having a better alternative, and from each of the four elements of the principled negotiation method (people, interests, options, criteria).
  * A good working relationship, which smooths negotiation and increases trust.
  * Effective communication: Helping the other side understand your thinking and clarify their views can clear up misperceptions and facilitate problem-solving.
  * Good listening increases your information and ability to influence the other side.
  * Knowledge of the negotiation process and ability to redirect it, for instance, to change the focus from positions to interests, options, and standards.
  * Ability to identify and understand the other side’s interests.
  * Creativity in crafting options, especially making interests dovetail.
  * A strong BATNA.
  * Identifying external criteria that lend legitimacy to an agreement.
  * Making an offer that commits to what you will do, won’t do, and want the other side to do. The more concrete an offer is, the more credible it is.



You’ll make the most of your potential power if you combine all of the elements and skills of principled negotiation so they reinforce each other. For instance, don’t depend on one skill, such as developing a BATNA, alone. They’re designed to work together.
