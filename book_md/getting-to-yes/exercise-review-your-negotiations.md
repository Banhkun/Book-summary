## Exercise: Review Your Negotiations

Weâ€™re always negotiating in our personal and work lives. In the traditional method of adversarial bargaining, each side starts with a position, argues and defends it, and haggles to reach a compromise.

* * *

Think of a situation where you negotiated with someone over something, for instance a used car, a job offer, or how to divide the housework. What did you want? What did the other person want? How did it turn out?

Did you both get what you wanted or could the outcome have been better for one or both of you? How?

How did the negotiation affect your relationship in the short and long terms?
