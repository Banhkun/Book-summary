## Part 3: Practical Application

(Shortform note: In the final two parts of the book, the authors answer questions about principled negotiation. Because some answers introduce new material or are repetitive, we’ve reorganized the information into sections on Practical Application (Procedures, Tactics), and Challenges to make it easier to grasp.)

### Procedures

Informal negotiations with family and friends about such things as where to eat or spend a vacation tend to be impromptu. However, formal negotiations between companies and employees, or involving governments, and other entities require planning. Here are some logistics and procedural considerations.

#### Deciding Where to Meet

Deciding where to meet for negotiations will depend on both needs and circumstances. Think about where the parties would be most comfortable and productive.

  * Seclusion may be important if there’s a significant chance of interruptions and distractions. 
  * If the other side’s chief negotiator relies heavily on support staff and documentation, you may want to meet in his or her offices. Meeting in the other side’s offices also gives you the option of walking away if necessary. 
  * If there are equipment needs such as a whiteboard or computer projection screen, you’ll need a facility that accommodates them.



#### Deciding How to Communicate

Challenging conversations, especially those involving emotions or relationship issues, typically are best handled face to face. Electronic communication, which has become integral in our personal and work lives, can be useful as an adjunct in negotiations. But it has potential drawbacks as well as positives such as convenience. Carefully consider the pluses and minuses of various methods, including phone, email, text messages, and video chat applications.

Among the potential advantages:

  * Many people are more comfortable asking tough questions on the phone than face-to-face.
  * People pay closer attention to content when they don’t have visual or audio cues, such as tone of voice or facial expressions. Objections may have more impact when delivered in writing via email.
  * Email allows time for reflection and research before answering.
  * Emails and texts before the start of negotiations can create a personal connection before getting into substance. The connection may help promote cooperation and increase the chance of agreement. 



However, beware of the potential drawbacks of non face-to-face communication:

  * Results can vary depending on the method of communication. One study showed written interactions can lead to impasses.
  * There’s a greater potential for misunderstanding or lying.
  * Lack of visual cues can make messages more difficult to interpret and decrease our empathy.



To prevent problems with non face-to-face communication:

  * Try to have an initial meeting in person or by phone, as well as periodic check-ins in-person or by phone.
  * Reread your messages several times before sending them; make the context and your reasoning extra-apparent, look for ambiguities, and ask yourself how it could be read differently from what you mean.
  * If you can’t have a difficult conversation face to face, try to do it by phone or video chat.



#### Deciding Protocol and Strategy

There are numerous considerations involving protocol and strategy. People often ask, Who should make the first offer, and how high should it be?

**Wait to give the first offer** : Making an offer too soon can make the other side feel rushed or pressured. It’s better to start by examining interests, options, and standards first. Once both sides have a handle on the problem, an offer that accommodates all interests will come across as constructive. In any case, in the early stages, you could try to introduce an objective or standard favorable to you. Ultimately, if both sides are well prepared for negotiation, it doesn’t make much difference who makes the first offer.

**Deciding how high to start** : In cases involving a buyer and seller, people are used to judging success by how far the other person retreats from their original position. The buyer’s goal is paying less than the original asking price. In traditional bargaining, if you’re selling, you start with the highest number you can ask for without looking unreasonable. In a principled negotiation, however, start with the highest figure that a neutral person would see as fair. And before making the offer, explain your rationale. You don’t want to be too firm initially because if you move later you may lose credibility. Alternatively, you could point out what people are paying for comparable items, thereby suggesting a standard without committing to that number.

#### Preparation First

Thinking about the first offer at the outset gets the cart before the horse. Preparation is the initial step. Your strategy will grow naturally from your preparation. Since you won’t know what the other side’s strategy is going to be, it’s best to focus on preparation initially and decide your direction later.

Here’s how to prepare and move through the negotiation process (rather than simply starting off by considering how high an offer to make):

  * **Think about the end:** Before starting to negotiate, think about what a good agreement would look like. To get there, what issues would have to be resolved? What kind of agreement could both sides justify to their constituents? Envisioning the end result will help you stay on track.
  * **Draft a framework agreement.** Outline a potential agreement with spaces for each item to be resolved. It can serve as an agenda, help keep discussions focused, and ensure important issues are addressed.
  * **Don’t rush toward commitment.** As you work through each issue, including options and standards, aim for a proposal that reflects all points made and meets each side’s interests on that issue. If you can’t get consensus on an issue, attempt to narrow the options and move on. Commitments should be deemed tentative at this point to encourage brainstorming. Expect to go through the issues several times, while making gradual forward progress.
  * **Pursue your interests persistently** , but don’t lock into a specific solution (which would be positional). Explain your interests and reasoning, and have the other side explain theirs. Clarify points of agreement and disagreement. Resolve conflicting interests with independent standards.
  * **Make an offer.** After you’ve explored one or more issues, make an offer. It should grow from the discussions so far rather than being a surprise, and should address the interests of both sides. If there are still outstanding issues, agree on fair procedures for resolving them (for instance, splitting the difference). 
  * **Make a final gesture.** When agreement is near, consider giving the other side something they want that’s within the logic of the agreement. This may relieve last-minute doubts and seal the deal. If the other side leaves negotiations on a positive note, it will improve implementation and enhance the relationship.



#### Building Your Negotiation Skills

To begin practicing principled negotiation:

  * **Start small** : Start with negotiations on smaller issues, where the other side is open to a principled approach. Start with techniques that build on your current skills and gradually incorporate new techniques.
  * **Make a commitment:** In order to get better, you need to commit yourself to learning new techniques. 
  * **Review your performance** : After each negotiation, assess what worked and what didn’t.
  * **Prepare** for negotiations by doing your homework. Build a good relationship with the other side. List your interests and theirs. Gather facts and consider possible options and standards. Draft a framework agreement.
  * **Practice** : Consider practicing the techniques by role-playing. Get advice and feedback from experienced negotiators.



### Tactics

Sometimes, despite your best efforts to practice principled negotiation, the other side insists on the traditional adversarial method of bargaining from position. There are three ways you can try to shift their focus to merits (facts and evidence):

  1. Focus on merits yourself instead of positions. Talking about interests, options, and standards may be contagious — the other side may play along if you just start playing a different game.
  2. Respond to each of their positional moves in a way that shifts the focus to merits. This mimics jujitsu, the Japanese martial arts method of countering an opponent by using his strength and weight against him.
  3. Bring in a trained third party to focus the discussion on merits (using the one-text mediation procedure explained below).



#### Shift the Focus to Merits

When the other side takes a firm position, it’s tempting to criticize and reject it. When they attack your proposal, you’ll want to forcefully defend it. But if you get into a mode of pushing back and forth, you’ll waste time and won’t get anywhere.

Instead, when they push, don’t push back. Don’t reject their position, defend yours, or counterattack. Refuse to act and you’ll interrupt the dynamic. Play conversational jujitsu by avoiding a direct response and channeling their energy toward the interests, options, and criteria.

Launching an offensive in positional bargaining often has three aspects: aggressively arguing their position, attacking your proposals, and attacking you personally. Here’s how to respond indirectly:

  * **Determine what’s behind their position instead of pushing back.** Ask yourself: What are their interests? What principles does their position reflect? For instance, what’s the basis for the pay increase they’re asking for and how is it fair? How can you improve on the position? Ask them why they’re taking the position: What concern are they trying to address and how does their position address it? Treat their position as one option and analyze how it meets each side’s interests.
  * **Ask for criticism of your ideas.** Ask them what’s wrong with your idea and what’s missing (what does it fail to account for?). This gives you a chance to learn their interests and make your proposal more acceptable to them. You can also turn criticism around by asking what they would do in your situation — they end up addressing your problem and may come up with an option that accommodates your interests. 
  * **Turn a personal attack into an attack on the problem.** First, let them vent without responding; just listen. Demonstrate that you get what they’re saying. Then reframe their ad hominem attack as an attack on the problem. For instance, if they accuse you of not caring about children, respond: “I’m as concerned as you are about providing our kids with a good education. How can we work together to make sure we’re doing that?”
  * **Use questions and silence.** Instead of making statements or declarations, which prompt resistance, ask questions that give the other side an opportunity to offer and explain their points. After you ask a question, wait silently for a response. If their response is inadequate or unreasonable, wait some more. SIlence makes people feel pressured to respond, often constructively.



#### Try the ‘One-Text’ Approach

When you’re deadlocked and unable to shift negotiations from positional to principled, it may be time to bring in a mediator. Mediators often use an approach called the ‘one-text’ process to come up with a fair agreement acceptable to both sides. Here’s how it works:

  * The mediator starts by making a list of both sides’ interests and needs. 
  * She asks each side to critique and improve on the list.
  * She draws up a rough plan and asks for a critique.
  * She comes back with a revised plan and asks for a critique.
  * She continues doing this until she feels she can’t further improve the plan.
  * When the mediator feels she can’t improve it further, she presents it as her final recommendation.
  * The two sides then vote yes or no.



The ‘one-text’ approach breaks impasses by bypassing positional bargaining.

It also speeds up and simplifies the negotiation process by narrowing the options to one. You can use the method without a mediator: Just prepare a draft and ask the other side to critique it. It works well in two-party negotiations, and is even more useful in multilateral talks as a way of streamlining a complex process.

The one-text approach was the basis for the Camp David agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1978. In the role of mediator, the U.S. prepared a draft, asked for critiques, and continued to improve it. After 23 revised drafts, President Jimmy Carter presented a recommendation and both sides accepted it.

### How to Handle Dirty Tricks

There’s an array of strong-arm tactics that hard bargainers may use in an effort to get you to succumb to their position, including lies, pressure tactics, and psychological tricks. They’re designed to be used by only one side, without the other side knowing they’re being manipulated.

The targets of these tactics typically:

  * Give in, in hopes the other side won’t ask for more, which usually doesn’t work. For example, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain tried to appease Hitler in 1938. But each time he thought they had an agreement, Hitler escalated his demands. 
  * Respond in kind with their own threats, outrageous proposals, and deceptive tactics. This ends in an impasse unless one party gives in.



The only effective way to counter these tactics is to use the techniques of principled negotiation to establish how you’re going to negotiate (the rules of the game). Let’s look at some strategies.

#### Call Out the Tactic

Follow these steps: recognize the tactic, call attention to it, and question its validity as a tactic. Use the tactic as the basis for discussing how to negotiate constructively.

Often just calling attention to the tactic will blunt its effectiveness and cause the other side to worry that they overplayed their hand and alienated you. As a result, they may drop it. But the important thing is that you can now negotiate the process. Setting aside substance temporarily, shift your aim to getting a fair agreement on procedure.

The method remains the same:

  * Separate emotions from the issue: Question the tactic, not someone’s integrity.
  * Talk about interests instead of positions: Look for the “whys” behind the position.
  * Generate options serving mutual interests: Suggest alternatives to unfair tactics.
  * Agree on objective standards: Apply the principle of reciprocity for all tactics. For instance, if you’ve purposely been given an uncomfortable chair, suggest that someone else use it next time.



#### Common Underhanded Tactics

Underhanded tactics fall into three categories: deception, psychological abuse, and pressure for concessions. Let’s look at specific ways to deal with each.

**Deception involves misrepresenting facts, authority or intentions.** Examples include:

  * **Phony facts** : The negotiator makes false assertions. In response, request verification or check the facts yourself.
  * **Deferring to a higher authority** : They may announce they have to take the decision to a higher authority in order to get another shot at making changes. Insist that both sides have the same opportunity to propose changes.
  * **Misrepresenting intentions** : If you have reason to believe they don’t really intend to comply, build consequences into the agreement.



**Psychological abuse is aimed at making you uncomfortable so you want to end as soon as possible**. Examples include: creating stressful situations, personal attacks, threats, and a good cop/bad cop routine. In response, you can ignore these tactics or call them out. In the case of threats, you could point out potential consequences, or call them out and ask for agreement to use more constructive behavior.

**Positional pressure tactics are intended to force you into making concessions**. Examples include:

  * **Refusing to negotiate** : Ask what’s behind their refusal to talk. Suggest bringing in a third party or using another method of communication.
  * **Making extreme demands** : Call them on it. Ask them to justify it.
  * **Escalating demands** : For every concession they offer, the other side may increase their demands or reopen issues. Call it out and take a break to consider whether you want to keep negotiating.
  * **Locking-in a position** : The other side locks in their position to make concession impossible. For instance, a union president makes a speech vowing to deliver a 15% pay increase. She can’t back down in negotiations without losing her credibility. You can call the other side’s bluff or downplay the position so they can back down without fanfare.
  * **Blaming a partner** : A negotiator may blame her intransigence on a partner or authority. Get an agreement in principle, then try to speak to the partner.
  * **Stalling to gain an advantage** : The other side may try to delay a decision until a more favorable time, for instance until a union’s strike fund will run out. Call out the tactic and negotiate it or establish credible deadlines based on relevant events, such as a board meeting.
  * **Take it or leave it** : You may want to ignore the ultimatum. Alternatively, point out what they have to lose and find a way for them to back down without losing face.
