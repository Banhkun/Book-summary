## Enabling Conditions of Enrons Deception

How was Enron able to get away with its bad behavior for so long, even when its operations involved thousands of people with partial insight into the problems? Here we take a look at the major conditions that promoted Enron’s deception. These are themes that might recur in future disasters.

(Shortform note: while the original book mostly tells a chronological story, we pulled the themes and patterns from the book to form this chapter.)

### People with Incentives to Tolerate Bad Behavior

People who could have stepped in and intervened didn’t, often because **they had a large personal stake in Enron’s success**. Further, the more Enron became a success (like in terms of stock price or deal flow), the more beholden the stakeholders were to Enron.

Furthermore, everyone looked to each other for validation. “Surely all these other people can’t be wrong!” Yet no one realized no one else had done their due diligence.

In a culture where earnings are prized above all, earners have the leverage to conduct bad behavior, unpunished. Threaten to quit and you get what you want. This culture promotes caring about self rather than the longevity of the company.

  * In the 1980s, an Enron oil trader ignored trading limits and siphoned money to himself. This was overlooked by management since his department was a golden goose. Letter from Enron management to trader: “I have complete confidence...please keep making us millions.” (He eventually had a disastrous short position that could have bankrupted the company.)



Breaking down each of the stakeholders:

**Employees**

  * Employees who had an inkling something was wrong were willing to look the other way for big compensation and a rising stock price. Why would you want the music to stop when you’re planning on buying a vacation home?
  * The market seemed to justify what the business was doing - surely professional investors with billions at stake couldn’t be wrong?
  * Furthermore, skeptics within the company were publicly punished by being reassigned. For many, the risk of being punished wasn’t worth the gain from exposing wrongdoing.



**Public markets**

  * In a period of dotcom bullishness, the possibilities were uncapped. All sorts of companies with illusory projections were propped up.
  * Investors tolerated Enron’s opacity, since the stock was up and to the right.
  * Investors circulated a mythos of Enron being an untouchable, invincible company.



**Consultants/accountants**

  * Arthur Andersen’s consulting had Enron as one of their biggest customers (paying $52MM in 2000). Enron kept competitors closeby to **threaten Arthur Andersen into validating their deals**. 
  * AA staff who grew Enron fees were promoted. Further, Enron **hired dozens of Andersen accountants** , giving individuals pressure to be seen by Enron as a team player.



**Bankers**

  * **Banks earned large fees from Enron’s complicated structured-finance deals** ($240 million in 1999), and bankers who grew deal sizes got promotions.
  * Like with accountants, Enron kept multiple banks in the wings competing for its business. 
  * Banks even tolerated Andy Fastow’s self-dealings with his private funds, because he was the gatekeeper between banks and Enron deals.



**Outside analysts**

  * Putatively, the analysts issuing buy/sell recommendations should be separate from the investment banking arm of the same bank. In reality, they were closely tied - **companies would only give deals to banks who issued a buy recommendation with aggressive price targets**.
  * In the 2000 era, buy/sell recommendations could move stock prices, so company shareholders resented sell recommendations, however well-reasoned.
  * So analysts focused on earnings-per-share estimates to the exclusion of cash and debt. 
  * Analysts even competed with each other for higher price targets - $100, $115.
  * **At least one analyst who was skeptical of Enron was pressured to be fired by Fastow.**



**Ratings agencies**

  * Moody’s and S&P should have issued downgrades for the sake of protecting their reputation. They had massive leverage over Enron, since their rating could sink Enron. Why didn’t they dig deeper?
  * For one, Enron simply stated they needed sufficiently high ratings to keep getting debt - lowering ratings would force debt paybacks and cause a selloff, which would sink the company. The ratings agencies didn’t want to be single-handedly responsible for sinking a company, just in case they were wrong.
  * Further, even ratings agents may have held stock in the public markets and were caught up in the flurry.



### Believable Guiding Visions

As a company, Enron saw itself as a modernizer of ancient industries. They were all doing “the Lord’s work” and “spreading the privatization gospel.”

  * Members of Enron’s trading department were missionaries - they saw themselves as revitalizing an industry populated by dinosaurs and bringing efficiency through free markets.
  * Enron international developers saw themselves bringing efficient privatized energy to poor countries.
  * Andy Fastow’s department saw themselves as financial wizards, pushing the boundary of what could be achieved in finance while staying in the bounds of GAAP accounting. They were just playing the rules of the game. They also saw themselves as saviors in the company, filling the holes that other departments created and providing real P&L value to Enron.



Gradually as workers become corrupted, they can justify their actions in terms of the original vision.

### Poorly Constructed Compensation Schemes

A pattern of Enron’s compensation style was to **reward short-term behaviors (like stock price or closing deal sizes) without concern for long-term value (like profitability)**. And according to the book’s author, Skilling happily fed greed, believing it was the best motivator for performance.

Deal makers were compensated by future expected cash flows when the deal _closed_ , not on the generation of actual cashflow. So deal makers hungrily moved from one deal to another, leaving the actual execution and capture of cashflow aside.

  * This was originally done to avoid giving direct equity in projects to developers.
  * “If you’re told to make $25 million and you do it, you’re in great shape. It doesn’t matter how much it costs you to make that $25 million.”
  * This happened in the international development deals under Rebecca Mark, and in EES under Skilling.
  * The projections of future profits included wildly optimistic price curves at the end.
  * Perspective of salespeople: **“I’m not going to be around 5 years from now - why should I care whether this deal works?”**



Employees had incentives around short-term stock prices.

  * In early 1990s, options for Lay and Kinder vested earlier if it showed 15% annual growth each year. 
  * At one point, employees were promised twice their annual salary in Enron shares if they met annual share price performance targets. This of course encouraged manipulation of stock price above fundamentals
  * This made employees desperate to hit earnings targets before the quarter closed, prompting bad deals and aggravating future problems.
  * Skilling wanted to avoid downgrades of Enron’s stock, knowing that losing confidence once would make it hard to regain.
  * The stock ticker was everywhere in Enron offices - in the lobbies, on computer screens. Dips in stock price caused dips in morale.



Peer performance reviews made big differences in bonuses, and allowed politicking - originators bullied risk department employees into approving bad deals; angry managers would dig in their heels for their staff to get top rankings.

### Accounting Practices that Disguised the Fundamentals

As explained throughout, Enron’s aggressive accounting stretched the limits of allowable practices, allowing it to inflate revenue while hiding losses.

**Mark-to-market** accounting allowed declaration profits of long-term contracts instantaneously.

  * The subjectivity of those future prices could heavily distort the profits before any cashflow occurred.
  * This led to rapid initial growth with large paper numbers, but required additional deals to show continuous growth each quarter (since the entire deal had already been accounted for in the previous quarter).
  * Long-term contracts could be reworked to post additional earnings, akin to double-dipping.
  * In the lifetime of the deal, if Enron suspected a deal would end in losses, they should have been reported on the balance sheet and profits - but sometimes they didn’t.
  * Philosophically, Skilling insisted that the value of the deal was in the idea, and once the idea was executed it should be rewarded. Future people shouldn’t be rewarded for the actions of people in the past.



For its trading, Enron used the aggressive interpretation of recognized the **selling price of goods as revenue, rather than merely the trading fees**.

For lost projects, instead of writing them off as a loss, Enron would book costs as an asset, which came to be known as a “snowball.”

Dead deals were fictitiously kept alive, to avoid a writedown that quarter.

Complicated SPE deals gave off-book debt

  * In summary, they allowed Enron to hide debt from its balance sheet, book loans as revenue, hide losses, and overstate its equity. 
  * Enron suggested it used SPEs to hedge against downside risk for its illiquid investments. In reality, the SPEs were using Enron’s stock as guarantees, thus not producing a hedge at all.
  * See the SPEs/minority interest transactions/prepay section above in Enron’s History.



Nonrecurring revenue was presented as part of ongoing operations - reworking of supply contracts, selling stakes in its facilities.

In 1997, Enron began using “Total Contract Value” as a pseudo-metric of growth, similar to the dot-com metrics of “eyeballs” and “hits.” In reality Enron could be losing money on every deal.

### Poor Management Appointments

Enron was characterized by the wrong people in the wrong positions of power.

At the highest level of management, **weak managers with the wrong intentions were placed into power**.

  * The aggressive Skilling was promoted to COO, instead of the more realistic Kinder as CEO.
  * Andy Fastow was promoted to CFO, even though his experience was in creating financial structures, not in financial prudence.
  * Ken Lay was more interested in being a public figure than managing business
    * He was celebrated as a business sage, leading an old industry into a new era.
    * Lay was also a weak manager, wanting others to like him and avoiding tough decisions.
  * A weak board
    * Ken Lay filled the board with people who had reciprocal relationships with Enron - a consulting contract, phantom equity, donation to a hospital.
    * Ken Lay appeared to walk on water. He seemed indispensable and everything great about Enron seemed to be attributable to him. 
  * The risk department was underpowered, led by a meek person who didn’t push back against bad deals



Throughout the company, Enron generally promoted people with the wrong kind of ambition (centered on self rather than the company’s long-term success).

### Businesses that Simply Didn’t Work

Enron habitually launched big into new markets, spending extravagantly in the belief that they would make it back many fold. Skilling believed worrying about cost stifled creativity.

Enron’s/Skilling’s optimistic promises to Wall Street created a situation where **Enron had to deliver fast on businesses, or else their stock price would plummet**.

Overall, Enron’s businesses lost over $10 billion in cash over their life.

Of course, the failed businesses exacerbated the situation - to hide the losses, they relied on increasingly complicated and questionable deals.

  * Enron desperately needed to produce earnings to avoid violating its loan agreements. Further, because of its low cash, it needed new loans to pay back maturing loans.
  * Enron couldn’t put too much debt on its balance sheet, which would hurt its credit rating, and banks would stop lending.



### Drinking their Own Kool-aid

**Executives loved the misguided impression given by press.**

  * Rebecca Mark for being a female phenom dealmaker
  * Skilling for Enron being the golden child of the old energy industry
  * Lay for being the prophet philosopher who saw the deregulation happening
  * Enron in general for being the new age energy company with exciting new business line



Wall Street loved Enron’s setup of the Risk Control Committee, believing it would allow Enron to take on more risk safely. This impression likely helped Enron execs and board overestimate its contribution.

In the late 1990s, companies had to move at Internet speed to keep up with other companies. Enron wanted to be seen as more like dot-coms than like Exxon.

Enron’s finance teams established a reputation as financial wizards, stretching the rules to create a new paradigm of practice. Lehman Brothers on Fastow: “He has invented a groundbreaking strategy.” Bankers saw working with Enron as a badge of honor.

  * This allowed Fastow to justify participating in his own deals as the 3% outside capital in an SPE. 



No one seemed to confront the possibility that Enron stock might actually fall.
