## Personal Traits of Enron Managers

Much is written about the management styles of the senior executives at Enron. They each had idiosyncracies that, when combined, led to a proliferation of problems.

### Jeff Skilling, COO then CEO

  * An intellectual purist, a designer of ditches, not a digger of ditches. Often slow to recognize when reality didn’t match theory. Left the execution details to his lieutenants.
    * “I’m not particularly interested in the balance sheet. It seemed to be doing well. We always had money.”
    * In the retail Enron Energy Services business, Skilling disparaged the operators of utilities as “buttcrack “ workers. “This stuff sells. Now we have to actually do something for the customers. That’s the easy part.”
  * A gambler at heart, always assumed he could beat the odds. (He was wiped out in the stock market twice in his teens.)
  * Convinced he was the smartest guy in the room - anyone who disagreed wasn’t smart enough to get it
    * He bullied analysts who questioned how Enron made money. If he didn’t want to answer a question, he dumped a lot of data. If you still didn’t get it, he’d call you stupid.
  * Darwinian in management. Encouraged confrontation between subordinates.
  * When developing a business, price was no object - the business Enron could build with an asset would far outweigh a higher price in the beginning.
  * Rarely pushed back on deals he believed were bad, promising to hold people accountable but rarely doing so.
  * Obsessed with Enron’s stock price on a daily basis.



### Ken Lay

  * Loved his public persona as a business sage, leading an old industry into a new era
  * Became engrossed by his charity foundation, networking with Washington elite, and being a local gatekeeper in Houston politics. Aimed to be treasury secretary.
  * Known internally in Enron as a pushover when negotiating pay and bonuses. 
  * Was a weak manager, wanting others to like him and hiding behind the board for tough decisions (like not promoting Rich Kinder). Lied to keep people from getting mad at him
  * Wall Street analysts viewed him as useless and out of touch with how the business worked - they preferred Kinder who delivered the numbers.
  * Used Enron’s resources for his family (family use of company jets) and engaged in nepotism (used a relative’s travel agency to book Enron flights).
  * Became a missionary for deregulation
    * This had worked once before in natural gas.
    * He inappropriately applied this mission to retail utilities, without proof that the states were actually moving in this direction. Enron bet big and lost.



### Andy Fastow, CFO

  * Burned with ambition, “not necessarily to be the best but to be seen as the best”
  * Exaggerated his resume to claim greater credit for securitization work
  * Had a chip on his shoulder by being in finance and not a department with P&L. Wanted to establish finance as a profit driver and thus sharing in the bonuses
  * A gratuitous self-promoter and brown-noser
  * Had a short temper, causing people to be afraid of speaking out
