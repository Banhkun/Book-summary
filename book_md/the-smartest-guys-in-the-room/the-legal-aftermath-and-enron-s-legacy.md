## The Legal Aftermath and Enron's Legacy

As the largest bankruptcy in US history to that point, the public demanded heads. And there were many responsible parties to punish.

The clearly illegal smoking guns led to straightforward convictions - Fastow’s misrepresentations about LJM; asset sales that were booked as revenue but in reality had a guarantee to be rebought, which meant it was a loan.

Arthur Andersen, previously one of the big five accounting firms, was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2002 for shredding documents. It voluntarily surrendered its licenses to practice as CPAs in 2002.

  * (The Supreme Court later reversed the conviction in 2005, though by that point its besmirched reputation prevented it from gaining any clients.)



The banks agreed to write big settlement checks, ultimately producing $7.2 billion for shareholders (about 20 cents for each dollar lost).

Beyond these, the legal difficulty was that **most of the financial maneuvers were not technically illegal** (which is why Fastow so brazenly boasted about the structures, and Wall Street praised them).

There also was no smoking gun that indicated either Lay or Skilling knew the extent of risk taken and predicted Enron’s demise. On deal forms, many signature lines for Skilling were left blank. They blamed Arthur Andersen and their lawyers for not detecting problems.

  * For years, Lay and Skilling maintained that **what they did was no different from the overoptimistic projections by dotcom companies**. Instead, they had always been targeted unfairly by short sellers. 



Ultimately, prosecutors chose a simpler, broader strategy - rather than analyze specific transactions and prove their illegality, they asserted that Enron had **severely misrepresented Enron’s financial health, manipulating public earnings through devices designed to produce misleading results and failing to disclose facts about Enron’s dire position**.

  * Examples of things that should have been disclosed - EES losses being hidden in wholesale; writedowns in bad deals like Azurix; meltdown in SPEs like the Raptors; last-minute filling holes to make quarterly financials look better.
  * Furthermore, accounting rules barred a company from using its stock to boost its income statement.
  * Other things that looked bad in trial - their cashing out of lots of personal shares; extravagant lifestyles; legal settlements with many Enron employees (if nothing was wrong, why had they all settled?)



In May 2006, the jury found Skilling and Lay guilty. Lay died in July from a heart attack (some suspected he faked his death). Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison and a fine of $45 million.

The massive failure of Enron also spurred regulatory changes:

  * Sarbanes-Oxley increased the personal liability of CEOs for financial statements; instituted requirements for auditor independence; and increased penalties for securities fraud.
  * The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act aimed to reduce lack of competition between the big three agencies. (This didn’t kick in strongly enough in time to prevent the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.)



### History Repeats Itself

In the afterword, the author connects the Enron scandal to the 2008 crisis. There were many similarities between the two:

  * Multiple stakeholders looked away while they got rich. This even includes the public, which could buy houses more easily than ever before.
  * After the crisis, more regulation was passed, with the promise that now everything would be different. 



Differences between Enron and 2008:

  * The author believes Enron was genuinely trying to be innovative. It launched new business lines (online energy trading, video on demand, international development).
  * In contrast, the banks in 2008 were merely issuing loans to people who couldn’t pay them, repackaging bad loans and misrepresenting their worth.
  * There could have been a case where Enron worked out; there was never an option for the latter.
  * There were no prosecutions of major bank executives.



It seems, therefore, that **we haven’t really learned our lessons, and the future won’t be any different. People will be greedy; there will always be blurry lines around what’s technically legal but immoral. It’s human nature.**
