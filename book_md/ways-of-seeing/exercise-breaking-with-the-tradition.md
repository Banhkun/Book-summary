## Exercise: Breaking With the Tradition

Berger says that the vast majority of oil paintings from this time period fall into the norms of the tradition, but there are a minority that break the conventional rules and are exceptional. Test your eye and see if you can identify the paintings that agree or break with the tradition.

* * *

Examine the images below. In your opinion, do they follow the norms of the oil painting tradition or are they exceptional? Why or why not? (Remember, the norms of the tradition lie in the paintingsâ€™ subjects and values: displays of wealth, mythology, and so on.) ![ways-de-witte.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-de-witte.jpg)
