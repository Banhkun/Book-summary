## Exercise: Observe How Ads Borrow From Paintings

Identify the connecting thread between a modern advertisement and the oil painting tradition.

* * *

Choose an advertisement near you that contains a strong image, ideally one that is staticâ€”on your phone, or in a print ad, for example. Give the advertisement a long look. Are you able to identify a connection to the oil painting tradition? What do the ad and the tradition have in common? How do they differ?
