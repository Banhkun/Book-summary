## Exercise: Analyze an Image Using Your Beliefs, Knowledge, and Experience

Berger tells us that what we believe, know, and have experienced influences our interpretation of images. Analyze your own reaction to an image using these insights.

* * *

Take a look at the painting below. In 1-2 sentences, what does the image make you think or feel? ![ways-arthur.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-arthur.jpg)

What is one **belief** you hold that may have influenced your reaction?

What is something you **know** that influenced your reaction?

Finally, what is an **experience** youâ€™ve had that influenced your reaction?
