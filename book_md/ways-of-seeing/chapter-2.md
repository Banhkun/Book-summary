## Chapter 2: The European Tradition of Oil Painting

Every topic discussed in _Ways of Seeing_ connects back to the European tradition of oil painting. Berger argues that understanding the dominant form of art from this period in Europe is key to understanding Western history and social order. Because so many paintings from this era are heralded as markers of artistic and cultural achievement in Western culture, he says it's crucial to understand the politics involved, and why they’ve been erased from (or mystified in) art history.

### “The Tradition”

The primary topic Berger discusses in _Ways of Seeing_ is the European tradition of oil painting, which he says occurred between the years 1500 and 1900. This is not a defined period of art history because there were several movements that occurred within it (Romanticism and Realism to name two), yet Berger recognized that this is a distinct period with overlapping norms, hence his classification of the medium and time period as a “tradition.”

While oil painting took off at the beginning of the Renaissance (around the year 1400), Berger argues that the artistic _norms_ of this time period were not fully established until the beginning of the 16th century. The norms continued until Impressionism and Cubism took over at the turn of the 20th century.

**The technique of oil painting** (mixing pigment with oils to create a medium) was around long before the Renaissance, but it **became an _art form_ during this period** because, for the first time, there was a need to develop and perfect the technique. This need was primarily **due to the subjects being depicted: food, pedigreed animals, expensive objects, land, and so on.** Tempera and fresco paintings couldn’t produce the intense realism that oil painting could, so to depict these subjects in a way that essentially placed them in the room—the desired effect—oil painting was necessary.

> **Why Oil Paints Are the Best Medium for Realistic Paintings**
> 
> Berger states that tempera and fresco paintings weren’t realistic enough to satisfy the artistic desires of this time period. What made oil paints a superior medium for this purpose?
> 
> Tempera is an egg-based paint that produces muted colors and dries very quickly. Fresco painting is the process of using watercolor paints on wet plaster, which also dries quickly. In both of these mediums, the artist doesn’t have the luxury of taking his time. He also has less control over the paint and mistakes are difficult to fix.
> 
> Oil paints, on the other hand, have an extremely long drying time—depending on the solvent used to thin the paint, it can take days, weeks, months, or even years in some cases, to fully cure. This allows the artist to work very slowly and deliberately.
> 
> The texture of oil paints lends them well to blending, which can produce seemingly infinite shades of color. Unlike other mediums, the colors of oil paints are vivid and saturated, which allow them to be layered on top of one another to create depth and texture, as well as fix mistakes.

#### Norms of the Tradition: Oil Paintings as a Depiction of Wealth

Berger argues that **European oil paintings from 1500-1900 were almost entirely focused on displaying wealth**. He explains that oil painting rose to prominence beginning with the Renaissance largely because of its ability to accurately depict tangible items. This made it an excellent medium for depicting subjects that represent wealth and power:

  * Expensive objects
  * Feasts 
  * Pedigreed animals 
  * Land ownership 
  * Portraits
  * Mythology
  * Genre paintings
  * Colonization
  * Nudes



> **The Hierarchy of Genres**
> 
> There are ranking systems that exist for genres of the European oil painting tradition, which sorts categories of art forms in terms of value. The first hierarchy of genres was established in 1667 by Andre Felibien, a theoretician of French classicism. He ranked the categories in the following order, from most to least valuable:
> 
>   * **History paintings** : Paintings with mythological, religious, historical, or literary subjects. The paintings must contain an intellectual or moral message.
> 
>   * **Genre paintings:** Paintings depicting everyday life.
> 
>   * **Portraits**
> 
>   * **Landscapes**
> 
>   * **Still lifes**
> 
> 


### Expensive Objects

Consider this painting by Holbein. If you look closely at what is being depicted, it oozes wealth. Berger describes to us the materials being displayed: marble, velvet, fur, and silk, among others. The men display their privilege through items like books, globes, scientific tools, and musical instruments—symbols of the educated class.

Berger explains that traditionally, art critics explain paintings such as this in terms of technical mastery. The brushstrokes required to accurately depict velvet are quite different from that of marble, or of a human face for that matter. While technical analysis has its value, Berger acknowledges, what is too often missing (mystified) from analyses is what is plainly before our eyes: These men surrounded themselves with their most expensive and class-validating possessions and hired an artist (Holbein) to paint them. And this was the norm. Why? That is the question that Berger urges us to consider.

THE AMBASSADORS BY HOLBEIN 1487/8-1543

> **Achieving Texture With Oil Paints**
> 
> Berger describes how Holbein painted the textures of velvet, marble, fur, silk, wood, and metal all in one painting. How is this achieved? Most artists agree that experimentation is the best way to learn about texture. Start by playing with the following factors:
> 
>   * **Brush type:** Stiffer bristles are more appropriate for applying thick paint, while thinner more delicate brushes can be used for thin applications.
> 
>   * **Pallet knives:** Instead of using a brush, you can apply paint with a pallet knife to achieve a “frosted cake” look.
> 
>   * **Brush stroke:** Dabbing, swooping with pressure, lightly sliding, and so on, all produce different looks on the canvas.
> 
>   * **Viscosity of the paint:** For thick texture (impasto), use the paint straight out of the tube with no medium to thin it. For thinner paints, add a solvent, such as turpentine or mineral spirits. Don’t add too much or your paint will become soapy.
> 
>   * **Dry mediums:** Try adding sand, pumice, or glass beads to your paint to add an unexpected texture. Use a pallet knife or disposable brush when applying this, as it can ruin your good paint brushes.
>

### Food, Pedigreed Animals, and Land Ownership

Just as expensive objects represent wealth, so did great feasts, expensive pedigreed animals, and ownership of land. These were things that the working class didn’t have, and the wealthy elite who commissioned paintings were proud to have them. Berger says that thousands of paintings from the tradition fell into one of these categories. Here is an example of each:

![ways-de-heem.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-de-heem.jpg)

STILL LIFE WITH A LOBSTER BY DE HEEM 1643

(Shortform note: Cornell University conducted a study of more than 750 Western food paintings from the years 1500 to 2000, similar to the years Berger discusses. They agree with Berger’s assessment that paintings of feasts were intended to cause envy and display social status. They added that the foods displayed were often exotic, native to non-Western lands. Fruits were also heavily featured, when in reality vegetables were much more readily available. The study authors warn art lovers to not use these images as a historical record of what was actually eaten at the time; rather, liberties were taken in order to appear as elite as possible.)

![ways-stubbs.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-stubbs.jpg)

LINCOLNSHIRE OX BY STUBBS 1724-1806

(Shortform note: Many modern art historians say that animals appear in Renaissance paintings as metaphors. Ermines, dogs, birds, and rabbits are listed as recurring animals in religious and secular paintings. Livestock, particularly pedigreed livestock, is not listed among them—which begs the question, is it possible that the ox in this painting is symbolic? Or is it simply an expensive animal standing next to a wealthy man as a display of ownership?)

![ways-gainsborough.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-gainsborough.jpg)

HENEAGE LLOYD AND HIS SISTER, LUCY BY GAINSBOROUGH 1727-1788

(Shortform note: Gainsborough is heralded as being a master of the portrait and the landscape, but we can infer that Berger would disagree with this assertion. Berger argues that landscapes are natural features that are not owned. If you look closely at Gainsborough’s landscapes, nearly every one shows the landowner standing proudly within it. The J. Paul Getty museum website also describes landscapes as being the “natural world,” but provides examples that include human structures upon them. We can gather that the nuanced definition of a landscape is still up for debate.)

### Mythology and “Genre”

#### Mythology

According to Berger, paintings of ancient myths and religious stories were the most respected category of painting. Because the wealthy elite were educated, they were the minority in society who had access to these myths. But instead of inspiring their wealthy owners to live up to the morality depicted in the paintings, Berger says the paintings instead served only to confirm its owners’ high perception of themselves because they were educated enough to know the stories being told.

Although oil paints are excellent for depicting tangible objects, Berger says intangible concepts like morality and spirituality were difficult to achieve through the medium. As a result, these paintings had a flatness to them, and were more self-serving than examples of artistic mastery.

TRIUMPH OF KNOWLEDGE BY SPRANGER 1546-1627

##### Shortform Commentary: A Modern-Day Mythological Painting—Leda and the Swan

Painted in 1962 as one of a set of six, Leda and the Swan is a modern-day mythological painting by Cy Twombly. It’s immediately apparent that this painting is done in a different style than the mythological oil paintings of the European tradition, yet it meets the criteria of the genre.

The painting is based upon the Greek story of Zeus seducing Leda by taking the form of a swan. This particular painting sold for over $50 million in 2017, demonstrating that the market value for this genre still tops the hierarchy list previously discussed. Another member of this set currently resides at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

![ways-twombly2.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-twombly2.jpg)

#### Genre Paintings

“Genre” paintings were the opposite of mythological images. Rather than depicting morality and virtue, the genre paintings depicted unrefined vulgarity. The subjects of these paintings were the working class—nameless individuals going about their lives. This is quite different from the commissioned paintings that immortalized the patron’s name in the title of the work.

The genre paintings that follow the tradition depict the working class as poor, but happy. Often, the subject is even smiling outward at the viewer of the painting, presumed to be a member of the bourgeoisie. Berger says this depiction isn’t realistic, but that it kept the wealthy from feeling guilt about their privilege (mystification).

Another mystification in the genre paintings is the hidden message that the poor are less deserving of nice things. This is accomplished by depicting the subjects as sloppy and haphazard. Often their objects are strewn about without care. It implies that a person’s economic status is the result of their virtues, or lack thereof.

Berger points out that the paintings that broke with tradition and showed the darker, grittier side of poverty rarely sold—the people who were able to afford these paintings didn’t want to see this reality.

![ways-steen.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-steen.jpg)

THE MERRY FAMILY BY STEEN 1668

> **Genre Paintings’ Moment in the Spotlight**
> 
> The “hierarchy of the genres” placed the genre artform beneath history paintings, and Berger himself spends far less time discussing this category as compared to that of the history paintings. However, in 16th century Northern Europe (especially in the Netherlands), genre paintings were among the most popular. The rise of Protestantism brought with it a desire for humble works of art—a deviation from the ornate and awe-inspiring frescos of the Catholic church. In fact, the Protestant church rejected frescoes altogether (historians believe this is at least partially due to the climate in Northern Europe: It was too humid for frescoes to dry properly).
> 
> Many of the masters of the “genre” genre came from the Netherlands, including Vermeer and Steen. The most common scenes depicted included social events, daily pleasure, soldier life, and scenes of drunkenness.

### Colonialism

Just as myth paintings assured elites that they too were moral and therefore deserving of their wealth, paintings that depicted colonized people and places reminded elites that (in their view) their culture was superior and therefore justified violent conquest. Berger explains that the painting in itself (a commodity)__ and the subject it depicted both contributed to this view.

![ways-spiridione.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-spiridione.jpg)

THE EAST OFFERING ITS RICHES TO BRITANNIA BY SPIRIDIONE 1737-1781

> **_Ways of Seeing_ and Postcolonial Theory **
> 
> Postcolonial theory is a body of thought that claims we cannot understand the world we live in without considering how imperialism and colonial rule has shaped it. “Post” is added to the word colonial because it primarily focuses on colonialism from the 18th to 20th centuries, but the theory doesn’t imply that colonialism has ended.
> 
> Postcolonial theory emerged in the 1980s as part of a larger conversation that includes feminism and critical race theory. The theory is not so much a set of beliefs as much as it is a lens from which to view history.

**Note: An important additional category that existed within the tradition was that of the female nude.** It was such a prominent category, and it’s discussed so heavily by Berger, that **the next chapter of our guide is dedicated to it.**

### The Mystification of European Oil Paintings

Because of the subjects depicted __ in paintings from this time period,__ as well as the monetary value the paintings hold as commodities, **European oil paintings are ripe for mystification**.

One of the most prominent ways that art is being mystified today is in how it’s represented and explained through art theory and history. According to Berger, **the artists and works that are most represented by museum docents and historians don’t accurately reflect the norms of the European oil painting tradition**. As a result, **the history of the time** **is invisible** to the viewing public, **and** **is unable to be learned from**.

Berger says that hundreds of thousands of paintings fulfilled the norms of the tradition (the ones discussed here as well as in the next chapter), and only a few hundred broke with it. It’s those few that are hailed as the greatest examples of the genre, but Berger argues that they aren’t examples of the tradition at all; rather, they are (and should be recognized as) _exceptions_ to the rule. This isn’t to say that Berger doesn’t respect these artists; quite the opposite, in fact. Because they broke the rules of the tradition, they pushed art _forward_ , which he says is worthy of reverence in itself.

Some of the artists Berger references in this regard are Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Turner, among others. As you can see below, these artists’ most prominent works don’t fall under the established categories (norms) of the tradition.

![ways-exceptions.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-exceptions.jpg)

From left to right:

  * _The Night Watch_ by Rembrandt, 1642
  * _The Milkmaid_ by Vermeer, 1657/8
  * _Fishermen at Sea_ by Turner, 1796



> Each of the artists represented above are known for their excellence in a particular theme:
> 
>   * **Rembrandt** painted in several genres but is best known for his prolific work in portraiture. His portraits broke with tradition by portraying true human emotion and character rather than a static body placed near evidence of wealth.
> 
>   * **Vermeer** is known for his masterful work of the “genre” genre. He broke with tradition by showing the working class without implications of moral depravity.
> 
>   * **Turner** was a versatile artist who is best known for his landscape paintings. He broke with tradition simply by depicting landscapes in their natural, non-owned state.
> 
> 


### How Wealth and Capitalism Are Protected by Mystification

According to Berger, oil paintings were mystified at the time they were created, and they continue to be mystified today. In both instances, they protect the economic and social order of capitalistic societies.

The rise of the oil painting coincided with the rise of the free art market in Europe. Almost all paintings during this time were done on commission, in large part because of the expense of the venture. **The wealthier a person was, the more paintings he could commission**. To have a house filled with commissioned paintings was a display of wealth and a point of pride. Because the paintings were commissioned, however, the patron had control over what the painting depicted.

Berger explains that**this is a form of mystification, because if you study the paintings from this time period, you are not seeing a record of what _was_ —you are seeing how the wealthiest class of people wanted to be portrayed.** These depictions protected their social status, which is inherently connected to wealth, for all of history.

ARCHDUKE LEOPOLD WILHELM IN HIS PRIVATE PICTURE GALLERY BY TENIERS 1582-1649

(Shortform note: Berger explains how mystification benefits the wealthy, but he doesn’t provide a clear argument for how demystification of centuries-old paintings would affect modern-day capitalism. We might infer that if the masses were to understand the class stratification and oppression of the past, they might be more likely to recognize it in modern society and challenge its authority.)
