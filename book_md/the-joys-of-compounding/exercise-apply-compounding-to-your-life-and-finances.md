## Exercise: Apply Compounding to Your Life and Finances

Baid argues that compounding is a transformative principle that can grow both your sense of personal fulfillment and your financial portfolio. In this exercise, consider how you might implement his strategies.

* * *

Consider Baid’s six strategies for cultivating a meaningful life (nurture your mental and physical health, pursue your passion, live authentically, build positive relationships, engage in continual learning, and achieve financial independence). Which one of these strategies could you benefit from prioritizing?

Think about Baid’s methods for practicing the strategy you identified. What one method can you immediately adopt and how will you implement it?

Now consider Baid’s strategies for managing your investment portfolio (enhance decision-making skills, assess investment value, manage risk, and invest in social causes). Which of these do you think you'll benefit most from in the long term and why?

Do you plan on adopting any of Baid’s investment strategies? If so, how will you incorporate them into your life?
