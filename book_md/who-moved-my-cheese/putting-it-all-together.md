## Putting It All Together

(Shortform exclusive section)

Let’s put it all together by talking about a common change in many people’s lives — job changes. If your job is redefined or eliminated, applying the principles in “Who Moved My Cheese” can help you deal with it successfully.

To start with, **watch for change** by paying attention to company statements, workload and structural changes, and industry trends. If you sniff out change, you can **prepare for change** by getting your personal finances in order, adding a part-time job, learning a new skill to develop your job in a different direction, or moving to a new company.

**Don’t try to hold on to the past** (don’t wait for the cheese to reappear) by ignoring warning signs, resisting new skill requirements, or by just working harder at what you know. Changing work can be scary, and it’s tempting to be in denial, but the longer you do this, the more you hurt yourself.

To combat the fear, **envision something better**(picture new cheese) — this can be an opportunity to do something you’ve always wanted to do, but couldn’t because the job tied you down. Now that you’re free of old constraints, imagine yourself succeeding in a new role. **Focus on what you can gain through change** rather than what you might lose. Possibilities include a chance to use latent creativity in a different job, having new experiences, or moving to a different part of the world.

**Don’t let fear paralyze or hold you back** from trying something new, whether it’s learning a new skill at the same company, or doing something different. Don’t be afraid to **leave your comfort zone** , because doing something offers a better chance of success than doing nothing. If you don’t **move quickly to adapt** you may lose your best chance. For instance, others will learn new skills and fill jobs that could have been yours.

**Learn to enjoy change** — it can offer rewards such as greater income, new relationships, or greater job satisfaction from using more of your talents. Finally, **expect and prepare for continuous change** by always growing and learning in your personal and professional life.

The moral of the cheese story is that the end of the old can also be the beginning of something better.
