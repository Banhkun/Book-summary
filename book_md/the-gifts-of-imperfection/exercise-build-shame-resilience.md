## Exercise: Build Shame Resilience

Learn how to combat shame by building shame resilience.

* * *

Describe the last time you felt shamed. What did your shame relate to? (For instance, it could be connected to your job, your appearance, your relationships, or something else entirely.) What triggered this shame?

What were the symptoms of your shame? Consider any physical reactions you had to the shame (for example, sweaty palms or a pounding heart), as well as any thought patterns that it triggered (for example, “I’m not good enough”).

What do you think the root cause of your shame was? For instance, did it come from societal expectations, the opinions of a loved one, or your own perfectionism?

One of the most powerful ways to combat shame is to talk about it. Is there someone you trust who you could talk to about your shame, and who could offer you support? What would you say to them?
