## Exercise: Practice Calm to Fight Anxiety

Learn how to practice calm in stressful situations.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you struggled to remain calm. What made the situation so stressful?

Did the situation trigger any strong negative emotions—for example, anger or fear? How did these emotions influence your reaction to the situation? (For instance, did they cause you to hastily act in a way that you now regret?)

Imagine you’re faced with a similar situation in the future. What could you do to stop yourself from having an instant emotional reaction? (Remember: Pausing before you react and challenging anxious thoughts are two practices that can help you to keep your emotions in check.)
