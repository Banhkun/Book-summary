## Exercise: Find Meaning by Using Your Gifts and Talents

Learn how to incorporate your gifts and talents into your working life.

* * *

Name two or three of your gifts and talents that you’re not currently using in your working life. Describe these gifts and talents in detail.

Pick one of the gifts or talents you outlined above. Why do you think you’re not using this gift or talent? What’s stopping you from putting it into action?

Consider how you could start to use this gift or talent. Is there a way you could incorporate it into your current job? Could you make a career change that would allow you to use it? Perhaps you could start a “side hustle” based around this gift or talent?

After brainstorming, do you feel more confident about your ability to use your talent? Why or why not?
