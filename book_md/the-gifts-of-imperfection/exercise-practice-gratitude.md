## Exercise: Practice Gratitude

Acknowledge the things you’re grateful for, and learn how to practice gratitude each day.

* * *

Describe all of the things that you’re grateful for today. (This could include small things, like your coffee this morning being particularly delicious, and big things, like having a loving partner and a fulfilling job.)

How has listing the things you’re grateful for made you feel? For example, do you feel joyful and fulfilled? Are you surprised by how much you have to be grateful for?

Think about how you could incorporate gratitude practice into your daily life. Choose a method of gratitude that suits your routine best. For instance, could you make time in your day to write down what you’re grateful for? Could you complete a gratitude meditation each morning?
