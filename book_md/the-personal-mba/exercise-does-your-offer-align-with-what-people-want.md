## Exercise: Does Your Offer Align With What People Want?

According to Kaufman, successful businesses offer products and services that fulfill people’s basic needs. This exercise will help you think about how potential customers might judge the value of your offer.

* * *

Briefly describe your product or service.

Describe how your product or service fulfills one or more of your potential customers’ five basic needs (to feel good about themselves, to connect with others, to grow and learn, to feel safe, or to avoid effort.)

Briefly describe the type of person that would benefit from your offer and why they might be receptive to it. (For example, you offer childcare services for working moms who can’t make it to school in time to collect their children. Your service alleviates their guilt about not being there and makes their lives easier—thus fulfilling their need to feel good about themselves and their need to avoid effort.)

How does your product or service compare to what competitors are offering? Consider the specific benefits it offers, its quality, and its price.
