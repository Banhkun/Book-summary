## Chapter 1: Deficits

Neurologists often speak of brain disorders in terms of deficits. A deficit is some impairment of neurological function, usually linked to brain damage to some particular area. Damage to Broca’s area, for example, is known to cause aphasia—the inability to process and understand written or spoken language.

We now know that the right hemisphere of the brain is primarily responsible for recognizing and ordering our reality. Indeed the right hemisphere is the neurological base of our identity and sense of self. It is how we root ourselves in time, space, and relation to other people.

But when the right hemisphere is damaged and the individual begins to lose this grounding and sense of identity, the brain has a remarkable ability. **It replaces or compensates for this loss, creating a _new_ reality that keeps our identity and self intact. **In other words,**** the brain is adept at turning deficits in one area into surpluses in another.

In this chapter, we’ll explore the stories of patients who suffered brain damage that compromised core functions like visual recognition, memory, body awareness, and language. All of these patients lost some crucial element of their humanity, but **the power of the human brain simultaneously endowed them with some extraordinary abilities to navigate their world, make sense of what they saw, and retain some sense of identity and self.**

### The Agnosia of Dr. P

We can see a clear example of a neurological deficit in the strange case of Dr. P, a distinguished professor of music. Author Oliver Sacks met with Dr. P after the man’s wife reported that her husband was having strange problems with visual recognition.

This manifested in bizarre ways. Dr. P seemed to be unable to recognize the faces of his students and only knew them when they spoke or played their instruments. He also had the opposite problem—seeing faces where there were none. To the bafflement of observers, Dr. P was known to pat inanimate objects like parking meters and fire hydrants, thinking they were children.

When Dr. P went to an ophthalmologist, he discovered that his _eyes_ were not the problem. **Dr. P suffered instead from agnosia—an inability to recognize and interpret visual data**. He could _observe_ the visual world around him but derive no holistic _meaning_ from it.

#### Left-Hemisphere Problems

Sacks’s initial examination revealed that Dr. P was having problems with the left side of his brain. Sacks identified a few symptoms of Dr. P’s condition immediately:

  * He could generally see well, but could not identify objects if they were placed on his left side.
  * When asked to describe an imaginary walk down the streets in the center of his town, Dr. P could only describe the buildings on his _right_ side. When asked to imagine the same walk through the town center but approaching from the _opposite_ way, he also described only those buildings on his right side—but this time, they were the buildings on the side of the street he had omitted in his initial description.



Sacks found that Dr. P could not identify the faces in photographs of friends and family. Those he _could_ recognize were those with distinct features—he identified a photo of his brother by noting his brother’s square jaw and big teeth.

But even this was only further evidence of his condition. He was identifying only the _features_ and using them as a clue to guess the identity of the person, but he was not truly _recognizing_ them. **He was missing the forest for the trees, using characteristics as clues to unlock the puzzle of the unrecognizable world in which he lived**. This also explained why he could identify highly stylized cartoon drawings, abstract shapes, or playing cards, but struggled to identify his own wife—whose head he often grabbed at, believing it was a hat.

Similarly, **Dr. P could identify the individual features of objects, but never define what the object was as a whole**. To him, a rose was “a convoluted red form” with a strange green tube attached to it.

#### Surpluses

**Although Dr. P had lost the power of visual narrative, his mind seemed to compensate for this deficit by crediting his neurological “account” in other ways**. As we saw with his rich and detailed descriptions of the _features_ of objects like flowers or gloves, it was clear that Dr. P had exceptional powers of abstract description. This was one of the ways in which Dr. P managed to service meaning from his world. A clear manifestation of this was how he excelled at schematic mental models involving abstract shapes—he was a skillful player of blind chess, able to perfectly visualize the board and pieces on his mind.

His already prodigious musical skills were another means by which Dr. P held his atomized world together. **Dr. P was only able to perform the routine functions of daily life by means of music.** His clothes had to be laid out in the same precise way every day and he had to maintain a musical rhythm while he dressed himself. Any change or interruption would render him unable to complete the task. Thus, his life was ordered like a carefully orchestrated opera, each note and beat guiding him through his days.

Sacks recommended that Dr. P commit to living a life entirely consisting of music. Music was one of the gifts Dr. P’s brain had given him to compensate for his devastating impairment, providing him a tool to order, recognize, and make sense of his world.

### The Memoryless Jimmie G.

**Brain damage can also affect another crucial component of the self—memory.** How can someone be said to be truly existing as a human being if they have no sense of past, but instead live in a continuous present that is reinvented every few seconds? This takes us to the remarkable case of Jimmie G.

Jimmie G. was a patient whom Sacks first met in 1975. This man likely suffered from the neurological impairment known as Korsakov’s syndrome, a condition caused by alcohol-related damage to the mammillary bodies in the brain. Korsakov’s syndrome impairs short-term memory and causes retrograde amnesia—the inability to recall memories.

**The most recent memories tend to be those most severely impacted, with patients forgetting people they met and events they witnessed mere minutes before.** Sometimes, the memory loss extends backward in time, eating up memories further and further back until only the most distant remain. The worst sufferers of Korsakov’s syndrome paradoxically become trapped in the past, while at the same time living in an inescapable present. This was the tortured psychic state in which Sacks first encountered Jimmie G.

#### Living in the Past

One of the first things that struck Sacks was Jimmie’s excellent _long-term_ memory. He could recall his childhood in Connecticut; the homes he’d lived in (even their phone numbers); his interest in math and engineering as a high school student; and his time in the US Navy, where he’d worked as a radio operator during World War Two.

But something curious happened when Jimmie talked about his Navy days. He switched to the present tense and began talking about his plans for what he was going to do when he was discharged from service in the war. He spoke of the death of President Franklin Roosevelt and the Allied victory in the war as though they were current events. Sacks realized that **Jimmie still thought it was 1945 and that he was still a 19-year-old sailor. In reality, it was 1975 and he was nearly fifty years old.**

When Sacks presented Jimmie with a mirror and asked him if the face he saw looked like that of a 19-year-old, Jimmie recoiled in horror, unable to understand what he was looking at. It temporarily shook his sense of identity to the core.

#### An Eternal Present

Luckily for Jimmie, he forgot the entire matter of the mirror a few minutes later. For, in addition to being stuck in the past, Jimmie was also stuck in an eternal present, having almost no short-term memory. He was good at solving puzzles, but only those that could be done within seconds or minutes. He was unable to do anything that took longer because he would forget the task he was engaged in.

Further, anything said to him would be forgotten in a matter of seconds, although sometimes he could show faint echoes of short-term memory. After Sacks stopped doing memory exercises with Jimmie and resumed them a few minutes later, Jimmie reported vaguely remembering performing similar exercises with a doctor “a while back,” but did not remember that it had been Sacks and that “a while back” was mere minutes before. **His condition had rendered every moment of his existence devoid of temporal meaning and context.**

After looking into Jimmie’s case history further, Sacks discovered that he had actually been in the Navy until 1965 and had been mentally competent throughout the entire period of his service. Sacks made contact with Jimmie’s brother, who told him that around 1970, Jimmie had suffered some sort of break, began drinking heavily, and almost entirely blotted out his post-1945 memories. When the brother went to visit Jimmie, Jimmie was unable to recognize him.

#### The Indestructible Spirit

**An essential piece of Jimmie (or whoever he may once have been) was missing and probably gone forever**. He told Sacks that he didn’t feel miserable but that he didn’t enjoy life either, and said, hauntingly, “I haven’t felt alive for a very long time.”

But after consulting with the great Russian neuropsychologist Alexander Luria, Sacks resolved to help Jimmie regain some semblance of his humanity. Luria reminded Sacks that the self consists of more than just the memories of past events. **Even someone as severely impaired as Jimmie still possessed feeling, emotion, and a sense of the sublime.**

Sacks moved Jimmie to a facility where he was cared for by a team of doctors and nurses. Jimmie never truly came to recognize anyone at this facility, though he did come to familiarize himself with the setting, managing to navigate the halls and find his way to and from his room. He was capable of having emotionally significant visits with his brother, whom he still loved, though Jimmie, thinking his brother was in his 20s, could not explain why he looked so old for his age. These meetings were deeply poignant—Jimmie’s brother was his only link between his disconnected present and the past in which he still imagined himself to be living.

**But some indestructible element of Jimmie’s being managed to overcome his impairment and even thrive.** When Jimmie went to church and participated in the Mass, he was clearly moved spiritually. His disorder was an _advantage_ here, because he was able to connect to God and remain completely in the moment. He could also follow and enjoy the rhythms of music and drama. Apparently, there were parts of Jimmie—perhaps the soul or the spirit—that even Korsakov’s could not destroy. The mind may have been irreparably damaged, but the soul could still be uplifted by music, art, and communion.

### Christina’s Loss of Proprioception

So far, we’ve talked about neurological losses as they relate to “internal” functions like visual recognition and memory. But the physical body is, of course, also an essential part of the self. Control and awareness of one’s body are crucial to our sense of autonomy. They are so automatic that we scarcely think about them.

**But what happens when we are no longer guaranteed the certainty of our physical selves?** This brings us to the unusual and disturbing case of Christina and her loss of proprioception.

#### A Disembodied Person

Christina was a healthy, 27-year-old woman and mother of two. The night before she was scheduled to have a routine surgery to remove gallstones, Christina had an awful nightmare in which she imagined she had no control over her body. She wasn’t _paralyzed_ in this dream—she could still move, but **she had no control over her movement or awareness of where her body was in relation to the physical world.**

Although the nightmare was initially dismissed by the hospital psychiatrist as standard pre-surgery hysteria, it soon became Christina’s living reality. She came back to the hospital, claiming that she felt weirdly disembodied, disconnected from her physical self. She had lost any sense of balance; could not hold objects or reach for them; could not stand without looking at her feet; and had suffered a total loss of tone and muscle posture, with her hands wandering freely unless she made a conscious effort to hold them in place.

#### Loss of Proprioception

When Sacks was called in to examine her, he found that Christina wasn’t suffering from hysteria at all. From head to toe, **she had completely lost proprioception—her sense of self-movement and body position**. Proprioception is a sixth sense, the “eyes” of the body by which we orient and position ourselves in relation to the physical world. It is how we know where our bodies are in space.

For example, even if you close your eyes, you can still touch your finger to your nose, because proprioception tells you where parts of your body are in relation to one another—you don’t need to rely on your sense of sight to tell you where your finger or your nose is.

**_Without_ proprioception, we are disembodied, with no innate awareness of our physical selves**. Christina found that she could not sense her own body anymore. Whereas she once intuitively _knew_ where her arm was, she now had to rely on her sense of vision to _locate_ it—painstakingly using her eyes to consciously will her body to do what it had once done automatically. Whereas she once knew how to modulate her voice because her sense of proprioception gave her an awareness of her vocal cords, she now had to use her powers of hearing to regulate its volume and tone.

**Christina had become a third-party operator of her body, as though it was an object that was no longer part of herself.** With great concentration, she could control it, but it was no longer “hers” in any way. She was driven to the deepest despair by her condition, likening it to a “dead veil” that had enveloped her being, telling Sacks, “I feel my body is blind and deaf to itself.”

#### Reality Becomes Artifice

**But Christina managed to** **regain some mastery over her body, through making extraordinary efforts and compensating for her loss with her other five senses.** She regained her balance by maintaining an overly formal and upright sitting pose. Likewise, she learned to modulate her voice by adopting a theatrical, stagy voice. She had to adopt a constant pose of artifice and performance to make up for the lost reality of her proprioception.

Eventually, these mechanisms became second nature to Christina. Life was possible once again—although it would always be disembodied, and never normal.

### Reagan’s Speech and the Aphasiacs

The ability to understand language is one of the defining traits of humanity. Other organisms communicate through sounds, but there is no parallel to the evocative power of human speech. Yet some people who’ve suffered brain damage are robbed of this ability. They suffer from **aphasia—the inability to process and understand spoken words.**

But, as we’ve seen, the brain has a remarkable ability to compensate for deficits in one area with neurological surpluses in another. Aphasiacs may possess an uncanny ability to look beyond the veil of words and derive true meaning more clearly than anyone.

#### Aphasia: Seeing Past the Words

In the 1980s, Sacks was at an aphasiac ward of a psychiatric hospital, where the patients were watching a televised speech being given by President Ronald Reagan. Their aphasia inhibited them from processing and understanding the words the president was speaking. But **they could still understand the _non-verbal_ aspects of language**, indeed, far better than most other people. Sacks observed that they were highly attuned to the changing rhythms, intonations, and cadences of Reagan’s speech.

Looking past the words prepared by Reagan’s speechwriters, they heard only his tone and inflection. Based upon this, **they saw the polished actor-turned-president as a dissembling phony, keenly picking up on the falseness of his tone and body language**. And their reaction to his speech was not reverential respect—it was uproarious, hysterical laughter! Sacks learned that one cannot fool an aphasiac with slick rhetoric, because they have extra heightened sensitivity to tone and can never be misled with words.

#### Agnosia: Just the Words

Agnosia presents the exact opposite condition. **Someone with agnosia can understand _only_ words, but not tone or expression**. Sacks asked an agnosia patient named Emily D. how _she_ interpreted Reagan’s address. Because she could understand nothing _but_ words, Emily needed people to use precise wording in order for her to derive meaning from speech. Slang, colloquialisms, metaphors, or any other imprecisions of language would render what she was hearing incomprehensible.

When she listened to Reagan’s speech, she focused on its imprecision with words. The president was not clear in what he meant, and, according to Emily, this meant he was either brain-damaged or being dishonest. Once again, it took patients with brain damage to look past Reagan’s slick speech and see it for what it really was.
