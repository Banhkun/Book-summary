## Exercise: Avoid the Pitfalls

Despite our best efforts, most of us occasionally stumble into one of the conversational pitfalls Fine describes. That doesn’t mean we’ve failed or that we’re bad people—it just gives us something to work on.

* * *

Pick a conversational pitfall you’ve stumbled into in the past or which you often struggle to avoid. Describe what you did or said on an occasion you fell into that pitfall. (The pitfalls are: boasting or bragging, dramatizing or one-upping, monopolizing or oversharing, bombarding or interrogating, and interrupting or advising.)

Describe how you felt or what you were thinking when you engaged in this behavior. Why do you think you did it, and what made it feel necessary or right? (For example, were you feeling particularly proud, nervous, uncomfortable, awkward, or annoyed?)

How do you think you were perceived by those around you when you engaged in this pitfall? Explain your answer. (For instance, you might think people were annoyed by your behavior because they were abrupt with you or ignored you subsequently.)

If you find yourself engaging in this behavior again, what will you do differently?
