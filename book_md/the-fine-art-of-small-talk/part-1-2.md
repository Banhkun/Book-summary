## Part 1.2: The Four Steps to a Successful Conversation, Steps 3-4

In this chapter, we’ll discuss Fine’s final two steps to a successful conversation: keeping the conversation going and ending the conversation.

### Step 3: Keep the Conversation Going

Fine states that once you’ve started the conversation, do your part to keep it flowing smoothly. Let’s explore two methods of prolonging conversation: asking open-ended questions that get people talking about themselves and using context clues to follow up on their answers.

#### How to Ask Open-Ended Questions

According to Fine, a conversation flows best when you create opportunities for your partner to share details you can explore more deeply. **Therefore, ask your conversational partner open-ended questions that demand more than a one-word answer.** Show interest and encourage them to talk about themselves: The more your partner gives you, Fine says, the more you’ll have to work with later. (Shortform note: You’ll see the value of open-ended questions more clearly in the upcoming section on following up on cues. For now, keep in mind that your goal is always to elicit more than a “yes” or “no.”)

**If your question elicits a one-word answer, ask another open-ended question.** For example:

  * Person A: “How was your vacation?”
  * Person B: “Great!”
  * Person A: “I’m glad to hear it! Did you do anything particularly exciting?”
  * Person B: “Well, my brother and I went water skiing at the lake. We…”



However, Fine includes a caveat to this recommendation: **Don’t push topics your partner doesn’t seem willing to engage in.** You’re not here to interrogate them: Let them decide how much they’re comfortable saying. If they give a short answer and then steer the conversation elsewhere, Fine recommends you respect that and join them in the direction they’ve chosen.

(Shortform note: This principle is crucial because it prevents you from _pressuring_ your partner to talk about certain things: Your conversation will go most smoothly if you give them space to control the topic. At this point, the conversation has only just started—and you want it to continue—so leave judgment, criticism, and interrogation behind.)

> **Give Strangers a Chance to Surprise You**
> 
> The examples of open-ended questions Fine provides commonly presume some prior knowledge of your conversational partner—for instance, asking a friend how a recent work project went requires prior knowledge of their work plans. **When it comes to strangers, however, we often lack the luxury of prior knowledge—** so, how can we ask them strong open-ended questions?
> 
> In such cases, blogger William Rudd suggests asking “what’s your story?” instead of the traditional “what do you do,” or “where are you from?” This question, he explains, gets your partner thinking: **It gives them the opportunity to shape their own narrative** —to share what’s important to them, what they value, and what they care about. In most cases, that means you’ll hear about more than just the job they don’t enjoy doing or the hometown they no longer identify with.
> 
> **Further, letting others tell you their story prevents you from jumping to conclusions** **about them.** You may assume, for instance, that Jack the car salesman from Kentucky doesn’t have much to offer you, a CEO from Europe. But if you give Jack a chance to tell his own story, you’re much more likely to be intrigued by him and his life. He may tell you about his wife, his children, and the chicken coop they built together last summer. And, just like that, you’ll have a lot more to ask about.

#### How to Follow Up on Cues With Additional Questions

Another way to keep conversations going is to follow up with additional open-ended questions. This is where Fine’s recommendation that you show interest in your partner’s answers yields fruit: **When you pay attention to their responses, you’ll notice interesting details you can use to deepen the conversation.**

You can choose follow-up questions based on any of the following:

**1\. Anything they’ve mentioned so far** —did anything about their previous answers intrigue or interest you? Did they seem particularly proud of anything they brought up? (Shortform note: In particular, dig into the things people mention that are _outside_ of their obligations. For instance, follow up on people’s hobbies, not their job. They’ll enjoy the conversation more if it’s focused on things they _want_ to do than things they _have_ to do.)

**2\. Things they’re wearing,** particularly those which denote group membership. (Shortform note: Why is this such a useful conversational tool? Because a person who wears a Rotary Club pin or a Seattle Seahawks cap to an event is usually doing so for a reason—they’re signaling a personal interest they like to think or talk about. When talking to younger people, keep an eye out for things like cell phone charms, keyrings, pins on their bag or jacket, or stickers on a water bottle.)

**3\. Their achievements, trophies, and ornaments** , especially those they display prominently. (Shortform note: This is particularly useful if you’re addressing someone whose achievements were recently announced (for instance, at a conference), but it’s just as helpful when you’re visiting someone’s home or office. People display what brings them happiness and pride—whether that’s a university diploma or a little figurine of a snail.)

**4\. The location or occasion.** (Shortform note: When all else fails, you can always ask someone what brings them here, who they know and how they met them, or how they’re feeling about the event.)

**5\. Their behavior, traits, or quirks**. (Shortform note: Fine suggests that the way someone speaks or writes can offer you opportunities for small talk—but be careful; it’s easy to offend someone this way. For example, don’t ask someone who seems to speak with a foreign accent “where are you really from?” Maybe they’re from the city you’re in and only picked up the accent from their parents.)

### Step 4: End the Conversation

Eventually, no matter how engaging a conversation is, the time comes to move on. Furthermore, occasionally, a conversation isn’t engaging or enjoyable, and you might want to leave swiftly. In this final step, we’ll explore how to gracefully exit a conversation without burning any bridges.

**When you know how to exit a conversation and leave a good impression, Fine explains, you’ll feel more comfortable and confident about starting one.**

(Shortform note: Comfort and preserving your reputation arguably aren’t the only, or even main, reasons to master the graceful exit. Kio Stark—who gave a TED talk on why you should talk to strangers—argues that in most cases, **the person who started the conversation is responsible for ending it.** When you start talking to someone, Stark explains, they assume you’re doing so for a reason—and politeness dictates they hang around until you’re satisfied. If you can’t or won’t end the conversation yourself, you force your partner to commit a faux-pas by breaking off before it’s clear that you’re done talking.)

#### How to Make Your Exit

Before you leave a conversation, Fine urges you to have a clear destination in mind and be honest about it. **Make it clear that the reason you need to leave is because there’s something you need to do.** For example, if your next goal is to get some food, speak to the event’s host, or make a call, courteously say so. When you’ve disengaged, do what you said you would: If your former conversational partner sees you doing something else, they’ll take it personally.

(Shortform note: Don’t worry if your reason for leaving isn’t very strong. Research shows that the word “because,” followed by a reason—even one that’s not compelling—leads to a much higher likelihood of acceptance of a situation. A Harvard psychologist, who had researchers try cutting in line to use the copy machine, discovered people were 34% more likely to allow the intrusion when the researchers said “because I need to make copies” than when they didn’t give a reason.)

Furthermore, Fine suggests that, when it’s time to leave, you thank your conversational partner for their expertise, their time, or the joy of conversing with them.**A genuine compliment or expression of gratitude leaves the other person feeling good about you and gives you an air of confidence and poise.**

For example, you might say: “Lydia, it’s been wonderful to talk to you about… I need to… Thanks for sharing your expertise,” or “it was so thoughtful of you to introduce me to Clifford. Thanks!”

(Shortform note: An additional important benefit of expressing gratitude at the end of a conversation is that it improves the likelihood of your conversational partner opting to stay connected with you long-term. Research shows that expressions of gratitude signal warmth, friendliness, and thoughtfulness—all of which contribute to a feeling in the recipient that the burgeoning relationship is worth investing in. For this reason, people you thank are more likely to give you their contact information or extend an invitation to spend time with them in future.)

Fine suggests that if you want to see the person again, you say so. Issue an invitation and don’t take it personally if you’re turned down.

(Shortform note: Fine doesn’t explain _how_ to extend an invitation, or when to do it—just that you should mention you’d like to. Keith Ferrazzi, author of _Never Eat Alone_ , gives more specific advice in this area: He suggests following up on an initial contact between 12 and 24 hours later. When you do, he says, thank the person for their time or help, remind them of a part of your conversation—a joke they made, or a topic you agreed on—and suggest you meet again. You don’t have to set a time or invite them to anything specific right away—just express that you _want_ to meet again, and let them know you’ll be in contact soon to discuss the details.)

> **Additional Escape Tools**
> 
> If you feel it’s time for a conversation to end, chances are, the feeling is mutual. It may just be that you both aren’t sure how to escape. With that said, sometimes you’ll just feel stuck with someone who’s content to talk forever. In either case, **the graceful exit is a reassuring technique to have in your tool belt.**
> 
> The following are additional exit techniques to take advantage of; whichever you use, be sure to express gratitude to end on a strong note:
> 
>   * **Be direct:** The next time there’s a pause in the conversation, smile and put out your hand. Say “well, it was nice talking to you.” It might be abrupt, but it’s a formula people are used to; the automatic response will likely be “you too,” and then you’re free to close out.
> 
>   * **Leverage “because”:** As Fine notes, “because” is a powerful tool—but it’s important you do what you say you’ll do. If you really can’t find a reason to leave, try a classic: “It was nice talking to you, but I need the restroom.”
> 
>   * **Give your partner an excuse to leave:** This technique lets you imply you feel you’ve taken enough of the other person’s time; you’re freeing _them_. Try: “I’ll let you get back to the party; it was nice talking to you!” Or: “Thanks for the chat; I’ll let you get another drink.”
> 
>   * **Find them a new partner:** If you see someone you know, especially a person who might enjoy your partner’s company, pull them into the fold. “Hey Steve, we were just talking about… What’s your opinion on that?” Once they get talking, you can make an excuse to slip away without leaving them all alone.
> 
>   * **Exchange social media:** Ask your partner if they’re on Facebook, LinkedIn, and so forth; in doing so, you imply you’re interested in looking them up and perhaps connecting again in future. It softens the blow of leaving and expands your network. In the worst case, you’re not obligated to follow up.
