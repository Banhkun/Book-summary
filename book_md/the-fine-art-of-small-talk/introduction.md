## Introduction: Get Started With Small Talk

**In _The Fine Art of Small Talk_ , Debra Fine explains the benefits of mastering small talk and teaches you to confidently converse with strangers.** She argues that if you’re not comfortable and confident in engaging in conversation, you’ll miss out on all manner of social, professional, and romantic connections. Further, mastering small talk can reduce your anxiety, boost your confidence, foster friendships, and enhance your leadership capabilities.

(Shortform note: In addition, avoiding small talk isolates you socially and emotionally, which leads to anxiety, fearfulness, and defensiveness. In contrast, making small talk with strangers and acquaintances fosters a sense of community belonging, which helps you feel comfortable and confident in the spaces you visit and inhabit.)

Fine is a once-inept conversationalist whose anxiety around conferences and industry meetings led her to make a serious effort to improve her conversation skills. In the years since, she’s started her titular business and has been teaching the Fine Art of Small Talk all around America.

In this chapter, we’ll explore why small talk is helpful generally and in your business relationships. We’ll also give a brief overview of a mindset that will benefit you as you practice small talk.

### Why Small Talk?

According to Fine, the opportunity for casual conversations crops up many times each day—with neighbors, kids, and coworkers, and at social events, business lunches, and even the local supermarket. When we avoid small talk, she explains, we minimize the number of deep conversations we get to have in these settings. **Furthermore, Fine says, we risk giving the impression that we’re cold, disinterested, or rude.**

(Shortform note: Fine's assertion that avoiding small talk can appear rude may seem a little unfair if you're shy: Shy people avoid conversation not because they're rude, but because they feel anxious or awkward. They want to connect, but they don't know how. Unfortunately, though, others may not realize that shyness fuels this behavior: They might just assume that you're rude or aloof. This is why it's so important for shy people who want to connect to get out of their comfort zones and try to overcome their shyness.)

#### Why Small Talk in Business?

According to the author,**small talk is especially important in business** for a number of reasons. First, engaging your customers in small talk shows them they’re doing business with a “real” person rather than a stilted salesperson. Second, if you’re good at small talk, you’ll make others feel included, valued, and comfortable. You’ll establish a rapport, and **customers will prefer doing business with you because they feel you’re warm, caring, and friendly.**

(Shortform note: Perhaps most importantly, small talk is valuable in dealing with customers because it fast-tracks your relationship to shared amiability. Researchers say small talk synchronizes the level of intimacy felt by each party and signals friendly intentions. In short, it’s a simple way to make others believe you’ll prioritize their comfort, safety, and—particularly critically in a customer relationship—their needs.)

Similarly, Fine notes that as a manager, bookending meetings with pleasant small talk allows you to more comfortably broach difficult subjects and end the meeting on a positive note. Your employees will feel much better receiving criticism if, through your small talk, they get the impression you care about _them_ as much as you care about their performance.

(Shortform note: Fine highlights the importance of managerial small talk in a business setting, but not all small talk is appropriate or helpful in this context. For example, your employees are likely to resent—rather than appreciate—hearing about your luxury vacation or your new expensive car. Indeed, the Harvard Business Review suggests that on a one on one basis, small talk between managers and employees is best focused on the employee’s career—his or her needs, goals, and opportunities.)

### Adopt a Proactive Practice Mindset

Clearly, small talk is a valuable tool—but what if it doesn’t come naturally to you? The good news, according to Fine, is that **anyone can learn to be a good conversationalist;** it’s just a matter of practice and mindset.

(Shortform note: When you want to learn or improve, your mindset—as Fine notes—affects how successful you can be. In particular, you’ll want to adopt a “growth mindset,” rather than a “fixed mindset.” When you hold a growth mindset, you remain open to improvement: You accept the belief that there’s no limit to how far learning and practice will take you. In contrast, those with a fixed mindset believe they’re limited to the traits, intelligence, and potential they were born with.)

According to Fine, taking the following principles to heart as you practice small talk will give you the best chance of improving:

**1\. If you want something, Fine says, go get it.** If your goal is to meet new people, don’t just stand around alone or talk to people you already know. Instead, actively approach strangers.

(Shortform note: Why is being proactive so important? Stephen Covey, author of _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , explains it’s because initiative is key to adopting new behaviors—it’s how we exert control over our circumstances. Covey might say that if you’re bad at small talk, it’s time to stop just letting small talk happen to you. Instead, accept that you’re having trouble, take responsibility for improving, and actively make an effort to change.)

**2\. According to Fine, it’s your job to start the conversation.** The second most common fear in America is of starting conversations, particularly with strangers. Because this fear is so common, you’re unlikely to face rejection if you initiate conversation—in fact, your conversational partner is likely to be relieved that you made the effort.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Fine’s claim, America’s most common fears change year-to-year based on the circumstances we’re dealing with—a fear of conversing with strangers doesn’t usually make the top 10. At the time of _The Fine Art_ ’s publication, for example, it was often claimed that Americans’ number one fear was of public speaking, though fears of terrorist attacks sometimes polled higher. In 2021, the most common fears were of political corruption, the death of a loved one, or of a loved one contracting the coronavirus.)

**3\. It’s as much _your_ job to carry the conversation as it is your partner’s, Fine notes.** When you leave the hard work of maintaining conversation to someone else, you selfishly put your comfort ahead of theirs. Conversation is a two-player game, and you need to participate equally.

(Shortform note: Fine’s point that you have to learn to carry your weight echoes a common complaint that she implies, but doesn’t openly state: that too many people refuse to hold up their end of a conversation. If you want to be a better conversationalist, you must be willing to take charge and set the direction. Aim to do so multiple times in every encounter, to ensure you’re practicing this skill.)

> **Strangers Aren’t the Only Use-Case for Conversation-Starting Skills**
> 
> You may think small talk is mainly for getting to know strangers whom you don’t know well enough to engage in _deep_ conversation. However, it can benefit you in many other situations, too. You can use it to:
> 
>   * Reignite a conversation that’s been interrupted or broken off
> 
>   * Reconnect with old friends or people you haven’t spoken to in a while
> 
>   * Advance a casual friendship to a deeper connection, or salvage one that’s fading away
> 
>   * Connect with friends of friends whose social circle you’d like to be a part of
> 
>   * Bring life and excitement to a gathering that’s become aimless or dull
> 
>   * Show those around you what’s interesting and valuable about having you around
