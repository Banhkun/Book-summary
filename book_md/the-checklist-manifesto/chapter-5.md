## Chapter 5: The WHO Checklist Project

In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) asked Gawande to organize a group to solve a problem: Surgery was increasing rapidly worldwide, but surgical patients were getting unsafe care so often that surgery was a public danger. WHO sought a global program that would reduce avoidable harm and deaths from surgery.

Data from 193 countries showed that the volume of surgery worldwide had skyrocketed by 2004. Surgeries exceeded totals for childbirth, but the death rate for surgery was ten to one hundred times higher than for childbirth. At least seven million people a year were disabled by surgery, and one million died.

The growth was due in part to improved economic conditions, which increased people’s longevity and therefore their need for surgeries. Health systems were greatly increasing the number of surgical procedures performed and the types of surgeries. There were more than 2,500 different surgical procedures. Safety and quality of care for surgical patients was becoming a big issue everywhere.

Surgery is often life-saving, even when performed under dire or substandard conditions. But failures leave millions disabled or dead. In the U.S. alone, when Gawande began the WHO project, at least half of surgical complications were preventable, and there were a variety of causes and contributing factors. He set out to find examples of public health interventions and campaigns that had succeeded. He found several examples, all of which shared three characteristics: **they were simple, their effects were measurable, and the benefits could be applied elsewhere**.

### Simple, Measurable, and Applicable Solutions

A U.S. public health worker in Pakistan came up with a way to reduce deaths, infections, and diseases among children in poor areas of Pakistan, with a high level of illiteracy, overcrowding, open sewers, and contaminated water.

The health worker provided soap donated by Proctor & Gamble along with **simple guidelines describing six situations in which people should use it and instructions on hand-washing techniques**. The soap was a behavior-change vehicle. People appreciated getting the free soap, even though some already had their own own soap. They also liked its scent and a significant number followed the instructions, which were basically a checklist. The incidence of diarrhea among children fell 52 percent. The incidence of pneumonia fell 48 percent and bacterial skin infections fell 35 percent.

The successful soap project was simple, measurable, and widely applicable.

#### Columbus Children’s Hospital

In 2005, Columbus Children’s Hospital developed a checklist to reduce surgical infections, one of the most common complications of surgery in children. A key to avoiding infections is giving an antibiotic within sixty minutes before the surgeon makes an incision. However, this step was often missed — the hospital’s records showed that a third of pediatric appendectomy patients didn’t get the antibiotic at the right time.

So the hospital’s director of surgical administration designed a checklist, which was put on a whiteboard in each operating room. It included a step to confirm that antibiotics had been given. The director, who was also an airplane pilot, called the program “Cleared for Takeoff.” A key feature was a metal “tent” labeled with the slogan, which the nurse placed over the scalpel when she laid out the surgical instruments. The surgeon couldn’t start until the nurse gave the OK and removed the tent.

**After three months of using the system, the surgical director found that 89 percent of appendicitis patients had received the antibiotic.** After ten months, 100 percent did — the checks instilled a performance standard.

#### University of Toronto

The University of Toronto performed a feasibilty study using a 21-item surgical checklist designed to catch a range of potential errors in surgical care. It combined task checks with communication points.

The surgical staff had to verbally confirm each item on the list — for instance, that an antibiotic had been given, that the right type of blood was available, and that test results were on hand. The checklist also incorporated a team briefing to talk about any risks or concerns as well as expectations (for example, how much blood loss was expected and what things to be prepared for).

Researchers monitored use of the checklist in eighteen operations. **In ten, it revealed significant problems or ambiguities** , including individual patient problems that a checklist wouldn’t typically catch.

#### Kaiser Hospitals

A study at a group of Kaiser hospitals in southern California further underscored the importance of communication and a sense of teamwork in surgery. The hospitals tested a thirty-item “surgery preflight checklist.”

The checklist included preventive steps for surgery’s three biggest killers — infection, bleeding, and unsafe anesthesia. However, a fourth killer — the unexpected — can’t be dealt with as readily with check boxes. So the program addressed it by setting up communication checkpoints. The checklist required surgical staff to stop and talk through the case together in order to be ready as a team to identify and address each patient’s unique concerns and risks.

This was unusual because, typically, surgery is treated as a one-person show. The operating room is referred to as a theater and functions as the surgeon’s stage. Surgeons like to think that surgical staff perform as a team, but often they really don’t. For instance, not all team members are aware of a given patient’s risks, problems they need to be ready for, or even why the surgeon is doing the operation. One survey of 300 staff members leaving the OR showed that one in eight weren’t sure where the incision would be until the operation started. This one-person-show approach makes it more difficult for staff to come together effectively in a crisis.

Checklists requiring communication also address another problem with surgery — “silent disengagement.” This is the tendency of each person to focus on a specialized task, sticking to their own area of expertise while not questioning what anyone else is doing or paying attention to the big picture. To avoid failures in surgery, staff members need to see their job not just as performing specialized tasks, but also as helping the group get the best possible results. This requires working as a team to address problems that arise and to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

**Kaiser’s checklist insisted that people talk together, which fostered teamwork.** It also required staff members to introduce themselves with their name and role, ensuring all team members knew each other’s names. Studies in various fields have shown that people who don’t know each other’s names don’t work as well together as those who do.

Further, research at Johns Hopkins showed that when nurses were given a chance at the beginning of a procedure to state their names and concerns, they were more likely to note problems during surgery and offer solutions. The researchers referred to this as the “activation phenomenon” because giving people a chance to speak early on activated a sense of responsibility and willingness to speak up.

##### Results

Kaiser hospitals tested the checklist for six months in 3,500 operations. It caught numerous near errors, including almost doing the wrong procedure in one case. In addition, the rating by surgical staff of the teamwork climate improved from good to outstanding. Employee satisfaction rose and OR nurse turnover dropped.

None of these studies were proof that a checklist could be devised that would be effective and versatile enough to improve surgery outcomes around the world, but they provided a starting point for further exploration. Gawande and his team began drafting a potential surgical checklist, but soon realized they needed more information on what makes an effective checklist.
