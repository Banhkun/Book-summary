## Chapter 6: Creating an Effective Checklist

**While it should be simple to use, developing an effective checklist isn’t a simple task. It requires analysis, real-world testing, and revision.**

Daniel Boorman, flight desk designer for Boeing, is an expert at developing checklists. He’s analyzed thousands of crashes and mishaps in an effort to figure out how to create checklists that prevent human errors.

Boorman’s checklists for Boeing aircraft fill a thick spiral-bound handbook with tabs. Yet each checklist is brief, consisting of a few lines on a page in large, easy-to-read type. Each applies to a different situation; together they encompass a range of scenarios. At the beginning of the notebook are what pilots call “normal” checklists for routine operations — for instance, steps to take before starting the engines. They’re followed by “non-normal” checklists for emergency situations such as engine failure, smoke in the cockpit, or an insecure door.

Over two decades, Boorman has learned how to make checklists that work. There are key differences between bad and good checklists.

Bad checklists are:

  * Unclear and imprecise.
  * Too long, impractical, and difficult to use.
  * Created by pencil pushers who lack experience doing what their checklists dictate.
  * Overly detailed. They try to spell out every single step, as if the users are clueless.
  * Mind-numbing, rather than engaging.



Good checklists:

  * Are precise, efficient, concise, practical, and easy to use even in the most difficult circumstances.
  * Don’t try to spell out everything. They provide reminders of only the most important steps that even an experienced professional could miss.



### How to Create a Checklist

(Shortform note: also see the Appendix: A Checklist for Checklists.)

Before creating a checklist, decide two things:

1) **Define a clear ‘“pause point”** at which the checklist is to be used (unless the moment is obvious, such as when something malfunctions).

2) **Decide whether to create a Do-Confirm list or a Read-Do list.**

To use a Do-Confirm checklist, team members perform their jobs from memory. Then they stop and go through the checklist and confirm that they completed every item on the checklist. In contrast, to use a Read-Do checklist, people carry out each task as they check it off, like a recipe.

(Shortform note: Choose the type of checklist that makes the most sense for the situation. For instance, a Read-Do list could be used when the sequence needs to be exact or the entire effort will fail, like in operating machinery or listing emergency tasks. A Do-Confirm list gives more freedom and is allowable when the stakes are lower, and a forgotten step can be done later out of sequence.)

Once you’ve chosen which type of checklist you’re creating, follow these guidelines:

  * **Keep the checklist short, typically five to nine items** , which is the limit of short-term memory. After 60 to 90 seconds, a checklist becomes a distraction from other things. People are likely to skip or miss steps. 
  * **Focus on the “killer” items** or steps that are most dangerous to miss but that are still sometimes overlooked. 
  * Remember that checklists are not supposed to be how-to guides. They are quick, simple tools to aid the recall of experts.
  * Keep wording simple and exact.
  * Use language and terminology familiar to the user. 
  * Fit the checklist on one page.
  * Avoid clutter and unnecessary or distracting colors. 
  * Use upper and lowercase text in a sans serif font for ease of reading. 



**Test your checklist in the real world** — have people use it and provide feedback. Boorman tests his checklists in a flight simulator. Language that you think is clear may not be to someone else. In practice, things are always more complicated than anticipated. Keep revisiting and testing the checklist until it works consistently.

### Why Pilots Trust Checklists

Some of the most effective checklists come from the world of aviation. Pilots readily turn to checklists because they’re trained to do so, from the beginning of flight school. They know their memory and judgment are fallible, and that lives depend on their recognizing that fact.

They also know that checklists have proven their worth and don’t hesitate to turn to them in emergencies. For example, pilots turned to a checklist and saved lives in 1989 when a forward cargo door blew out on a flight from Honolulu to New Zealand, and flying debris damaged a wing and two engines. In under two seconds, nine passengers were sucked from the plane and lost at sea.

The pilots didn’t know what had happened — they thought a bomb had gone off — but they knew cabin pressure and oxygen had dropped. Voice recordings show that they immediately turned to a checklist. Following protocol, they reduced altitude, shut down the two damaged engines, tested the plane’s ability to land with wing damage, dumped fuel to lighten their load, and safely returned to Honolulu with 328 remaining passengers and 18 crew members.

As another example, in 2008, the engines gave out on a British Airways flight from China when it was only two miles from London Heathrow Airport. The pilots crash-landed the Boeing 777 at 124 miles per hour in a grassy field a quarter-mile short of the runway, but everyone survived.

The cause wasn’t provable, but investigators theorized that ice crystals had formed in the fuel lines as the plane flew over extremely cold regions. Boorman’s Boeing team created a checklist of new procedures for dealing with a fuel blockage caused by ice crystals, and within a month it was in the hands of pilots and in cockpit computers.

Later that same year, it was put into action, when a Delta flight from Shanghai to Atlanta had engine failure over Great Falls, Montana, due to ice in the fuel lines. Pilots followed their checklist, slowing instead of revving the engine to give it time to recover, and 247 people were saved.

#### A Lesson for Medicine

While Boorman and his team at Boeing quickly got new information into a useful form and out to the people who needed it, the field of medicine is notoriously slow to put new information into action.

A study following nine new treatment discoveries showed that on average it took doctors 17 years to adopt new treatments for at least half of American patients. When it comes to errors, medical professionals don’t typically conduct investigations the way aviation investigators do. And even if they do investigate a failure and learn something, they might issue voluminous guidelines unlikely to be read, make an addition to a textbook, or mention the new information in a seminar.

The knowledge basically doesn’t get out because it hasn’t been put into a simple, usable form and distributed systematically. The world of medicine is in need of effective checklists.
