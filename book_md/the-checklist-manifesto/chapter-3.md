## Chapter 3: From Simple to Complex

The successful experiences of using checklists in aviation decades ago suggest they could be applied widely. They protect even the most experienced from making mistakes in a whole range of tasks. **They provide a mental safety net against typical human lapses in memory, focus, and attention to detail.**

Professors Brenda Zimmerman and Sholom Glouberman, who study complexity, defined three kinds of problems: simple, complicated, and complex.

  * **Simple:** An example of a simple problem is baking a cake from a mix — there’s a recipe and a few techniques, but once you’ve learned them, following the recipe usually works. 
  * **Complicated** : An example of a complicated problem is sending a rocket to the moon. Complicated problems can be broken down into smaller problems. Solving the problem involves many people, teams, and specialists. Unexpected issues pop up, but you can learn, repeat the process, and perfect it. Timing and coordination are key. 
  * **Complex** : An example of a complex problem is raising a child. Every child is unique. You learn from raising one child, but the next child may require a different approach. With complex problems like raising a child, the outcome is uncertain. Yet it’s possible to raise a child successfully.



In classifying the three problems described so far in this book — the bomber crash of 1935, the issue of central line infections, and the rescue of a drowning victim — the key problem and solution in each case were simple:

  * To avoid crashing the bomber, focus on the rudder and elevator controls.
  * To reduce central line infections, maintain sterility.
  * To saving a drowning victim, be ready to perform a cardiac bypass



All could be resolved by using a simple tool to compel the needed behavior — a checklist. We’re constantly confronted with similar simple problems that can be mitigated by checklists — for instance, a nurse’s failure to wear a mask while putting in a central line or a surgeon’s failure to recall that one cause of a cardiac arrest could be a potassium overdose.

But can checklists be used to address complicated or complex problems, such as ICU work, where there are many tasks performed by multiple people, dealing with individual patients with individual and complex problems? Medicine encompasses all three types of problems — simple, complicated, and complex. It’s important to get basic things right, while allowing skill, judgment, and ability to react to the unexpected.

The medical profession could learn from the construction industry, which handles the design and construction of huge and complicated structures with the help of sophisticated checklists addressing the full range of problems.

### Demise of the Master Builder

People used to hire master builders, who designed, engineered, and oversaw the construction of large and small projects from start to finish. For instance, master builders built Notre Dame and the U.S. Capitol building.

However, by the mid-20th-century **master builders became obsolete because one person alone couldn’t master the advances occurring at every stage of the construction process**. Architectural design and engineering design became separate specialties. Other specialties and subspecialties developed. Builders split further into areas of expertise such as finish carpenters and tower crane operators. Major projects now involve 16 different trades and hundreds of workers who must do their jobs in coordination with others.

The construction process is orchestrated using sophisticated schedules and checkpoints that enforce roles, communication, and follow-through. The major advance in the industry over the last few decades has been perfecting this process of tracking and communication.

**To manage increased complexity, the entire construction industry was forced to evolve.** However, much of medicine is still structured like the master-builder era — with a lone physician executing all of a patient’s care — even though times have changed to the extent that a third of patients have at least 10 doctors involved in their care by the last year of their life. As a result, care can be uncoordinated and subject to error.

In construction, failure isn’t an option. Massive structures must stand up straight and withstand all kinds of pressures and potential disasters such as fires and earthquakes.

#### The Rise of the Construction Checklist

To see how this works, the author visited the Russian Wharf project in Boston while it was under construction in 2006. The project, completed in 2011, consisted of a high-rise, glass-and-steel waterfront building that incorporated commercial and residential space while retaining historic aspects of the original building on the site.

The nerve center for the project was a room where the construction schedule, essentially a huge checklist, was posted on the wall. This consisted of multiple, large sheets of paper containing numerous computer-created, color-coded lists. They listed every task by order and date — for instance concrete pouring and steel delivery for each story were scheduled at certain times. As each task was completed, the project executive noted it on the schedule and printed out the next phase of work. The construction schedule was designed to build the project in layers, using day-by-day checks to ensure that the knowledge and skills of hundreds of people were correctly applied at the right time and place.

_(Shortform example: above, an example construction schedule.)_

A second type of schedule, called a submittal schedule, specified when people were to communicate, about what, and with whom. The submittal schedule dictated that various experts speak to each other on specific dates regarding progress in specific areas, as well as who needed to share, or submit, information before the next steps could proceed.

Besides maintaining communication, the submittal schedule was a means of handling unexpected developments. Experts could make judgments, but they had to discuss problems with a team, taking others’ concerns into account and agreeing on what to do.

![checklist-manifesto-submittal-schedule.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/checklist-manifesto-submittal-schedule.jpg)

_(Shortform example: above, an example submittal schedule.)_

The submittal schedule operated on the assumption that if you got the right people talking to each other, problems could be averted or addressed. **To deal with the unexpected, the builders relied on communication and group knowledge, rather than the expertise of an individual.**

#### Success Built on Communication

The reason for the construction industry’s emphasis on communication is that failure to communicate is the most common reason for major building errors.

For example, there was a serious communication oversight in the construction of the Citicorp building, now called The Citigroup Center, in Manhattan. It features an unusual design — a slanted top and a nine-story stilt-style base. During its construction in the 1970s, the welding contractor building the base changed specifications without consulting the architects — the contractor switched from making welded joints to less-strong bolted joints, which could have failed and caused the building to collapse in 75 mile-per-hour winds.

The architect discovered the change in 1978, a year after the building opened, when he reviewed the plans in response to a question from a Princeton engineering student. He informed the building’s owners and not long afterward, Hurricane Ella began moving up the coast toward the city. An emergency crew worked secretly at night to weld two-inch-thick steel plates around two hundred bolts to successfully secure the building.

While the construction industry’s checklist process hasn’t been perfect, it’s been amazingly successful. Building failures are extremely unusual. And although buildings are more complex than ever, and are built to higher standards for such things as earthquakes and energy efficiency, they take a third less time to build.
