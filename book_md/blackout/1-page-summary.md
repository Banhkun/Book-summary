## 1-Page Summary

Candace Owens is rallying the troops—she sees the Democratic Party as modern-day slavery and is calling on all Black Americans to walk out in a mass exodus. In _Blackout,_ Owens gives the history of Black politics, reveals hidden oppressions, and demonstrates how the Democratic Party has been keeping Blacks poor and needy for their own political gain. Specifically, Owens claims that Democratic policies have destroyed the nuclear family, created government dependency, and encouraged Blacks to embody victim mentalities. The only way out, Owens says, is to jump ship and join the Republicans.

Candace Owens is a conservative author, activist, political commentator, and talk show host. A millennial Black American woman, Owens is best known for being an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump. During his presidency, she frequently made headlines for her far-right views that opposed many of the social movements of the time. Specifically, she proclaimed her disdain for and distrust of the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements. During the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Owens declared herself anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination, a stance that she still holds today. More recently, Owens has taken aim against transgender rights (in this book she says she _does_ support gay marriage).

Owens was left-leaning until 2017, when at the age of 28, she had a shift in perspective and became one of Trump’s most vocal supporters. In 2018, Kanye West tweeted, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks,” and her popularity with the far-right Republican Party skyrocketed.

_Blackout _was published in September of 2020, just before the presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It __ was a _New York Times_ best seller and has sold nearly half a million copies to date. Despite Owen’s controversial public image, the book has received primarily favorable reviews from readers of both political persuasions, with many claiming that Owen’s points are well-researched and well-argued. Critics say that Owens uses extreme examples to disparage leftist politics, which doesn’t fairly represent the Democratic Party.

Our guide is organized into three parts:

  * Part 1: The History of Black Americans and the Democratic Party
  * Part 2: Manipulation of the Black Vote
  * Part 3: Systematic Destruction—How the Democratic Party Is Destroying Black Life



Our guide explores each of Owens’s arguments in turn and compares them to the most recent statistics and opinions of experts on both sides of the political aisle.

(Shortform note: In _Blackout_ , Owens doesn’t capitalize the ‘b’ in “black” or the ‘w’ in “white.” In keeping with the 2020 amended style guide of the Associated Press, we’ve chosen to capitalize Black but not white. It’s worth noting that Owens would likely disagree with this choice and we can infer that she would argue against the symbolic lifting of one race over the other. The topic continues to be debated, with some arguing that capitalizing the word black is more about virtue signaling than racial equality.)

### Part 1: The History of Black Americans and the Democratic Party

Owens’s primary argument in _Blackout_ is that for Blacks to thrive in America, they _must_ depart from the Democratic Party. But how and why did the majority of Blacks become Democrats in the first place? To explain, Owens takes us through the history of Black oppression in America: from slavery and segregation at the hands of Democrats to Black Americans’ eventual Democratic allegiance.

#### Myths About Slavery

Before we can understand the political progression of Black Americans, Owens says we need to fully understand how Black Africans came to _be_ in America, which means we need to examine the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to the 19th centuries. While Owens doesn’t deny that the slave trade itself was horrific, she argues that there are several myths about the slave trade that affect current political policy—especially reparations. She insists that if we have an accurate understanding of slavery, we wouldn’t support the Democratic push for reparations.

(Shortform note: Reparations are a compensatory form of restitution from the federal government to living descendants of former slaves. The push for and against reparations has been around for decades and continues to this day. Proponents of reparations argue that they are a way to atone for slavery and the oppression that followed. They also believe it will help boost the economic welfare of current and future generations of Black Americans. Opponents disagree with reparations on two grounds: moral and financial. In general, they believe that because living Black Americans were never slaves, and living white Americans were never slave owners, it’s not the latter’s obligation to repay the former—especially if it requires a federal tax increase.)

**The myth: Slavery began in America with white men.**

Owens says that most American children are taught in school that slavery began with colonial white men in America, and that this belief feeds the toxic narrative that white men are historically evil and should forever owe a debt because of it.

**The truth:** **Slavery has existed everywhere in the world since humanity began**. According to Owens, even Native Americans practiced slavery centuries before white Europeans arrived on the continent. Owens calls out the double standard that slavery is forgiven if it was brown-skinned people enslaving other brown-skinned people, or brown-skinned people enslaving white-skinned people—but that we continue to punish white people for doing the exact same thing.

(Shortform note: African slaves were first brought to the British colonies in America in 1619, about a hundred years after the trans-Atlantic slave trade began. By the time the slave trade ended in the late 1800s, around 12 million Africans had been uprooted. Of all the countries that imported slaves, the U.S. took in the fewest—around 300,000 slaves were taken to mainland North America, one million went to Spain, three million went to Great Britain, and nearly six million went to Brazil. These numbers support Owens’s argument that white Americans were neither the first nor the largest participants in slavery, but critics would argue that this defense is a form of “whataboutism”—a logical fallacy that deflects responsibility by pointing to a seemingly worse offense committed by someone else.)

**The myth: Africans who were taken in the slave trade were living wealthy and sometimes regal lives before they were snatched and chained by Americans.**

Owens says that it’s a common perception that today’s Black Americans suffer economically because they’ve spent generations trying to climb their way back up to the comfortable, or even prosperous, lifestyle that their African ancestors once enjoyed in the motherland.

**The truth: The descendants of slaves are better off now than if their ancestors had stayed in Africa.**

Owens says that wealthy Africans were not the ones being sold into the slave trade. Rather, commoners were sold into slavery by other Africans in exchange for basic necessities. Not only were the slaves not well-off to begin with, she says, but Africans _today_ are still enslaved, while American Blacks have their freedom. According to Owens, there are close to 700,000 slaves in Africa today. In fact, along Lake Volta in Ghana, 20,000 children are enslaved by their own people. Activist Colin Kaepernick visited this country in protest of America’s Independence Day in 2017, which Owens says is hypocrisy at its finest.

(Shortform note: The argument that descendants of slaves have better lives _now_ for having been brought to America inspires debate over the Machiavellian principle of “the ends justifying the means.” In this philosophical viewpoint, a positive end result outweighs any negative methods used to achieve it. In other words, we can forgive slavery if it ultimately achieved a better life for those who descended from it. The “end” is rarely defined, however, so to use this argument would be to judge actions and results based solely on present-day conditions, which are ever-changing.)

**The myth: Republicans owned slaves.**

Owens says that people who are the most ignorant of history still believe that Republicans are racist against Blacks and were the ones who owned slaves.

**The truth: It was Southern Democrats who owned slaves.**

Just before the Civil War, about four million Blacks were enslaved to Democrats. Their reason for owning slaves was based purely on greed—African slaves were free labor for Southern plantations. Furthermore, to keep the slaves from uniting and rebelling, and therefore ensuring the continuation of free labor, Democrats dissolved family units and deprived slaves of education. These are two tactics that Owens says Democrats continue to use on Black Americans today, as we’ll see later in the guide.

> **The Democrat-Republican Party Switch**
> 
> Owens uses references to the Democratic Party and Republican Party as touchstones throughout this text. However, when interpreting a political party’s values, it’s important to consider each party’s ideologies at _different points in time_ rather than rely on their names alone. Party names and values, including their level of conservatism or liberalism, have continuously morphed throughout history, and the Democratic and Republican parties are no exception.
> 
> In what’s known as the “Great Party Switch,” many of the ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties reversed beginning in the early 1900s and peaking during the Civil Rights Movement. The most dramatic reversal in voting patterns happened during the 1963 presidential election between Barry Goldwater (a Republican) and Lyndon B. Johnson (a Democrat). Johnson was in favor of the Civil Rights Act and Goldwater was against it. Southern Democrats were so against the Civil Rights Act that they turned their loyalties over to the Republican Party, and for the same reason, Black Americans cemented their support for the Democratic Party.
> 
> So while Southern Democrats were the slave-owning party, this same population (a few generations removed) became the Republicans who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

#### Reconstruction and the KKK

After the abolition of slavery in 1865, Black Americans faced two new forms of oppression: segregation and violence. According to Owens, both of these were at the hands of Democrats. She argues that because Democrats couldn’t legally enslave Black people anymore, they did their best to politically and socially enslave them through the use of Jim Crow laws and violence from terrorist groups.

Although they weren’t given the Constitutional right to vote until 1870, many former (male) slaves were allowed to vote by their states earlier than this, and the vast majority pledged their allegiance to the Republican Party out of loyalty to their emancipator, Abraham Lincoln. At the time, Lincoln’s Vice President, Andrew Johnson (a Democrat), had assumed the presidency and wasn’t doing much to further the rights of newly freed slaves. In response, Black voters contributed in large part to the 1868 election of Republican President Ulysses S. Grant. Grant ushered in the era of Reconstruction (1865-1877)—a time period in which former slaves were given additional rights and new relationships were defined between whites and Blacks.

As Owens explains, various groups of Southern Democrats were still angry about losing the Civil War and their free labor, and they rebelled against Reconstructionist policies—often violently. The most notorious of these rebellions was the formation of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a secretive and violent hate group that was composed of white Southern Democrats. This terrorist group went on to lynch over 3,000 Black Republicans and over 1,200 white Republicans.

> **The Rise and Fall of the KKK**
> 
> The Ku Klux Klan was founded during Reconstruction in 1865 in resistance to the abolition of slavery. By 1870, the Klan had factions in almost every Southern state. While the vast majority of Southerners opposed abolition because they benefited financially from slavery, the KKK believed in total white supremacy. In their hatred, they were willing to commit targeted lynchings, bombings, and burnings.
> 
> Owens doesn’t specify when the lynchings reached the numbers that she cites, but a recent report states that at least 2,000 known lynchings of Black Americans took place during Reconstruction alone, and that between 1865 and 1950, the lynchings approached 6,500.
> 
> During Reconstruction, local governments were either unwilling or unable to stop the KKK, so the federal (Republican) government took action. They passed the Force Bill in 1871, which gave federal courts the power to prosecute the Klan. Though it didn’t result in many arrests, the violence subsided almost entirely by 1876.
> 
> The KKK’s membership had a resurgence during Prohibition and peaked in the 1920s, with over 4 million Klansmen nationwide. At this time, their target was not Black Americans, but Catholic immigrants. Because of the secrecy of the organization, it’s difficult to know precisely how many Klansmen exist today, but in 2016, experts estimated that membership was between 3,000 and 6,000.

#### Segregation

In addition to the risk of lynching, Blacks endured segregation due to local regulations that became known as “Jim Crow laws.” Beginning in the late 1870s, the South enacted local and state policies designed to suppress the Black vote and keep them segregated from whites in almost all facets of life. Schools, hospitals, workplaces, transportation—even public restrooms and drinking fountains—all had separate spaces for each race. And not only were Blacks kept separate from whites, but their facilities were also of lower quality. Owens argues that these were Democratic policies designed to keep Blacks “enslaved” while a Republican federal government worked to increase their freedoms.

(Shortform note: Desegregation was a process that spanned more than 20 years. In 1948, President Truman (Democrat) ended segregation in the military. Six years later, segregation was ruled unconstitutional in the Supreme Court Case _Brown vs. Board of Education_. Though it was outlawed, segregation did continue in many Southern schools for more than a decade afterward, and the federal government had to step in to enforce integration. In 1961, some bus terminals began to desegregate. And in 1964, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting, employment, and in the use of public facilities.)

#### A New Democratic Allegiance

Following abolition, former slaves were firmly rooted in the Republican Party. But today, 87% of Black voters are registered Democrats. Owens argues that even before the Civil Rights Act cemented their loyalty, Democrats _bought_ Black Americans’ votes with the New Deal.

##### FDR and the New Deal

In 1933, during the midst of the Great Depression, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) made a promise that persuaded Black voters to go Democrat—he promised financial stability for _all_ Americans who were willing to work. Owens says that Black voters had nothing to lose, as nearly everyone in America was struggling financially and looking for any kind of relief. It worked, and FDR was re-elected for three more terms. His “New Deal” that followed was a series of programs and agencies aimed at restoring financial stability to the country, part of which was establishing a minimum wage.

(Shortform note: The 1936 election between FDR and Republican candidate Alf Landon was a landslide victory, in no small part to the 71% of Black voters who decided to vote Democrat. His New Deal was seen as an early success: Between FDR’s first election in 1932 and his re-election in 1936, unemployment rates as a whole dropped from 24.9% to 16.9%.)

Owens explains that the enactment of a minimum wage counterintuitively _hurt_ Black employment. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) enacted several policies, including a minimum wage, that effectively barred Black workers from employment. For example, power was given to unions that arbitrarily refused Black workers, and skill mandates for minimum wages kept Black workers from being hired even by companies who were willing to have them.

(Shortform note: Owens doesn’t mention the NRA’s institution of a separate and lower wage scale for Black workers. Discussed in a 1933 editorial, the minimum wage was set at $13.50 per week. The NRA approved a $9 a week minimum wage for “colored workers.” They argued that this was an equitable adjustment because the cost of living for Black Americans was lower than that of their white counterparts. Whether a wage scale is more or less discriminatory than the prohibitive minimum wage is up for debate.)

To help boost the economy through inflation, FDR enacted the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid subsidies to farmers in exchange for limiting production of certain crops. The idea was to avoid overproduction so that crop prices could rise, which would be good for farmers. Owens says that this was another Democratic policy that helped white Americans while hurting Black Americans. The farms were owned by white people, who benefited financially from this arrangement. The _workers_ were often Black people, who were laid off in mass numbers because of the decline in production. (Shortform note: In 1934 and 1935 alone, over 100,000 Black sharecroppers and tenant farmers were laid off from agricultural work.)

Owens says that because of these New Deal programs, among others, 1930 was the final year that Black Americans had lower unemployment rates than white Americans. (Shortform note: In 2022, Blacks had the highest unemployment rate among the racial demographics, at 5.7%. For comparison, whites were at 3%, Asians were at 2.4%, and Hispanics were at 4.1%.)

Even though the New Deal caused Black Americans to be worse off than before, they continued to re-elect FDR. Owens says that a big reason for this was FDR’s wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. Eleanor had become the face of the Democratic Party and was genuinely concerned about Black rights. For example, she pushed for anti-lynching legislation (a bill that FDR ultimately failed to support) and was instrumental in forming the black cabinet, a group of Black Americans who advised the administration on issues that affected their community. Owens says that Black voters _perceived_ the administration to be pro-Black, even though FDR actively protected discriminatory policies, in fear of losing his white Southern constituents. Owens argues that this was the Democrats’ first major manipulation of the Black vote.

(Shortform note: Owens implies that during FDR’s presidency, Black constituents blindly followed a red herring. But according to letters that were sent by the thousands to FDR during the Great Depression, Black Americans _were_ aware of discrimination in the distribution of relief supplies. They called on FDR and Eleanor to ensure that they would be treated humanely and would receive their fair share.)

### Part 2: Manipulation of the Black Vote

Now that we’ve covered the historical basis for Black Americans’ political leanings, we’ll begin exploring Owens’s primary thesis: **Participation in the Democratic Party is modern slavery, and to be free and successful, Black Americans must escape.** The rest of this guide covers all of the ways that the Democratic Party manipulates, shackles, and damages the Black population. With each principle we cover, Owens urges you to keep in mind that wherever there is manipulation, there is someone profiting. In this case, she says that Black allegiance to the Democratic Party benefits four groups of people:

  * Democrat politicians
  * Mainstream media
  * Guilty whites
  * Irresponsible Blacks



#### Democrat Politicians

It likely comes as no surprise that Black loyalty to the Democratic Party greatly benefits the politicians themselves. What might be surprising, however, is how reliant Democrats are on the Black vote. Owens points out that the Black population tends to be much more aligned in their voting patterns than other races, and they generally make up 10-12% of the total voting population. Because of this, the Democratic Party virtually can’t win without them.

For example, Barack Obama received 93% of the Black vote in 2012 and Blacks made up 12.9% of the total votes. This means that 12% of the total votes in the election were from Blacks and for Obama. He won the popular vote by 3.9%, so if his opponent (Mitt Romney) had had the Black vote instead, Obama would have lost—by a lot.

Owens says that even Hillary Clinton, who alienated Black voters with her cringy pandering and phony attempts to relate to them, received 87% of the Black vote in her 2016 presidential election. This is how united the Black voting population is—and it explains why the Democratic Party will _say_ just about anything to keep their loyalty. _Doing_ , on the other hand, is another story.

> **Voter Alignment Across Demographics**
> 
> Owens says that Black Americans are more united in their voting patterns than other races. For context, let’s examine the alignment rates of a few other key demographics in the 2020 presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden:
> 
> **Women:** 57% voted for Biden and 42% voted for Trump.
> 
> **Men:** 45% voted for Biden and 53% voted for Trump.
> 
> **Hispanic voters:** 65% voted for Biden and 32% voted for Trump.
> 
> **Asian voters:** 61% voted for Biden and 34% voted for Trump.
> 
> **White voters:** 41% voted for Biden and 58% voted for Trump.
> 
> **Black voters:** 87% voted for Biden and 12% voted for Trump.
> 
> Within the scope of this election, Black voters were far and away the most aligned and white voters were the most divided, which supports Owens’s notion that having the Black vote is a powerful possession.

#### The Mainstream Media

In addition to politicians, Owens says that the mainstream media benefits financially from a liberal fanbase, in large part because the owners are primarily left-leaning themselves. The more Democrats there are, the more viewers the program receives, which contributes directly to the wealth of the (mostly) Democratic owners. According to Owens, the media deepens and expands its Democratic reach primarily by broadcasting stories that demonstrate white-on-Black racism.

Owens argues that **the media’s continued coverage and exaggeration of racism perpetuates fear, which ensures the audience’s rapt attention.**

This is particularly evident in the media’s coverage of the Black Lives Matter Movement. Owens says that the media latches onto stories of white cops killing Black men because it receives an intense response and fills the 24-hour news cycle, but that the narrative is intentionally misleading. She says that when you look at the actual numbers, white cops are in far more danger of being killed than Black men are. In fact, police are 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a Black male than an unarmed Black man is to be killed by a cop.

(Shortform note: In addition to mainstream media, social media plays a large part in the perception of major social issues. According to a 2020 Pew Research survey, 23% of adult social media users have admitted that social media influenced their viewpoint on a social or political issue. When respondents were asked which particular issues came to mind, police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement were most commonly cited.)

##### On Media Bias

Owens makes two other significant points about the mainstream media: First, she says that they hypocritically vilify conservative figures and hold up liberal ones, which demonstrates extreme bias. For example, she points out that the media repeatedly lambasted former President Trump for his Diet Coke vice, yet never commented on Obama’s smoking habit.

Second, she says that liberal news outlets exploit real tragedies by hijacking the given story and using it to push a political agenda. For example, when a school shooting happens, rather than focusing entirely on the events, the victims, and the healing, the media outlet will quickly pivot their stories to the issue of gun control. Owens argues that this tactic is manipulative and heartless.

> **The Politics Behind Mainstream Media**
> 
> Owens exhibits a significant distrust of what she considers to be the “liberal mainstream media,” specifically calling out ABC, CNN, and NBC. According to PEW Research, the top five news outlets are (in order) as follows: ABC News, CNN, New York Times, MSNBC, and Fox News. In the name of transparency, we’ll examine the politics of who is currently in charge of each company.
> 
>   * **ABC News** is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and its CEO recently transitioned from Bob Iger, an outspoken Democrat, to politically-ambiguous Bob Chapek.
> 
>   * **CNN** is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery, whose CEO is currently David Zaslav. Zaslav took the position of CEO in 2022 and publicly declared that he wishes to return CNN to a more neutral political stance. Rumors have swirled about Zaslav being a staunch Republican and supporter of Donald Trump, but his political contributions indicate that he is a Democrat. ****
> 
>   * **_New York Times_ **is owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, and the current publisher is A.G. Sulzberger. His personal politics have been kept under wraps. A media bias website rates the publication as left leaning.
> 
>   * **MSNBC** is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal. The CEO is Jeff Shell, and his political contributions indicate that he is a Democrat.
> 
>   * **Fox News** is owned by Fox Corporation and chaired by Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch is an Australian-born American citizen and a Republican, although he recently publicly rescinded his support for Donald Trump. Murdoch also owns the _New York Post_ and the _Wall Street Journal._
> 
> 

> 
> **The Escalating Distrust of Media**
> 
> According to the Gallup polling organization, America’s trust in the media’s news coverage as complete and accurate reached an all-time low in 2016 and has barely risen since. Only 7% of Americans have “a great deal of trust” in the media, and 38% have none at all. It’s worth noting that there’s a partisan divide—57% of Republicans claim to have “no trust at all” in the media, compared with 10% of Democrats.
> 
> The primary reasons that Americans do not currently trust media news reports include:
> 
>   * Inaccurate information
> 
>   * “Fake news” or “alternative facts” (two terms coined by Donald Trump)
> 
>   * Sensationalism and “click bait” type stories
> 
> 


#### The Benefit for Whites & Blacks

As mentioned, Owens says that the Democratic Party upholds a narrative of good guys versus bad, which benefits two types of people: whites who feel guilty for having privilege, and Blacks who don’t want to take responsibility for their own situations.

According to Owens, **white liberals have a hero complex**. They feel good when they’re helping others that they perceive to be beneath them. She says that as long as the liberal narrative holds Blacks up as victims, there will be white people who rush in to “save” them, and it’s purely for their own self-esteem or to alleviate subconscious guilt for their inherent privileges. (Shortform note: It’s theorized that “white guilt” began in the 1960s following the Civil Rights Movement, not as true guilt over the plight of Black Americans, but out of a desperation to prove to themselves and others that they aren’t racist. A recent term for this is “virtue signaling.”)

Irresponsible Black people, on the other hand, also benefit from the Democratic narrative. Owens argues that **Blacks who find themselves stuck in poverty, ignorance, or addiction would rather blame an external evil than analyze their own choices** and limiting beliefs. When they buy into the Democratic story, they’re relieved of the responsibility for the outcome of their own lives.

> **Bootstrap Politics**
> 
> Owens says that Black Democrats shirk responsibility for their station in life, preferring instead to blame systemic racism for their problems. A Republican ideology that reflects Owens’s stance on personal responsibility is “bootstrap politics.” It’s a term based off of the old adage instructing you to “pull yourself up by your bootstraps.” In other words, with hard work, dedication, and self-reliance, you can climb from the bottom of the socio-economic ladder to the top and achieve the American dream.
> 
> According to _Time_ magazine, however, the bootstrap model is a myth. While it’s an inspiring thought that one can rise from poverty to extreme wealth, the likelihood of it happening is very slim. According to statistics, those who are on the lowest rung of the ladder and the highest are the least likely to change positions from generation to generation—the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. A middle-class person, on the other hand, can more easily fall into poverty or obtain wealth in their lifetime.

### Part 3: Systematic Destruction—How the Democratic Party Is Destroying Black Life

We’ve discussed Black Americans’ Republican origins and their move to a steadfast Democratic allegiance. We’ve explored who benefits from this allegiance and how. Finally, we’ll discuss the ways that this allegiance is destroying Black families and keeping Black Americans stuck in generational poverty. Each piece reiterates Owens’s primary argument—that it’s time for Blacks to leave the “Democratic plantation” and embrace true independence.

#### The Dismantling of Black Families

One of Owens’s biggest arguments is that Democratic policies dismantle the foundation of Black families and undermine the traditional values on which they’re based. According to Owens, during the time of slavery, spouses and children were separated as a way to keep slaves broken and compliant. Today, she says, Democrats still push a set of agendas that systematically destroy the fabric of Black family life. Two umbrellas that these programs mostly fall under are government handouts and feminism.

##### **Government Handouts**

Social safety nets, such as TANF (commonly known as “welfare”), SNAP (“food stamps”), WIC, and Section-8 housing are programs supported by Democrats. They say that the programs are intended to help struggling individuals and families get back on their feet. Owens, however, has a more cynical perspective. She believes that these **social services are used by the government to accomplish two things: to keep Black mothers single, and to create reliance on their party.**

From Owens’s perspective, **social services keep Black mothers single because if they can receive food, money, and housing from the government, then there’s no need to marry the man that impregnates them**. The men are free to impregnate as many women as they want without having to face the responsibility of caring for a family. The unfortunate result is a vast increase in children who grow up fatherless and ultimately end up in prison. This system feeds itself and keeps Black people at the most powerless levels of society.

(Shortform note: An impact review was recently conducted on the effects of single-parent households on a child’s likelihood to graduate from college or be incarcerated. White and Black subjects were both included, and the results were the same for both races: Children who were raised by single parents were more likely to go to jail or prison, and were less likely to graduate from college. One critic of these studies, an associate professor at Harvard, presented data that argues that two-parent households are not a silver bullet and will not ensure academic success for Black children. Her results demonstrated that economic stability was the most important factor when determining whether a child would do well academically.)

Owens says that Democrats also like to give out social services because it creates dependency. The longer a person is on welfare, the more difficult it is to pull themselves out of it. And if they were to vote a Republican into office, this hand that’s feeding them could very well disappear.

LBJ created these services in 1964 as part of his “Great Society” initiatives. Owens says that LBJ (a known racist with a penchant for using the “n” word) spoke of his initiatives and allegedly said to two governors, “I’ll have those n*ggers voting Democrat for the next two hundred years.” (Shortform note: According to Snopes, this quote is widely cited but there is no evidentiary proof that LBJ said it.)

(Shortform note: A recent survey found that 59% of Americans believe that Black people receive the same or more social supports than do white people. The truth is quite the opposite—in food stamps and Medicaid, white recipients outnumbered Black ones. For food stamps, 32.6% of recipients were white and 25.6% were Black. For Medicaid, whites made up 43% of the recipients, and Blacks made up 18%. Because Black Americans comprise a little more than 13% of the population, these statistics still demonstrate that a larger chunk of the Black community uses these services than does the white community, but perhaps more importantly, it reflects the assumptions, attitudes, and misconceptions of the American people.)

##### **Feminism**

Owens argues that the feminist movement has historically been at odds with the liberation of Black Americans, and that it continues to hurt the Black population today—specifically in the areas of suffrage, independence, and abortion.

**Suffrage:** According to Owens, because white men have historically held more power than women and Blacks, there has always been an inherent rivalry between feminists and Black activists. Suffragettes were angry that Black men were granted the right to vote before women were. And Black women were angry with white women, because they were essentially asking for both members of their household to have voting rights before even one member of a Black household did.

(Shortform note: Women were granted the federal right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920. However, this did not eliminate state laws that prevented Black women from voting. Poll taxes and literacy tests kept many Black women out of the toll booths until after Jim Crow laws were dissolved. This is another reason why many Black people felt at odds with the feminists—the spoils were not distributed equally.)

**Hyper-independence:** Similar to her discussion about welfare, Owens stresses the importance of an intact family unit. She believes that modern feminism encourages women to be “strong and independent” to the point where they emasculate or even replace men. Owens argues that proper child rearing depends upon a masculine figurehead as husband and father, and that feminism is leaving a dangerous void in its place.

(Shortform note: The rate of married couples in the US has been on the decline and is currently at an all-time low. In 2019, there were six marriages for every 1,000 people. Compare these numbers to those at the start of the 21st century, when there were eight marriages for every 1,000 people. Statisticians say that this is a significant decline in a short period of time and attribute it in part to economic independence and gender equality for women. This supports Owens’s argument that feminism is affecting marriage rates, but it doesn’t address whether or not these households are happier and safer than in previous generations.)

**Abortion:** A key tenet of modern feminism is reproductive choice. Owens says that Black families are historically and deeply religious, and that the idea of abortion goes against their Christian beliefs. She says that Democrats fund Planned Parenthood, and that Planned Parenthood facilities disproportionately target Black neighborhoods. She believes that this is a feminist attack on the Black family’s religious foundations.

(Shortform note: There are many myths and misconceptions about Planned Parenthood as the abortion debate rages on. FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan website dedicated to indisputable facts and figures, goes through the most common messages about Planned Parenthood and explains why they are accurate or inaccurate. One example is a frequently cited statistic that “94% of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortions.” FactCheck explains that this number is misleading and inaccurate because it disregards all of the non-pregnancy related health services offered, such as contraception, cancer screenings, and counseling.)

#### Conclusion: The Way Out

The time has come, Owens says, for Blacks to break free of the Democratic shackles and step into their own independence. Ultimately, she wants all Blacks to pledge allegiance to the Republican Party, but she also stresses the following actionable steps and mindset shifts. If they are embraced, she says, Black Americans can claw their way out of generational poverty and disenfranchisement.

  * **Avoid government handouts** —they are disempowering, bad for your self-worth, and are a tool of the oppressor to keep you reliant upon the hand that feeds you.
  * **Vote for school choice** —don’t allow the government to tell you where you have to send your kids to school. School choice, or the voucher program, allows you to choose a school that is good quality and matches the values you want your children to have.
  * **Raise your children in a two-parent household** —Allow your wife to be the woman or your husband to be the man. Raise your children together in a home based on Christian values and work ethic.
  * **Reject the “Black” culture of purposeful ignorance and crude music** —This is a relatively new trend and is not part of Black identity. Your oppressor wants you to be dumb. Educate yourself, take pride in speaking well, and listen to music that reflects your true values. 
  * **Vote against affirmative action** —Affirmative action is designed to lift minorities up, but it really sets them up for failure. Time and again, Black students who are not skilled or educated enough for the rigors of a particular university, but are admitted because of a race quota, end up failing. Those same students could succeed if they were to attend schools that are actually at their level.
  * **Above all else, take personal responsibility** —Your life is your own, and you have no one to blame but yourself if you fail. Knowing that success is up to you and you alone will empower you to find a way to succeed. 



> **Breaking the Curse of Generational Poverty**
> 
> More than 20% of Black Americans are currently in the third generation of family poverty. Because we are now three generations away from the Civil Rights Movement, some scholars argue that we have proof that time is not enough for poor Blacks to climb their way out of a poor economic station. Here are three ways the scholars recommend we tackle the issue as a society:
> 
> **First, we need to improve education for Black students of all ages**. Many believe education is the key to upward mobility, and the current K-12 system of funding needs major reform. We can infer that Owens would agree with this strategy because she has criticized public schools in Black neighborhoods and advocates for school choice.
> 
> **Next, we need to bolster Black men.** To empower Black men to lead their homes and communities, we need to reform the criminal justice system and the education system with them at the front of our minds. Owens would also likely agree with this tactic, as she strongly believes in two-parent households and strong male figures.
> 
> **Finally, we need to eliminate child poverty.** While children are in their formative years, we must add social supports to make sure that they never go without a meal or clothing or shelter. By supporting them as they grow, they are more likely to have the tools they need to succeed on their own once they reach adulthood. We can infer that Owens would disagree with this approach because it could be categorized as a “government handout,” although she doesn’t directly discuss social supports for _children_ in this book.
