## Part 3: The Importance of the Bottleneck

The critical concept in the book is **identifying the bottleneck, or the key constraint that holds back throughput**. While this sounds like common sense, it can be hard to objectively identify your own bottlenecks when you’re in the thick of work.

### Building Blocks of Manufacturing Flows

Relationships between a bottleneck (X) and non-bottleneck (Y) can be summarized in the following 4 diagrams:

Y → X

  * The non-bottleneck feeds to the bottleneck
  * Y has excess capacity. Letting both X and Y run continuously will build up inventory in front of bottleneck X.



X → Y

  * The bottleneck feeds the non-bottleneck.
  * Y is starved for inventory to process and marches to the beat of X’s drum. This is totally fine, even if Y is idling at times. No inventory builds up in front of Y.



X → Assembly ← Y

  * Parts passing through X and Y flow into a joint step of assembly.
  * Working Y out of pace with X produces inventory in front of assembly.



X → Product A | Y → Product B

  * Here X and Y are independently operating for separate marketing demands.
  * If X cannot produce enough to meet market demand, then the constraint for product A is bottleneck X.
  * If Y can produce more than enough to meet market demand, then the constraint for product B is not Y - it is market demand. Y can produce more than the market demands for the sake of “efficiency,” but this will lead to excess product B inventory, increasing costs.



In all these blocks, **Y never determines throughput for the system**. Throughput instead is determined by bottleneck X, or market demand.

### The Massive Cost of the Bottleneck

Any time that the bottleneck isn’t working is lost time forever that cannot be made up at any other part in the system.

**An hour lost at the bottleneck causes a loss in total throughput equal to the hourly capacity of that bottleneck.** This is an important concept.

  * If the total throughput is a thousand dollars per hour, then the bottleneck is processing at a thousand dollars per hour, _even if the literal operational costs or the parts going through it cost much less_.
  * Alternatively, take the _entire_ operating expense of the factory, divided by the hours worked by the bottleneck - that’s the **actual cost of the bottleneck**.



In other words, a loss in the bottleneck means a loss to the entire operation, and should be viewed with such gravity

Other losses in _effective_ throughput are also similarly costly. For example, feeding low-quality parts through the bottleneck will cause rejection later, leading to effectively lower throughput.

While time lost from the bottleneck can be made up for by hurrying non-bottlenecks, any extra effort here typically adds to operational expense (eg overtime pay). Ideally, the bottleneck is simply maintained at peak capacity at all times.

### Identify the Bottleneck

The bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is equal to or less than the demand placed on it. Here are a few ways to find it.

**Identify the bottleneck by seeing where you have the greatest upstream inventory piling up** , and low inventory at the next step. If the non-bottlenecks are producing at equal rates (eg 100 parts/hour), the slowest step will have the largest upstream inventory.

Alternatively, see which downstream steps are most in demand of upstream parts and are idling. If you decrease inventory sizes, you will see which work center, if stopped, halts the whole line.

  * Analogy of rocks and water: the water level corresponds to inventory, while rocks are problems disturbing the flow. Lower the water level until a rock sticks out. Solve that problem, then lower the water level further.



Alternatively, in a more brute-force comprehensive way, define your market demand (by sales), then compare the productivity of each step of the chain to this demand.
