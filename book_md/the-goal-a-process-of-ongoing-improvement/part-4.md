## Part 4: Identifying and Improving the Bottleneck

Now that we know the bottleneck is hugely significant, we’ll learn how to improve the bottleneck’s capacity.

### Five Focusing Steps for Improvement

In _The Goal_ , Goldratt describes the 5-step process for continuous improvement:

  1. IDENTIFY the system’s constraint.
  2. OPTIMIZE the system’s constraint. Squeeze more capacity out of the constraint.
  3. SUBORDINATE all the non-constraints to the above decisions.
  4. ELEVATE the system’s constraint. Add more capacity to the constraint.
  5. If in the previous steps the constraint no longer remains the constraint, go back to step 1 for the new constraint.



We’ve discussed identification in the previous chapter. We’ll now dive more deeply into improvement.

### Increase Capacity at the Bottleneck

The protagonist of _The Goal_ book undergoes multiple iterations of increasing capacity as his bottleneck to increase overall throughput. Without detailing every struggle, in this book summary we’ll cover common causes of reduced capacity at bottlenecks, and fixes to increase capacity.

(Shortform note: This is a good point to consider your own work or life in this context, and to construct effective ways to relieve your personal bottlenecks.)

#### Common Contributors to Bottlenecks

  * The machine is running inefficiently, performing unnecessary steps or with high setup/switching costs.
  * The machine is running efficiently, but there simply aren’t enough machines
  * The machine isn’t being run for the maximal number of hours
  * The step requires a long batch period, and batches are not fully filled.
    * Eg running a dishwasher - each cycle takes 2 hours and more dishes can’t be added midway through
  * Poor quality upstream parts waste bottleneck time, because the bottleneck processes them into a product that is later rejected.
  * Working on parts you don’t need urgently diverts capacity from the more important backlog.
  * Occasionally, the bottleneck doesn’t have the upstream inventory to work at full capacity (and technically isn’t the bottleneck at that moment). 
    * This may be because the non-bottlenecks are working on non-bottleneck parts or haven’t built up inventory.
  * Machines run idle because people are redistributed to work on non-bottlenecks.



#### Fixes to Bottlenecks

We can divide this into a few themes.

**Improve the Bottleneck Itself**

  * Skip unnecessary steps or decreasing setup/switching costs.
  * Add on supplements to increase bottleneck capacity, even if they’re less efficient
  * Guarantee round-the-clock production at the bottleneck.
    * Example: Eliminate lunch breaks and downtime.
  * Permanently staff people at bottlenecks to decrease idle time.
    * Eg have people waiting by dishwasher to prepare loads and unload immediately. 
    * Remember that the cost of a lost hour at this bottleneck is very expensive, and possibly well worth people idling on standby.



**Improve What the Bottleneck is Working On**

  * Focus the bottleneck only on parts that are needed today, not for safety’s sake tomorrow.
    * Order the work in terms of first in, first out - clear the backlog first to guarantee important work is being done.
  * Allow parts to skip the bottleneck step if it’s not _necessary_.
  * Collect accurate statistics on bottleneck operations to make better decisions.



**Optimize the System for the Bottleneck**

  * Redistribute capacity from non-bottlenecks to the bottleneck (e.g. more workers).
  * Make sure there is extra inventory ahead of the bottleneck so it can always be running at full capacity.
  * Take some of the load on the bottleneck and redistribute to non-bottlenecks, if the same function can be performed.
  * Do quality control upstream of the bottleneck to prevent time processing substandard parts.
  * Tag parts that will go to the bottleneck as higher priority, so they get processed first and you guarantee inventory in front of the bottleneck. The bottleneck gets an express lane.
  * Announce the importance of bottleneck to the entire team, so they understand the priority of processing for the bottleneck.
  * Check upstream steps to see if adjustments can be made that decrease load on bottleneck.
    * In _The Goal_ , the team discovers that running an upstream milling step more efficiently leads to requiring heat treatment. If this is slowed down, then the parts can skip heat treatment. In this case,**lowering efficiency at one step actually increases throughput**.
  * Outsource the bottleneck outside the organization.



(Shortform suggestion: take some time to consider how to apply these to your own life. For example, say you’re a manager who wants to improve your throughput. Consider the **above fixes directly applied to a manager** , whose time can often be the bottleneck of an organization’s throughput:

  * Increase your time on tasks that you are uniquely good at (ideally, these are higher leverage tasks). Train others to take over your lower level responsibilities.
  * Allow workers to bypass you for permission for smaller decisions. Don’t require everything to pass by your desk.
  * Prevent idle time by enforcing meetings starting on time with everyone present.
  * Track your backlog so that more important items are worked on first, then process in first-in first-out order.)



### Market Demand and Throughput

Ideally, **the flow through the bottleneck should match market demand**. Producing more than this will increase inventory of finished product. Too much inventory will hinder flexibility through sunk cost fallacy - you’ll be reluctant to adapt to new market demands, because it would mean writing down your old inventory.

Instead, **when you have surplus capacity, try to increase sales to make use of this capacity.** Because you’re already paying for the fixed costs, you can lower prices to above material (marginal) cost to simulate more demand. This will decrease your overall cost per product.

### Finding the New Constraint

If you do your work right, you’ll find that the constraint is no longer holding up the system, and the constraint has moved somewhere else. Here are a few tips on how to deal with this.

**Different constraints can require very different optimizations.** Don’t assume that what you applied to the first constraint can solve any other constraint.

Don’t overcorrect for the constraint you just fixed. Overcorrection can be counterproductive. If you obsess about preventing the bottleneck from idling and exceed market demand, you’ll produce surplus inventory.

### Shortform Exclusive: Applications to Non-Manufacturing Work

While The Goal is literally concerned with manufacturing, its principles are generalizable to any work system in which multiple parts contribute to a single goal.

**Consider asking yourself these questions:**

  * Are you refusing profitable work because you don’t have enough throughput? If so, find your bottleneck and alleviate it.

  * How can you cut batch size to increase efficiency?

  * Where is the weakest link in your chain?

  * Are you currently the bottleneck for any throughput? How can you tell?

  * What are 3 ways you can relieve yourself as the bottleneck?
