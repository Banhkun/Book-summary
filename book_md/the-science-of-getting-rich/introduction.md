## Introduction: The Science of Getting Rich

**There is a guaranteed method—a science—to getting rich.** By nature, God and the universe want you to be rich, so all you have to do is:

  1. Learn some fundamental truths about the workings of the universe (covered in Chapter 1).
  2. Harness what you’ve learned and work in harmony with the universe’s natural processes using the Certain Way (covered in Chapter 2).
  3. Contribute to the enrichment of the entire world, as a result of completing the above steps (covered in Chapter 3).



The author intended for _The Science of Getting Rich_ to be a practical guide, so it’s short and doesn’t go into detail about the philosophy behind the methods. He writes that his recommendations are tested and they work, so you can take everything he states as fact. (If you are interested in the philosophy, he recommends you read Hegel and Emerson.)

(Shortform note: _The Science of Getting Rich_ was originally written in 17 chapters. We have rearranged the information for concision and clarity.)
