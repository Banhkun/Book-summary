## Exercise: Follow the Certain Way

The Certain Way has three steps: think, will, and act.

* * *

Think: What is a physical possession that you want? For example, consider a house or a car. Describe it in detail. Write down both what it would look like and how you would feel while using it.

Will: What are two or three events, people, or things in your daily life that could potentially distract you from your vision? How will you concentrate on your vision as you encounter these distractions?

Act: What are three specific ways you can do your best in your current environment, therefore increasing the opportunity of receiving what you want?

Think of the last time you made a transaction in which you took more than you gave, whether that was selling someone something or having a conversation. If you could redo that interaction, how would you change your actions so you increased the other personâ€™s life by more than they increased yours?
