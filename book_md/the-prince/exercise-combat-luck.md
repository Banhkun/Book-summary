## Exercise: Combat Luck

Machiavelli argues that not just politics, but all of life, is a struggle between luck or fortune and a person’s abilities. At least half of all events exist outside of our control, but that leaves half for us to manipulate through our own skill.

* * *

How has luck played a role in where you find yourself in life today? Have there been times when you overcame bad luck in order to achieve success? Were there times when luck itself was responsible (at least in part) for your success?

List some goals you have for the future. What role do you anticipate luck playing in your achievement of those goals (positive or negative)?

How can you prepare now for what impact luck may have in the future? How can you use Machiavelli’s principles of _foresight_ and _adaptability_ to thrive through whatever challenges life may throw at you?
