## 1-Page Summary

_The Prince_ is a 16th-century work of political theory and (possibly) an educational resource aimed at fledging authoritarian leaders, or “new princes.” Through simple maxims and historical examples, Niccolò Machiavelli instructs the reader on how princes may seize, maintain, and defend their power, encouraging them to embrace cruelty and deception as necessary tools in their arsenal. According to _The Prince_ , no action is unjustifiable if it contributes to the overall strength and stability of the government.

Machiavelli was a Florentine author, diplomat, and historian who lived through a period of great social and political upheaval in Renaissance Italy. _The Prince_ was the sum of all his experiences in politics as well as a gift offered to Florence’s newly ascended authoritarian leaders in the 1510s, in the hope, or so he claimed, that it would help them lead Italy to greatness. His true intentions have been debated for centuries, and _The Prince_ is both the work for which he is best known and his most controversial.

In the modern day, _Machiavellian_ is used mainly as an insult, describing a treacherous or cutthroat approach to politics. At the same time, many political analysts and scholars invoke Machiavelli’s lessons as a guide to a pragmatic or clear-eyed view of politics, in which other leaders and nations are understood not as idealized symbols but as fundamentally self-interested political actors. _The Prince_ doesn’t argue for tyranny, but rather that the reader should understand themselves and all other leaders as imperfect people working towards a noble vision—a great state, the unification of disparate territories, the liberation of a people, and so on—and willing to undertake whatever is necessary to achieve it.

> **Mirrors for Princes**
> 
> _The Prince_ is the best-known, though not the most representative, example of the genre known as _mirrors for princes_. These texts were written by scholars, monks, and politicians as instructions for newly ascended monarchs. They offered advice, gave a history of the state, and described rulers whom the new monarch should seek to emulate. Though the genre experienced a boom in the Middle Ages, it dates back to ancient Greece, and new examples were published until the 19th century.
> 
> What makes _The Prince_ unusual is Machiavelli’s grounded interests and largely realistic tone. While other authors stressed the importance of Christian virtue and acting on behalf of the people, Machiavelli is concerned mainly with power—how to take it, maintain it, and defend it. He mentions Christianity only in passing, and encourages the reader to flout traditional morality if doing so helps preserve the state.
> 
> Machiavelli dedicated _The Prince_ to Lorenzo II de’ Medici, the then-prince of Florence who was only 20 when he took power. While there’s no evidence that Lorenzo or any of his successors ever read the book, some scholars have theorized that it was written as a kind of job application, a cynical attempt by Machiavelli to ingratiate himself to the Medici family after they had imprisoned, tortured, and dismissed him from government a year earlier. _The Prince_ ’s dedication stressed his loyalty and his knowledge of politics, and in making a gift of the book, he may have hoped to simultaneously assuage any suspicions against him and encourage Florence’s new leaders to bring him back into politics.

This guide consolidates Machiavelli’s 26 lessons into four main sections. The first two provide an explanation of Machiavelli’s core ideas about politics and government organization. The latter two lay out his advice for how a prince should conduct themselves, both generally and when attempting to establish a new state.

  * **Defining Types of Government:** Reviewing Machiavelli’s descriptions of the different types of states
  * **Luck vs. Ability:** Discussing Machiavelli’s foundational belief that all of life is a struggle between faith and ability
  * **How a Prince Should Behave:** How a prince should conduct themselves before their enemies and their people
  * **How to Form a State:** How a prince should go about setting up a new government 



We’ll also discuss Machiavelli’s historical context, how different interpretations of his intent change how we understand his lessons, and how his ideas relate to the modern political landscape.

### Defining Types of Government

Machiavelli uses the first few chapters of _The Prince_ to describe different types of government. Though he begins by stating that all states are either republics or principalities, the book focuses almost exclusively on principalities, discussing how they’re formed and how a prince can keep them stable against both internal and external threats.

#### Republics vs. Principalities

Machiavelli does not offer a formal definition of his terms, but from his descriptions, we can gather that **republics are ruled by a group of people** , chosen for their positions because of their abilities and that citizens under a republic have some **freedom to influence politics**.

In contrast, **principalities are ruled by a single individual who holds exclusive or near-exclusive power**. The position may be hereditary, elected by a council of advisors, or with successors being hand-picked by previous princes.

(Shortform note: Despite our modern associations with the word “prince,” Machiavelli is not speaking exclusively of hereditary monarchies. For him, a prince is anyone who exercises authoritarian control over a state. This means that some modern monarchies, such as the one in England, would not be principalities, since the English king or queen occupies a largely ceremonial role, and the actual system of government is a parliamentary democracy. It also means that dictators with no royal blood, who passed their position to a chosen successor rather than a child, would be princes—such as Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union.)

> **What Is Republicanism?**
> 
> Republics are not the focus of _The Prince_ , but understanding them provides important context. While Machiavelli uses _The Prince_ to advise absolute rulers, in life he was a staunch believer in republics as the ideal form of government. He served in a republic for more than a decade before it was overthrown and replaced with an authoritarian system.
> 
> A _republic_ is defined, in simplest terms, as a government by the people. Unlike a “pure democracy,” in which every citizen participates in governance, the people of a republic choose representatives to speak on their behalf whenever political decisions are made. These representatives may be elected, appointed, or chosen by lottery, as they were in the Florentine Republic of Machiavelli’s day. The representatives make decisions by consensus or by majority rule, meeting regularly to debate and vote on certain actions, and their power is restricted by a _constitution_ ,__ which prevents them from taking actions that would jeopardize the basic rights of the people. The United States of today is a republic, as are most democracies.
> 
> Scholars have often struggled to reconcile Machiavelli’s love for republics with his writing of _The Prince_. Among other things, the book advises princes on how they may invade or destroy existing republics and how to rule with an iron fist, crushing attempts at challenging their power. How could Machiavelli sincerely give advice to the type of person whom his fellow republicans would consider a tyrant? Adding to the confusion is the fact that in nearly all of Machiavelli’s other writings, written both before and after _The Prince_ , he explicitly praises republics as the ideal form of government, making this book the odd one out.

### Luck vs. Ability

Throughout the book, **Machiavelli sets up a dichotomy between _fortuna_ , meaning fortune or fate, and a prince’s innate skill or ability**. According to him, everyone is subject to the whims of luck to some extent. What sets successful princes apart from their peers is that they act decisively against the odds and don’t let bad luck defeat them.

Machiavelli contends that up to half of all human events are subject to chance, implying that half are subject to our own will. He argues that what makes a prince truly great is their refusal to let their life be dictated by _fortuna_ , either through their _adaptability_ or their caution and _foresight_.

#### Adaptability

A successful prince must be prepared to act differently according to the particular needs or threats that their state faces. Two princes could behave exactly the same way, but because one rules Rome in the 3rd century and the other rules France in the 12th, one will fail where the other succeeds. Machiavelli advises that when a principality is prosperous and at peace, the prince can be lenient. However, when the principality is at war or suffering economic hardship, the prince may need to be controlling and harsh.

> **Is Adaptability Possible?**
> 
> Machiavelli contradicts himself several times in his discussion of adaptability. On one hand, he believes that princes must change with the times to succeed. On the other hand, he suggests that people are fundamentally fixed in their ways and _can’t_ change with the times. Writing that people “cannot deviate from what nature inclines [them] to,” he argues that the most successful rulers are those who live extremely short lives, since they’re able to have a great impact on their time before circumstances change so drastically that they fall out of favor.
> 
> In short, Machiavelli doesn’t believe that princes are capable of the adaptability he says they need to have. Why, then, does he include this advice? Does he want the reader to understand that principalities are fundamentally unstable? Is he arguing in favor of constant regime change or for a kind of government that allows different people to rise to power at different times, rather than being subject to the will of a single ruler? If so, that suggests that _The Prince_ was intended as an ironic or satirical work, subtly criticizing princes rather than instructing them.

#### Foresight

In Machiavelli’s view, pre-planning and foresight are the most important tools a prince can wield against chance. No matter how stable a principality appears, the prince should never become complacent in times of peace or economic prosperity. They should always anticipate future threats, provide for followers, and be prepared for war at any time—Machiavelli advocates for having either a standing army or a militia that can be summoned at a moment’s notice so princes are never caught off guard.

> **The Value of a Standing Army**
> 
> In the modern day, the vast majority of states have some kind of permanent military force that can be called into action at any time, as Machiavelli recommended. This was not the case historically, since the constant recruitment and training of soldiers was considered too costly and unnecessary to ensure regional stability. The first standing armies appeared in empires, which were constantly expanding and so needed soldiers on hand to defend their newest borders.
> 
> Today, standing armies are considered a common-sense part of national security, though just how large and well-equipped such an army needs to be is debated. Even tiny and peaceful states maintain an army or form agreements to share forces among neighboring nations as a way to avoid political pressure from larger states. Today, the military isn’t considered just a wartime necessity, but also a way for states to defend themselves against the possibility of war in the future.

#### How _Fortuna_ Can Destroy a Prince

Princes often meet their downfall due to bad luck, but Machiavelli argues that a lack of skill also plays a role in their failure. If the prince had planned ahead better or anticipated threats, they could have endured whatever bad luck came their way. As an example, he cites Cesare Borgia, a notorious Italian prince of the late 1400s and early 1500s.

Borgia was unprepared for a change in his fortunes. As the son of a pope, he had enormous success manipulating his enemies and establishing his own state in central Italy. For a time, it seemed like Borgia might succeed in conquering the entire peninsula, but soon after his father died, his state crumbled. He failed to either foresee the danger or to adapt to the times, and all his cunning and brutality could not protect him from being overthrown. Machiavelli argues that if he had better prepared for the inevitability of his father’s death, he might have held onto power longer.

> **Borgia as an Ideal Prince**
> 
> Machiavelli invokes Borgia more often than any other historical figure, leading some to call Borgia the “hero” of _The Prince_. What may be lost on a modern reader is how bizarre and controversial Borgia was as a choice. His family was a known enemy of the Medici, to whom Machiavelli dedicated _The Prince_ , and Borgia’s name was synonymous with treachery and violence throughout Italy.
> 
> Whatever successes Borgia may have had in life, it ended in disgrace, and Machiavelli frequently contradicts himself when attempting to praise him. For example, in the same breath as arguing that Borgia failed to prepare for his father’s death, Machiavelli insists that Borgia had “done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man” and, indeed, “could not have regulated his conduct otherwise.” If Borgia’s skill was simply not enough to defeat _fortuna_ , does that mean his downfall was inevitable?
> 
> This, along with other inconsistencies, has provided evidence for the belief among some scholars that _The Prince_ is actually intended as a satire. If Machiavelli invokes Borgia as representative of all princes, that may mean that all princes are cruel, dishonest, self-interested, and ultimately doomed to fail. His comparison of Borgia to the Medici might have been intended as a condemnation, revealing to the reader that all princes were fundamentally alike, even when they opposed one another. While this reading is not universally accepted, it does provide one explanation for how the known republican Machiavelli could praise an authoritarian like Borgia.

### How a Prince Should Behave

When it comes to how princes should conduct themselves, Machiavelli advises pragmatism. For him, **whether a prince is a good and just ruler or a cruel and tyrannical one** **matters only inasmuch as it helps or hurts their ability to keep power**.

However, Machiavelli still believes that princes should have and work towards certain _guiding principles_. The princes he venerates were driven to brutality or deception by the need to bring about the happiness of the people, the long-term stability of the state, or the greatness of the people as perceived by other states. They weren’t motivated solely by greed or selfishness.

> **Pragmatism and _Realpolitik_**
> 
> Throughout history, critics of Machiavelli have called him a teacher of evil, instructing princes to behave in fundamentally self-interested and amoral ways. He’s even been compared to the devil himself. However, while Machiavelli rejected traditional morality, he didn’t believe that princes should be _amoral_ or that it was a prince’s job to advance themselves at the expense of the people.
> 
> Machiavelli’s philosophy is that of _extreme pragmatism_ —that anything and everything is justified if it serves the state. As Machiavelli sees it, everything a prince does should be to the benefit of their people, and that can include brutal punishments or deprivation of basic human rights. If it makes the government more stable and the area safer, then it’s for the good of the people _as a collective_ , even if it hurts individuals.
> 
> A version of Machiavelli’s philosophy survives in politics today, in the form of _realpolitik_ : the idea that politicians should be motivated by the security and survival of their state, not by abstract political philosophies or ethics. Critics of realpolitik argue that it reduces politics to power-grabbing, with politicians being motivated solely by ambition and greed. However, realpolitik’s defenders say it defines politics in realistic terms, encouraging politicians to focus on the consequences of their actions and concrete events rather than vague ideals.

#### Machiavellian Virtue

For Machiavelli, what makes a prince great is their _virtú_ , which he defines as their ability to take decisive action and to stand as an individual.

(Shortform note: Most translators do not interpret this word, _virtú_ , as its most obvious English equivalent, _virtue_ , since Machiavelli rarely uses the word to describe a prince’s goodness or morality. Instead, he uses the word to mean _boldness_ , _skill_ , _courage_ , _willpower_ , or _strength_. One translator has suggested that the best modern equivalent of virtú for English readers would not be an English word at all, but a Yiddish one: chutzpah.)

Machiavelli’s ideal prince is unafraid to affect radical change or to begin military offensives, takes advice without being steered by others, always thinks ahead to anticipate threats, and prioritizes the survival of the principality. To appear ‘virtuous,’ as Machiavelli defines it, a prince shouldn’t aim to appear morally good, but to appear as someone whose continued success can be relied upon.

According to Machiavelli, a prince lacking in _virtú_ will eventually lose their state, either because they fail to overcome the odds (that is, they were unable to deal with changes in _fortuna_) or because no one respects them as a leader.

> **_Virtú_ and the Cult of Personality**
> 
> The formation of a modern _cult of personality_ , in which a political figure is worshiped as the absolute best a society can offer, often relies on the same characteristics Machiavelli describes with the word _virtú_. The leader at the center of such a cult will emphasize their strength, boldness, and independence, promising to do things ordinary politicians shy away from and to enact radical positive change. Whether or not they are morally good is less important than the fact that they’re _good for the state_ ; they will protect it from outside threats and bring it to new heights of prosperity.
> 
> However, their ability to hold onto power is linked to their ability to maintain this image. If it’s compromised or they fail to deliver on certain promises, the people’s faith in them is weakened and their leadership, or even the entire state, may collapse.

#### Being a Realist

Machiavelli argues that too many politicians and political theorists approach questions of rule with idealism rather than a realistic sense of the problems they face. Princes should strive to rule effectively rather than to create a utopian government. According to Machiavelli, the prince who tries to act morally good at all times will inevitably be overthrown because they won’t meet the threats they face with the appropriate brutality.

Instead, princes should act according to necessity and circumstance and be prepared to do the wrong thing if it means preserving the principality. Machiavelli argues that **losing the state because they’re unable to be brutal is crueler than keeping the state alive through brutality.**

> **Moral Relativism: Do the Ends Justify the Means?**
> 
> Essentially, Machiavelli is making an argument in favor of _moral relativism_ , or the belief that right and wrong are not universal truths but are highly specific to time, place, and culture. Moral relativism is not the same as complete amorality, and Machiavelli does believe in right and wrong, condemning behavior he sees as pointlessly brutal. But he does support brutality _with a purpose_.
> 
> Machiavelli is often misquoted as having summarized his philosophy as: “The ends justify the means.” Though Machiavelli never says those words exactly, he does write that “in the actions of all men, and especially of princes…one judges by the result.”
> 
> His emphasis on “princes” in this context indicates he believes that what a prince does may be judged as wrong by the average person, but a prince is not the average person: Their actions don’t just speak for themselves, but for many others as well. Because a prince has greater responsibilities, they can, in Machiavelli’s view, better justify bad behavior. By how much is a question he leaves open.

#### The Value of Deceit

Interestingly, while Machiavelli argues that princes shouldn’t be concerned with _behaving_ morally, he says **they should be very concerned with _appearing_ moral**. Princes should strive to have a reputation of being just, loyal, kind, generous, and religious.

While Machiavelli argues that princes should always be prepared to do the wrong thing, he also acknowledges that people want to believe that their leaders are fundamentally good. A prince who is obviously cruel or dishonest or who makes promises with no intention of keeping them, will eventually lose the love of their people and the trust of their allies.

Machiavelli particularly emphasizes the need for a leader to appear _religious_ , even if they don’t truly subscribe to religious principles. In Renaissance Italy, Christian faith was often synonymous with goodness, so a prince outright rejecting its teachings would be ostracized by every other power in the area.

(Shortform note: Though he does not say so outright, Machiavelli is warning readers that too much focus on religion could open them up to manipulation by the Church and the Papal States. As God’s representative on Earth, the Pope could argue that any truly Christian state should answer to him, while Machiavelli believed that princes should rule their principality according to the needs of their people.)

#### Balancing People and Peers

Examining princes who have fallen from power, Machiavelli observes that a prince needs to strike a delicate balance between keeping the love and support of the people they rule, and keeping the love and support of those who aid them in ruling, be they nobility, a council of advisors, potential successors, military leaders, and so on.

Because these two groups tend to occupy different social classes and have different relationships to power (accepting that they will be ruled versus wanting to rule), their desires and priorities differ, so failing to satisfy either one can leave a prince vulnerable to being overthrown.

That said, Machiavelli argues that **the support of the people is always more valuable and should take priority over the support of the nobility, other government officials, or the army**.

This is partly due to their sheer numbers, which makes the people a more effective power base and harder to stand against; after all, it’s easier to remove a few noblemen from power than to crush a national movement. Machiavelli also argues that appeasing the people requires you to do less to curb your own power, since, rather than aspiring to gain power for themselves, most of them just wish to live safe, prosperous, and comfortable lives.

> **The Possibility of Democratic Revolution**
> 
> Curiously, Machiavelli doesn’t discuss the possibility that the people may want power or the ability to govern for themselves. On one hand, democracies in Machiavelli’s day looked very different than they do now, and he may simply not have regarded ordinary people as political actors. On the other hand, classical Greece provided numerous examples of self-rule by the people, and Machiavelli used ancient history as the basis for many of his lessons. His admiration for republics was based on these ancient models of democracy.
> 
> There’s also the fact that Machiavelli observes early on in the book that society is a constant struggle between nobles, or the rich and powerful, and ordinary people: “The people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles,” while “the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people.” This philosophy is echoed by later democratic thinkers, including the French Enlightenment writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who described government as a kind of compromise made between the people and their rulers over who has the power, and even by Karl Marx, who conceptualized all of history as a struggle between the haves and the have-nots.
> 
> Rousseau was an admirer of Machiavelli, believing him to be a republican icon and _The Prince_ a brilliant satire. Indeed, while Machiavelli predated the Age of Revolutions by around 250 years, his writings had a great impact on the fundamental beliefs underlying it—that politics had little to do with religion, that princes ruled through a combination of manipulation and cruelty, and that a government could not survive without the support of the people. Even if Machiavelli didn’t consider the possibility of a democratic revolution, his readers certainly did.

In contrast, meeting the needs of a prince’s peers means keeping them loyal despite their aspirations for power. Machiavelli argues that a prince should allow the nobility, government, and army to compete amongst themselves for influence and wealth but should violently crush any move made against the prince. In turn, he advises princes to honor and reward those who remain loyal and to be extremely wary of anyone whose loyalty is uncertain, no matter how little power they might appear to have.

Machiavelli also suggests that keeping the love and support of the people can discourage conspiracy or assassination attempts originating from your peers. No matter how unhappy the members of a prince’s inner circle are, if they suspect that the people would refuse to accept their government after the overthrow of a beloved prince, they will continue to support the prince.

> **Populism**
> 
> Machiavelli’s advice about prioritizing the love of the people resembles modern-day _populism_ , or an approach to politics that emphasizes the needs and interests of ordinary people over those of so-called elites. Populist movements argue that ordinary people are oppressed, exploited, or otherwise harmed by the rich and powerful, and want to bring this unbalanced relationship to an end. The question of _how_varies widely across right-wing and left-wing populist movements, as does the conception of who counts as ‘ordinary people’ versus ‘elites.’
> 
> Examples of populist leaders and movements from the 21st century include Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party movement, Evo Morales, Hugo Chavez, Brexit, and Donald Trump. As Machiavelli suggested, many of these leaders were able to achieve great success in politics despite being complete outsiders to the establishment or even openly disliked by their peers. The support of the people, in the form of votes or even physical force, gave them the tools to enact change. To keep power long-term, however, these leaders would eventually need to either win over their peers or replace them with loyal supporters.

#### Being Feared, Rather Than Loved

Machiavelli’s adage that it’s better to be feared by people than loved by them is one of _The Prince_ ’s most infamous lessons. His justification for this idea is simple: **Obedience due to love and affection is unreliable, while obedience due to fear is not**. People are inherently disloyal, and no matter how much love they have for a prince, they may betray him if they believe it’s in their best interest, or even in the best interest of the state.

(Shortform note: This is essentially the conflict faced by Brutus in Shakespeare’s _Julius Caesar_. Brutus loves his friend Caesar but conspires to kill him out of his belief that doing so will preserve the republican government of Rome. This plan backfires, and Rome is embroiled in a civil war that ends with the establishment of the Roman Empire under the first emperor, Octavian. For his part, Brutus is remembered by various writers as either a tragic hero (as in Shakespeare’s telling) or the ultimate betrayer, as in Dante’s _The Divine Comedy_ , which places him in the lowest circle of Hell. How Machiavelli would have seen him is unclear.)

That said, Machiavelli warns that fear can easily turn to hatred and advises princes to never act against someone without good reason. Cruelty might be necessary for the running of the state, but just as a prince should not appear to be a liar, they should not appear to be cruel for cruelty’s sake. People should fear the state’s power without resenting it.

He also suggests, as much as possible, getting all necessary brutality out of the way at the beginning, so a prince’s rule can become more lenient over time. This allows the prince to relax their rule without compromising their safety or the principality’s stability since any threats will have been crushed out of existence early. It also helps to win the loyalty of the people, now living relatively free lives in peacetime.

> **Fascism**
> 
> Machiavelli’s ideas about princes were co-opted in the 19th and 20th centuries by Italian fascists, who believed that government should be run as an authoritarian, ultra-nationalist project where the most important concern was the security and prosperity of the state. One of the most famous fascists, Benito Mussolini, was an outspoken admirer of The Prince. He shared Machiavelli’s hope that Italy would one day be restored to the glory of ancient Rome—though he admired the Empire, while Machiavelli admired the Republic.
> 
> Fascist leaders frequently rule through fear and enact repressive politics that restrict human rights in the interest of the state. They also, as Machiavelli suggests, institutionalize their violence so that it becomes a “new normal,” and people then interpret an end to _some_ but not all of the brutality as leniency. Fascist leaders often risk being hated but can avoid this by directing the people’s hatred outward at some foreign “other” and insisting that all brutality is necessary to protect the people.

### How to Form a State

Because Machiavelli wrote _The Prince_ primarily for new princes, he dedicates several chapters to the question of how a prince should approach conquering and then organizing the territory that they intend to make into their principality. He breaks his advice on this subject into three main categories: how to build up armed forces, choose trustworthy advisors to support you, and win over a newly conquered people.

#### Building Up Armed Forces

Machiavelli distinguishes between three types of armies: _hired_ forces, _borrowed_ forces, and _personal_ forces. He cautions princes to avoid hired forces, to be wary of borrowed forces, and to opt for personal forces when possible.

##### Hired and Borrowed Forces

Hired forces are a**** preexisting mercenary group that a prince pays for their services, while borrowed forces are soldiers loaned to a prince by another prince or government, either because they’re working towards a common goal or as a show of goodwill between nations. There are two issues with hired or borrowed forces: **They’re not loyal to the prince, and** **using them puts the prince in debt** , either literally or in terms of relying on another ruler for monetary and military support.

Both hired and borrowed forces have a commander they’re already loyal to, be it their general or captain, or the prince of another nation. The prince who makes use of them can never truly rely on their loyalty and will have no defense should they decide to betray him. Machiavelli also argues that hired forces especially tend to be unreliable, citing numerous examples of mercenaries breaking and running as soon as the battle turned against them. They are often poorly trained and disciplined and may abandon their work if they’re not being paid well enough or if they feel that the pay doesn’t justify the danger.

Princes should appear strong, bold, and independent, and in Machiavelli’s view, the prince who must rely on their allies for defense is none of those things. He even suggests that it would be better to lose with your own forces than to win with someone else's because success puts you even more in their debt. A victory that a prince cannot take full credit for has little value as a victory. More than a resource, these types of forces are a drain on resources and a potential threat.

(Shortform note: The use of hired or borrowed forces was extremely common in Machiavelli’s time, as few Italian city-states had armies of their own. Machiavelli was extremely critical of this practice, believing that this reliance on others was partly what had caused Italy to fall to so many foreign invasions: In defending itself with mercenaries or non-Italian forces, Italy had “been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis [both of France], ravaged by Ferdinand [of Spain], and insulted by the Switzers.” Several of these cases involved the Italians being betrayed by their allies or abandoned by their mercenaries. They lost money, territory, and international respect.)

##### Personal Forces

Machiavelli argues that all princes should have personal forces. Developing a personal army has several advantages: The prince **relies solely on their own resources** , they have **full control over how their army is organized and run, and they can enforce loyalty** within the ranks through a combination of legal structures (such as making desertion a crime) and social shaming (encouraging the populace to see military service as part of their patriotic duty).

Princes should not just be the heads of their states on the civilian side of things; they should be seen as military leaders. Machiavelli writes that, for a prince, strong ‘arms’ are just as important as strong laws, and even a prince who has no direct interaction with soldiers should make an effort to be knowledgeable about military tactics and warfare. If a prince _does_ have personal involvement with commanding the military, they’re more able to use their personal forces as a resource and are thus more secure in their position.

> **Machiavelli’s Militia**
> 
> Under the Florentine Republic, Machiavelli proposed and then organized the city’s personal militia. This militia saw a number of military successes before it was eventually defeated and dissolved when the Medicis took over. In making this point, Machiavelli may have been defending his past actions and encouraging the Medici to follow his example—rather than relying on papal forces and therefore a continuing relationship with Rome, the rulers of Florence could train and organize their own troops, always have them on hand to defend the city, and encourage patriotism among the general population and the soldiers alike. Having a personal army would also stabilize their government against rebellion, which was a threat they had faced before.

#### Choosing Advisors

Machiavelli advises that princes should surround themselves with reliable government officials who can assist them in ruling the state by forming a kind of advisory council. Advisors can be chosen from among powerful or wealthy families, the army, or the general populace.

In contrast to a traditional nobility, where positions are inherited through families who have a historical claim to their position, **the power of advisors should be conditional and come solely from their relationship to the prince**. As long as their resources and authority are conferred by the prince, rather than being something they have a natural right to, they won’t risk betraying him. In addition, whatever they accomplish will be linked to the prince in the eyes of the people.

Machiavelli advises new princes to allow advisors to feel like their role is important but to moderate how much power they actually have and how freely they can speak their minds. If a prince is willing to ask for advice and even criticism, that shows that they reward good judgment, but a prince who permits advisors to criticize them in public or with particular harshness might look weak. Allowing too much dissent can undermine a prince’s authority.

To avoid this, **advisors should feel confident in telling the truth, but should only do so when asked**. Advisors who exist to flatter the prince serve no purpose, but even those who offer genuine and realistic advice should never offer unprompted criticism or express doubt**** in the prince’s decisions. For their part, a prince should treat their advisors with respect, but it must be understood by all that the prince makes the final decisions.

(Shortform note: Throughout history, advisors who had too much influence posed a significant threat to the prince’s image and credibility. An advisor who appeared to aspire to power or to already be the true “power behind the throne” could undermine the authority of the entire government. One famous example of this was the “Mad Monk” Grigori Rasputin of Russia, beloved by Tsar Nicholas II but widely believed to be a con artist. Rasputin was eventually murdered by resentful nobles, and the tsar overthrown in a popular revolution a few years later. The evil or manipulative advisor has even become a trope in fiction, from Iago in Shakespeare’s _Othello_ to Gríma Wormtongue in _The Lord of the Rings_.)

#### Winning Over the People

As previously mentioned, Machiavelli sees a loyal populace as one of the most valuable tools a prince can have. In turn, he warns that**a prince who is hated by their people can never hold on to power for long**. A populace will rise to overthrow a hated prince, and no amount of brutality can crush that kind of popular movement forever. In the end, a prince’s resources and the goodwill of their allies will run out.

Machiavelli also suggests that a prince who is resented by their subjects is more vulnerable to outside threats. Instead of rising up to defend their homeland in the event of an invasion, a hated prince’s people might welcome their new conquerors as a needed change.

(Shortform note: This occurred in several colonial nations, where the native people had no loyalty to the foreign and often discriminatory local government. When the colonizers found themselves at war with a neighboring country or another colonial power, many of the natives chose to ally themselves with this new opponent in the hope that it would be their “liberator.” For example, in the Spanish-American War, Cuban and Filipino resistance movements aided the Americans, mistakenly believing that once the Spanish were gone they would be granted independence.)

As previously stated, Machiavelli believes that all most people aspire to is to live a safe, prosperous and comfortable life. If a new prince can offer them that, then the people will fall in line. In that vein, he offers several suggestions for how a new prince can win over the populace after establishing their principality.

##### Live Among the People

Machiavelli argues that **once a prince has conquered a territory, they should immediately establish a home there**. This dissuades foreign invaders from taking advantage of the confusion of a regime change, allows the prince to become familiar with local culture, and makes the prince less faceless in the eyes of the people. Propaganda is more effective when people feel truly close to the person being praised, and can ‘put a face to a name.’

If moving to the new state is impossible, either as a matter of safety or because the prince’s government is based elsewhere, Machiavelli suggests setting up colonies instead. In that instance, government officials or citizens of the larger principality can act as stand-ins for the prince. However, the prince must carefully monitor the behavior of these officials and soldiers to ensure that they aren’t exploiting the locals and giving the principality a bad name.

> **Cultivating Local Appeal**
> 
> Even in the modern day and in democratic nations as well as authoritarian ones, leaders will often attempt to appeal to the people on the basis of a shared home, geography, or culture. People are more attracted to politicians that they see as being “like them,” however superficially, and that emotional connection can be a powerful source of support.
> 
> For example, in the United States, both Democrats and Republicans will claim to originate from or have a personal connection to “rural America” to attract rural voters. This might involve highlighting a town they once lived in, participating in local events or traditions, or just using familiar symbols—farms, wildlife, guns, plaid and denim clothing, and so on—in their advertising. The success of these tactics varies widely, and perceived insincerity can doom a political campaign.

##### Avoid Changing the Existing System

When establishing a system of government, Machiavelli suggests changing the existing laws and taxation system as little as possible so that people can go about their everyday lives much as they did before. This avoids breeding resentment against the new prince, and it takes less effort than setting up an entirely new system. Machiavelli points to the success of the Roman Empire, which allowed its colonies across Europe and the Mediterranean to essentially run themselves as city-states while using them as a resource from which to draw taxes, soldiers, and slaves.

(Shortform note: While modern political campaigns tend to emphasize what a leader will do differently from their predecessors rather than what will stay the same, _nostalgia_ and _faith in the existing system_ still play a major role in appealing to the people. People fear change because they fear losing what they have. Political campaigns that promise “restoration” or a return to an idyllic past are attractive because they promise to calm recent upheavals and preserve what people find most comfortable and positive about the existing system. In contrast, candidates who promote the belief that the existing system needs to be overhauled tend to be polarizing.)

##### Let the People Keep Their Arms

While it may seem dangerous to allow potentially rebellious civilians to be armed, Machiavelli warns that people accustomed to having weapons on hand will react strongly to a government trying to take them away. Since disarmament is a protective gesture on the state’s part, Machiavelli suggests that a prince should instead encourage people to use their arms on behalf of the new state—to defend themselves against foreign invasion, to drive out members of the old regime, and so on. This begins the process of setting up a national identity under the new prince and can even help the prince begin developing personal forces.

> **The Risks of Arms Control**
> 
> Various authoritarian governments throughout history have attempted to disarm their people to diminish popular power. How successful these attempts were varied widely—in Nazi Germany and the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, these efforts were focused on minority populations (Jewish people and Armenians, respectively) and worked alongside other laws to deprive the population of freedom of movement and basic human rights. On the other hand, attempts by British colonial authorities to seize American revolutionary weapons backfired violently.
> 
> The modern American gun control debate shows how controversial an issue disarmament still is, with millions of people determined to keep their arms despite government restrictions, and said restrictions being shot down in many states. Even Machiavelli’s princes, who ruled an authoritarian government rather than a democratic one, risked turning the people against them by attempting to seize their weapons.

##### Support Cultural Development

Machiavelli advises princes to be patrons of the arts and to publicly honor and reward those who contribute to society through successful businesses, scientific or historical discoveries, or great works of art. This patronage helps in the development of the people’s sense of identity and pride in their nation, and it shows that the prince has a personal interest in their well-being. It may also boost the national economy, which contributes to people’s happiness. For these same reasons, Machiavelli also suggests that princes make an effort to entertain the people with festivals, holidays, and sporting events.

(Shortform note: The Medici family were some of the most generous patrons of the Renaissance, financially supporting artists like Botticelli and Michelangelo. In the modern day, politicians and independently wealthy businesspeople similarly attempt to connect to the people through _philanthropy_. This includes organizing and financially supporting things like art installations, educational programs, and public health campaigns. Sporting events and federal holidays also provide the opportunity to give back to the people and enhance a public image.)
