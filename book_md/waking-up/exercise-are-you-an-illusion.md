## Exercise: Are You an Illusion?

While Harris’s other writings question the validity of religion and the existence of God, in _Waking Up_ he asks you to question whether your individual sense of selfhood is real or illusory. Whether or not you agree with his argument, take a moment to contemplate the basis of your feelings of identity.

Assuming that the conscious workings of your brain are the product of unconscious neurological processes, how much do you feel that you’re actually in control of your thoughts, feelings, and inner motivations? Have you ever had a thought or feeling that took you by surprise and that you couldn’t explain? In retrospect, what might have triggered it?

Given that your experience of the world is subjective, what mental biases and distortions may affect your perception of the world? Have you ever had an experience where you found out later that your perception or memory of the event was wrong? If so, what was it?

If you accept that your thoughts and feelings are even slightly rooted in your unconscious, and if you accept that your perceptions and memories are subject to error and distortion over time, then what do you feel is the strongest basis for the “self” that sits at the core of your personal identity? If you were to meet a younger version of yourself, one without the same memories and perceptions you now have, in what way would they be the same person you are now?
