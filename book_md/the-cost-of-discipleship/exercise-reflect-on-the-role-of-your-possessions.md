## Exercise: Reflect on the Role of Your Possessions

Bonhoeffer teaches that as a disciple, you may make use of material things, but you should not place value on them, because the more wealth you have on earth, the more focused you will be on protecting your wealth instead of serving Christ.

* * *

Think about what you currently own. What possessions do you value the most? List your top three to five in the box below.

Why are these items important to you? What benefits or meaning do they provide in your life?

How much do you worry about losing your most valuable possessions? How much time, money, and energy do you currently invest in protecting them?

Given your answer to the previous question, how could you redirect that time, money, and energy toward building your character, helping others, or fulfilling your purpose in life?
