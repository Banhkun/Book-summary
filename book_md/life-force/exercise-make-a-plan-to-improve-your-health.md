## Exercise: Make a Plan to Improve Your Health

The authors explain that leading a healthy lifestyle is the most important factor in preventing disease. Identify some changes you could make in your lifestyle to improve your health.

* * *

Consider the lifestyle decisions that the authors describe as unhealthy. Which ones do you think you engage in? For example, do you sit for six or more hours per day? Do you have a diet high in refined carbs or ultra-processed foods?

Now identify two to three changes you could make to address some of these poor lifestyle habits. This could include things like going on a 20-minute daily walk, adding more fresh fruits and vegetables to your diet, or going to bed an hour earlier so you can get the right amount of sleep.

Finally, make a concrete plan to implement these changes over the next week. The easiest way to do this is to build them into your routine: For instance, you might pencil in a walk every other day after dinner or set a timer that tells you when to start winding down for the evening.
