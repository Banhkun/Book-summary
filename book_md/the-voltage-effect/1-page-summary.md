## 1-Page Summary

Published in 2022, _The Voltage Effect _by John A. List is an economics text designed to help you understand the characteristics of scalable ideas. **Scalability is the capacity of an idea to transition from a relatively small initial audience to a much larger one**. List uses the word “voltage” to describe the power and momentum of scalable ideas, and he lays out a framework for building and preserving your idea’s voltage as you scale.

List is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a former member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. With _The Voltage Effect_ , he explains how to scale your ideas, whether you’re an entrepreneur, a policymaker, or simply someone with an idea that you think could benefit your community.

In our guide, we’ll first examine List’s four red flags—the characteristics of ideas that are unlikely to scale successfully. (While List describes five negative patterns to avoid, we’ve condensed these into four red flags to avoid overlap.) Then, we’ll cover List’s strategies for scaling your idea. Throughout our guide, we’ll consider other approaches to scalability, management, and data science that supplement and contextualize List’s ideas.

### The Four Red Flags

**Scaling is the process of bringing an idea from a small audience or sample size to a much larger one**. Many businesses, nonprofits, and individuals want to scale their ideas for a variety of reasons—to make more money, do more good, or simply to spread their ideas as widely as possible (or some combination of the three).

For example, if your brownies are always selling out at your local community center’s bake sale, you might consider scaling up your baking operation. By mass-producing and marketing your brownies, you’d be able to make enough money to quit your day job while also donating more money to the community center, and you’d have the satisfaction of spreading your creations far and wide.

(Shortform note: Experts note that there are key differences between growth and scaling. Often, when a business grows, its costs increase in proportion to its revenues, meaning that while the business grows larger, it doesn’t necessarily become more profitable. However, when a business scales, its revenues increase at a higher rate than its costs, resulting in much greater profitability.)

List details the characteristics to look out for when trying to figure out if your idea will scale. **Ignoring these red flags and trying to scale the wrong idea can lead your enterprise to suddenly and dramatically lose momentum when scaling—List calls this a “voltage drop.”** When an idea loses momentum at scale, you lose time, energy, and potentially funds, and the project collapses in on itself.

To return to our brownie baking example, if you fail to notice red flags in your baking business model, you might drastically overestimate how many brownies you’ll sell at scale. Lacking customers, you’d be sitting on a pile of rapidly expiring baked goods that you spent time, money, and energy producing. In all likelihood, you’d have no choice but to eat your losses.

(Shortform note: New enterprises lose momentum and collapse at a high rate. Some authors estimate that as many as 70% of new businesses fail within their first 10 years. In _Built to Last, _Jim Collins describes the characteristics of businesses that are able to beat the odds and find enduring success. Collins argues that these companies succeed not by conservatively trying to avoid failure but by striving for ambitious long-term goals. By setting these kinds of goals, you help motivate your organization and prevent complacency.)

#### Red Flag #1: Lack of a Scalable Audience

The first red flag is the lack of a scalable audience. According to List, individuals and organizations often incorrectly assume that because an idea is popular with its original audience, it will continue to succeed when scaled to a broader audience. However, **if your original audience doesn’t accurately represent the larger audience you hope to scale to, you may find that your idea fizzles out at scale**.

For example, a parka salesman living in Alaska would likely find that almost everyone in his local community owns a parka, indicating universal demand for his product. However, if he assumed that his audience in Alaska was representative of an audience in Phoenix, Arizona, and decided to open a second store in Phoenix, he’d probably find that demand for parkas isn’t so universal after all.

(Shortform note: Failing to accurately assess the overall audience for your products and services—also known as market need—is a common pitfall for new businesses. It’s estimated that 42% of failed IT startups went under because there wasn’t significant market need for their products or services. This statistic echoes List’s assertion that overestimating your audience can be fatal for your business.)

To determine whether your idea will have an audience at scale, **you need to figure out who is in your current audience. The best way to do this is to test your idea in multiple markets that include a wide variety of demographic groups**. Testing your idea as broadly as possible will give you the data to determine who your product appeals to, and why.

Suppose that to better understand his audience, our parka salesman continues testing his parkas in new markets. To his surprise, focus groups in Toronto and Reykjavik love his parkas, while consumers in Los Angeles and Miami give them the cold shoulder. Based on this data, the parka salesman realizes that parkas only appeal to people who live in cold climates.

(Shortform note: In addition to broadly testing your ideas, you can also use purchase behavior to identify your audience. Often when you advertise products on social media, you’ll be able to generate data on what other goods and services your customers have purchased through that platform’s ads. By using this purchasing data, you can gain a better understanding of who is in your audience and how best to target them. For example, if your company sells protein bars, you might find that your customers also frequently purchased bike parts online. You’d realize that cyclists are a part of your audience, and you’d be able to market to them going forward.)

If your idea only appeals to select groups of people, and you still want to find a way to scale it, you may need to tweak your idea to have a more diverse audience. The key to broadening your audience is figuring out the needs that different groups of people share.

For example, if our parka salesman decides he wants to scale his business to Miami and Los Angeles, he’ll need to diversify his business to have a broader audience. Realizing that he needs to appeal to people who live in warm locations, he could design a line of tank tops and flip-flops to sell instead of parkas in his warm-weather stores.

(Shortform note: Not only will product diversification help your business scale, but it can also help protect your business from unexpected events. When your product is multifaceted and appeals to different groups of people, you’ll be less severely affected by market fluctuations. For example, suppose you have a product that sells well with both teenagers and young adults, and a competitor emerges that proves especially successful with teenagers. Because your product has a wide audience and is still selling well with young adults, this setback will do less damage to your bottom line.)

While having a broad appeal can help to scale your idea, **your product doesn’t need to appeal to everyone to be scalable**. What’s important is that you understand your audience and only scale your idea to markets where you’re confident it will succeed.

If our parka salesman decides he doesn’t want to tweak his business to work in warm climates, that doesn’t mean his business won’t scale. Instead of adding a flip-flop line, he can simply expand his business to other cold-weather markets, and open stores in Canada, Scandinavia, Siberia, and beyond.

(Shortform note: Niche marketing is the marketing industry term for finding ways to sell products with narrow and specific audiences. While businesses that market niche products may be limited by the smaller size of their audience, there are also benefits to niche marketing. Experts note that you’ll usually have fewer competitors in a niche market and that it’s generally easier to market to a narrow niche than to market to more general audiences.)

##### Misleading Results

When determining whether your idea has a big enough audience to scale, remain alert to misleading results. **Misleading results, or “false positives,” as List refers to them, are data that overstate the appeal of your idea**.

(Shortform note: To avoid falling for misleading results, consider sources outside your organization alongside your own data. By reading economic reports and checking database information, you gain an outside perspective on the condition of the market. If your internal data matches up with this, your data is probably correct. However, if your estimation of your idea’s appeal drastically differs from outside evaluations of the market, you may be experiencing misleading results.)

It can be tempting to believe in misleading results because of _confirmation bias_ , a phenomenon in which people interpret new events in a way that reinforces their prior beliefs—if you believe in your product’s appeal, confirmation bias can make it more difficult to see the product’s flaws.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli offers a strategy for combating confirmation bias. He recommends seeking out perspectives that contradict your own beliefs and reevaluating your beliefs in the context of this new information. In the context of scaling, if you have data that suggests your idea will scale, seek out perspectives that suggest that it won’t. This could mean reconsidering economic factors and marketplace competitors, or following any other line of thinking that could expose a flaw in your idea.)

Misleading results occur for a variety of reasons. Often, misleading results arise from failing to sufficiently test your idea. List recommends that you replicate your tests to double-check their results, in addition to testing your idea in diverse markets. **By replicating tests, you ensure that initial positive results aren’t flukes** that occurred randomly or due to an unforeseen factor.

(Shortform note: To get the most accurate results from your repeated tests, take care to use proper experimental controls in every iteration of the test. In _Bad Science_ , Ben Goldacre defines experimental controls as features of an experiment designed to prevent outside factors from influencing your research. For example, if you were testing a new soft drink with a focus group, you’d want to ensure that the test took place in a location with a moderate temperature and not an especially warm room in which a cold beverage would seem more appealing. When retesting the drink’s appeal, you’d want to implement identical experimental controls, to ensure that any change in your results wasn’t due to a change in temperature.)

If testing indicates that your idea is likely to scale well, you can retest the idea by introducing it in just a few locations before fully scaling up production. If the initial result was accurate, and your idea is scalable, it’ll perform well in these markets. If your idea doesn’t perform well in these new markets, it’s a sign that your initial results may have been misleading and that your idea may not scale.

(Shortform note: When testing your idea in new markets, ensure that your test period is long enough to gain accurate data. Experts note that test data can be impacted by factors such as initially ineffective advertising and “honeymoon periods” in which sales of new products are temporarily inflated. To account for these factors, new market tests should be at least six months long, and ideally even longer.)

#### Red Flag #2: Dependence on Talented Individuals

The next red flag List advises you to look out for is dependence on talented individuals. Specifically, List argues that **if the primary driver of your success is the talent of one or several above-average performers, your idea will not scale**. Ideas that depend on talented individuals fail to scale simply because it’s impossible to scale a human being—while you can continue to hire the best available talent, you can’t replicate an individual’s unique talents and abilities.

For example, suppose you’re the owner of a shop that sells hand-forged kitchen knives. You’ve succeeded thus far because of the strengths of the craftsmen you hired—they’re experienced artisans who work together to create unique, beautiful designs. Thrilled with your success, you look into opening franchises in other cities. However, when conducting interviews, you realize that almost none of the candidates meet your lofty standards—as it turns out, knifemaking is a unique skill that only a few individuals put in the time to master. Unless you’re willing to compromise on quality, you probably won’t be able to find enough staff to scale your business.

(Shortform note: As List notes, organizations that rely too heavily on individual talent often struggle to keep finding such talented employees. However, dependence on talent can also leave you susceptible to other scaling pitfalls. Specifically, experts note that successful business founders frequently struggle to apply their entrepreneurial talent to long-term management of their firms. If your company got off the ground thanks to the pluck of a gifted founder, the same founder may become an obstacle to scaling, unless they develop management skills or switch roles.)

Just as talented individuals cannot be scaled, systems designed by exceptional people cannot always scale. List notes that **technology developed and tested by especially talented people can sometimes fail to scale when implemented across an entire organization.** This happens because tech experts don’t struggle with the same kinds of problems as average people. When new technology is only tested by the experts, those experts might fail to notice design flaws that hamper wider, less adept audiences. Testing new technologies with an audience that accurately represents the average intended user of your product can help mitigate this effect.

(Shortform note: Not only do talented developers tend to create technology that regular users can’t grasp, but those experts are also often ill-equipped to educate others on how to use their products. According to some authors, the greater your skill in any given discipline, the more difficulty you’ll have teaching laypeople about it. In _Team Topologies_ , Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais recommend that you create dedicated teams of educators tasked with training the rest of your workforce to efficiently handle even complicated pieces of software. Otherwise, your productivity may suffer while untrained users struggle to work things out for themselves.)

#### Red Flag #3: Unintended Consequences of Scale

Another red flag to look out for as you try to scale your ideas is unintended consequences of scale, or as List calls them, “spillover effects”. List notes that at scale, ideas often produce unintended effects, both positive and negative. Failing to account for the potential negative effects of scaling can prevent you from successfully scaling your ideas.

(Shortform notes: In addition to impacting your idea’s scalability, unintended consequences can also impact the world around you. For instance, as your company scales up manufacturing, its operations may have an increased effect on the environment and the health of the surrounding area. While these kinds of unintended consequences may not necessarily affect your bottom line, they could have severe consequences. As you monitor your organization for financial consequences, be sure to look out for non-financial consequences, too.)

List notes that unintended consequences of scale often occur because markets naturally tend to stabilize after being disrupted—because of this principle, when a new product enters the market, it may experience an inflated level of success due to its price point, its novelty, or other factors. However, as suppliers of similar products adjust their prices and offerings, and consumers adjust their spending and expectations**, a new product’s initial advantages can diminish, leading the new product to gradually lose steam as the market readjusts around it**. As a result, ideas that initially seem to be scaling well may wind up struggling in the long run.

(Shortform note: As businesses scale up, they often standardize their procedures across their many locations to provide customers with a consistent experience. However, if your product’s advantage is a strong brand identity, standardization can cause this identity to become diluted as an unintended consequence of scale. For example, experts note that as Starbucks scaled up, it experienced a cultural crisis. After standardizing procedures across their thousands of stores, Starbucks executives found that the stores had begun to lose their identity as cozy coffee houses. Instead, they more closely resembled fast food locations.)

For example, List notes that during his time at Uber, the company attempted to increase driver earnings by raising fares across the board. While this initially caused drivers to earn more, over time, the increased cost led riders to book fewer trips, causing driver earnings to return to their previous level as the market readjusted.

(Shortform note: Despite Uber’s rationale for keeping both fares and pay rates low, many rideshare drivers have continued to demand raises, striking and advocating for legislation that would increase their earnings. These drivers argue that pay increases are necessary to keep up with inflation. At least in part due to these protests, in March 2023, New York City’s local government passed legislation that increased rideshare driver wages within the city by about 9%. How the market will readjust remains to be seen at the time of this writing.)

##### The Unintended Consequences of Workplace Social Dynamics

Unintended consequences of scale can also stem from certain workplace dynamics. As you scale your organization, you’ll inevitably have to hire more employees. **With an increasingly large workforce, the relative costs of social problems such as demoralization, poor communication, and employee turnover can become increasingly severe** due to the effects of scale.

Suppose, for instance, that due to its demanding environment, your startup maintains a 40% annual turnover rate. Given that you only employ 10 people, this high rate of turnover likely won’t feel unmanageable, as it only equates to hiring one new employee every few months. However, suppose that your business scales up, growing in size to the point where it employs a workforce of 1,000 people. If your business maintains its high turnover rate at scale, to remain fully staffed, it will have to go through the costly and time-consuming process of hiring dozens of employees each month. While it wasn’t such a big deal when your workforce was small, at scale, managing turnover becomes exponentially more expensive.

(Shortform note: While List argues that unwanted workplace dynamics become increasingly costly at scale, some authors believe that larger organizations are often better equipped to deal with workplace toxicity than smaller organizations. These authors argue that at scale, most organizations have the resources to staff and train HR departments that can help repair broken workplaces. By contrast, in small organizations, where each member of the team is intricately involved in the day-to-day, negative workplace dynamics may be allowed to fester while other issues take precedence.)

It’s also common to run into unintended consequences of scale when adopting a new network or system at your organization. Generally, **even if a new system is more efficient and effective in the long run, your organization will experience lower productivity as individuals adjust to it**. At a smaller organization, these setbacks may seem relatively minor. However, at scale, even slight changes in productivity can be costly.

For example, if your organization decides to change platforms for internal communication, switching from email to a more modern platform like Slack, your workforce will likely experience a temporary dip in productivity. If your small business only deals with thousands of dollars a week, a 5% to 10% decrease in productivity isn’t such a big deal. However, if your business is operating at a larger scale, dealing with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars each week, even a 5% change in productivity represents a large sum.

(Shortform note: While there is a short-term cost associated with switching platforms, you should also consider the opportunity cost of not switching to a new system. As experts note, whenever you choose to use one piece of technology over another, you pay an opportunity cost equal to the value of the strongest option you didn’t choose. In other words, you miss out on all the benefits the other system would have provided you. To put this in concrete terms, consider Southwest Airlines’s December 2022 meltdown. Southwest’s antiquated software caused thousands of flights to be canceled, ultimately resulting in a net loss of roughly $800 million. In this case, $800 million is the cost Southwest paid for not choosing a stronger system.)

##### The Unintended Consequences of Wage Transparency

A common source of unintended consequences is organizational policy around wage transparency. According to List, **wage transparency can have a variety of positive and negative effects depending on how it’s implemented at your organization**. To avoid the negatives and benefit from the positives, List recommends taking a considered approach to wage transparency.

List conducted a study on the effects of wage transparency to better understand which practices produced the best results. In the study, employees worked harder when they knew how much their managers were being paid, as they aspired to get promoted and earn those wages for themselves. However, when employees knew how much other workers at the same level were being paid, they became resentful and demotivated if any of their peers were earning more than them. Based on the results of this survey, the best approach would be to let employees know what the average employee makes one step up the ladder—that way, your workforce will have something to aspire to, without knowing what their peers make in enough specificity to become resentful.

> **The Many Effects of Wage Transparency**
> 
> As List notes, wage transparency can have both motivating and demoralizing effects within an organization, depending on its implementation. However, wage transparency can have an even wider range of effects on your workforce than List describes.
> 
> In terms of additional negative effects, wage transparency may cause some of your employees to quit outright. In one organization’s survey, 5% of participants said that they’d quit their jobs if they learned someone in the same role was earning more. Staff leaving their positions could have major ramifications for your organization, especially if they’re in important roles.
> 
> As a more-or-less neutral effect, experts observe that wage transparency policies often result in the flattening of earnings curves within a single role. Put simply, when wage transparency policies are enacted, employees in the same role will also begin to receive similar pay. This happens as a result of supervisors attempting to prevent employees from being disgruntled at someone else’s elevated rate. In response to flattening pay curves, employees often request individual incentives, viewing bonuses as a way of both earning more and distinguishing themselves from their peers.
> 
> This increased demand for bonuses based on personal performance creates a unique opportunity to create fair and transparent workplace incentives. When employees request individual incentives, experts recommend that you implement an individual performance-based bonus system that is identical for all employees in a particular role. By implementing a system that’s the same for everyone, yet still rewards individual efforts, you’ll have created a motivation system that is as egalitarian as possible.

#### Red Flag #4: Runaway Costs

List’s final red flag is runaway cost. **Runaway costs occur when per-unit expenses unexpectedly increase as your organization scales**. Generally, as you scale up a product, your unit cost should decrease, since you'll be able to take advantage of increased efficiency and lower component cost, while overhead costs remain the same. However, if your idea’s unit cost increases as you scale up, it may not become profitable, leading your idea to fail at scale.

(Shortform note: Runaway costs are especially common in organizations that purchase cloud computing services for internal use. While the convenience of cloud computing is attractive to many startups, experts note that the cost of cloud services can skyrocket as your organization scales. This effect occurs because vendors usually charge for each element of their cloud services as a recurring expense, much like a subscription. This means that as your organization scales up, its growing use of storage and other services also becomes a recurring expense. By contrast, when you use traditional, in-house computing infrastructure, upgrading storage or processing power is a relatively simple, one-time fix that comes at a flat fee.)

To avoid being blindsided by runaway costs, when calculating your costs and setting prices before launching a product, **overestimate your costs to account for the unexpected**. By overestimating your costs, your business can remain profitable even if you end up having to spend more money than you’d like.

For example, suppose you’re a new restaurant owner, and one week, your fridges fail, causing all your ingredients to spoil. If you had overestimated your costs beforehand, and set aside extra funds for unexpected expenses, you’d be able to afford to replace your stock. However, if you haven’t planned for unexpected expenses and have emptied your bank account just getting the restaurant open, you’ll likely have to close up shop at least temporarily, while you figure out your next steps.

(Shortform note: While List recommends leaving room in your budget for unexpected expenses, he doesn’t specify how much money to set aside. According to some experts, for small businesses, you’ll want to reserve an additional 20% of your organization’s total budget to be truly prepared for unexpected costs.)

List also recommends doing whatever you can to lower your overhead cost before your product launches. By lowering your overhead, you’ll be able to introduce your product to the market at the lowest possible price point, which will allow you to target a wide audience. Additionally, the lower your overhead costs, the sooner you can make them up and begin to profit.

(Shortform note: Permanently switching to remote work can be an especially effective tool for reducing overhead costs. While many businesses shifted to remote work by necessity during the Covid-19 pandemic, major companies such as Yelp, Airbnb, Spotify, and Lyft have embraced remote work as a cost-cutting measure. As a growing portion of the workforce seeks remote work, going fully remote may be a win-win in terms of attracting talent and lowering overhead costs.)

### How to Scale Successfully

Once you’ve gone through the author’s red flags and determined that your idea is likely to succeed at scale, it’s time to put your ideas into action. As you scale your idea, List recommends a few strategies to help give your idea its best chance to scale successfully: Set the right incentives, avoid the sunk cost fallacy, and build a positive organizational culture.

#### Incentivize to Win

List’s first strategy for successful scaling is setting the right incentives to motivate your team. List argues that **incentives are a more effective focus than leadership style or personality** when it comes to managing your workforce at scale. It’s better to focus on incentives than leadership style because as we’ve learned, talented individuals don’t scale, making it impossible to replicate the unique qualities of gifted leaders across your organization. However, incentives are much more easily scaled as blanket policies across your organization.

(Shortform note: While List fervently advocates workplace incentives, other authors have argued that incentives have little to no effect on employee performance. These authors argue that at best, incentives cause employees to briefly attempt to change their behavior before reverting to their prior patterns. According to this school of thought, incentives actually distract employees from the work itself. Incentives lead employees to view the work as an obstacle they must overcome to earn a bonus, which leads them to lose interest in the work altogether.)

List recommends taking advantage of loss aversion when setting incentives. According to List, **people are generally more motivated by their fear of loss than by their desire to gain**. To take advantage of this element of human nature, pay out performance bonuses for a given period of time before the period begins, letting employees know that they’ll have to repay the bonus if they don’t hit their targets. When employees get the incentive up front, they’ll be more motivated to work hard to keep it, thanks to loss aversion.

For example, suppose you’re a parent, trying to motivate your 16-year-old to work harder in school. To get them to study, you could offer them an incentive based on their interests—this could be a new videogame, new clothes, or anything else they’re interested in. To take advantage of loss aversion, you’d want to give your kid their reward at the beginning of the semester, and let them know that they’ll only be allowed to keep it if they dedicate a certain amount of time to studying or achieve a certain grade. Based on List’s principle, your child will work harder to protect the reward they’ve already been given than they would to earn a potential future reward.

(Shortform note: According to List, incentives that use loss aversion are more powerful than traditional bonuses. However, in some studies, loss aversion incentives produced an unexpected decrease in workplace productivity. Researchers believe that when employees are presented with loss aversion incentives, they become more incentivized to avoid loss than to pursue success. For example, a salesperson who was presented with loss aversion incentives might adopt a conservative strategy, focusing on not blowing sales calls, instead of focusing on closing them.)

According to List, social incentives can also be powerful motivational tools. As we learned when discussing List’s red flags for scaling, workplace social dynamics can impact performance. Social incentives make use of the interpersonal factors that motivate your employees. Specifically, List notes that **people tend to work harder when they know that their performance is being monitored** , in a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect. By letting your employees know that you’re tracking their performance, giving them clear targets, and offering them encouragement, you can take advantage of the Hawthorne effect to get the best out of your workforce.

For example, suppose you’re the manager of the sales department at an insurance company, and you want to use the Hawthorne effect to encourage your staff to make an extra effort. A simple way to do this would be to set and communicate goals for each employee, and then let your staff know that you’ll be checking in regularly on their progress toward those goals. Thanks to this gentle nudge (using the Hawthorne effect), you’d likely see a bump in productivity.

> **Does the Hawthorne Effect Exist?**
> 
> List’s proposed social incentives rest on the assumption that the Hawthorne effect is a near-universal phenomenon. However, there is still significant disagreement within the scientific community about whether the Hawthorne effect even exists.
> 
> Some researchers have argued that in the study in which the effect was first described, there was insufficient evidence to infer a causal relationship between observation and behavioral change. According to a meta-analysis of the literature on the Hawthorne effect, while many studies demonstrate some evidence for the effect’s existence, most studies of the Hawthorne effect contained methodological inconsistencies that may have compromised their results. These findings suggest that further research is necessary to concretely establish the existence of the Hawthorne effect.

#### Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy

In addition to offering the right incentives, as you scale your ideas up, List advises that you take steps to avoid succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy. **The sunk cost fallacy is the human tendency to invest additional time and resources into failing projects** in an attempt to salvage resources that have already been invested in the project. In these situations, you should pull out of the failing project, as doing so minimizes your losses and maximizes the time and resources you’ll be able to invest in more fruitful projects.

(Shortform note: As Dobelli notes in _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , overcoming the sunk cost fallacy can be difficult because it inherently involves the uncomfortable task of admitting your mistakes. Instead, those who fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy continue to invest in their failing enterprises, hoping that they’ll eventually become successful, in which case their decisions would be retroactively vindicated.)

(Shortform note: While List offers separate sections on identifying diminishing returns and giving up optimally, we’ve merged them to condense the strategies for avoiding the sunk cost fallacy.)

##### Don’t Be Afraid to Give Up

List offers a strategy for avoiding the sunk cost fallacy: Give up. **To prioritize your best ideas, you need to recognize when an idea isn’t scaling and give up on that idea as quickly as possible**. When you’re able to quickly give up on failing ideas, you minimize your losses and free up resources so that you can successfully pivot to another project.

(Shortform note: List’s recommendation to abandon struggling projects is primarily aimed at executives and other organizational leaders who are tasked with protecting and efficiently directing their organization’s resources. However, if you’re a project manager, it may be in your best interest to try to revitalize your projects, instead of giving up on them. Experts note that your reputation as a project manager is often directly tied to the success or failure of projects you manage. You can boost your reputation and increase your chances of advancement by learning to turn around floundering projects.)

When you think it might be time to give up on an idea, List recommends that you consider alternative ways you could spend your time and resources. For example, if you think it may be time to pull the plug on a specific product feature, ask yourself what else you could do with the resources currently allocated to the project. If there are other ideas or features that seem more lucrative, exciting, or scalable, it’s probably time to give up and move on.

(Shortform note: If you’re not sure whether you should give up on a project, consider getting an outside perspective. In _Rework_ , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson recommend that you ask a coworker for advice any time you’re stuck on a project for longer than two weeks. In many cases, your coworker will be able to provide fresh ideas and solutions that help you make progress. And, if it turns out that your project is irreparable, your colleague’s distance from the project will often allow them to identify the problem when you’re unable to do so yourself.)

##### Identify Diminishing Returns

List notes that ideas that aren’t scaling properly often suffer from diminishing returns. **Diminishing returns are a phenomenon in which profit margins per unit decrease as production scales up**. As we learned when discussing runaway costs, for an idea to scale successfully, cost per unit needs to decrease as the business scales.

(Shortform note: As you retool your ideas to address diminishing returns, avoid compromising on quality. In _Profit First_ , Mike Michalowicz notes that in trying to cut costs, many entrepreneurs try to save short-term costs by lowering the quality of their goods and services. While reducing product quality can temporarily help your bottom line, in the long run, it may cause you to lose customers to competitors who provide better products.)

To identify diminishing returns, you need to interpret your data correctly. List notes that many organizations fail to identify diminishing returns because they focus on the wrong metrics—for instance, on the average profit per unit. Instead of focusing on your average profit margin, List recommends that you calculate the profit margin on the most recent unit sold. If it’s lower than your average margin, you may be experiencing diminishing returns. If this is the case, it may be time to give up.

(Shortform note: A common economic strategy for optimizing production is identifying the point of diminishing return. The point of diminishing return is the point beyond which producing additional units results in decreased cost efficiency—you can accurately estimate this using equations that take into account your production and your output. Generally, it’s most efficient to produce your product at the point of diminishing returns. Below that point, you aren’t taking full advantage of your resources, and beyond it, you’ll begin to experience diminishing returns.)

#### Build Teamwork and Diversity Into Your Culture

Lastly, List argues that you should focus on building a sustainable culture while you scale your ideas. Specifically, List writes that **cultures that embrace collaboration and diversity do well at scale**.

As your organization grows, collaboration becomes increasingly important. When an organization is in its infancy, the drive, talent, and ideas of one or two individuals may be enough to propel it forward. However, as we know, talented individuals don’t scale. Instead, as your organization grows, its success will depend on clear and efficient communication within a larger group of employees.

To incentivize teamwork, List suggests assigning each employee to multiple teams, which will help ensure that ideas are shared across your organization and help employees invest in the success of the organization as a whole.

> **Learning to Collaborate at Scale**
> 
> Experts note that collaboration often comes naturally to small businesses in their early years, but as they scale, these businesses often struggle to continue collaborating. At young companies, there are usually fewer employees who work together more closely than at larger organizations. These employees tend to form strong bonds that enable them to collaborate informally and effectively. However, as an organization grows, it becomes impossible for each member of a team to build a deep relationship with everyone else. Because of this, as your organization scales, you’ll have to implement policies that lay the groundwork for effective collaboration.
> 
> To set your organization up to cooperate efficiently at scale, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais recommend, in _Team Topologies_ , that you assign staff to smaller teams and provide guidelines for how teams should interact and communicate with each other. And, as Patrick Lencioni argues in _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , you can financially incentivize teamwork by offering bonuses based on the teamwork output.

Along with collaboration, diversity helps organizations to succeed at scale. **Diversity enables your organization to solve problems creatively** , as individuals from a variety of backgrounds will naturally bring a variety of perspectives, ideas, and problem-solving tools to their work.

(Shortform note: Diversity can also help boost employee retention. Studies have shown that in addition to the benefits List describes, cultivating diversity can also help your organization keep its best employees. Over time, as those employees continue to innovate and excel within your firm, the strength of your workforce may become a competitive advantage for your organization.)

**List argues that you must demonstrate a real commitment to diversity to recruit a diverse workforce**. Specifically, List notes that diversity statements fail to attract many candidates when they’re not paired with policy and action. However, when organizations commit to hiring candidates from minority groups and simultaneously commit to treating employees well and fairly regardless of their backgrounds, word gets around, which leads more strong minority candidates to apply.

(Shortform note: As part of your efforts to create a positive environment for a diverse workforce, experts recommend educating your current workforce on workplace diversity. To keep the diverse range of employees you hire, education can help ensure that your current staff welcomes all new hires and treats them with fairness and respect. Without educating your staff, you run the risk of mistreating and alienating your new hires, which may ultimately cause them to leave your organization.)

#### Be Accountable

List notes that even as you try to build a positive culture that embraces collaboration and diversity, you will sometimes make mistakes. When these things happen, List stresses that **the best thing for your organization is for you to take responsibility for your actions and offer an apology.**

(Shortform note: As a corollary to the rule that you should apologize for any mistakes that you’re responsible for, you should avoid apologizing for things that aren’t truly your fault. Research has shown that apologizing when you’re not in the wrong can lower your self-esteem and lead others to view you as incompetent. For example, suppose you run a logistics company, and one of your shipments is delayed due to a hurricane making local roads impassable. While you should communicate to your client that the shipment will be late, you shouldn’t apologize, as this will cause the client to infer that the delay is your fault when in reality it isn’t.)

**When offering an apology, note that money speaks louder than words**. For example, if some of your employees feel they’ve been underpaid or mistreated on the basis of their race or gender, they’ll probably respond more positively to an apology that includes a wage increase than to an apology without financial compensation.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that apologies that don’t include some form of reparative action aren’t real apologies. According to these experts, to make a genuine apology, commit to rectifying the situation and ensuring that it doesn’t happen again. In business-related conflicts, reparative action often includes a financial angle, as List describes. However, reparative action can take many forms and should be carefully chosen to correct your organization’s errors. For example, if one of your factories accidentally leaks pollution into the local environment, you could dedicate organizational resources to funding cleanup efforts that will help mitigate the negative impact of the spill.)

However, don’t be too quick to apologize, especially in situations that are likely to recur. **Apologizing too frequently lowers the value of each additional apology** , especially if you’re unable to fix the issue you’re apologizing for. For example, if you run a delivery service, and five-minute delays due to traffic variance are unavoidable, you probably shouldn’t offer an apology each time. It’ll only make the user more upset if another order gets delayed.

(Shortform note: Apologizing too frequently can be a difficult habit to break, but there are ways to make the process easier. For one, experts recommend that you practice thanking people in situations where you habitually apologize. For instance, if you ask a schoolmate for help with an assignment, instead of apologizing for bothering them, you can simply thank them for their time.)
