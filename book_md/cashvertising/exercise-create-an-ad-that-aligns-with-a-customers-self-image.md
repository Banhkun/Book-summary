## Exercise: Create an Ad That Aligns With a Customer’s Self-Image

Tailor a hypothetical ad to align your product with your customer’s current or aspirational image of themselves.

* * *

Devise a real or imagined product to sell and note its name below. If possible, choose a product you’re familiar with either as a consumer or through your work.

Determine what self-image the customers for this product have. How would someone who is likely to buy your product see themselves (or _like_ to see themselves)? (For instance, if your product is a state-of-the-art standing desk, your customers probably see themselves as professional, experienced, and successful).

Now, decide how you can craft an ad that makes your product appear to reinforce the customer’s identity. You might consider using some of the other techniques Whitman mentions, like combining logic and emotion, writing visually, and using an effective layout. (For instance, you might include compelling facts about how your product is made from premium materials. You could feature a photo of an astronaut using your desk in space to associate it with expertise and professionalism. Finally, your ad copy could conjure a vivid image of someone becoming a top employee thanks to the desk.)
