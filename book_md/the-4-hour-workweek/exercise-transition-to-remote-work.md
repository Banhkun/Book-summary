## Exercise: Transition to Remote Work

There are two methods for transitioning to remote work: the five-step method and the hourglass method.

* * *

What are some logistical problems you might encounter if you transitioned to remote work? Are there parts of your job that would be hard to do remotely?

How important are they? How would you do them remotely if you had to?

How could you make yourself more valuable to your boss and company? Think of an event or training sessions that you could ask to attend.

Which of the two methods do you think would work better for you? Why? Remember that the five-step method involves slowly transitioning to remote work, and the hourglass method involves going fully remote, then pulling back to part-time trial remote, then slowly transitioning back to fully remote.
