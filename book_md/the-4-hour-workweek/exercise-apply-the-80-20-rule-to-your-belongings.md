## Exercise: Apply the 80/20 Rule to Your Belongings

Having a lot of material possessions creates a lot of mental clutter.

* * *

Think about the material possessions that you own. What possessions fall into the top 20%? Consider which possessions make you happy, are useful, or allow you to do things you want to. For example, if you love to play the guitar, your guitar would be in your top 20%.

What possessions fall into the bottom 20%? Consider which of your things take up a lot of space or that you never use. For example, if you bought a mouthguard because you wanted to get into rugby and then later discovered you hated rugby, the mouthguard would be in your bottom 20%.

What are the negative consequences of getting rid of anything on your bottom 20% list? Are any of them permanent?
