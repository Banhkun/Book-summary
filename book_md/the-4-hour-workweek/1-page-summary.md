## 1-Page Summary

Most people want to be millionaires so they can quit their day jobs, travel, buy nice things, spend time with the people they care about, and pursue a hobby or a passion. However, in _The 4-Hour Workweek_ , entrepreneur, consultant, and life coach Tim Ferriss argues**** that**you don’t need a million dollars to have a millionaire lifestyle.** We’ll describe each of his steps to creating this life, examine why some of his recommendations are particularly effective, and explore alternatives and counterarguments to other suggestions.

Ferriss says there are two ways non-millionaires attempt to live the retired millionaire lifestyle:

1\. _Postponers_ follow the conventional system of working for 30-40 years and then retiring. However, they use up the prime physical years of their life working, then either run out of money or lose the ability to enjoy their money while they’re traditionally retired.

(Shortform note: The average age of retirement is trending up, so postponers might find themselves delaying retirement even longer than expected. A Gallup poll from 2021 found that the average retirement age was 62—Gallup’s 2020 poll reported that the average retirement age was 61, and its 1991 poll reported the average retirement age was 57.)

2\. _Lifelong retirees_ live the millionaire lifestyle throughout their lives, alternating brief periods of work with lengthy pseudo-retirements. Their goal is to spend as little effort and time to make as much money as possible. **_The 4-Hour Workweek_ teaches you how to become a lifelong retiree by building a business that makes you enough money to live on, while not taking much of your time. **

> **What if You Don’t Want Your Own Business?**
> 
> Ferriss’s advice in this book is, essentially, to create a strong source of passive income so that you can afford to quit your day job. He suggests doing so by creating your own company and then automating it, but there are other methods for earning money without having to work continuously.
> 
> For example, in _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ , Robert Kiyosaki says that financial independence comes from _investing:_ In other words, putting your money into things that you expect to provide ongoing returns. Common examples of investments include retirement accounts, stocks, and rental properties. According to Kiyosaki, the goal of investing is to eventually live entirely on those returns so that you’re never forced to work again.

Ferriss says that you can achieve a millionaire lifestyle by following a four-step process, which he illustrates with the acronym **DEAL: Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate.** Each section of this guide will explore one of those four steps.

First, we’ll discuss how to**decide what you _want_ to do. **In other words, if you were freed from your time-consuming obligations, what would you do with your time? Next, we’ll explore how you can **streamline your schedule—** figure out which time-consuming activities you can get rid of _now_ to make your day job less onerous. Third, we’ll show how to use your newfound time to **create your own business**(what Ferriss calls your “muse”).**** It’ll be a lot of work at first, but eventually you can automate that business to provide passive income. Finally, once your business is earning enough money and no longer needs much input from you, you can **retire and start living like a millionaire.**

### Step 1: Decide What You Want to Do

The first step in Ferriss’s process is to identify what you would do if you didn’t have to spend your time working. This step also involves identifying—and overcoming—the fears that hold you back from living your dreams.

#### Envision Your New Lifestyle

To begin, picture what your new lifestyle will look like. Ferriss says you should imagine your dream lifestyle, then put those dreams on a timeline of three, six, or 12 months. He calls this process _dreamlining._

**First, list five items for each of the following: things you want to _have_ , things you want to _do_ , and things you want to _be_.** Make these as specific as possible. For example, don’t say that you want to “travel”—write down the actual places you’d like to visit and what you want to do there. **Once you have your 15 dreams written down, go back over the list and choose your top four.**

(Shortform note: As Richard Rumelt explains in _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ , having a limited number of clear and specific goals narrows your focus, which helps you direct your attention and resources effectively. If you have too many goals, or if your goals are too vague, then your efforts to reach those goals will be unfocused and ineffective—it would be like trying to get stronger by doing a dozen different exercises one time each. While _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ is a business guide rather than a lifestyle guide, the principle of focusing your efforts applies whether you’re trying to build a business or improve your personal life.)

**Next, calculate how much money you’d need per month** in order to do all four things you chose,**then increase that number by 30%.** This will give you your target monthly income, with a built-in buffer against unexpected expenses.

> **How Much Do You Really Need?**
> 
> Ferriss is urging you to live a balanced life: Instead of pushing to make as much money as possible, figure out how much money you _need_ and how you’ll enjoy your life once you have it. Robin Sharma’s fable _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ illustrates the difference between a workaholic, money-obsessed lifestyle and a balanced one using the character Julian Mantle.
> 
> At the start of Sharma’s book, Julian is a high-profile lawyer who makes enormous amounts of money. However, he works so hard that he never takes the time to enjoy what he has, and the stress of his job leads to health problems that culminate in a heart attack.
> 
> Later in the story, Julian sells nearly all of his material possessions, trains and meditates with the (fictional) Sages of Sivana, and thereby finds inner peace and balance. In short, by giving up his obsession with wealth and professional success, Julian finds a much different and—according to Sharma—more meaningful kind of success: health and happiness.
> 
> While _The 4-Hour Workweek_ is hardly urging you to sell everything you own and become a monk, Ferriss’s question is similar to Sharma’s: How much do you _really_ need to be happy?

**Finally, come up with three actionables for each dream** : One you can do today, one you can do tomorrow, and one you can do the day after tomorrow. Do the first action for each of your dreams _right now._

(Shortform note: Doing something _today_ to start working toward your dreams can help overcome procrastination and boost your motivation. In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson says that most people think motivation comes before action, but in reality motivation and action create a positive feedback loop. Manson believes that taking a step toward a goal—no matter how small that step is—inspires you to keep working.)

#### Mitigating Fear

Now that you’ve figured out your dream lifestyle, it’s time to identify what might hold you back from achieving it. Ferriss says that **most people hold themselves back out of fear of the unknown—** they choose to be unhappy in a familiar situation rather than take a chance on an unfamiliar one.

If your fears are holding you back from making a change, Ferriss suggests examining them by asking yourself the following questions:

  * What’s the absolute worst thing that could happen?
  * If the worst possible thing happened, how would I fix it?
  * What’s the thing that’s _most likely_ to happen? (Hint: It’s not the worst thing.)
  * How would I undo this change if I needed to? (In other words, what’s your escape plan?)



(Shortform note: Ferriss is advising us to gain control over our fears by examining them rationally. Therefore, it might be helpful to know why we experience fear in the first place. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach says that fear is a natural response that warns us of danger and prepares us to react. However, she adds that fear responses often go far beyond what’s necessary to keep us safe; we’re constantly tense and on guard, even when there’s no threat nearby. Her solution to fear is to recognize it, accept it as a natural but unnecessary feeling, and allow it to rise up and fade away in its own time—a practice called mindfulness.)

### Step 2: Streamline Your Life

Ferriss’s second step to becoming a lifelong retiree is to eliminate things that take up time you’d rather use for something else. To free up time, reduce the time you spend on emails, calls, and meetings, and remove unimportant commitments from your schedule.

#### Do Only What’s Important

Most of us probably approach our chores and tasks by managing our time, prioritizing, and finding efficient ways to get things done. However, Ferriss says**the best way to save time is to do only things that matter, and stop doing everything that doesn’t.** To do this, keep two principles in mind: The 80/20 rule and Parkinson’s Law.

**The 80/20 rule (the Pareto principle):** This rule states that 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort. Therefore, you can greatly reduce your efforts without having a large negative impact on your outcomes. For example, imagine that you sell magazines, and that 80% of your orders come from 20% of your customers. If you completely ignored any customer who wasn’t in the top 20%, you would lose customers, but you’d still retain 80% of your orders. You’d also save a great deal of time, which you could use to do something more profitable.

(Shortform note: In _The One Thing_ , Gary Keller __ suggests taking the Pareto principle to its extreme: Once you’ve whittled down your activities or ideas to the most important 20%, do it again to find the most important 20% of _those_ activities. Repeat the process until you’re left with only the single most important activity you do: the titular “One Thing.”)

**Parkinson’s Law:** This law states that a task will take as much time as you give it; a corollary states that the more time you devote to a task, the more significant that task seems. For example, if you give yourself five days to write an essay, it’ll take you five days and feel extremely daunting; if you start two hours before the essay is due, you’ll get it done in two hours and feel like it was no big deal.

(Shortform note: Even if you understand Parkinson’s Law, it can be helpful to have someone else set the deadline for your work. Many people find it hard to set their own deadlines and keep themselves on task without external motivation.)

**In order to stop doing things that aren’t important, apply both laws—** only do the 20% of your tasks that give you the greatest return, and give yourself short deadlines for each of those tasks.

#### Minimize Unnecessary Time-Consumers

Ferriss says when you work a day job, there are three categories of work that take up your time unnecessarily: busywork, routine work, and work that requires input from someone else. He explains how to identify these time wasters and offers suggestions for minimizing the time you spend on them.

##### Busywork

Busywork happens when people pile unimportant tasks onto you, either because they don’t want to handle those tasks themselves or because they want you to “look busy.” Therefore, Ferriss suggests avoiding busywork by limiting people’s access to you.

He says that people will try to access you in three ways, and he offers suggestions for limiting each:

  * **Email:** Only check your email twice a day, and set up an auto-reply that explains this to anyone who emails you. Include a phone number in your auto-reply so people can still reach you with urgent matters. 
  * **Phone:** Set up two numbers, one for urgent inquiries and one for non-urgent. Answer the urgent number and set the non-urgent one to go straight to voicemail. Like your email, check your voicemail only twice a day, and record a message explaining that to callers.
  * **In person:** Avoid meetings, especially those that don’t have a clear agenda or end time. If someone tries to get you to go to a meeting, suggest they email you instead, claim that you have another commitment, or go to the meeting and then leave early. Also, avoid informal chats in your office or cubicle—put up a “do not disturb” sign, wear headphones, or pretend to be on the phone.



> **Practice Rejection**
> 
> Ferriss’s advice to say “no” to people who try to take up your time—to reject them—can be difficult to put into practice. In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson says that people fear rejection—both being rejected and having to reject others—because rejection is unpleasant no matter which side of it you’re on. However, Manson argues that rejection is an important skill that everyone should practice; if you say “yes” to everyone and everything, you’ll end up stuck in situations that make you unhappy, and unhappiness is what you were trying to avoid in the first place.
> 
> This ties into Ferriss’s points about people taking up your time because modern culture (and especially modern workplaces) often set the unhealthy expectation that anyone can contact you at any time for anything and expect you to respond. Ferriss is urging you to _reject_ those expectations and the people who set them; instead, set clear rules regarding when and why you’ll give people your time.

##### **Routine Work**

Routine work consists of repetitive and time-consuming tasks that need to be done. Ferriss suggests you **handle these tasks by doing them all at once, at a scheduled time, instead of handling them as they come up.**

  * For example, if you have to go shopping every couple of days to restock the store, you could save a lot of time by planning ahead and buying a week’s worth of supplies all at once. 



(Shortform note: In _The Effective Executive_ , Peter Drucker suggests dividing your time into blocks—making each block as large as possible within your schedule—and devoting each block to a particular task or type of task. In this case, you might create a time block of four or five hours within your weekly schedule, and devote that block entirely to these routine tasks. Drucker argues that by setting aside time and focusing your efforts in this way, you’ll handle tasks more effectively and reliably than if you try to handle tasks in smaller time increments.)

##### **Work That Requires Someone Else’s Input**

Work that requires someone else to get involved can eat up time for both you and the other party. Ferriss suggests you**minimize these interruptions by establishing clear rules that empowers others to act without your input in as many situations as possible.**

  * For example, if employees need a manager to approve returns, that forces employees to waste time waiting on the manager and also forces the manager to interrupt his or her own work. To avoid this inefficiency, the boss might create a blanket rule that employees can handle returns for, say, $50 or less without approval.



> **Empower Employees**
> 
> Employees who need managerial approval for basic tasks (like taking returns) are _disempowered_ —they can’t do anything beyond what they’re explicitly told or allowed to do. This situation is frustrating for the employees and inefficient for the company.
> 
> In _The Leadership Challenge_ , leadership experts Barry Posner and James Kouzes say that there are two aspects to employee empowerment:
> 
>   * **Self-determination:** They can decide for themselves how to handle situations, rather than waiting on approval for anything even slightly out of the ordinary.
> 
>   * **Accountability:** With the power to make decisions comes responsibility for the outcomes of those decisions. That means that your employees should accept credit for their good decisions and accountability for bad ones. Note that “accountability” shouldn’t mean “punishment,” but rather responsibility for fixing whatever problems their decision caused.
> 
> 

> 
> If you’re the boss, try taking steps to empower your employees. If you’re an employee, try to empower yourself by making your own decisions and accepting responsibility for them; if that’s not possible, quit and seek a job that will let you do so.

Ferriss adds that you can save a great deal of time each week by transitioning to remote work. If you aren’t in a position to work remotely, or to make the previously mentioned changes to your workflow, Ferriss suggests quitting and looking for a less time-consuming job.

(Shortform note: Besides saving time by skipping the daily commute, Ferriss might not have anticipated other benefits of remote work, such as increased job satisfaction and increased productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many companies to transition to remote work—and even when restrictions were lifted and workplaces opened back up, many employees still chose to work from home.)

### Step 3: Create and Automate Your Own Business

Ferriss’s third step toward living the retired millionaire lifestyle is to **build your own business and set it up to run itself with minimal input from you.** That way, you’ll have a reliable source of income without having to spend much time working.

#### Find Your Niche

To begin earning without working, start a particular kind of business the author calls a “muse.” The goal of this business isn’t to make the world better or to generate a lot of money so you can sell the company in 20 years. **The goal is simply to make steady, reliable money with as little time and effort as possible.**

There are three steps to creating an automated business. Ferriss warns you not to start manufacturing anything until you’ve done all three steps:

**Step 1: Brainstorm niche markets.** Start by choosing a market where there will be demand for your product. Look for a small, niche market where you won’t have to compete with big companies (and their big advertising budgets). **Choose a market that you’re personally familiar with and have a means of advertising to** —for instance, through magazine or online ads.**** For example, if you’re an athlete, you might choose martial artists as your market.

(Shortform note: In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , the authors __ describe a niche market with little competition as the titular “blue ocean,” a patch of clear and open water where you don’t have to compete for limited resources (customers). Many companies enter “red oceans” instead—crowded markets with fierce competition—because they mistakenly believe that they have to go to where the demand is, instead of _creating_ demand with an innovative new product or service. In other words, they smell the “blood in the water,” but they end up competing with larger and stronger companies.)

**Step 2: Brainstorm products.** Come up with possible products that would serve the niche markets you brainstormed above. Ferriss believes that **your best bet is selling an _information product_ —like a book or online course—that you create yourself.** You don’t have to be an expert to create an information product, you just have to know more about the subject than your customers. Such products are ideal for a muse business because they’re cheap and fast to create, can sell at a large markup, and are hard to copy or knock-off.

Continuing the previous example, you might sell a prerecorded, martial arts-themed workout. Once you’ve filmed the workout, it’s cheap and easy to make copies of a DVD or distribute the video online.

> **Make Something Remarkable With the “Purple Cow” System**
> 
> It’s not enough to make a product that you can reproduce cheaply—it also has to be something that people will be interested in. Marketing maven Seth Godin says there are so many products on the market today that a product has to be truly exceptional in some way (for example, in quality, price, or appearance) to attract customers.**** In _Purple Cow_ , he __ offers a two-step system for creating these “purple cow” products—products that stand out from the crowd as much as a purple cow would stand out from a herd of plain brown cows:
> 
>   * **Find the absolute edges of possibility.** Brainstorm the most extreme ideas possible for your product. For example, if you’re making a martial arts DVD, you could hire a celebrity martial artist to help you make and advertise it.
> 
>   * **Decide which edge of possibility you’ll go toward, and how close you can get to that edge.** Study the list of ideas you just brainstormed, and choose the one that’s most likely to get the results _you want—_ for example, giving away your DVD for free would be extreme and remarkable, but it wouldn't help you make money. Next, figure out how close you can get to achieving that idea; you probably couldn’t afford a UFC champion to help make your DVD, but it might be possible to get a retired fighter who’s looking for work.
> 
> 


**Step 3: Test your product ideas.** Study your competition to find a way to make your product different, then create an ad that highlights those differences. Next, reach out to your target market to see how many people are interested in your product. Finally, figure out if your product will be profitable by comparing your advertising budget to your potential income from selling to the interested people. If the numbers don’t add up in your favor, revise your product or your advertising (or both) and try again.

For example, many martial arts workout DVDs exist, but perhaps yours is the only one that includes specific exercises for increasing the power of your side kick. In that case, you’d make an ad emphasizing your unique exercises, then conduct some basic market research to see if enough people are interested in strengthening their side kicks to make this a worthwhile endeavor.

(Shortform note: There are many free and helpful tools that can help you do the market research Ferriss recommends here. For this issue, a particularly helpful tool is SurveyMonkey, which allows you to create a free account and send surveys to potential customers (also for free). This is a fast and convenient way to reach a large number of people.)

#### Automate Your Business

Once you’ve come up with a product and started your own business, make the switch from running your company to having your company _run itself_. Ferriss says that there are three phases of automation, based on sales:

**Phase 1: You’ve shipped 0-50 products in total.** According to Ferriss, in this first phase your business is too small and too new to automate. Therefore, **you’ll be personally involved in every aspect of the business** —including talking to customers, taking orders, packing, and shipping. To upgrade to Phase 2, use what you learn from chatting with customers to tweak your website and advertising, and look into getting a merchant account at a small bank so you’ll be ready for growth.

(Shortform note: While the ultimate goal is to make money, your first priority in this early stage should be learning what your customers want and what they’ll pay for. In _The Lean Startup,_ Eric Reis says that one of the most common reasons new companies fail is because they overlook chances to learn and adapt their business practices—instead, they go into business with a single plan and refuse to deviate from it. If you want your business to grow to the point that it can support your retired millionaire lifestyle, it’s crucial to avoid that pitfall.)

**Phase 2: You ship a few products per week.** You’re still involved during this phase, but you can bring on a local fulfillment company. Ideally, look for a fulfillment house that’s willing to respond to order status inquiries from customers, won’t charge you setup fees or monthly minimums, offers net-30 terms (you have 30 days to pay after the invoice date), and has at least three good references.

> **Choosing a Fulfillment House**
> 
> A fulfillment house (or fulfillment center) is a warehouse that handles packing and shipping orders for you. In a business where you’re selling physical products, choosing the right fulfillment house is key to keeping your company running smoothly. _Forbes_ suggests a five-step process for finding the best fulfillment house for your business:
> 
>   * **Gather your data.** Before you approach fulfillment centers, prepare clear, organized, and comprehensive data about how many different products you have, how many of each you sell (on average), and how much each product weighs.
> 
>   * **Determine the ideal location** that’s reasonably close to where most of your products are going. For instance, if most of your business comes from the East Coast, you don’t want a company whose warehouses are on the West Coast (or vice versa).
> 
>   * **Find centers that work in your niche.** Some fulfillment houses specialize in products that might not be appropriate for your business. For instance, if you sell books or DVDs, don’t use a center that specializes in construction materials.
> 
>   * **Analyze proposals.** Once you have a list of fulfillment centers in the right area and the right market niche, examine their offers to determine which one is best for you. Consider not only the cost, but also the speed and quality of their fulfillment services.
> 
>   * **Make your choice.** Pick a fulfillment center that best meets your current needs. As your business grows and expands, you can always end this contract and switch to a larger company if need be.
> 
> 


**Phase 3: You ship more than 20 products per week.** Ferriss says that, at this point, you’re ready to remove yourself from the business almost completely. By the time you’re finished with this step, your business should require a few hours of your time each week _at most._ Furthermore, your company should be profitable enough that you’re ready to leave your day job and live on this income stream.

There are two steps to getting your business fully automated:

1\. **Research and sign up with a large fulfillment company, a credit card processor, and a call center**(if you want to take phone orders). Ideally, choose companies that already work together to avoid any communication hiccups among them.

(Shortform note: As a counterpoint, Chris Guillebeau says in _The $100 Startup _that outsourcing your business in this way actually increases the amount of time you have to spend managing it, because you no longer have direct control over your products. While that’s still more efficient than trying to process and fulfill a large number of orders yourself, Ferriss’s idea that you can fully disengage from your business may not be realistic.)

2\. **Decrease interactions with customers and streamline your customer base.** Customers buy your products, but they also take up your time. Therefore, Ferriss suggests focusing your efforts on customers who order frequently, don’t ask a lot of questions, and seldom return items. Send infrequent and time-consuming customers to your retailers, or just ignore them.

(Shortform note: In _The $100 Startup,_ Guillebeau explains that there are two ways to grow your business: _horizontally_ (expanding your customer base) and _vertically_ (deepening your relationship with your existing customers). Dismissing infrequent or “annoying” customers seems counterintuitive when you’re trying to maximize profit, but Ferriss is really suggesting that you grow your business vertically: Focus on creating a small but loyal customer base that will spend a lot of money on your products while not demanding a lot of your time.)

### Step 4: Start Living Your New Life

Ferris’s final step to living the retired millionaire lifestyle is to achieve the dreams you defined in the first step. You’ll **leave your day job, try out retirement, and settle into your new lifestyle.**

#### Retire and Live the Millionaire Life

Ferriss suggests you take several months to disconnect from your old lifestyle and settle into your new one by taking a “mini-retirement”. **If possible, spend time in a different country—if you stay near your home, you run the risk of being drawn back into your old lifestyle.**

Ferriss recommends taking this time to learn how to _do nothing.****_ Learn that it’s okay not to be busy and productive all the time. Make anonymous donations to break yourself of the need to be recognized and praised for what you do. Learn a new skill, take up a new hobby, or volunteer your time to stave off boredom and find new ways to feel fulfilled.

Finally, when you get back from your mini-retirement, look over your list of dreams and timelines. You might find that you’ve accomplished some of your dreams, or that some were less fun or fulfilling than you imagined. Then, update your dream list as needed.

> **A New Place for a New Life**
> 
> Among other benefits, travel can help you reinvent your identity—which is exactly what Ferriss wants you to do with your new retired millionaire lifestyle. There are a few ways that traveling and living in another place can help change the way you see yourself and the world around you:
> 
>   * **You’ll learn about different places and people** , which might cause you to reevaluate some aspects of your own life and culture. You may find new ways of thinking about familiar concepts or discover cultural values that you’d like to adopt for yourself.
> 
>   * **You’ll learn about yourself.** Being in strange (and occasionally stressful) situations helps you discover more about who you are. For example, are you the type of person who eagerly drinks in a strange culture, or does it make you uncomfortable?
> 
>   * **It provides a clean break with the past.** Traveling can help you with major transitions or lifestyle changes—you might find yourself thinking in terms of “pre-travel” and “post-travel,” as if you’re a different person or living a different life.
