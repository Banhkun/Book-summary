## Exercise: Delegate to a Virtual Assistant (VA)

You can save yourself a lot of time by hiring a VA to do tasks for you.

* * *

What are some specific, time-consuming, remote-friendly tasks that you do in your personal or professional life?

How could you delegate the above tasks to a VA? Think about how you would phrase your instructions.

For the above tasks, what timelines you would give, and what kinds of rules you would set up?

What are some tasks that you really hate doing or that make you uncomfortable?

Could you delegate these uncomfortable tasks to a VA? Think of ways you could make the task specific and remote-friendly. For example, if you hate mowing the lawn because youâ€™re allergic to grass, you could ask your VA to set you up with an affordable landscaping service.
