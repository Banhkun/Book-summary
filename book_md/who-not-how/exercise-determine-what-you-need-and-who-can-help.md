## Exercise: Determine What You Need and Who Can Help

Use this exercise when you need to figure out exactly what you need help with, and who can help you do it. Note that this exercise works just as well for personal problems as it does for professional ones.

* * *

Describe the project you’re attempting to complete or the problem you want to solve. (For example, maybe you want to eat healthier)

Explain what your goal is. Why do you want to solve this problem or complete this task? What do you stand to gain if you succeed, and what will you lose if you fail? (For example, you want to lower your cholesterol and improve your cardiovascular health so you’ll be around to see your grandchildren grow up.)

Explain the value of achieving your vision. How does it impact the world, your community, or the people involved in it? (For example, improving your health will allow you to rejoin the tennis club, to play with your grandchildren, and to participate more actively in your business.)

Describe the outcome you desire. What does the _successful_ completion of this project look like? (For example, you want at least two of your meals each day to be planned and prepared by someone else, and you want to be able to run again.)

Look over your answers and consider: Who can help you solve this problem? What kind of person are you looking for? (For example, you’re looking for a personal chef with a background in nutritional science, and a trainer used to working with older clients.)
