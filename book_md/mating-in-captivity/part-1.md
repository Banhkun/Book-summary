## Part 1: Individual Desire | What Is Desire/Eroticism?

_Mating in Captivity_ defines eroticism, or desire, as **sex with imagination**. Imaginative sex is a quest for pleasure through play⁠—creative, curious, unselfconscious, goalless play.

**Eroticism, sex, and love are all interrelated, but they’re not interchangeable⁠—they’re not even related in a predictable and linear way, and sometimes, they’re contradictory.** Eroticism can be present or absent in both love or sex, and sex can be more or less than an extension of an emotional relationship. For example, for some people, a loving, committed relationship makes them feel free to experiment with sex and eroticism. Other people can have sex with someone regardless of whether or not they love or desire them. And finally, you actually don’t even need the act of sex to have an erotic experience; desire is about excitement and pursuing pleasure.

There are some ingredients inherent to desire: mystery, risk, aggression, uncertainty, and fascination with power. These characteristics conflict with many of the values of modern relationships such as security, intimacy, and fidelity. Even though the ingredients of love and desire clash,**the author of _Mating in Captivity_ , couples therapist Esther Perel, believes it’s possible to retain desire in a committed relationship.**

While everyone’s desire is driven by the same general intangibles, everyone also has their own individual sense of desire, shaped by their childhood, culture, and personality. Part 1 will address how our families and fantasies shape our individual desire.
