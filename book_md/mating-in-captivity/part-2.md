## Part 2: Desire Within Relationships | Chapter 5: Approaches for Rekindling Desire

In Part 1, we looked at the factors that contribute to our individual sense of desire. In Part 2, we’ll look at the factors that influence our desire for our partners.

There are at least two ways to approach a bad, boring, or non-existent erotic life: quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative approach has merit in certain situations, but because eroticism is abstract, looking at it qualitatively will nearly always be more revealing.

#### The Quantitative Approach

Many people approach desire problems using the same methods they would to approach any problem in their life: break the problem into small steps, create a concrete plan, and work hard. **However, this approach reduces sex to physical achievement⁠—successful sex becomes a matter of whether or not a man has an erection.** This definition of success not only bypasses desire, it places the importance on the man’s genitals rather than the man himself, and it focuses on the person with the penis rather than whomever they’re with.

Additionally, mainstream solutions for bad sex are usually aimed at performance, reliability, and regularity. However, this focus can actually make a struggling sex life worse. Numbers and averages are just one more thing to worry about in addition to waning desire. And anything resembling routine can diminish desire, because the ingredients for desire are mystery and the unknown.

#### The Qualitative Approach

This approach recognizes that eroticism is subjective, contradictory, illogical, and sometimes inarticulate. Eroticism doesn’t respond well to time management, explicit communication, or quantification. **Eroticism is about play, and you can’t win play or attach goals to it⁠—the whole point is to have fun.**

That said, however, there are times when the quantitative approach can be useful. If you have physical limitations, communication problems, lack knowledge, or have no free time, a practical solution such as consulting a doctor, working on your communication, informing yourself, or better managing your time may be necessary.
