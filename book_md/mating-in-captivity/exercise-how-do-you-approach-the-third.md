## Exercise: How Do You Approach the Third?

There are three ways to approach the threat of infidelity: try to control it, acknowledge it, or invite it into your relationship.

* * *

Who or what is your third? Remember that the third can be a real person, a fantasy, or the life you might have had if you’d chosen to be with someone other than your partner.

Would you prefer to ignore your third, acknowledge it, or invite it in? Keep in mind that whichever you choose, your partner would do the same with their third.

Consider one of the options that you didn’t choose in the previous question. How would your relationship change if you chose that option instead?
