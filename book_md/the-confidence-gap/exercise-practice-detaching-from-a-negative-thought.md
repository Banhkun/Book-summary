## Exercise: Practice Detaching From a Negative Thought

Using Harris’s three-step process, practice detaching from a negative thought.

* * *

Think about the last few days: Did you have any negative thoughts that prevented you from doing something or that simply dampened your happiness? Categorize that thought as a barrier, self-judgment, comparison, or prediction, and write the category here.

Now, label the thought in a way that’s helpful to you. You might describe the type of thinking (“comparing myself to others”) or come up with a funny or evocative name for the thought (“Mister Woe-is-me,” for instance).

Now, write down the full thought or say it mentally or out loud. If you’re writing the thought, you might even do so in an application where you can modify the appearance of the text. Then, practice changing how the thought looks or sounds: Experiment with altering the font, color, and size of the text, or with saying the thought out loud in a silly voice or to the tune of a song. There are even free online voice modifiers that can make your voice sound like a robot, cartoon character, or alien.

Finally, reflect on how the last step makes you feel. Does the thought seem less real to you? Have you achieved some distance between yourself and the thought? Do you think that if you detach from this thought the next time it appears, you’ll be able to continue doing what you were doing in spite of it? Note any reflections below.
