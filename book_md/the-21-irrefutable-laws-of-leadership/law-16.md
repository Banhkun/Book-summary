## Law #16: Leaders Harness Momentum

**Sometimes, momentum can be the only thing that makes the difference between success and failure.** Think of momentum like a freight train. It takes a lot of energy to get the train moving from a standstill. Initially, it moves slowly. Until it speeds up, even small obstacles like twigs can stop it. But once it gets going, it can plow through anything.

**Keep in mind that momentum doesn’t always bring positivity.** The train can be full of money, or it can be full of garbage. Whether or not you want the freight, once the train is moving fast, it’s hard to stop it.

There are some keys to momentum:

  * **Momentum has a magnifying effect.**
    * Example #1: When a sports team is in a slump, no matter what coaches and athletes try, nothing seems to help.
    * Example #2: In basketball games, when a team is starting to get on a streak—starting to develop momentum—the other team’s coach will call a timeout to try to dissipate the momentum.
  * **Momentum makes leaders _look_ disproportionately good.** When things are going well, it’s easy to only see the positives.
    * For example, older leaders may not be as good as everyone thinks they are, and younger, newer leaders are usually better than everyone gives them credit for.
  * **Momentum makes followers _perform_ disproportionately well. **Followers not only _appear_ better than they are, but actually _perform_ at a higher level. 
    * For example, the 1980 US Olympic hockey team shouldn’t have won the gold medal. They weren’t as good as the other teams. But leading up to the gold-medal game, they got on a roll. They beat tough teams, including the Russians, and had so much momentum no one could stop them. 
  * **Momentum is hard to start but easier to maintain.**
    * For example, recall the freight train analogy. It’s hard to get a really heavy piece of equipment moving. Once it’s moving, though, it doesn’t take as much energy to keep it going, or to steer it.
  * **Momentum is the best way to create change.** When something is working, even if it’s new and different, everyone wants to be on the winning side. 
    * For example, when a sports team starts winning, everyone starts supporting them, even if they weren’t previously interested in the sport, and sometimes even if they would normally cheer for a different team.
  * **Momentum is created by leaders.** Creating momentum requires vision, motivation, and a good team, and leaders can encourage momentum by celebrating and rewarding accomplishments. Followers can get on board with momentum, and managers can use it, but leaders are the ones who _start_ it.



### Example of Failed Application of the Law: Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Division

The cofounder of Pixar was Ed Catmull, a failed animator who studied physics and math and eventually found his calling in computer animation. Catmull developed new software and dreamed of making computer-animated full-length films. George Lucas hired Catmull and Catmull put together a strong team including John Lasseter, who had formerly worked at Disney. Catmull’s team produced the “Genesis” sequence in _Star Trek II_ , and while it was groundbreaking, Catmull still wasn’t able to convince Lucas to let him make a feature film. **Though Catmull’s division had passion, resources, and a good team, it _didn’t_ have momentum.** Lucas sold Catmull’s division to Steve Jobs.

### Example of Successful Application of the Law: Pixar

Steve Jobs named the division Pixar and put five million dollars into it. Pixar made a short film called _Luxo Jr._ , which is about a “parent” lamp and a “child” lamp. At the time, computer-animated films were mainly attended by industry experts who wanted to know technical information about how the film was made. After the first audience saw _Luxo Jr._ , one of the first questions was whether the “parent” lamp was mom or dad. _Luxo Jr._ wasn’t just showing off new technology, it was telling a story and connecting emotionally with an audience. The film was nominated for an Academy Award. This first success moved Pixar forward, but only slowly. They did good work and won an Oscar, but still only had enough money to survive.

Lasseter tried pitching Disney a one-hour animated special. Instead, Disney asked for three full-length computer animated films. **This first break started Pixar’s momentum—and once it had momentum, it couldn’t be stopped.** The first film they made was _Toy Story_ , and while there were obstacles, Pixar had enough forward momentum to overcome them. The movie was far more successful than even Jobs had predicted and this success buoyed several more—17 Oscars and 42 patents (Shortform note: As of the time of writing in 2007).
