## Appendix: Leadership Checklist

The following checklist contains a question about each of the 21 laws of leadership. When your answer to the statement is yes, check it off. The more checkmarks you have, the more laws you are applying.

  * When I encounter a problem, I ask myself, “How can I get other people to help me solve this?” instead of “What can I personally do to fix this?”
  * When I ask my colleagues to do something, do they do it even if I don’t have any leverage over them?
  * Do I make time, at least once a week, to practice and study leadership?
  * When I make a goal, do I prepare a concrete, specific plan to achieve it?
  * Do I consider the needs of others above my own?
  * When a project goes wrong, am I honest about its status?
  * Do other leaders follow me?
  * Do I often make the right decision, even if I can’t explain exactly why?
  * Have I intentionally surrounded myself with people who have different skill sets than my own?
  * Do I know the name of everyone who works for me?
  * Have I intentionally recruited people to my inner circle?
  * Do I put my followers in charge of projects?
  * Do I practice what I preach?
  * Do people follow me, even if I don’t have a good idea?
  * Do I strive for victory at all costs?
  * Do I regularly demonstrate enthusiasm, even if I’m not feeling that motivated?
  * Do I regularly delegate tasks?
  * When I have to give something up to achieve my goals, do I do so?
  * Do I consider the current conditions before embarking on a project?
  * Do I spend 80% of my time on the top 20% of my people?
