## Shortform Introduction

In _Stumbling on Happiness,_ Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert presents a fundamental problem with humans’ quest for happiness: In the present, you make choices and take actions to bring about future events that you believe will make you happy. However, those choices and actions _don’t_ always make you happy and often make you actively _unhappy_.

Gilbert’s explanation for this is that your imagination (which you use to envision the future and what will bring you the most joy), your memory, and your perception of the present are largely inaccurate. When you use these inaccurate and poorly-informed visions of the future, present, and past to make choices about what to do in the future, your choices are often poor and hinder future happiness. This means that frequently, the best way to find happiness is not to deliberately plan for it but to simply _stumble_ upon it by accident.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Random House

_Stumbling on Happiness_ was published in 2006 and won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books the following year. It was on the _New York Times_ best-seller list for six months and sold over a million copies across the world.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

Just before turning his attention to happiness, Gilbert primarily studied the fundamental attribution error: the human conviction that others’ actions are the result of their personality while _our_ actions are the result of external circumstances. It was only when he went through a prolonged period of personal difficulty that he began wondering why we so often mispredict how we’ll feel in the future and what will make us happy. This led Gilbert to conduct experiments on humans’ ability to predict their future emotional states. His findings from this research formed the foundation for _Stumbling on Happiness._

_Stumbling on Happiness_ is part of an ever-growing body of work on positive psychology: the study of human happiness. However, the book occupies a unique space in this field because it doesn’t offer actionable advice on how to be happy, instead focusing on why we’re wired to sabotage our future happiness. Other positive psychology works that offer a more action-oriented approach to achieving happiness include:

  * Dan Harris’s _10% Happier_ —Retired journalist Dan Harris outlines his journey to greater happiness through meditation and mindfulness and shows how you can do the same. 
  * Russ Harris’s _The Happiness Trap_ —Harris proposes you escape the happiness trap—the constant and anxiety-provoking pursuit of happiness—by accepting suffering in your life. 
  * Jay Shetty’s _Think Like a Monk_ —Shetty argues that you can achieve lasting peace and happiness by adopting the mental habits of monks. 



#### The Book’s Impact

_Stumbling on Happiness_ is widely acknowledged as an important and valuable contribution to the field of positive psychology and popular science literature, as evidenced by its receipt of the Royal Society Prize for Science Books—an award for popular science books previously given to Stephen Hawking and Bill Bryson. The book has also turned Gilbert into a sought-after expert for educational TV shows, documentaries, and talks.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Stumbling on Happiness_ has received largely positive reviews. Reviewers found Gilbert’s arguments clear, his evidence strong, and his writing style humorous and engaging. They also appreciated Gilbert’s comprehensiveness. He includes more than _just_ enough information to support his thesis: Instead, he explores in detail how our minds work (and often fail to work as expected). Finally, satisfied readers argue that anyone with an interest in human cognition, not just in human happiness, will find something interesting and useful here.

Readers who didn’t enjoy the book felt that its title was misleading—they expected to learn _how_ to stumble on happiness. Others felt that Gilbert’s explanations were too long and that the book was padded with unnecessary background and tangential information. A final complaint was that Gilbert’s writing style was too slick and that he wrote flippantly about serious subjects, like death and suffering.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

As discussed above, _Stumbling on Happiness_ is not a self-help book about how to find happiness: It’s a book about decision-making and imagination and how these faculties _fail_ to produce the happiness we think they should. Gilbert offers no advice on how to _counteract_ our tendencies to make predictions and choices that limit our happiness, focusing only on _how_ and _why_ we do so.

Much of the book is an explanation of how our minds work, backed up by scientific evidence. The main idea—that our imaginings of the future, memories of the past, and perception of the present are fabricated and thus form the foundation for poor choices that don’t make us happy in the future—takes up relatively little page space. This is, in large part, a necessity, as some of Gilbert’s principles are complex and require significant background information to grasp. For instance, he must explain first how selective and subjective memory is before he can describe how a selective and subjective memory forms the basis for poor decisions about the future.

However, at times, Gilbert arguably gets lost in the finer points of his research and doesn’t spend enough time explaining his thesis. For instance, he dedicates a lot of page space to describing how our personal definitions of happiness differ, a point that’s not central to the book’s main idea.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Gilbert breaks his book into six parts. In the first part, “Prospection,” he describes why humans think about the future in the first place. In the second part, “Subjectivity,” Gilbert explains why it’s difficult to discuss happiness objectively and presents ways for us to overcome the obstacles to doing so.

The next three parts—the bulk of the book—describe the three major flaws of the human imagination that cause you to make poor choices about your future. Gilbert labels these parts “Realism” (your failure to imagine the future accurately), “Presentism” (your tendency to imagine the future based on events and experiences in the present), and “Rationalization” (your tendency to rationalize even initially terrible decisions as positive). In each part, he dives deeply into the cognitive processes underlying each individual flaw, as well as the problems that each flaw causes.

Gilbert then concludes with a part called “Corrigibility,” in which he explains why we can never correct these three flaws of our imaginations.

Gilbert’s structural choice of attributing a detailed part to each flaw of the imagination means the reader develops a firm understanding of each _individual_ flaw and how it occurs. However, this siloed structure, with very little information connecting the flaws to each other and to the rest of the book, can make it easy to lose track of the book’s overarching thesis: that, because you fabricate a large part of your perception of reality, you use incorrect information when making decisions about the future and consequently become unhappy. In particular, since Gilbert explains the neurological origin of each flaw in great detail, it’s easy to become bogged down in explanations of human cognition and fail to connect these explanations to the thesis.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Rather than structuring this guide to make the three individual flaws of the human imagination our focal point (as Gilbert does), we’ve structured it around Gilbert’s central thesis that, because we manufacture our reality, we use poor information when determining what to do in the future. Each part contains an explanation of one section of his thesis:

**Part 1: Why It’s Difficult to Talk About Happiness:** Before we get into Gilbert’s central argument about why we make happiness-reducing decisions about the future, we’ll describe five reasons why it’s difficult to objectively talk about happiness in the first place. We’ll also present two propositions that will allow us to nonetheless have a constructive conversation about human happiness.

**Part 2: You Fabricate Your Reality:** This part presents the first section of Gilbert’s main argument: that your memories, perception of the present, and imaginings of the future are fabricated and not objective depictions of reality. We’ll show how these three faculties are, in large part, constructed.

**Part 3: Your Fabricated Reality Leads You to Make Poor Choices:** In this part, we’ll continue Gilbert’s argument by showing that you aren’t aware that your mind fabricates your memories, perception of the present, and imaginings of the future. This lack of awareness leads you to think you’re seeing reality exactly as it is. When planning your future, you base your decisions about what to do to find happiness on this fabricated reality. Because the information you’re using to make decisions is inaccurate, those decisions end up _reducing_ your happiness.

**Part 4: Six Poor Choices About What to Do in the Future:** Here, we’ll present six types of common poor choices that result from the process described above.

**Part 5: You Can’t Make Better Choices About Your Future:** We’ll conclude the guide by showing how you’ll fail to correct your decision-making in the future. Even when you try to learn from others’ experiences, you’ll end up heeding poor advice and ignoring good advice.

To create a clearer logical progression between ideas, we’ve rearranged the ideas from Gilbert’s three parts about flaws in imagination. Specifically, we’ve separated the information about how each flaw works, how they lead to poor choices, and the specific poor choices that they trigger into three distinct parts (Parts 2, 3, and 4).

We’ve also moved the ideas in Gilbert’s first part, “Prospection,” into Part 2.3, about our flaws when imagining the future, to group together ideas about _how_ and _why_ we imagine the future and thus improve the flow of logic.

Our commentary in this guide covers several areas: We'll explore how Gilbert's ideas about decision-making link to other facets of human cognition, such as cognitive biases, memory, and self-image. We’ll also connect Gilbert’s ideas to those in other prominent books on decision-making. Additionally, we’ll offer actionable solutions to some of the cognitive obstacles that Gilbert feels we can’t overcome. Finally, we’ll point out when some of the cognitive processes Gilbert thinks _hinder_ our decision-making have valuable functions in other areas of thinking.
