## Exercise: Reflect on the Impact of Risky and Safe Choices

Consider the effects of risky and safe choices, and explore which type of choice you might ultimately pursue.

* * *

Briefly describe a recent choice you had to make between something risky and something safe. (For instance, you might have been deciding between staying in and going to a party where you didn’t know anyone.)

What did you feel was at stake if you made the risky choice? What did you feel you’d gain by making the safe choice? List as many risks and gains as you can. (For example, you might have feared having no one to talk to if you go to the party. On the other hand, if you stayed in, you could watch TV and be comfortable.)

Now, knowing that you find meaning in adversity following poor decisions, what might be some ways you would have justified or derived meaning from the risky choice if it went poorly? Conversely, what would you lose by making the safe choice? (For example, if you went to the party and you didn’t know anyway, you might have justified attending as a good choice because you learned how to make better small talk. If you made the safe choice, though, you would have regretted not having the chance to meet someone new.)

Based on your answers to the above, if you had the chance again, would you make the risky choice or the safe choice? Explain your answer.
