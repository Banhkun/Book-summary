## Exercise: Recognize There’s Information That Doesn’t Support Your Beliefs

Strengthen your awareness that you base your beliefs and actions only on _certain_ information—usually, information that you agree with—and that you therefore _interpret_ your reality, rather than view it objectively.

* * *

Note some of your current lifestyle choices and habits. These could include dietary choices (Are you a vegan or vegetarian, for instance?), exercise choices (Do you exercise regularly? At what time of the day?), recreational choices (How do you spend your free time? Playing sports? Watching TV?), or any other conscious choice you’ve made about how to lead your daily life.

Now, briefly write down the beliefs that underpin those lifestyle choices. Why have you made these dietary, exercise, recreational, or other choices? (For instance, you might believe that humans should protect the environment, which led you to adopt a freegan diet. Or you might believe that heavy exercise more than twice a week can damage your body, which is why you never exercise more frequently than that.)

Describe the information you received that led to the beliefs you outlined above. What did you learn, see, or experience that formed the basis for your beliefs? (For example, you learned about climate change in school, which led you to believe you must protect the environment. Or you saw your father damage his ankle on his third run of the week, which led you to avoid frequent, heavy exercise.)

Next, consider what alternate information would _undermine_ your beliefs. You don’t have to substantiate it—just think of ideas or data that would force you to believe the opposite of what you now believe. (If you were to learn, for instance, that humans don’t cause climate change, you might not believe that we have a duty to protect the environment. Or, if you were to learn that exercising every day is the best way to avoid injury, you’d no longer believe that exercising more than twice a week can harm your body.)

How does considering the possibility of alternative information make you feel about your habits and the beliefs that underpin them? (For instance, do you now feel unsure whether or not exercising more than twice a week truly _is_ unhealthy? Are you feeling intrigued and open to researching this—and possibly changing your habits as a consequence? Or do you feel validated because the alternative information wouldn’t convince you to change your ways?) Explain your answer.
