## Part 5: You Can’t Make Better Choices About Your Future

In the last part, we described six types of poor choices you can make about your future. Now, let’s conclude by talking about potential solutions to correct these poor choices—and why, in Gilbert’s view, none of these solutions work.

We’ll first cover solutions based on personal experience—in other words, using your memories of past events to correct your decision-making in the future. We’ll then talk about solutions based on the insights of others—using the experiences and learning of others to inform your decision-making.

### Trying to Make Better Choices Using Memories

You might be tempted to think that you can use your memory of past poor choices to make better decisions about the future, writes Gilbert. But this is impossible because your memory is faulty in several ways we’ve already discussed: It’s made up of snippets of an experience, not the experience itself, and you constantly rewrite memories based on new information. This means that you rely on fabricated memories when trying to correct decisions, which leads to poor outcomes.

Your memory misrepresents the past and keeps you locked in a cycle of making poor choices about your future in three specific ways:

#### Error #1: You Remember Uncommon Experiences More Than Common Ones

First, you believe that extraordinary events in your past are more likely to reoccur than they are, writes Gilbert. This means **you _base decisions_ on the expectation that extraordinary events will happen, when they probably won’t**.

You believe this because your mind recalls memories of extraordinary occurrences more readily than ordinary ones, claims Gilbert. Ordinary events and outcomes—like taking the train and arriving at work without incident—happen all the time, so your mind doesn’t register them as vividly as uncommon events and outcomes—like taking the train and being re-routed to a different city. You therefore overestimate the frequency and dominance of extraordinary events.

This means that when weighing a decision about the future, writes Gilbert, you’ll more readily recall unique, extraordinary instances in the past when the option that normally doesn’t make you happy, _did_ make you happy. Based on this selective memory, you’ll therefore choose the option that probably won’t make you happy, thinking it’s more likely to generate happiness than it really is _._

Here’s an example: You subscribe to a monthly wine delivery service and can choose between Plan A, which offers a high variety of wines, or Plan B, which offers a low variety of wines but more wines you enjoy. You’re currently on Plan A, and you need to decide whether to stay on this plan or switch to Plan B.

You have many memories of not enjoying the high variety of Plan A and wishing you’d picked the consistency of Plan B. But when deciding which plan to continue with, your mind will favor a memory of an _extraordinary_ instance in which you _preferred_ the high variety of Plan A. Your mind _won’t_ rely on the ordinary majority of your memories in which you _disliked_ high variety. Therefore, despite your intention to correct your decision-making, you still make a poor choice by re-selecting Plan A based on your more easily recalled yet extraordinary memory of enjoying it on one occasion.

> **Using Uncommon Experiences and Overcomplicated Considerations**
> 
> Gilbert claims that because your mind highlights memories of strange occurrences over commonplace ones, you believe strange events are more likely to occur in the future than they really are. You therefore base your choices about the future on uncommon past events.
> 
> In _Thinking, Fast and Slow, _Daniel Kahneman describes a similar way your brain triggers poor decisions: by overcomplicating those decisions. Rather than relying on straightforward information and simple considerations—tantamount to using memories of commonplace occurrences to inform our choices—we give more weight to unimportant factors and favor complicated considerations over simple ones—which is similar to using unusual, extraordinary memories to inform our choices.
> 
> In this way, when considering which wine delivery plan to get, you might use unimportant factors and make a complicated consideration by thinking: “If I have a big dinner party next year, I’ll need a wide variety of wines. And because I normally don’t drink wine in the summer, I’ll probably want to give away many bottles to friends during that time. I should, therefore, opt for Plan A.” (This complicated consideration could even be based on a memory of a past extraordinary instance in which you did have a big dinner party and required a variety of wines, or one unusual summer in which you gave a lot of wine away.) It would be better, Kahneman would argue, to simply think about what wine you like and then purchase the plan that has the most of that wine.

#### Error #2: You Remember the End of Experiences More Than the Rest

Another reason Gilbert says you can’t rely on memories to correct your decision-making is that you remember the _ends_ of experiences more than the _bulk_ of experiences. This means you look at a _narrow_ _piece_ of an experience—the end—to inform your decision on whether or not to pursue the _whole experience_ again. If the end doesn’t reflect the overall experience, you make the same mostly-poor choices again and again, laments Gilbert.

For instance, if you went on an amusement park ride that you mostly disliked but which had a great final loop, you might go on the ride again because you recall only the final loop and not the bulk of the ride. This is a poor decision because you disliked the vast majority of the ride: Back on the ride, you’ll wonder why you thought it would be a good idea to do it again. When you get off, though, you’ll once again only recall the great final loop, and this will again lead you back to the mostly-average ride.

(Shortform note: The fact that you remember the _end_ of an event more strongly than the _bulk_ of the event means you can build more happiness into your life by manually improving the ends of experiences. For instance, you might salvage a bad dinner out with friends by going out dancing afterward. Going forward, you’ll remember the great time you had dancing more than the bad dinner, making your memory a generally happy one. You can also use this knowledge to urge yourself through the low points of an experience to get to the payoff. Rather than writing off a bad dinner and heading straight home, stick it out: You can still create a happy memory by ending on a high note.)

#### Error #3: You Remember How You _Should_ Have Felt, Not How You Really Felt

The final reason your memories can’t help you correct your decision-making is that you reconstruct memories to reflect how you think you _should_ have felt at the time rather than how you _did feel_ , says Gilbert. This means **you don’t remember your true emotional reaction to an event and can’t learn from it**.

Here’s an example: You hated going to your sister’s wedding. However, you believe that you _should_ enjoy weddings because _everyone_ enjoys weddings. Therefore, you’ll falsely remember yourself as having been happy at the event. This prevents you from correcting your decision-making in the future, and you’ll RSVP “yes” to another wedding that will, in reality, not be fun for you.

(Shortform note: One way to better remember how you truly felt, rather than how you believe you _should_ have felt, is to journal about your feelings. By noting down when you’re having an intense emotional reaction to an event and what, specifically, you’re feeling, you create a reliable historical account of your feelings to which you can later refer and learn from. Journaling can even help you _make sense of_ your feelings if you’re confused or overwhelmed about an event. This further reduces the chances that you’ll misremember or misinterpret how you felt about that event later.)

### Trying to Make Better Choices Using the Insights of Others

We’ve just shown that you can’t correct your decision-making based on your memories, as your brain misrepresents your lived experiences. Because you don’t recall experiences as they actually happened, you make the same bad decisions over and over.

Let’s now look at learning from the insights of others. If we can’t use our own experiences to make better choices, can we use the experiences of those who’ve made similar choices in the past? Unfortunately, writes Gilbert, we _could_ , but we don’t. This is for two reasons: We believe the incorrect information we receive from others, and we ignore the correct information we receive from others.

(Shortform note: There are likely additional reasons beyond the two Gilbert outlines for why we don’t act on the insights of others. In _Thinking, Fast and Slow, _Daniel Kahneman writes that our pride can prevent us from accepting hard evidence that we were wrong about something in the past. Our pride can conceivably also cause us to ignore evidence from others that we may be wrong about the future: If we think we’ll ace a test, we may ignore the warning of someone who already took the test and found it difficult because believing them would mean accepting our initial assessment was wrong.)

Let’s look at each reason in more detail:

#### Reason #1: You Believe Incorrect Information From Others About What Makes You Happy

Gilbert writes that we often believe inaccurate information about what makes us happy because of the nature of that particular information: Some incorrect information about happiness is able to perpetuate itself because**it encourages people to take the actions that spread it**. Let’s illustrate this using the incorrect information that having kids makes you happy:

Your parents pass this information on to you at a young age, and you later act on it by having kids. You then tell your kids that having their own kids will make them happy, since you believe it’s true—it’s what everyone always told you, after all. Eventually, your kids have kids, too, who they tell to have kids, and the cycle continues. In this way, the information “having kids makes you happy” self-perpetuates, because it encourages people to keep producing the next generation who’ll learn and spread the information.

Yet, argues Gilbert, this information is incorrect: People with kids _aren’t_ happy. They report low levels of happiness from childbirth until their kids go to college. The reason we perpetuate this lie is because of Correction Error #3: We remember feeling the way we believe we _should_ have felt while parenting—happy and rewarded—not the way we actually felt: unhappy and tired.

This type of self-perpetuating information is essential to the continuation of humanity as a whole, not to the happiness of the individual, contends Gilbert. For us to survive as a species, we _need_ to believe this information about what will make us happy, even though it’s untrue. We see this clearly in the example of “having kids makes you happy”—if we didn’t believe having kids makes us happy, none of us would have kids, and our species would die out.

You therefore can’t make better choices about the future using the insights of others because virtually all humans buy into and spread the same poor, self-perpetuating information about happiness, concludes Gilbert. That poor information may help our species to succeed, but it also forms the basis of decisions that leave you personally unhappy.

(Shortform note: Gilbert claims that there are certain ideas about what will make us happy that all humans “fall for” simply because we _need_ to fall for them to keep humanity afloat. This could make us feel like unthinking cogs in a survival machine. Yet while this notion can be disheartening, some have proposed that while our _genes_ undeniably want human life to continue, individual humans can still construct meaning beyond procreation for their own __ lives. We can make the world a better place through altruistic action, for instance, and in that way, we can defy the notion that we’re just tools used for some higher purpose.)

> **Parental Happiness Around the World**
> 
> Gilbert claims that the belief that having kids makes you happy is a lie, pointing to studies that show American parents are unhappy from the time their child is born until that child departs for college. However, parental happiness levels differ around the world, and not all parents are as unhappy as the American ones Gilbert describes.
> 
> Of 22 surveyed countries, the US had the highest gap between parental and non-parental happiness: 12%. Some countries also reported lower levels of parental happiness than nonparental happiness, but many countries have parents who are happier than nonparents. Among them are Russia, France, and, topping the charts with eight-percentage-points-greater parental happiness, Portugal.
> 
> Part of the reason why American parents report low happiness may be due to the lack of workplace support and paid time off for working parents. Being a parent in the US is also more expensive than elsewhere, particularly when you factor in college tuition, which is higher than in other countries.

#### Reason #2: You Ignore Correct Information From Others About What Makes You Happy

According to Gilbert, you also fail to correct your future decision-making because **you don’t listen to _correct_ information from others about what will make you happy**. It’s technically possible to make better choices by finding out how others feel after making those choices. However, you don’t heed their insights as you don’t believe others’ feelings can apply to you, Gilbert asserts. This is because all humans believe their experience of life is more unique than it is. In reality, though, our lived experience and feelings about those experiences can quite easily mirror other people’s.

For instance, you’re considering taking a management position at your company. The previous incumbent warns you not to do so, as they were miserable in the job—the boss was too demanding and the team was difficult to manage.

It’s likely that you’d face the same issues if you took the job since the boss and team members in question are still working for the company and are still just as difficult to work with. However, you ignore the incumbent’s advice because you believe you’re uniquely placed to handle these challenges: You worked with a difficult manager in the past, so you figure you’re resilient enough to cope with a similar situation again. You take the job, but you end up miserable—even with your uniquely resilient temperament, the boss and team members are so persistently combative that you find them difficult to handle. You should have heeded the previous manager’s words.

(Shortform note: Gilbert argues that we limit our ability to improve our decision-making by thinking that the opinions and experiences of others can’t apply to us because we’re too unique. However, that’s not the only misconception that keeps us from listening to others: We also believe that we’re above average in every way and therefore better than _everyone_ around us. This is called the better-than-average effect and can similarly lead to poor choices about the future. For instance, if you think you’re a better swimmer than your friend, you might head into waters they claim are dangerous because you think you can manage better than they can—even though this poses a threat to your safety.)
