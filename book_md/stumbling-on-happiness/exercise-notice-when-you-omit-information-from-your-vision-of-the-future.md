## Exercise: Notice When You Omit Information From Your Vision of the Future

Recognize when you might not be considering unfavorable or negative information when envisioning future events and situations.

* * *

Think of a recent event or situation you looked forward to but that went wrong in some way. How did you picture the event or situation in your imagination? Be as specific as possible. (For instance, you might have looked forward to your birthday party, thinking about the friends you’d see and gifts you’d receive.)

During this event, what negative moments occurred that you hadn’t imagined beforehand? Describe these briefly. (Perhaps you actually spent most of the day lamenting the fact that you’re getting older.)

Now consider: _Could_ you have known in advance that these negative moments would occur, based on how past situations played out? What information about the past could have helped you to predict the negative moments? (For instance, you might feel bad about getting older on your birthday _every_ year. Reflecting more deeply on your memories of previous birthdays would have helped you to realize this.)

Moving forward, how can you consciously acknowledge potential negative facets of a future scenario to avoid feeling disappointed again? How might you create a fuller, more balanced vision of the future? Jot down as many ideas as you can. (For instance, you might think of one potential negative aspect of a future scenario for every positive one. Or, you might mentally step through a previous occurrence of the scenario in detail so you don’t overlook the negative things that occurred and may happen again.)
