## Exercise: Identify Your Bias

Use this exercise to identify one of your biases. This is the first step; once you’ve found the bias, you’ll be ready to remove it.

* * *

Think of a conflict you’ve recently had with another person. How did you blame them, another person, or outside circumstances for the cause or outcome of that conflict?

How did you justify your behavior or reaction either during the conflict or in the events leading up to it?

How did you, this person, or the world begin to look especially horrible?

Describe the way you felt during and after the conflict, in as much detail as you can.

Take a look at the feelings associated with each of the Four Biases. Which biases align most accurately with the feelings you described above? (Remember: It’s possible to be biased in more than one way at a time.)
