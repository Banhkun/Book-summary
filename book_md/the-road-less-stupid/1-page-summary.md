## 1-Page Summary

The secret to financial success is to avoid making stupid mistakes, according to Keith Cunningham. And the key to making fewer stupid mistakes is to think before you act. If that sounds easy, it’s easier said than done. In _The Road Less Stupid_ , Cunningham discusses lessons that he learned the hard way, as well as business insights on a variety of issues, ranging from corporate culture to customer relations to risk assessment.

Cunningham is an entrepreneur, author, and speaker who runs a business school called Keys to the Vault.

We’ve organized this guide into two parts: First, we’ll consider the top mistakes that Cunningham urges you to avoid. Then we’ll explain his methodology for thinking through business issues so you can avoid as many mistakes as possible. Along the way, we’ll cross-reference Cunningham’s ideas with complementary insights or elaborations from authors like Ryan Holiday (_Ego Is the Enemy_ , _The Obstacle Is the Way_), Geoffrey Moore (_Crossing the Chasm_), and Edward de Bono (_Six Thinking Hats_).

### Stupid Mistakes That Smart Executives Make

It’s not practical to list every stupid mistake that can or has been made in business, but some mistakes and misconceptions are common enough that Cunningham takes the time to discuss them particularly. Note that, as used by Cunningham, the word **“stupid” refers specifically to things that you do or accept even though you are _smart enough to know better_. **This contrasts with the way others sometimes use the term “stupid” to refer to a lack of intelligence.

In this section, we’ll examine these key mistakes so you’ll be able to more easily spot and avoid them.

#### Letting Pride Cloud Your Judgment

According to Cunningham, letting your emotions influence your business decisions will almost always result in stupid mistakes, which, in turn, will result in financial losses. **One of the most dangerous emotions of all is pride** because it can cause you to ignore risks or expect unrealistically easy profits**.**

He warns that having too much pride in your past successes can inflate your ego and give you unfounded confidence in the future success of your projects. In recounting his own greatest financial losses, Cunningham observes that one of the few good things about failing badly is that it humbles you. One humbling failure can help you view future projects more objectively because it takes humility to learn new things and assess your own ideas honestly, both of which are important for anyone directing a business.

But even if you’ve been humbled by failure, he says it’s helpful to have someone else who can review your proposals without getting emotionally involved. This second check helps keep your pride in check and prevents a lot of stupid mistakes. Many businesses have a board of directors for this purpose.

> **More Dangers of Pride**
> 
> In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , Ryan Holiday elaborates on how egotism (an elevated sense of self-importance) can sabotage your career. He corroborates Cunningham’s observations that sometimes ego can drive you to ignore obvious problems with a plan or venture—even when other people confront you with them—and rush into projects without first developing the capabilities you would need to make them succeed.
> 
> But Holiday points out that sometimes ego can also have the opposite effect: It can prevent you from moving forward with important projects because you spend so much time talking yourself up that you feel you’ve already achieved success. This not only robs you of motivation to move forward but also of the time and mental energy needed to actually work on the projects that you envision succeeding.
> 
> Holiday also echoes Cunningham’s emphasis on the importance of learning and of being humble enough to learn. But where Cunningham suggests that your failures can help to humble you and put you in a better mindset to learn, Holiday warns that sometimes ego can even prevent you from learning from your failures: Pride can drive you to blame your failures on other people or circumstances, blinding you to mistakes you could otherwise learn from and creating resentment instead of humility. Resentment makes it _harder_ to move on to something new, where you’d have another chance to succeed.

##### Pride Causes You to Ignore Risk

As we’ve alluded to, pride can blind you to risks, and ignoring risks can precipitate stupid mistakes. For that matter, Cunningham argues that the idea that higher risks correlate to higher returns is a stupid misconception. On the contrary, higher risk just means a lower probability of success.

(Shortform note: The correct way to understand the correlation between high risk and high returns is that a venture needs to offer higher returns in order to justify higher risk. But, as Cunningham points out, higher-risk options don’t necessarily offer higher rewards in practice.)

**The better you understand what could go wrong on a given project or venture, the better you’ll be able to avoid stupid mistakes** and foolish gambles, whether you’re comparing the risks of several possible projects, or deciding what risks to focus on mitigating in a project you’re already working on. He says the key to assessing risks is to write them down so you can compare them side by side—trying to analyze them in your head invites stupid mistakes.

As you write them out, you can begin to quantify them by estimating their probability of happening, how much loss they would incur if they did happen, and how difficult it would be to reduce the probability or the cost. Once you’ve done this, he advises you to sort them by probability and **focus on the top 10 most probable risks for any given venture**. This gives you an idea of what could most likely go wrong and how serious the consequences would be. If you couldn’t live with the consequences of any given risk, or if the expected payoff isn’t enough to justify the risk of loss, don’t undertake the venture.

> **The Risk of Inaccurate Risk Assessments**
> 
> As Cunningham says, writing out your risks side by side can help you compare them objectively, facilitating better decisions. But only if the cost and probability of each risk is reasonably accurate. Error or uncertainty in these values introduces the risk of making the wrong decision based on a faulty risk assessment. Let’s consider a couple of factors that throw off the accuracy of your risk assessment.
> 
> Analysts warn that it’s easy to underestimate the seriousness of risks if your data isn’t sufficiently detailed. For example, suppose that your company has 1,000 customers distributed throughout the US and 20 other countries. That makes the risk of changing customer preferences seem pretty low because it would take a truly sweeping global change to affect your entire international customer base. But what if 75% of your _profits_ come from just 10 large customers, all of whom operate in the same industry and are based in southern California? This detail increases both the cost and the likelihood of the risk because a change to their industry, California’s regulatory code, or other local factors could influence their preferences simultaneously.
> 
> Some experts, such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb, also caution that it’s easy to underestimate the _risk_ of low-probability events that could have catastrophic consequences. In _Fooled by Randomness_ , Taleb argues that humans tend not to prepare adequately for low-probability events because they confuse assessing risk (which you can do objectively) with predicting the future (which no one can do accurately): If the _probability_ of a certain risk is very low, we tend to assume that it _won’t happen_ , so we don’t take action to mitigate it.
> 
> However, he argues that if _consequences_ are severe enough, even a low-probability risk can warrant significant mitigation because the value of the risk is equal to the probability of it happening _multiplied_ by the cost or consequence. Cunningham’s recommendation to focus only on mitigating your top 10 most _likely_ risks arguably succumbs to this tendency to underestimate the risk of low-probability events.

##### Pride Causes You to Expect Profit Without Effort

Cunningham also lists greed, laziness, and impatience as consequences of pride that lead to particularly stupid mistakes. Sometimes laziness and impatience can drive you to abandon a business venture that would have been very profitable if you’d been more persistent.

Greed, laziness, and impatience also make you vulnerable to get-rich-quick schemes. Cunningham asserts that anyone who promises to teach you how to make millions of dollars with minimal effort, regardless of your situation, is just guessing that you’re lazy and greedy and trying to take advantage of you.

**He says sustainable success always requires sustained effort and a clear focus on the right tasks**. Furthermore, the tasks that you need to focus on depend on the situation. Thus, any legitimate business consultant will ask a lot of questions and take the time to learn your situation before offering any advice about how to make your business more successful.

> **The Advantages of Persistence**
> 
> In _The Obstacle Is the Way_ , Ryan Holiday elaborates on the principle that success requires persevering in the face of difficulties and setbacks. He goes so far as to argue that the challenges and setbacks you face are, in fact, an intrinsic part of the opportunity to succeed because they force you to get better in order to overcome them.
> 
> Holiday develops this concept mostly in the context of personal development: Overcoming obstacles in your life helps you become a better person as you cultivate inner mental strength and exercise virtues like forgiveness. However, the same principle can be applied to businesses as well: As W. Chan Kim and René Mauborgne explain in _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , if you have to develop unique capabilities in order to succeed in a given venture, those unique capabilities make your business model difficult for competitors to copy, thereby increasing long-term profitability.
> 
> This, in turn, helps to explain why get-rich-quick schemes and even well-intentioned copy-and-paste business models tend to fail. You might copy a business plan that worked for someone else, but if you don’t have the right capabilities to pull it off, or the tenacity to develop those capabilities, then it won’t work for you.
> 
> It also suggests that even business consultants who take the time to learn your situation have their limitations: They can tailor a business plan to your existing capabilities or interests, but they still can’t foresee every challenge that will come up in implementing the plan, nor can they give you the persistence to overcome unforeseen challenges.

#### Building What You Want Instead of What Your Customers Want

Cunningham also argues that **doing what you love and expecting to somehow make money on it is fundamentally a stupid idea**. If you want to make money, you need to find out what _your customers_ love (and are willing and able to pay for) and deliver it efficiently enough to make a profit.

(Shortform note: As you investigate what your customers want, it’s often beneficial to observe them in the field. As innovation management expert Vijay Kumar explains in _101 Design Methods_ , watching users in action often reveals insights into how they use your product, what they like, and aspects they struggle with that they wouldn’t bring up if you just talked to them about it.)

For that matter, if you want to make _more_ money or grow your business, Cunningham says you’re usually better off researching why people who know about your product _aren’t_ buying it and addressing their concerns, rather than expanding your advertising to reach more people. **If your product is making a bad impression, it’s stupid to expand your advertising** , because then it will just make a bad impression on more people.

However, if there’s a grain of truth in the philosophy of doing what you love, it’s that you have to start with an understanding of your own resources and capabilities (which probably align with your interests) so you can make plans that you can realistically execute as you consider ways to win new or repeat customers.

As Cunningham explains, starting with a realistic understanding of what you can do now helps you avoid another common business misconception: the idea that you should first identify your goals or desired end-state, and then plan how to achieve them. This philosophy implicitly assumes that you have the resources to _execute_ any long-term vision that you can _plan_. And since you don’t have infinite resources, that’s a stupid assumption.

> **Maximizing Your Strengths**
> 
> Depending on your product and the reasons that prospective customers are hesitant to buy it, you might be able to resolve the problem by appealing to a different customer base rather than changing the product itself. This goes along with understanding your capabilities so you can plan realistic solutions: You need customers whose needs match your strengths so you can meet or exceed their expectations.
> 
> It’s also a business application of the principle of strengths-based self-improvement, which Tom Rath discusses in _Strengths Finder 2.0_. Rath points out that you can’t realistically fix all your weaknesses, and even if you could, it’s more productive to hone your strengths than to fix your weaknesses. This is because you’ll make more progress with the same investment of time and effort in areas that you’re naturally good at than in areas where you’re naturally weak. Furthermore, Rath explains, many traits are weaknesses in one context but strengths in another, so trying to fix a perceived weakness might make you forfeit what could have been a useful strength.
> 
> But even if you end up courting a different customer base, it might still behoove you to understand how your _current_ customer base perceives you. In _Positioning_ , Al Ries and Jack Trout elaborate on Cunningham’s assertion that you need to understand where you are now before you can make realistic plans to get to where you _want_ to be: People outside your company often perceive your company differently than you do, and it’s possible that your desired future customer base will see your product differently than you expect them to. By understanding how current customers perceive you, you might get a firmer grasp on how your desired future customer base will perceive you and how to best appeal to them.

##### Trying to Be Everything to Everyone Instead of Finding Your Niche

As you tailor your product to your prospective customers’ needs and desires, Cunningham cautions you not to make stupid mistakes like ignoring competing products or trying to make your product appeal to _everyone_ instead of to a focused target market.

He observes that **even within a target market, there are three things you can focus on to differentiate your offering from the competition** : low cost, high quality or performance, and customer relationships (such as providing exceptionally fast service or making every customer feel like she’s getting special treatment). In Cunningham’s experience, successful companies stand out as superior in _one_ of these three areas, keep up with competing products in a second area, and neglect the third area almost entirely. Meanwhile, products and companies that try to focus on all three tend to die off because they’re spread too thin and not adequately differentiated.

(Shortform note: Some analysts might disagree with Cunningham’s assertion that you’ll be more successful if you limit your focus to excelling in just one of these three areas. For example, in _Ten Types of Innovation_ , Larry Keeley and his co-authors argue that to be successful, a new product typically needs to excel in at least five out 10 standard categories. Product performance and customer service are two of Keeley’s 10 categories, while three other categories (your company’s capabilities, organizational structure or efficiency, and type of revenue stream) would dictate your product’s cost.)

> **The Importance of Positioning Your Product in Its Own Niche**
> 
> In _Crossing the Chasm_ , business innovation consultant Geoffrey Moore advises you to tailor your product exquisitely to the needs of a particular niche market whenever you’re introducing a new product. The reasoning behind his recommendation provides some complementary insight into Cunningham’s ideas.
> 
> As Moore explains, every product and company occupies a certain position on the market landscape in customers' minds. For example, maybe customers think of your product as the premium model, the over-priced knockoff, the best-bang-for-the-buck, or the women’s version. Your marketing can influence customers’ perceptions to some extent, but not nearly as much as word-of-mouth from other people with similar needs or tastes.
> 
> If you make your product a balanced mix of everything, as Cunningham warns you not to, it will be hard for potential customers to mentally place your product on the market landscape, because it doesn’t stand out in any particular way. This makes them less likely to remember it, let alone buy it. But if you tailor it specifically to one niche (especially a niche that doesn’t have a clear market leader yet), it’s easy for people to remember your product as the leader in that niche. And in a small, close-knit market sector (for example, the market for radiation-hardened inspection cameras, or the market for sushi in a certain city), it’s easier for word-of-mouth to get around, which will amplify the effects of your marketing. This helps to explain _why_ companies and products that try to appeal to everyone tend to die as Cunningham observes.

#### Confusing Goals With Plans

According to Cunnigham, another stupid mistake that frequently tempts executives is to establish a goal or vision for improving the company but fail to establish a detailed plan for achieving it. **Just thinking about a desired end state doesn’t help you get there** , no matter how much you want to. To reach it, you need to identify what obstacles stand between you and your goal (you’d already be there if nothing was holding you back) and figure out exactly what you need to do to overcome those obstacles.

Cunningham further explains that, while a detailed plan enables you to progress toward your goals, letting your plans become sacred is another stupid mistake. The value of a detailed plan is that it’s actionable (unlike a goal), and it gives you a standard against which to track your progress so you’ll know when you begin to deviate from it, as you inevitably will at some point. Deviations aren’t always a bad thing—sometimes you may discover opportunities along the way that are better than your original goal. But it’s important to know when you start to deviate so you can reassess the situation and update your plans as needed.

(Shortform note: In _The 33 Strategies of War_ , Robert Greene elaborates on the relationship between detailed, actionable plans and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. He says successful generals would often compose detailed battle plans for a variety of possible scenarios and contingencies so that they could quickly change course if the situation warranted it. This kind of branching plan can also be useful in business, enabling you to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.)

> **How to Develop Your Plan**
> 
> In _Execution_ , Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan elaborate on the process of turning your strategic goals into actionable plans. While they acknowledge that every situation is different, and thus will require a unique plan, they recommend using the following standard workflow for creating your plan:
> 
> **Step #1** :**** Identify which departments or teams in your organization need to be involved in the plan. Determine what each team’s role in the plan needs to be, and ask team leaders to draft the portions of the plan that their teams will be responsible for.
> 
> **Step #2** : Hold a meeting with the team leaders to discuss assumptions they made in drafting their portions of the plan, and make sure everyone is on the same page.
> 
> **Step #3** :**** Assemble a complete plan from the individual portions that the team leaders submitted. Work out any differences, discrepancies, or conflicts between them.
> 
> **Step #4** : Identify contingency plans that can accommodate shifting circumstances.
> 
> **Step #5** : Wrap up discussion and secure commitments from everyone to ensure alignment with the plan.
> 
> **Step #6** : After the meeting, send a memo or otherwise follow up with the team leaders, summarizing each person’s commitments and short-term benchmarks.
> 
> **Step #7** : Assess progress toward those benchmarks at quarterly review meetings. Presumably, this is where you’ll also analyze any deviations from the plan and assess whether any parts of the plan need to be changed.

##### Using the Wrong Metrics

As you track your progress to plans, Cunningham stresses the importance of using the right metrics. People tend to focus more on tasks that get measured and reported because the results will reflect on them more strongly, and people want to look like they’re doing well at their jobs. Thus to set up your plan for successful execution, you need to select metrics that will focus people’s attention on the right things.

For example, suppose you’re running a telemarketing business. If you track how many calls your marketers make as a measure of how well they’re doing, that will incentivize them to make as many calls as possible—potentially forfeiting some sales if they cut their calls short to get in as many as possible instead of taking time to address customers’ questions and concerns. But if you track the number of _sales_ instead, then they’ll focus on making sales, instead of just on making calls.

It’s also important to **select metrics that enable you to make corrections to your plan early enough to _avoid_ problems**, instead of merely alerting you to problems that have already come up. Cunningham notes that standard business KPIs (key performance indicators) like monthly profit and loss usually measure results, and thus only alert you to problems after the fact. He advises you to find the _causes_ of these results and a way to measure the causes, giving you leading indicators that you can use to steer your company toward the results that you want.

> **Measuring What Matters**
> 
> In _Measure What Matters_ , venture capitalist John Doerr describes a method for tracking progress on plans as Cunningham suggests. He calls it the OKR system, for “Objectives and Key Results.” This approach allows you (and everyone else) to easily see how the plan is progressing and where things may be deviating or falling behind. As its name implies, the OKR system involves tracking the objectives and key results of each team and individual worker in the company.
> 
> Doerr describes objectives as high-level goals, but he also says they must be tangible and action-oriented, so these could be milestones or other interim achievements stipulated by the plan that you’re executing. Doerr insists that each entity, whether individual worker, team, or department, should only have three to five objectives at once so that their focus doesn’t get spread too thin.
> 
> Key results are actions or sub-goals that support each goal and have specific deadlines. For example, if the objective is to increase the size of the workforce in support of a certain project, one of its key results might be to interview at least five people for a certain position and hire one of them by the end of the month. In the context of Cunningham’s discussion of tracking both cause and effect, you can view key results as causes and objectives as effects.
> 
> Again, to maintain focus, Doerr says there should be no more than three to five key results for each goal. He also recommends that each worker and team set most of their own key results, although it’s OK for their superiors to set their objectives. This gives superiors the tools they need to focus their staff on the right metrics associated with the objective, while also ensuring that employees have buy-in and understand what they’ll do to achieve their objectives.

#### Misunderstanding Corporate Culture

One stupid mistake that, according to Cunningham, can have a devastating effect on productivity is misunderstanding the concept of corporate culture. Specifically, thinking that you can create a culture of high performance by creating a few unique job perks is stupid.

He explains that corporate culture is the code of conduct that dictates how people in the company act by delineating the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. **Establishing and maintaining a positive, high-performance culture requires a constant dialogue about what’s acceptable and not**. And if you fail to enforce the rules, that will undermine the culture.

Disciplinary actions _can_ be effective for correcting unacceptable employee behavior, but they can also create a culture of fear, which produces less-than-ideal performance. Cunningham observes that every employee _wants_ to succeed. So before you resort to firing or otherwise disciplining an employee who isn’t meeting your expectations, he recommends assessing whether she understands your expectations and whether she has the skills and resources to meet them. If not, you may be able to clarify your expectations or enable her to meet them by providing the training or support she needs.

> **Comparing Perspectives on Corporate Culture**
> 
> Many business experts might contend that corporate culture is more than just the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior, and thus it’s more difficult to change than by simply firing or disciplining an employee or by clarifying and enforcing expectations.
> 
> For example, when John Kotter discusses changing corporate culture in _Leading Change_ , he defines culture as the set of norms, behaviors, priorities, and shared values that persist and are passed down within a group or organization. As such, Kotter asserts that training employees, having discussions with them to clarify new expectations, and enforcing behavioral expectations is only the first step toward changing culture.
> 
> Often, significant changes to corporate culture lead to significant employee turnover, and you need to be careful to hire people whose personalities will fit well with the culture you’re trying to create. The change is not complete until people’s attitudes have shifted to the point that the new culture becomes self-perpetuating.

### Avoid Mistakes by Taking Time to Think

Cunningham’s solution to the problem of making stupid mistakes is to set aside blocks of time for deep thinking that force you to confront issues and answer questions you might otherwise have failed to consider. Schedule thinking sessions at least twice a week and ideally every day.

Each thinking session is one hour long: You spend the first 45 minutes pondering questions or problems and jotting down possible answers or solutions. Then you spend the final 15 minutes evaluating the ideas you came up with and documenting any that are good enough or important enough to warrant following up on—whether in a future thinking session or as actionable business directives.

(Shortform note: In _Six Thinking Hats_ , psychologist Edward de Bono elaborates on the process of thinking, explaining that there are six fundamental types of thinking. De Bono observes that our thinking is often a jumble of all six types and argues that you can think more coherently and productively by consciously separating them. Cunningham appears to be doing just that with his thinking sessions by dedicating the first 45 minutes to generating ideas (what de Bono labels “green hat thinking”) and then 15 minutes to evaluating them (“black hat thinking”).)

Cunningham stresses the importance of minimizing distractions during your thinking sessions so you can focus deeply on questions and issues. In addition to blocking off the time in your schedule so that you won’t be interrupted, he recommends setting aside a specific place for thinking, such as a separate desk or a chair in a corner of your office where your computer screen and other reminders of pending tasks will be out of sight. He even has a separate pen and notebook that he uses only for documenting questions and ideas during thinking sessions.

(Shortform note: We’ve compiled additional methods, tips, and resources for avoiding distractions and focusing deeply in a Master Guide to Focus. For example, some authors observe that you’re naturally better able to focus deeply at a certain time of the day, which can vary depending on your chronotype (your body’s particular circadian rhythm). Others observe that consistently engaging in a rewarding activity, such as a relaxing walk outdoors, right after your sessions of intense thinking can train your brain to associate your thinking with the pleasurable break that follows, reducing stress and making it easier to maintain your focus.)

#### What to Think About

Cunningham advises you to **start each thinking session with at least one question that you want to ponder but no more than three** so you can focus deeply on them and get past the obvious, superficial answers to more original, insightful answers. He observes, though, that once you start thinking about a question, it often spawns other questions. Also, most important questions take more than one session to really think through, so don’t worry if you don’t answer all your questions in a given session.

What specific issues should you ponder in your thinking sessions? Aside from contemplating whether you’re making any of the mistakes that he calls out specifically, Cunningham discusses a number of general questions you’ll probably need to ask from time to time, so consider starting your thinking session with one or more of the following:

**1) What questions or issues** are most important for you to consider right now? Cunningham urges you to periodically ask yourself whether you’re asking the right questions. He notes that when you can’t seem to come up with a good answer to a question or problem, it’s often because you’re asking the wrong question.

**2) What are the real problems** you need to solve? Are the problems you’re currently trying to solve the actual root problems or just symptoms of an underlying problem? You might spend a thinking session listing possible causes for a given problem, or listing actions and events and asking yourself whether the problem would go away if a given event happened or stopped happening.

**3) What can you do to solve a certain problem?** Once you figure out what the _real_ problem is, ask yourself what you (and your organization) can do to overcome it. We’ve discussed the difference between goals and plans. Solving the problem is your goal, now you need to plan your solution. As you make your plan, ask yourself what you need to change about your corporate focus or strategy, as well as how you’ll need to reallocate resources and rethink your metrics to support the change of focus.

**4) What are your assumptions?** As you consider any change or new venture, Cunningham advises you to think about the assumptions you’re making in assessing its potential. Consider whether the assumptions are reasonable and how you could validate them. Unfounded assumptions can lead to stupid mistakes, especially if you don’t realize you’re making the assumption until it proves to be false. We discussed risk analysis earlier. You’ll want to consider the risk of each assumption turning out to be wrong.

**5) What are the unintended consequences?** Cunningham observes that even if none of the risks that could hinder the success of your project are realized, the project itself could have unintended consequences that pose another kind of risk. For example, maybe you roll out a new product with special safety features, and people trust the new features so much that they take bigger risks when using it, such that the new safety features actually result in an _increase_ in injuries.

> **Rethinking Human Errors**
> 
> In _The Design of Everyday Things_ , engineer and cognitive psychologist Don Norman explains how misconceptions about human error can prevent us from correctly identifying root causes, perpetuate poor assumptions, and precipitate unintended consequences. Thus, you may be able to make your thinking sessions more effective by rethinking how you think about human error in light of Norman’s discussion.
> 
> Norman observes that when people are looking for the root cause of a problem, especially a problem that caused an accident, they tend to conclude the search as soon as they find a _person_ to blame. If someone did something wrong and that caused or substantially contributed to the problem, then the root cause gets labeled as “human error,” and the investigators rarely stop to ask why the person made the mistake. Often, Norman argues, human errors are actually a predictable result of poorly designed systems.
> 
> As he goes on to explain, frequently the problem is that people who design machines or other systems unconsciously assume that their users don’t make mistakes. But all humans have physical and mental limitations. For example, you can only focus deeply on a given task for a certain amount of time, and even then, interruptions can disrupt your focus. And a person may not remember to do everything she’s supposed to do if her focus lapses or is disrupted.
> 
> Norman warns that when real, fallible people operate systems that were designed for hypothetical infallible people, the unintended consequences can be severe. For example, the SL-1 nuclear reactor was designed such that the control rod (which slides in and out of the core to adjust the power output of the core) had to be lifted slightly by hand to attach it to the mechanism that would raise and lower it in normal operation. The operating procedure for the reactor specified that it should never be lifted more than four inches by hand.
> 
> One day, when workers were re-starting the reactor after it had been shut down for a while, the control rod got stuck. When a worker pulled on it hard enough to get it moving, he accidentally lifted it too far. This triggered a power surge in the core, causing the reactor to explode and killing the workers.
> 
> Thus, as you contemplate whether you’re solving the right problems, remember to look beyond human error to see if a system, device, or process needs to be redesigned. As you try to identify your assumptions, consider how you expect customers, employees, and other people to behave, and ask yourself whether your expectations are consistent with normal human limitations. And as you contemplate unintended consequences, don’t forget the possibility of people misusing your product or system.
