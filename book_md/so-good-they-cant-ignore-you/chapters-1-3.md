## Chapters 1-3: Rule #1: Don’t Concern Yourself With Passion

In this rule, we’ll look at the “passion hypothesis”—the idea that a job that lets you exercise a pre-existing passion will be enjoyable. Then, we’ll look at the evidence that suggests following your passion isn’t going to make you happy.

### The Passion Hypothesis

**The “passion hypothesis” is the idea that you can find a job you like by first figuring out what you’re passionate about, and then looking for a job that allows you to use this passion.**

The author doesn’t know exactly when this idea evolved, but he thinks it was sometime around 1970 when Richard Bolles published _What Color Is Your Parachute?_ The book’s thesis is that the best way to change careers is to figure out what you enjoy doing, and then find somewhere you could get paid to do the activities you like. (Shortform note: To learn more about Bolles’s ideas, read our summary of What Color Is Your Parachute?)

This message was groundbreaking at the time, and readers liked it and passed it on to younger generations. It's now a staple of culture. Most career counselors teach it, most career books cover it, and people who have followed their passions, such as professional athletes, are admired. Additionally, a spin-off theory states that traditional office jobs are inherently devoid of passion and that if you want to be happy, you have to avoid them.

For a select few, the passion hypothesis does describe how they found their work. For example, Peter Travers, a film critic for _Rolling Stone_ , has taken notes on movies since he was a child, and most professional athletes have loved the sports they play since childhood. However, these cases are outliers—there’s far more evidence _against_ the passion hypothesis.

### Evidence Against the Passion Hypothesis

**The author believes the passion hypothesis is flawed** and there are three pieces of evidence to support this: scientific research, Conference Board surveys, and Roadtrip Nation interviews.

#### Piece of Evidence #1: Scientific Research

**Scientists who study passion have discovered that there are several reasons people enjoy their work. Interestingly, having a pre-existing passion for the work is _not_ one of the reasons. **Scientific research about career satisfaction has discovered:

##### Discovery #1: Passion Isn’t an Ingredient for Motivation

Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the best scientific understanding of what motivates people, states that **there are three crucial ingredients to motivation** , whether in the workplace or elsewhere. These traits are applicable to any field:

  * **Independence.** In the workplace, independence refers to having control over your responsibilities, which inspires you to do them well.
  * **Capability.** In the workplace, capability refers to being skilled at what you do. This results in a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment, and often also results in you acquiring more independence.
  * **Connection.** In the workplace, connection refers to your relationship with your coworkers. If you like the people you work with, you’re more likely to be happy.



##### You’ll notice that **passion isn’t one of the ingredients for motivation.**

##### Discovery #2: Most People Don’t Even Have Occupational Passions

In 2002, Robert J. Vallerand, a psychologist, surveyed Canadian university students about their passions. **He discovered that 84% of students had a passion, but less than 4% of the passions were related to work.** The passions were mostly hobbies and the most popular ones were swimming, reading, dance, hockey, and skiing.

##### Discovery #3: Occupational Passions Can Be Developed

Amy Wrzesniewski, an organizational behavior professor, surveyed workers from a variety of fields and discovered that most people slot their occupations into one of three categories:

  * A _calling_ is work that’s an important part of your identity and life.
  * A _career_ is a stepping stone to better work.
  * A _job_ is simply work that makes you money.



A believer in the passion hypothesis would expect to find that people who consider their occupation a calling would be working in fields that match common passions. For example, helping people is a common passion, so doctors would probably describe their work as a calling.

However, that’s not what Wrzesniewski found. When she looked at college administrative assistants—a position that doesn’t match any common passions—she discovered that about a third of people who held this position saw their work as a calling. **This suggests that jobs of all types have the potential to be enjoyable and passion-satisfying, not just the ones commonly seen as aspirational.**

Next, Wrzesniewski asked the college assistants why they categorized their work the way they did. She discovered that **the assistants who saw their work as a calling had been working the job the longest, which suggests that people _develop_ passion for their work **as they acquire the ingredients of motivation such as becoming more capable and connecting with coworkers. Additionally, the longer someone is on the job, the more opportunity they have to see evidence of their work’s positive effect on others, which also increases their job satisfaction and helps them learn to love their work.

#### Piece of Evidence #2: Conference Board Surveys

**Since the rise of the passion hypothesis, workplace satisfaction has actually decreased.** The Conference Board has been studying job satisfaction since 1987. In 1987, 61% of Americans said they were happy with their jobs. By 2010, only 45% of Americans were. Of young people specifically, 64% aren’t happy with their jobs. These numbers aren’t attributable to recessions—there have been both busts and booms since 1987 and the satisfaction has been steadily declining regardless of the economic conditions.

Additionally, **anecdotal evidence shows that even people who have jobs that match their passions aren’t happy.** For example, 27-year-old Scott, who works in politics, admits that his job is practically perfect. He’s passionate about his field and he loves his company and coworkers. However, even though everything seems right, Scott isn’t convinced that his job is living up to the standards of the passion hypothesis because he doesn’t enjoy every single task.

#### Piece of Evidence #3: Roadtrip Nation Interviews

Roadtrip Nation, a nonprofit organization that helps people find careers, interviewed a large sample of people who liked their jobs. **Most of the people found their careers not by following their passions, but by taking a circuitous, messy route** —it’s difficult to guess in the abstract what you might learn to like.

For example, Andrew Steele, an astrobiologist who loves his job, didn’t know where he was going to end up when he started his Ph.D. program. He signed up because it gave him options, not because he was passionate about the subject.

### Extended Examples

_So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ contains many case studies. For each rule, we’ll look at an example of someone who failed to apply the rule, someone who successfully applied the rule, and the author’s personal application of the rule.

#### Example of Failed Application of Rule #1: Thomas the Monk

**Thomas decided on his passion—discovering the meaning of life—early in his life and committed to it.** He earned two bachelor’s degrees, one in theology and the other in philosophy, and then completed a master’s degree in comparative religion. After graduating, he decided that he wanted to become a practicing lay monk and live in a Zen monastery.

However, Thomas needed to earn money first, so he worked a variety of jobs including teaching English overseas. **He was so enraptured with his passion that he didn’t enjoy any other jobs because he was constantly comparing them to his dream job.**

When Thomas learned about the Zen Mountain Monastery, he applied and was accepted. He spent months working on the Mu koan, which is a word puzzle designed to inspire enlightenment. Passing the Mu koan is the first step to becoming a serious student. One day, Thomas solved the koan. **He was exactly where he wanted to be—he’d followed and officially achieved his passion to become a Zen practitioner—but this didn’t magically make him happy.** He was still the same person he’d been before—a person who was never satisfied with reality because his expectations, based on the passion hypothesis, were so unrealistic.

#### Example of Successful Application of Rule #1: Steve Jobs

Unlike Thomas, Steve Jobs didn’t try to follow his passion. **Like many people who end up loving what they do, Jobs’s route to a satisfying career was messy and complex.**

**Jobs initially wasn’t interested in technology or business.** After graduating from high school, Jobs went to Reed College, where he studied dance, Western history, and a little bit of Eastern mysticism. After a year, he dropped out of college and eventually moved back in with his parents. He got a job with Atari because he needed money, it was convenient, and the ad said it would be fun.

While working for Atari, Jobs spent his free time at a commune near San Francisco. He went to India and when he returned, he trained at the Los Altos Zen Center. **If Jobs had followed his passion, he probably would have become a teacher at the Zen Center.**

Instead, Jobs took opportunities as they came. Jobs’s friend Steve Wozniak hooked him up with a job at a computer company, which went well until he went to the commune for a season without telling his boss. **Jobs clearly wasn’t that committed to business or electronics at this point. He was only interested in technology when it made him money.**

Less than a year later, Jobs came up with the idea to sell computer circuit board kits to hobbyists and asked Wozniak to work with him. **The plan was to sell 100 kits and make $1,000, not to create a major technology company.** The project only scaled when Jobs approached a computer store about selling the kits and the store asked for computers instead. This break resulted in the founding of Apple, which ultimately provided Jobs with work he was passionate about—work he would never have found if he’d tried to follow his pre-existing passion.

#### Example of the Author’s Application of Rule #1

The author learned that passion isn’t a prerequisite for a desirable job in high school, when he and his friend Michael started a web design company. **Neither boy was passionate about designing websites** , but they couldn’t think of a better idea. **They weren’t passionate about entrepreneurship either** —they just thought starting a company would be more fun than a regular summer job.

The company did well in spite of its owners’ lack of passion and the experience helped the boys get into good colleges.
