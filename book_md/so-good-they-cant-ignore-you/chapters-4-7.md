## Chapters 4-7: Rule #2: Improve Your Skills

As we established in Rule #1, following your passion is unlikely to lead you to love your work. Rule #2 explains what _will_ lead you to love your work—**improving your scarce and prized skills (career capital) to the point where you’re so good people can’t ignore you.**

First, we’ll look at the theory of career capital. Then, we’ll look at how to acquire this capital.

### The Theory of Career Capital

The career capital theory includes three statements:

#### Statement #1: The Traits That Make a Job Desirable Are Scarce and Prized

After looking at case studies of three people who enjoy their work, the author came up with three scarce and prized traits that make a job desirable:

**Trait #1: The job provides the opportunity for autonomy.**(We’ll look more at this trait in Rule #3.)

  * For example, Al Merrick, a surfboard shaper, doesn’t have to adhere to a dress code or work prescribed hours. His surfboard factory is a block from the beach and he can take off and go surfing whenever he wants.



**Trait #2: The job provides the opportunity to change the world.**(We’ll look more at this trait in Rule #4.)

  * For example, Steve Jobs’s advances in the field of technology have changed the lives of everyone who uses computers.



**Trait #3: The job provides the opportunity to use imagination.**(Shortform note: While the author lists creativity as one of the three traits that are inherent to great work, he hasn’t included a rule about it.)

  * For example, Ira Glass, host of _This American Life_ , narrates a one-of-a-kind podcast that lets him use his creativity.



#### Statement #2: Careers Are Subject to the Rules of Supply and Demand

The rules of supply and demand state that if you want something scarce and prized, you need to pay for it with something equally scarce and prized. This also applies to careers—you’ll “buy” the three desirable traits using your career capital.

#### Statement #3: The Craftsperson Mindset Helps You Build Career Capital

There are two different mindsets when it comes to work, the passion mindset and the craftsperson mindset. The passion mindset, like the passion hypothesis, will set you up to fail while adopting the craftsperson mindset is the first step to loving your work.

##### Passion Mindset

**The passion mindset is concerned with what the universe can do for you.** People who subscribe to this mindset expect the universe to quickly provide them with a job that perfectly matches their passion.

This mindset leads to the following negative consequences:

  * **Pessimism.** If you concentrate on what you’re _supposed_ to be getting, it makes you aware of what you’re _not_ getting. You become preoccupied with all the things you don’t like about your work, whether that’s specific tasks or bureaucracy, and as a result, you’re perpetually unhappy. Entry-level positions are particularly bad for pessimism because, by nature, they include supervision and don’t include exciting projects.
  * **Identity crisis.** The passion mindset suggests that your work is integral to your identity and is an expression of what you love. Identity can’t be so easily reduced, so you’ll constantly be questioning who you are and what you should _really_ do with your life. 



**_Courage Culture_**

A spinoff of the passion mindset is courage culture, which suggests that the main obstacle that’s keeping you from following your passion is a lack of courage. **It suggests that there’s a perfect job out there with your name on it, and the only reason you don’t have it yet is that you’re too scared to leave your conventional job. This is inaccurate** —as we’ve learned, it takes scarce and prized skills, not merely courage, to acquire a desirable job.

##### Craftsperson Mindset

The craftsperson mindset is the opposite of the passion mindset—**instead of concerning yourself with what the universe can do for you, you focus on what you can do for the universe.** The craftsperson mindset offers a much clearer roadmap to loving your work—all you have to do is work hard to get good at something. You don’t have to think about whether your job is perfect or represents your identity—you simply focus on developing your skills.

**You must adopt the craftsperson mindset to end up in work you love no matter what field or industry you’re involved with.**

For example, Steve Martin, comedian and actor, is an example of an adopter of the craftsperson mindset. When he was first starting his career, stand-up comedy was founded on delivering punch lines. He wanted to do something less formulaic and came up with a groundbreaking act. It took ten years of hard practice for him to develop his joke-writing skills enough to make the act work.

**_Rebutting Criticism of the Craftsperson Mindset_**

Some people, particularly supporters of the passion hypothesis, argue that it’s only possible to adopt the craftsperson mindset _after_ you’ve discovered your passion. For example, musicians are only able to practice hours every day because they love music so much.

In fact, this isn’t the case. Musicians and other entertainers are often unsure about whether their jobs are right for them because jobs in the arts tend to be insecure. For example, when Steve Martin was developing his new act, he was so uncertain that it was the right thing to do that he regularly experienced panic attacks. Performers adopt the craftsperson mindset not because they know they’re on the right path, but because they know it’s the only way to succeed in their industry.

Additionally, musicians aren’t good examples because they’re not representative of the general public. Musicians often succeed because of a lucky break or because of some unusual circumstances from their early life (for example, their parents were also musicians).

### How to Acquire Career Capital: Practice Deliberately

As we learned in the previous section, to develop your career capital, you need to adopt the craftsperson mindset and practice your skills in order to develop them. The best way to practice is “deliberately,” a method studied by psychologist Anders Ericsson.

(Shortform note: To learn more about Ericsson’s research, read our summary of his book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise.)

There are two requirements for deliberate practice:

**Requirement #1: Appropriate challenge.** You need to push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Repeating things you’re already good at is fun, but it doesn’t make you improve.

  * Bad example: When the author practiced guitar, he didn’t like the mental strain that came with learning new songs, so he mainly spent his practice time playing through songs he was already good at.
  * Good example: When Jordan Tice, a professional musician, was first learning guitar, he learned Allman Brothers songs by listening to them, which is more difficult than learning them by reading music. He also plays everything a little faster than is comfortable in order to make things hard for himself.



**Requirement #2: Immediate feedback.** You need to be told what you’re doing right and wrong in order to improve. Feedback can come from a teacher, coach, yourself, or the result of your actions.

  * Good example: Jordan Tice studied with a guitar teacher who would tell him whenever he made a mistake. He also got feedback from his guitar—he could hear it when he played a wrong note.



Productivity and getting things done isn’t the goal of deliberate practice. The goal is to improve your skills.

#### Extended Example: Chess Players

Neil Charness, a psychologist, studied how chess players practice to see if different practicing methods made a difference to their skill level. Charness only looked at people who had acquired 10,000 hours of practice, a number generally agreed upon to be the amount of time required to become an expert. (This time requirement suggests that becoming an expert has less to do with natural talent and more to do with effort. Scientists haven’t found that experts have a natural predisposition towards their fields, except that physical characteristics like being tall might make you better at basketball.)

Of the players who had 10,000 hours of practice, some had achieved the rank of grandmaster and others were at an intermediate level. **Since they all had the same amount of experience, there must have been another factor that determined who became an expert and who didn’t progress and stayed intermediate.**

At the time, there was a debate among chess players about which of two practice methods was most effective. The methods were:

  * Playing in tournaments, which forced players to adhere to a time limit and deal with distractions. 
  * Reading books and training with coaches, which forced players to identify their weaknesses and then train to overcome them.



Charness discovered that **seriously studying the game was far more effective than any other practice method.** The people who became grandmasters had spent half of their 10,000 hours on serious study. The people who stayed intermediate had spent only 10% of their time on serious study.

**This is because playing in tournaments doesn’t offer an appropriate challenge, the first ingredient of deliberate practice.** In a tournament, chess players often aren’t evenly matched against their opponents. Face off against a far more skilled opponent than you and you won’t be challenged, you’ll be destroyed. Face off against a far less skilled opponent and you won’t be challenged because winning is too easy.

Serious study, on the other hand, is tailored to your skill level at any point in time. As you improve, you can adjust your study to make it more challenging. Additionally, **serious study also offers the second requirement of deliberate practice, immediate feedback.** You can look up how to solve a chess problem if you can’t figure it out by yourself, or if you have a coach, she can tell you what you’re doing wrong.

#### Applying Deliberate Practice to the Workplace

If you’re not playing chess, music, or a sport, it’s less obvious what deliberate practice involves—the workplace doesn’t have a strict competition schedule or training regime. As a result, **most professionals improve their skills for a little while and then get caught in plateaus.** Ericsson discovered that after reaching an acceptable performance level at work, people’s skills didn’t improve with additional practice time.

This means that **if you can be one of the first people to figure out how to apply deliberate practice in your field, you’ll quickly acquire more career capital than your coworkers and surpass them.** We’ll look at how to do this in the next section.

#### Five Steps to Practicing Deliberately

There are five steps to figuring out how to deliberately practice in your workplace:

**Step #1: Determine your career capital market.** There are two types of career capital markets:

  * **Single skill.** In this type of market, there’s only one kind of career capital. Everyone who works in your industry is trying to acquire the same skill.
    * For example, Alex Berger, a television writer, is in a single-skill market because, in TV writing, the only meaningful skill is scriptwriting.
  * **Multi-skill.** In this type of market, there are different types of applicable career capital. Everyone who works in your industry has a different combination of capital.
    * For example, Mike Jackson, a cleantech venture capitalist, is in a multi-skill market because venture capitalism makes use of many skills. The skills Mike has are entrepreneurship and knowledge of renewable energy markets.



**It’s less obvious than you might think to determine which market you’re in, and many people mistake a single-skill market for a multi-skill one.**

  * For example, Alex originally thought that the entertainment industry was multi-skill and worked as an editor at the _National Lampoon_ , anticipating the skills he gained there (working with humor writers) would help him in other parts of the entertainment industry. As the only skill that matters in TV writing is scriptwriting, his skills weren’t transferable. After a year, he realized this and took a job as a TV executive’s assistant, which _did_ teach him the single skill he needed for TV writing.



**Step #2: Determine what kind of capital you want to develop.** In a single-skill market, you don’t have a choice—there’s only one type of capital—but in a multi-skill market, you can choose which skills you want to develop. It’s fastest and easiest to develop skills in areas you already have a head start in.

  * For example, Mike did his bachelor’s degree in earth systems and biology at Stanford and his master’s thesis was about the natural-gas industry in India. When Mike’s thesis supervisor then launched a research project on natural gas in India, he asked Mike to help. Mike said yes, deciding that the project would help him acquire the career capital of understanding the global energy market. Mike chose this particular type of career capital because the opportunity was easily available to him due to his background.



**Step #3: Determine your goals.** Once you’ve decided what skill you’re going to develop, you need to decide how good you have to get at it.

  * For example, Alex decided that “good” meant writing a script that an agent was willing to take on.



**Step #4: Strive for discomfort.** Seek out the feeling of mental strain and discomfort to challenge yourself, and also seek out and learn from feedback.

  * For example, Mike gives himself feedback by budgeting the hours of each week to certain tasks using a spreadsheet. Then, he tracks his hours throughout the week and at the end of the week, he looks at whether or not he met his targets. This forces him to spend time on the tasks that are challenging and provide feedback, such as fund-raising or talking to investors, and spend less time on mindless tasks such as email.



If you encounter mental resistance to discomfort, such as wanting to give up on your practice session, you can try implementing two types of structure:

  * **Time structure.** Practice for a specified amount of time. Keep practicing for the entire time, even if you feel you’re not making progress. Probably, after a few minutes, your internal resistance will wear down and you’ll be able to concentrate.
    * For example, when the author was trying to understand a difficult paper, he forced himself to study it for one hour at a time.
  * **Information structure.** Practice until you achieve a specified result, no matter how long it takes you.
    * For example, the author quizzed himself on the important definitions in the paper. He wasn’t allowed to stop practicing until he’d memorized the definitions, no matter how long it took.



**Step #5: Stay focused and exercise diligence.** In this context, “diligence” refers to focusing on developing the skill you’ve chosen and not being distracted by other pursuits. It takes a long time to develop a skill, so you need to stick with it.

  * For example, it took Alex two years to get his first TV script produced, and it took Mike five years after graduating from college to land his job as a cleantech venture capitalist.



### When to Stick It Out and When to Quit

There are certain jobs and situations that inhibit your ability to amass career capital. If your current job has any of the following factors, you should look for a new job:

  * **The job doesn’t give you enough opportunity to develop scarce and prized skills.**
    * (Shortform example: Priya coaches soccer for an organization that has a strict curriculum and micromanaging bosses. All she’s allowed to do is follow the same procedures all the other coaches follow, so she has no opportunity to stand out, choose what skills she wants to develop, or practice them deliberately.)
  * **The job is useless or immoral.** While you could theoretically build up career capital at a job like this, you probably wouldn’t want to work there for as long as it would take.
    * (Shortform example: Karina works for a bank that helps its clients evade taxes, which makes her uncomfortable.)
  * **The job involves working with disagreeable people.** Again, while you could theoretically build up career capital at a job like this, you probably wouldn’t want to work there for as long as it would take.
    * (Shortform example: Joaquim’s coworkers are rude to him and he dreads going into work every day.)



### Extended Example of Failed Application of Rule #2: Lisa Feuer

Lisa Feuer was a marketing and advertising professional who was getting tired of the corporate setting she worked in. At age 38, she had acquired a fair amount of career capital in marketing, but she decided to make a change and start a yoga business, inspired by courage culture.

Lisa took a 200-hour yoga course and started Karma Kids Yoga. **200 hours of training isn’t very much career capital, especially in a popular, competitive field, and as a result, Lisa wasn’t so good she couldn’t be ignored.**

In 2008, when the recession hit, Lisa struggled. People stopped wanting private lessons, one of the gyms she worked at closed, and her classes at schools were cut. By 2009, she was applying for food stamps. Her move into yoga didn’t work out because while she had had enough courage to quit her job, she didn’t have enough scarce and valuable skills to succeed in her new job.

### Extended Example of Successful Application of Rule #2: Joe Duffy

Like Lisa, Joe Duffy was an advertising professional who was getting tired of the corporate setting he worked in. He originally trained as an artist and wanted to do something more creative. **Instead of immediately quitting his job like Lisa, however, he embraced the craftsperson mindset and began developing career capital.** He stayed at his agency and developed his skills in brand icons and logos.

Joe became so good at branding and logos that Fallon McElligott offered him a job running a subsidiary of their organization. **This new job offered him more autonomy, the first of the traits that make people enjoy their work.**

Joe worked for Fallon McElligott for twenty years, continuing to practice deliberately and earn career capital. Then, he started his own marketing company, Duffy & Partners. **He was very successful—everyone wanted him to design their logos because he had so much experience.** This move also offered him more autonomy and the opportunity to be creative.

By the time Joe retired, **he likely had all three traits that make a job enjoyable** —in addition to autonomy and creativity, his advertising impacted the world.

### Extended Example of the Author’s Application of Rule #2

The author acquired career capital throughout his education, especially in the first two years of graduate school, when he was forced to practice deliberately. Classwork in graduate school is inherently challenging and there’s constant feedback from instructors.

The last two years of graduate school, however, are mainly self-directed study, so if the author didn’t push himself, he would plateau. He came up with ideas to force himself to practice deliberately and his first exercise was to figure out the math behind a complicated paper.

The author was met with internal resistance the moment he encountered the first difficulty. He forced himself to continue by using both time and information structure. He estimates it took him 15 hours over two weeks to fully understand the paper. He used this new career capital to publish on a topic similar to the paper’s.

Then, he came up with a routine for deliberate practice that includes three elements:

  * Every week, he forces himself to summarize a paper. 
  * He tracks every hour he spends on deliberate practice. Every month, he compares his actual times to his goal times.
  * He forces himself to come up with new theory results and writes down the results of his brainstorming in a notebook.
