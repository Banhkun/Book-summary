## Introduction

In 2010, author Cal Newport was a postdoctoral associate at MIT and just about to start his job search for a professorship. He had three things working against him: His research specialty was niche, the academic job market was particularly bad as a result of the 2008 recession, and he wasn’t willing to relocate. He was facing the very real possibility that he might not be able to secure a professorship.

If Cal didn’t become a professor, he’d have to do something else, and this made him wonder: What makes people love their work? As he waited to hear back about his job applications, he studied performance science, interviewed people about their professional successes and failures, and tested out his hypotheses on his own career and life.

Interestingly, he discovered that the best way to find or create work you love is _not_ to follow your passion, as so many career counselors, books, and well-meaning mentors advise. In fact, **the best way to love what you do is to become highly skilled—so good no one can ignore you. Then, you offer your skills in exchange for work that allows you autonomy and the opportunity to change the world** , two of the most significant contributors to workplace satisfaction.

_So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ describes four rules to loving your work:

  1. Don’t concern yourself with passion.
  2. Instead, improve your skills.
  3. Cash in your skills for autonomy.
  4. Cash in your skills for the opportunity to change the world.



Each of the following sections will define the rule in more detail, offer strategies to put its recommendations into action, and showcase examples of both successful and failed applications of the rule.

(Shortform note: For clarity and coherence, we’ve moved the information in the original book’s conclusion into earlier chapters.)
