## Introduction

Investing well over the long term does not require incredible intelligence or deep insight. Instead, it requires two things:

  * A rational framework for making decisions
  * Preventing your emotions, and other people’s emotions, from overriding your framework



With these two elements, and without extensive trading experience, you can do better than more financially-educated people who lack patience, discipline, and emotional control.

**Investing successfully in stocks requires keeping a few key principles in mind:**

  * A stock is not just a mere object you trade. It is a piece of ownership in a business. Therefore, the stock has a fundamental value that is often not the share price. Understand the business, and you understand the fundamental value.
  * Pay attention to the price at which you buy stock. The more you pay for a stock, the lower your return will be. Buying stock carelessly, with the expectation that you can buy anytime at any price and still profit, is a mistake. As Graham says, “buy your stocks like you buy your groceries, not like you buy your perfume.”
  * The market has constant mood swings. At times, it is over-optimistic, which makes stocks too expensive. At other times, it is pessimistic, which makes stocks cheap. The key is to buy from pessimists and sell to optimists.
  * Keep a “margin of safety”—don’t get carried away and overpay for a stock, or a downturn can cause irrevocable losses.



Warren Buffet read this book when he was 19 years old, and he still calls this “by far the best book about investing ever written.

### Brief Biography of Benjamin Graham

Graham was born in 1894 and lived his childhood in New York. His father died when he was 9, the family business failed, and the family became poor. Her mother traded stocks on margin and became bankrupt in the stock market panic of 1907. This incident deeply influenced Graham’s thinking on the importance of not suffering grave losses in investing.

Graham attended Columbia for college and entered Wall Street. Here he obsessed over analyzing stocks and companies in minute detail. He eventually founded his investment firm, the Graham-Newman Partnership, where he employed a young Warren Buffett. Over 20 years, his firm returned 14.7% annually (after fees), compared to 12.2% for the stock market.

In 1956, Graham Graham retired and closed his partnership and continued teaching and writing, sharing his principles of value investing worldwide. He died in 1976, a few years after his last revision of this book.

Graham led the movement of “value investing” and deeply influenced some of the world’s most successful investors, most notably Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway.

### Shortform Introduction

This book was first published in 1949, but it’s gone through multiple revisions since then. We’re summarizing the latest edition, which was published in 2003. Each of the 20 chapters in the book has two parts: 1) the original by Ben Graham, from his last revision in 1973, and 2) modern commentary by Jason Zweig, a finance columnist for the Wall Street Journal.

In his section, Graham often discusses the contemporary market of 1973, giving advice to the 1970s reader on how to invest based on the market conditions then. We’ll largely skim over these details to focus on the timeless principles, but we’ll keep the best examples.

Zweig’s modern commentary points out how Graham’s advice has been timeless through major stock market events, such as Black Monday in 1987 and the dot-com bubble in 2000. Since the book was written in 2003, it doesn’t address the great financial crisis of 2008 or the decade-long bull market following that, but disciples of Graham’s value investing would have little doubt the principles still hold.

Throughout the summary, by default the ideas come from Graham’s writing; we note which ideas and updates come from Zweig. Any mention of history after 1973 should be assumed to come from Zweig.

The book is written for investors in the United States investing in United States securities, but the ideas are likely applicable to any modern financial market.
