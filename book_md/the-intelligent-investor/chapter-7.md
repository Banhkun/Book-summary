## Chapter 7: The Aggressive Investor, Specifically

With the general mindset established, we can now cover the specific choices of the aggressive investor. While the defensive investor can earn market returns simply by investing in general mutual funds, the aggressive investor needs to seek pointed opportunities to be above average.

### Asset Classes to Avoid

An aggressive investor willing to do a lot of work will likely be more interested in a broad array of asset classes. If you know what you’re doing and can find good opportunities, you’ll likely enter areas that defensive investors should stay clear of.

However, Graham cautions against a set of instruments that even aggressive investors should be skeptical of. **An investor’s success is defined just as much by what he chooses _not_ to do **as by what he does.

For the below issues, the aggressive investor should be cautious and scrutinize the security before investing.

  * Be careful not to get carried away by the promise of higher returns while ignoring the risk and inadequate margin of safety.
  * Avoid buying each of these securities at full prices. Consider buying them only at steep discounts (where prices are below two-thirds of their fundamental value). 



In any of these classes, you may find clear bargains, but you need to be more careful than usual.

Defensive investors should avoid these entirely.

#### Second-Grade Bonds (Junk Bonds)

Companies with a sound position offer first-rate corporate bonds. More precarious companies with lower credit ratings issue lower-grade bonds (also known as “junk bonds”) with a higher interest rate.

One heuristic Graham uses to determine the grade of a bond is the **ratio of company earnings to interest charges**.

  * In the railroad industry, for instance, he prefers that a company earn at least 5 times the annual interest charge; less healthy companies might only have enough earnings to cover 1 times the interest charge.
  * In modern times, WorldCom sold $11.9 billion of bonds in 2001. However, its pretax income fell short of covering its interest charges by $4 billion. It could only pay off its interest by borrowing even more money. While its bonds did offer 8% yields for a few months, WorldCom went bankrupt in 2002.



It may be tempting to buy these lower-grade bonds purely for the sake of a higher yield. But Graham cautions that **it’s unwise to seek attractive yield without adequate safety**. The companies issuing lower-grade bonds have a higher chance of default and you may actually lose your entire principal, merely for an extra 1-2% of yield.

Therefore, a second-grade bond selling at par value is usually a bad investment. It’s better to buy lower-grade bonds at steep discounts. Because these bonds tend to rise and fall with markets, a patient investor will be able to find good deals.

In his modern commentary, Zweig mentions there are now junk-bond funds that allow more diversification across dozens of different junk bonds. While they do outperform Treasury bonds on paper, they tend to charge high fees.

#### Foreign Government Bonds

The trouble with owning foreign government bonds is that the owner of these bonds has no legal way of enforcing them. Unlike domestic companies, foreign governments are outside the domestic legal system.

Historically, foreign bonds have also had a poor history for much of the 20th century until at least when Graham wrote this book. For instance, Cuba issued bonds that reached a high of 117 in 1953, then defaulted on those bonds and brought the price down to 20 in 1963.

In his commentary, Zweig mentions there are now emerging-market mutual funds that, once again, allow diversification across foreign bonds. He notes that these have the useful property of not correlating strongly with the US stock market and may be useful as diversification, but don’t put more than 10% of total bond holdings into them.

#### New Stock Offerings (IPOs) and New Issues

In an initial public offering (IPO) or a new stock offering, privately owned companies “go public” and sell their stock to the public. This allows the company to sell their stock for cash, raising funds for further investment and allowing stockholders to cash out.

Not all new issues should categorically be dismissed, but **they deserve extra scrutiny** for two reasons:

  * The underwriters of the IPO (commonly investment banks) own a large portion of shares, so they have a passionate interest in painting the best picture of the company to pump up the price.
  * New issues are opportunistically sold under good market conditions (typically bullish), which means worse conditions for the buyer.



When considering IPOs, we tend to fixate on the landmark examples of the past—the Microsofts and the Apples—while forgetting that most other IPOs were bad investments. Zweig notes that, **between 1980 to 2001, if you had bought each IPO and kept it for 3 years, you would have underperformed the market by 23% annually**.

##### The IPO Cycle

IPO hype occurs in a cycle. History has shown a regular cycle of 1) a bullish period, during which private companies go public with soaring stock prices, followed by 2) steep declines in a market contraction. This occurred in 1945, then in 1960, then in 1967, the dotcom boom in the late 1990s, and so on.

In more detail, **the bullish period has a repeatable sequence that brings stocks to unfathomable heights** :

  * In the middle of the bull market, the first IPOs are priced reasonably, and its early buyers make large profits.
  * As the market continues to rise, more companies seek to cash out through IPOs, and the pace of new issues increases. At the same time, the quality of the companies going public deteriorates, and the prices soar to unreasonable heights.
  * During the bullish period, the fast rise of the new stock prices causes a greedy complacency that dulls the public’s critical skepticism. 
  * A sign of the coming end of the bull market appears when the new IPO stocks are priced comparably to mid-sized companies with a much longer track record.
  * As the bull market turns downward, the new public stocks may lose 75% or more of their initial price.



For a notable example, AAA Enterprises IPO’d at $14 a share in 1968, reached a peak of $28, then dropped to $0.25 in 1971 (a 98% drop). (We’ll cover this company more in Chapter 17.)

An intelligent investor needs to maintain his critical faculties during bull markets and avoid buying overpriced shares that are far outside the underlying value of the business. If you’re patient, you can pick up steeply discounted shares just years later when the hot stocks fall out of fashion.

#### Convertible Issues

(Shortform note: This material comes from Chapter 16.)

Convertible issues are bonds or preferred shares that have a conversion option—they allow the holder to convert the bonds or shares into common stock at a particular conversion ratio.

The sales pitch is that convertible issues are presumably a “best of both worlds” for everyone:

  * The investor gets the stability of a bond, while having the option of participating in the rise in a company’s stock price by converting.
  * The issuer gets to raise capital through a debt-like instrument—because of the value of the conversion option, the interest rate is usually lower. And if the company succeeds and the investor converts, the issuer gets rid of a senior creditor; in the meantime, the company isn’t diluted as much as if it issued new shares.



Despite these positive arguments, Graham believes **convertible issues are the worst of both worlds for the investor** :

  * By having the conversion option, the investor accepts a lower interest rate than would be available through standard bonds. Thus, in bear markets, they underperform bonds, yet they carry more risk by being more junior in debt obligations.
  * The value of convertible issues rises and falls with the company stock price. An investor with typical psychology would convert the shares when the stock is rising, but that’s precisely when the stock is likely overpriced.
  * Companies that issue convertible securities tend to be of lower quality with worse long-term prospects. Instead of buying stock in these companies, investors think convertible issues are safer. But if you wouldn’t buy stock in these companies, why would you want to hold convertible securities?



In other words, if a company is strong, you should invest in its stock directly. If you want the security of bonds, then just buy bonds. The middle ground of convertible issues is usually an unnecessary compromise. (As with any of the securities in this section, there may be exceptions where a convertible issue is more attractive than the common stock or bonds, but you will have to search for them.)

### How to Choose Stocks

With these cautionary notes out of the way, which stocks _should_ the aggressive investor choose? Graham describes four general strategies that aggressive investors take and offers his opinion on each:

  1. **Market timing** : buying in bear markets and selling in bull markets
  2. **Growth stocks** : identifying stocks with high potential to growth
  3. **Bargain stocks** : finding that have fallen out of favor of the market and are trading well under a reasonable price (this is Graham’s preferred strategy)
  4. **Special situations** : idiosyncratic situations, such as acquisitions, bankruptcy, and legal proceedings



One strong general theme runs through: **when you consider the wisdom of investing in a stock, you cannot ignore its price**.

  * A very promising company with bright prospects may still be a bad investment, if its high price already reflects the market’s enthusiasm for the stock.
  * “Buy your stocks like you buy your groceries, not like you buy perfume.”



(Shortform note: While Graham focuses his advice on choosing stocks, the principles for choosing specific bonds are analogous.)

#### Market Timing

Market timing has a strong allure: buy when the market is down, and sell when the market is up. **The trouble is determining when exactly the bottom or the peak of a market is.** This often seems obvious in retrospect but is exceedingly difficult to predict in the future.

Graham notes that markets have resisted any reliable mathematical diagnosis of when a market is poised to collapse or to boom. In his commentary, Zweig adds that even professionals who spend their entire careers attempting market timing are empirically unsuccessful at it. So think carefully: why should you do any better?

We’ll cover more of market timing in Chapter 8, when discussing Graham’s famous Mr. Market idea.

#### Growth Stocks

Growth stocks are stocks that have grown earnings well in the recent past and are expected to continue growing them into the future.

The simplistic strategy is to choose a basket of stocks that have recently outperformed the market, expecting them to continue outperforming. However, growth funds specializing in this strategy have not been shown to outperform the market and often do worse.

Why doesn’t this work reliably? There are two major issues:

  1. Because the company has already outperformed in the past, the market has already developed an optimism for the stock, and so **the stock may already have its current price inflated**. Buying in at this point is risky: If the company fails to meet the market’s lofty expectations, its stock price may tumble.
     * Graham suggests that stocks with a price-to-earnings ratio of over 20 already have significant growth accounted for in the stock price.
  2. **It’s difficult to extrapolate future growth from recent history.** In practice, growth cannot continue forever. The larger the company, the harder it is to grow at the same rate. Beware of breathless enthusiasm for infinite growth possibilities.
     * In the 2000 dotcom bust, countless reputable investors forecast unlimited growth and considered traditional investing principles obsolete. Some stocks reached a price/earnings ratio of over 100! In hindsight, this was a gross overestimation of growth prospects, and the stocks crashed back to earth.



Graham also **advises against buying stocks based merely on _industry_ growth.** It’s hard to consistently pick the best companies in the best industries—even experts fail at it.

  * In the 1950s, airline traffic was poised to grow by multiples. But investing in airlines would have been a mistake—despite rising revenues, airlines were chronically unprofitable.



##### Beware the Fantasy Stories

Investing history is rife with fantastical stories of early investors in companies such as Microsoft and Apple, who grew their initial stakes 100-fold into fortunes.

While it’s tempting to find opportunities like this as a public outsider, Graham notes that **these fortunes are usually made only by people with a close tie to the company** , such as the founders, employees, or family members of either. These insiders have stronger reasons to hold onto the stock than you would as an outsider; they held onto the stock through its fluctuations, while you would face significantly more psychological pressure to capture your gains or stem your losses.

In his commentary, Zweig adds that many of these fortunes were made by heavy concentration in one stock, as with Bill Gates and Microsoft. However, history is unkind to people who concentrate so heavily. Take the 400 richest people on the _Forbes_ list in 1982 and look 20 years later—only 64 (or 16%) remained on the list in 2002. The rest had most of their worth tied to their business and enjoyed a temporary fortune; when their businesses went south, their worth followed.

#### Bargain Stocks

Finding bargain stocks is Graham’s preferred method. Here’s the general idea: markets are made up of people who are impulsive and follow each other. This can cause major fluctuations in price (both up and down) that are irrational, based on the stock’s underlying value.

**When a company has fallen _out_ of favor, its price will drop below what the fundamentals of the company would warrant. The stock has now become a bargain**—if you buy them, they may later recover their prices and be good investments.

Graham defines a bargain as **a stock that has a real value of at least 50% more than the current price**. In other words, the price is below two-thirds of the stock’s value.

How do you calculate the stock’s value, then? Two methods:

  * Take the company’s future earnings and multiply these by a factor relevant to the company and industry. (Shortform note: a related method is discounted cash flow.)
  * Estimate the value of the business to a buyer. This value might generally be similar to the future earnings method, but more attention might be paid to the value of assets.



To be more concrete, Graham shares a few flavors of bargain stocks.

##### The Unpopular Large Company

Large companies with a history of good performance and a sound position are like large, steady ships: they can weather many storms, since they have the resources to work through sudden problems and bad macroeconomic conditions.

However, these companies might fall out of favor in the market because of bad news (like a small scandal or a news report). **The market may overreact, thinking that the news reflects a permanent, irrecoverable loss in the value of the company. In reality, the large companies can recover quickly** , and the market may regain confidence in it quickly given the company’s strong track record.

Here are a few examples:

  * In October 1982, seven people in Chicago died from Tylenol laced with cyanide. The parent company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) saw its stock fall by 17.5%, but within the year it introduced new tamper-proof packaging. Tylenol regained its market leader status, and J&J quickly regained its share price and became a strong growth stock through the 1980s.
  * Similarly, in July 2002, J&J announced a federal investigation into record keeping at one of its factories, and its stock price fell 16% in a day (taking its price-to-earnings ratio from 24 to 20). It recovered its price within a few weeks.
  * In 2002, the cruise ship operator Carnival lost 10% of its value when news came out of tourists getting sick _on the ships of other companies_.



Beware, however, that not all companies can recover from bad news. Some companies may start trading at an apparent discount and indeed show a permanent loss in stock price.

**How do you identify companies that _can_ weather the storm?**

  * It should have stable earnings over the past 10 years or more.
  * It should be large enough and have strong enough finances to overcome future problems.



##### Untraditional Earnings

Some companies may have accounting idiosyncrasies that obscure its real earnings potential. Graham cites Northern Pacific Railway, which had real earnings in 1947 of $10 per share but had a stock price of $13.50, because railroad companies used accounting methods that underestimated its earnings potential.

##### Value Less Than Net Working Capital

At times, a company’s market capitalization may be lower than its net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities). This is an odd situation, since it suggests a buyer could buy the company and get all its fixed assets (property, equipment) and goodwill for free.

**Very few companies are truly in such a poor situation that it should be worth less than net working capital** , so more likely it has simply fallen temporarily out of the market’s favor.

##### Secondary, Non-market Leader Companies

The large market leader of an industry tends to be a “blue chip” type of stock, with relatively predictable stock price performance. The secondary companies, or companies who are not market leaders, have a more lopsided potential—they are smaller and thus more at risk of failing, but, being smaller, they are able to grow faster than large companies.

Therefore, secondary companies are more susceptible to the current market fashion. The fashion has oscillated over time:

  * The Great Depression in the early 1930s was especially harsh to secondary companies, so the market avoided them for decades, preferring the stability of large market leaders.
  * After World War II, the economic boom benefited all companies but was especially kind to smaller companies, which had more room to grow. Thus small company stocks grew faster than large company stocks, and they became fashionable.
  * Each boom and bust cycle tends to show this pattern. In times of technological hype, as in the 1960s with electronics and computer companies, the small startup companies tend to have wildly inflated values.



The key, then, is to **invest when secondary companies are out of fashion, when the market believes they are headed to extinction**. In reality, this is an overreaction—secondary companies are often solid businesses on their own right, and they may be comparable in size to leaders in smaller industries. Thus there’s no general reason they shouldn’t have an equal chance of longevity as larger companies.

#### Special Situations

These are special idiosyncratic situations that require considerable insight. Thus even most aggressive investors may be wise to avoid them unless they really know what they’re doing.

##### Acquisitions

At the time of Graham’s writing, large corporations favored the strategy of diversification by acquiring smaller companies. When buying public companies, a buyer often needs to persuade the target’s shareholders by offering a price well above its current trading stock price. If you expect a company is soon to be approached by a suitor, then you might invest in the seller’s stock.

Even after an acquisition is announced, it may represent an arbitrage opportunity.

  * For example, Acme Corp. may propose acquiring Beta Corp. by giving 1 Acme’s shares for 2 of Beta’s shares. If the transaction were certain to close, then Beta’s stock price should be half of Acme’s—for instance, Acme might be priced at $40 and Beta at $20. 
  * If Beta’s shares are priced less than this ratio, then the market believes the transaction is not certain to consummate. This presents an arbitrage opportunity—if you understood this transaction well and held a non-consensus view of its likelihood of consummating, you could earn a fairly quick return. This of course is subject to the risk of the deal not consummating, at which point you’d likely suffer a loss.



##### Bankruptcy

Companies going through bankruptcy reorganization may have old bonds that can be exchanged for new securities after the reorganization, producing a kind of arbitrage. There’s a risk that the company doesn’t reorganize successfully.

##### Legal Proceedings

There’s an investing maxim that goes, “Never buy into a lawsuit.” If most of the market believes this, then a company running into legal issues may have an underpriced stock. Some of these companies may indeed face permanent damage, but others may recover.

##### Closely Held Companies

Graham’s definition of a bargain (two-thirds of its underlying value) pertains to outside investors who do not control a company. If you do control a company, then you can consider buying shares at a value above Graham’s bargain price, at a fair value in the private market.
