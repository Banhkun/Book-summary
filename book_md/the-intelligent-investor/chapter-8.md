## Chapter 8: Market Fluctuations and Mr. Market

When asked to predict what the market would do, the financier J.P. Morgan said, “it will fluctuate.”

You can be sure that the market will fluctuate. In all likelihood, you will not be able to _predict_ when and how the market fluctuates. You can, however, respond in two critical ways:

  1. **Steel yourself mentally for the fluctuations.** Prepare for the idea that your portfolio may decline by 30% from its high point, and don’t tie your emotions to these fluctuations.
  2. **Watch patiently and prepare to spot opportunities when they do appear.** When the market sours on a stock, it can be an overreaction and present a bargain buying opportunity.



We cover two trading strategies that deal with market fluctuations: market timing and stock pricing. Graham is sour on the former as a reliable investment strategy, but, as we’ve seen, he believes in the latter.

### Market Timing Doesn’t Work

Market timing has a strong allure: buy when the market is down, and sell when the market is up. The trouble is determining when exactly the bottom or the peak of a market is. This often seems obvious in retrospect but is exceedingly difficult to predict in the future.

Graham argues that **market timing is so unreliable that it should be considered speculation**. There is little evidence that any individual investor should be able to beat the overall market at market timing.

#### Why Do People Like Market Timing?

Speculators are drawn to market timing for a variety of reasons:

  * They are impatient to do _something_ in the market and to have _some_ opinion about the market. It’s less entertaining to sit idly until stocks fall under your criteria for a bargain.
  * They have an arrogant presumption that if you’re smart enough, you can predict how the market will move. Investment “experts” profess to have these clairvoyant powers and put out endless predictions daily, but in reality they are woefully inaccurate.
  * Compared to the hard work of evaluating a business’s fundamental value, market timing is relatively simple—guess whether the market is too high or too low, and sell accordingly.



#### Why Doesn’t Market Timing Work?

Simple mathematical formulas to determine whether the market is at a peak or bottom (such as relying on overall price-to-earnings ratios) tend not to work. There are two major reasons why:

  * A formula may _seem_ to work when backtesting across past years or decades. However, **it may simply have been illusory** —a pattern fitting due to random chance, or a strategy that worked in an idiosyncratic period—and provide no predictive power going forward.
  * The formula may indeed have worked in history, but if a strategy provides a real advantage in the market and is simple to execute, **it will be adopted so quickly and widely that it loses its advantage**. (Shortform note: The advantage disappears because if enough people adopt the formula, market prices will adjust in an unfavorable way. For example, a formula may predict when a market’s bottom is and thus when to buy. If enough people buy at that point, prices will rise, meaning the stocks are no longer a bargain and there is less room for the price to appreciate.)



**Any simple formula that can be easily adopted by the market most likely does not present an advantage over the long term.**

Graham comments on how, in the first half of the 20th century, there were ten market cycles running from high to low and back again. Most bull markets fit a certain pattern, such as having a high price level, high price/earnings ratios, and a high number of low-quality stock offerings. Seeing these warning signs of the top of a bull market, an investor might reasonably sell and wait for the market to turn.

However, this pattern didn’t fit all cycles, such as the bull market of the late 1920s or the postwar market from 1950 to 1970. During these times, the market soared beyond warning signs that applied in previous cycles. An investor trusting these signals would have sat out much of the market’s growth. Even worse, an investor might get so uncomfortable seeing the market leave him behind that he abandons all caution and buys into the market, right at the point at which it is overvalued and really due for a downturn.

### Stock Price Fluctuations

In a narrow sense, a stock price should be considered an indication of the value of a business. If you examined a private business and tried to estimate its value, you might consider its book value (or its assets minus liabilities), as well as its current earnings.

However, in public markets, a high-quality company tends to have its stock price inflated well above book value. This is due to the market’s expectation that the company will continue growing (and so today’s stock price might represent the company’s book value 10 or 20 years from now).

**The more a stock price deviates from the company’s current book value, the more speculative the stock is, and the more volatile the price will be.** When the stock price well exceeds the appraisal value of the business, the movements of the stock price are not really based around whether the _fundamental_ value of the business has changed, but more around the enthusiasm of speculators.

This is why fundamentally sound companies can see their stock price change dramatically, even when the underlying business hasn’t changed much at all. For instance, in 1963 IBM stock fell by half, from 607 to 300, even though its long-term growth prospects hadn’t materially changed.

Graham thus cautions the conservative investor to **concentrate on stocks trading at no more than one-third above the company’s book value**. Investments in these stocks can be justified on solid financial grounds and will be less subject to the whimsies of stock speculators.

#### Example: A&P

To illustrate the wild fluctuations of stocks, Graham gives the example of A&P, a grocery store chain. From 1915 to 1965, A&P was the largest retailer in the US. Durings its lifetime, its shares went from tremendous bargain to alarmingly overpriced.

##### A&P Stock Reaches a Low

In 1929, A&P started trading publicly, with stocks as high as 494. By 1932 the price had fallen to 104, and in the recession of 1938 it plummeted to a low of 36.

This low price was remarkable. The market valued the company at $126 million, less than its current assets: $85 million in cash and working capital of $134 million. At this time, A&P was the largest retailer in the country, if not the world, yet **the market believed it was worth less than if the company were liquidated that day**.

Why would the market believe this? Partially because of the overall depressed bear market, and partially because of temporary fears (chain stores might have new taxes levied against them, and earnings had declined).

Any investor holding stock in A&P would have felt the emotional pull of the stock’s collapse, but on inspection he might find that A&P was still a sound company with strong future prospects. Instead of selling in a panic with the rest of the market, he would judiciously hold onto his stock or even buy even more stock at a bargain. He would find himself vindicated. In 1939, A&P shares rose to 117.5, triple the low the previous year.

##### A&P Stock Reaches a High

In 1961, the price soared to the equivalent of 705 (the stock had a 10-for-1 split, so its literal price was 70.5). This represented a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, compared to 23 for the Dow Jones index.

This rich price implied bright growth prospects. In reality, A&P was headed for an irrecoverable decline in earnings and revenue. The company was larger than it was 30 years ago, but it was not managed as well, was not as profitable, and could not ward off competition. Within a year, the stock price halved to 34, then over ten years halved again to 18 in 1972.

The example illustrates the vacillations of the stock market in relation to the fundamental prospects of the business. **When A &P was in its prime and poised for growth, the market wouldn’t touch the stock. Inversely, when A&P was headed for obsolescence, the market was breathlessly enthusiastic about its future.**

A patient, alert investor will watch for gross aberrations like these and take advantage.

### Don’t Be Pressured to Act

Now that you know stock prices vary, you should prepare yourself psychologically for this reality.

It’s human nature to have your emotions pulled with the market.

  * When you haven’t bought stock and the price rises, you fear missing out and regret not having bought earlier.
  * When you hold stock and the price rises, you wonder whether growth might indeed be limitless. Should you buy more at this inflated price and be overcome with greed like everyone else?
  * When you hold a stock and the price falls, you worry whether you‘ve missed something. You may believe the business had sound prospects, but perhaps other people know something you don’t? Maybe you should sell to cap your losses?



Beyond simply _feeling_ these emotions, an even worse decision is to _act_ on the emotions—to buy greedily right when the stock is too high, to sell in a panic right when it is a bargain.

Objectively, this is silly. **If you know the fundamental value of a business, why should the mistakes of _other_ people influence _your_ behavior? **Behaving this way is like having your emotions and behavior dictated by other people. You have no obligation to act according to market fluctuations. **You should deliberately _choose_ to transact only when it is in your favor.**

In fact, you might largely be better off by pretending there is no quoted market for the shares day to day. If you don’t check the value of your home on an hourly basis, why should you do the same for stock prices?

To make this idea concrete, Graham gives his famous parable of Mr. Market.

#### Mr. Market

Say you own a piece of a business worth $1,000. Imagine a fellow named Mr. Market who is a manic-depressive sort of person and visits you once a day, asking to buy and sell your interest.

  * When the market is up, he asks to sell another piece to you at exorbitant prices: $1,500, $2,000. 
  * When the market is down, he comes by asking to buy your stake for $600.



Should you go along with this odd person, feeling exactly what he feels at every moment and doing what he demands?

Of course not. You know the piece of business is worth $1,000. You’d maintain your own rationality and politely ask this oddly behaving person to leave your house.

(Shortform note: To make the analogy even more concrete, imagine Mr. Market quoting you the price of a hard asset, like your home or car,. If your house is worth $200,000 and someone comes by asking you to sell it for $100,000, would you? Likely not, because you expect the future value to rise again. The same thinking should apply to stocks.)

Yet countless traders behave as Mr. Market demands they do. They buy when stocks are going up and sell when they have gone down.

**You shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely, nor should you blindly follow whatever he tells you, but rather use his prices only when it is to your advantage.** You are _not_ obligated to trade with him.

#### Your Psychological Advantage

In his commentary, Zweig notes that your psychology is your advantage in the market. As an investor, you compete with lots of other traders, including professional money managers. In most dimensions, you are outclassed by professional money managers—they have more resources, people, and experience than you.

**The one advantage you have over money managers is that you do not need to follow Mr. Market.** Money managers do, because they represent the interests of people (who themselves follow Mr. Market):

  * When the market rises, investors get greedy and put in more money, forcing money managers to buy more stocks (which drives price up more).
  * Likewise, when the market falls and investors withdraw money in a panic, money managers are forced to sell just as stocks are cheap.



This is essentially behaving as Mr. Market demands. You do not need to suffer the same obligation.

#### Invert the News

One manifestation of Mr. Market is the way that financial news is commonly related. When stock prices go up, there is jubilation; when it falls, there is doom and gloom. These daily mood swings don’t really make sense—**if you’re investing for an outcome 20 or 30 years from now, why should the movements on a single day (one ten-thousandth of your time span) make any difference?**

In his commentary, Zweig proposes an interesting inversion of normal financial news.

  * **When the stock market has fallen, frame this as the positive.** “Stocks became even more of a bargain today, adding a 5% discount to its already steeply discounted price. This is an unprecedented buying opportunity for affordable stocks.” 
  * Likewise, **when the market is raging to new heights, sound loud warnings.** “Markets soared to dangerous heights today, with stocks at a 180% premium over their fair value. These stocks have become a certifiable rip-off and may get worse in the coming months.”



Inverting news this way may help you counter the natural effects of Mr. Market.
