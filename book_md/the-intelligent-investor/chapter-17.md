## Chapter 17: Case Studies in Failed Companies

(Shortform note: Chapter 16 discussed convertible issues; we covered this in Chapter 7 on what the Aggressive Investor should avoid.)

When choosing investments, it’s as important to avoid overhyped companies on the brink of failure as it is to choose bargain stocks. Graham shows four case studies of companies that had astronomical stock prices but showed clear warning signs of their impending demise. Moreover, to detect their weak conditions, you wouldn’t have needed to understand their intricate workings—you could have used the basic financial metrics we’ve covered already.

Then, in his commentary, Zweig adds modern examples of each archetype.

The four archetypes shown are:

  * A giant company with signs of poor operating performance
  * An empire-building conglomerate that grows unwisely through acquisition
  * An acquisition where a small company absorbs a giant
  * A company with little substance riding a speculative wave



### Archetype 1: A Poorly Operating Giant

#### Penn Central

In 1970, the nation’s largest railroad company Penn Central filed for bankruptcy. This was shocking to the finance world, but Graham argues **its demise could have been predicted well in advance** :

  * The company had not paid income taxes for 11 years, yet it was regularly reporting earnings. How would this have been possible?
  * The standard interest coverage ratio (the ratio of earnings to interest charges) for railroads was 5:1 before taxes. In 1967 and 1968, Penn Central showed a ratio of just 1.9.
  * It was operationally inefficient. Railroad expenses made up 47.5% of its income in 1968, compared to 35.2% for a more efficient competitor.
  * Its accounting was fishy, with strange transactions that didn’t make much sense. Graham declines to go into detail.



Graham argues that anyone paying attention to the simple fundamentals of the business could have noticed that Penn Central was in deep trouble. At that time, they should have pulled their stock and bonds out of the company and exchanged them for more robust competitors.

#### Lucent

In 2000, Lucent Technologies had a valuation of $193 billion on roughly $32 billion in revenue. It was in a precarious position:

  * It had acquired a company for $4.8 billion—this company had zero revenue and no customers, and a book value of just $600 million.
  * Lucent had lent $1.5 billion to its customers to buy its products, under “customer financings.” How safe are your revenues if your customers need financial help buying your products?
  * It accounted for software development as a “capital asset,” not as an expense.
  * (Shortform note: In 2000, Lucent also reported a $125 million accounting error and a $700 million overstatement in revenues.)



By 2002, Lucent reported losses of $28 billion in two years; its stock fell 97%. (Shortform note: It later merged with Alcatel in 2006, forming Alcatel-Lucent, which was then acquired by Nokia).

### Archetype 2: An Empire-Builder that Falters

#### Ling-Temco-Vought

Ling-Temco-Vought was a conglomerate involved in industries as wide as aerospace, sporting goods, and pharmaceuticals.

(Shortform note: The conglomerate began with a young entrepreneur James Ling, who took his electrical contracting business public in 1955. From that point he began a blistering pace of acquisitions in a staggering array of industries. Taking advantage of low interest rates in the 1960s, Ling-Temco-Vought raised huge sums of debt to fund acquisitions. The strategy was relatively simple—as long as an acquired company’s earnings could cover the interest on debt used to acquire the company, the acquisition was profitable.)

**The nominal growth in the company was staggering** —revenue began at $7 million in 1958, grew _twenty-fold_ within 2 years to $143 million, then grew again twenty-fold again to $2.8 billion by 1968.

Yet **warning signs appeared through this steady rise** :

  * The acquisitions required debt, which ballooned to $1.5 billion by 1969. This was a near-record amount across all companies in history (Shortform note: On the financial tables shown, its assets to liabilities ratio generally remained between 1.0 and 2.0.)
  * Its ratio of earnings to interest didn’t pass the conservative benchmark of 5.
  * Its market price in 1967 was a remarkable 22 times net tangible assets.



In 1969, at its peak in sales, Ling-Temco-Vought reported a loss of $70 million (it had earned $124 million before taxes and interest, but interest charges were $122 million, swallowing up nearly all the profits; additional taxes and special items caused further losses).

Over the next few years, the stock price fell from its peak by over 95%.

(Shortform note: Graham doesn’t comment on the company’s fundamental business issues. It appears Ling-Temco-Vought suffered from:

  1. A general market downturn in 1970
  2. Investors’ realization that its acquired companies weren’t growing any faster as part of the conglomerate than before they were acquired, thus weakening the conglomeration strategy
  3. Antitrust concerns of conglomerates)



#### Tyco

In the late 1990s, Tyco was an acquisition machine. Over 4 years, it spent $37 billion buying hundreds of companies—in 2000, it acquired 200 companies, or more than one every two days.

The high-level results were impressive: by 2001, revenue had grown from $7 billion 5 years earlier to $34 billion. It showed operating income of $6.2 billion, and its valuation reached $114 billion.

However, the fundamental success of these acquisitions was questionable. In its financial statements, Tyco repeatedly wrote off acquisition-related charges of over $750 million per year. In 2002, it showed a $9 billion loss. (Shortform note: The same year, it suffered a corporate scandal in which the former CEO and CFO were convicted of stealing $150 million.)

### Archetype 3: A Tiny Company Swallows a Giant

#### NVF and Sharon Steel

In 1968, NVF, a company with $31 million in sales, **acquired a company seven times its size** : Sharon Steel Corp, a company with $219 million in sales.

To fund this acquisition, NVF issued $102 million of bonds with stock warrants attached. Warning signs then appeared:

  * Its financial reporting showed incomprehensible entries relating to debt expenses, cost of investment in Sharon Steel, and fair market value of warrants. The overall effect was to disguise the severity of the debt and of the dilution from the stock warrants.
  * The newly issued bonds soon traded at a steep discount (42 cents on the dollar), suggesting the market had deep concerns about its financial position.
  * In 1969 Sharon Steel adjusted its calculations for pension costs and lowered depreciation rates, thus artificially boosting earnings by $1 per share.



(Shortform note: Graham doesn’t discuss the stock performance of NVF, but Sharon Steel began defaulting on debt in 1985 and filed for bankruptcy in 1987. The chairman of NVF, Victor Posner, was a famed “corporate raider” and pioneer of leveraged buyout and hostile takeover strategies.)

#### America Online (AOL) and Time Warner

In 2001, AOL, a company with $6 billion in revenue, merged with Time Warner, a company with $27 billion in revenue. This was signaled as a “merger of equals,” but AOL was clearly the smaller company. The rationalization was that AOL, the hot Internet company, was going to revitalize the old media company Time Warner.

AOL was already on shaky ground:

  * The SEC had opened investigations into whether AOL had misleadingly represented marketing costs.
  * Half of AOL’s assets ($5 billion worth) consisted of stock in other companies; if the stock market fell, its asset base would also fall.



The eventual result: AOL Time Warner reported a $99 billion loss in 2002, to date still the largest corporate loss of all time (after accounting for inflation), and an 80% loss in stock price.

(Shortform note: The book doesn’t go further into fundamental reasons for the business’s failure, but general consensus points to 1) the bursting of the dotcom bubble, 2) the disruption of AOL’s dial-up Internet service by broadband Internet providers, 3) a clash of cultures between new AOL and old Time Warner that prevented real cooperation from materializing.)

### Archetype 4: An Illusory Company Riding a Speculative Wave

#### AAA Enterprises

In the late 1960s, the markets enjoyed a “franchising” craze—anything in the market with “franchising” in its strategy received hype and heady valuations.

In this environment, AAA Enterprises entered the stock market. Its historical business was selling mobile homes; it seized on the idea of franchising this business, allowing others to sell mobile homes with its corporate name. It had another business of preparing tax returns (using mobile homes as offices); this business too was turned into a franchise business.

In 1969, AAA Enterprises sold 500,000 shares to the investing public, at $13 per share. The stock soon more than doubled to 28, producing a valuation of $84 million. **For the company’s financial performance, this price was astronomical** —this price was ten times book value; at earnings of $690,000, **the price-to-earnings ratio was 115 times**!

By this point in the book, an intelligent investor knows to be skeptical of overhyped stocks that are driven by wild speculation and promises of limitless future growth. AAA Enterprises soon fell to the ground:

  * The company grew quickly, opening retail carpet stores and acquiring a manufacturer of mobile homes. These appeared to be poor ventures—in the fourth quarter of 1969, the company lost $4.4 million, dwarfing all the money it raised in the stock offering and its earnings to date.
  * Through 1970, the company continued to lose money and was supported by loans from the company’s founder.
  * In 1971, AAA filed for bankruptcy. 



Graham isn’t shy about blaming the parties involved for such a clear failure:

  * The underwriters clearly profited from the jump in share price, not just for this company but in encouraging imitator IPOs who also wanted to cash in on the exuberant times.
  * Speculators are “incorrigible” and will “fall for” any company spouting the latest buzzwords, regardless of actual company performance.
  * AAA Enterprises designed itself to take advantage of the franchising hype—it even likely chose the name “AAA” so that it’d appear first in listings of stocks, thus being a beneficiary of speculative energy.



#### eToys

In 1999, Internet retailer eToys went public at a valuation of $7.8 billion. It was a tiny company with sales of just $30 million and assets of $31 million; in comparison, Toys “R” Us was worth $2 billion less at $5.6 billion, with 70-fold more revenue ($2.1 billion) and total assets of $8 billion.

How did this make any sense? eToys showed an astounding growth rate of 4,261% in the past year. However, as Graham has cautioned us, smaller companies are able to grow at astounding rates that they cannot sustain (a 42-fold growth in revenue suggests eToys had just $700,000 in revenue the previous year).

Even worse, while it showed revenue of $30 million, eToys suffered a loss of an equal size, at $31 million—it was losing a dollar for every dollar it brought in.

In 2001, eToys filed for bankruptcy, and its stock fell from $86 per share to zero.
