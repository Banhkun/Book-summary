## Chapter 4-5: The Defensive Investor

With some market fundamentals covered, we’ll now discuss the two major types of investors: defensive investors in this chapter, and aggressive investors in the next.

**Defensive investors** want to avoid spending too much time on investing. They like simplicity and don’t love thinking about investments or money. Their goal is to perform on average in line with the market, and to avoid serious mistakes.

We’ll cover how the defensive investor should invest, both from a philosophical point of view on how to behave and a tactical point of view on what stocks and bonds to buy.

### How Should Defensive Investors Invest?

Graham’s recommendation is to split investments between stocks and bonds. **The default split is 50-50 between stocks and bonds**. This allows you to participate in both the gains of stocks as well as the relative safety of bonds.

At times, you can shift your balance in favor of stocks or bonds. If you feel stocks are overpriced and due for a downturn, you can shift your investment to 25% in stocks and 75% in bonds. Likewise, after a steep market downturn or when stocks are cheap, you might shift to 75% in stocks and 25% in bonds. But Graham advises no more than a 75-25 imbalance.

Why is this? **Why not put 100% of your investment into bonds?** Three reasons:

  * Stocks on average rise faster than inflation, whereas bonds might not, so holding stocks better protects against inflation. 
  * Stocks tend to have better returns (though this isn’t always true; if interest rates are very high, as they were in parts of the 1970s and early 80s, bonds may provide better returns).
  * If you invest 100% into bonds, but the stock market grows tremendously, you’d feel regret on missing out.



**And why not 100% into stocks?**

  * Stocks don’t always outperform bonds at all times. At the time of Graham’s last revision in 1973, bonds were outperforming stocks. Keeping a balance helps you weather a variety of economic conditions. 
  * Stocks fluctuate much more than bonds do, and the wild oscillations of a 100% stock portfolio may test the investor’s equanimity. A terrible mistake you can make as an investor is to sell as the stock market craters, and buy at the peak of its hype. Holding a minimum 25% in bonds gives some psychological cushion against stock market falls.



In short, **keeping a standard split is simple, provides adequate returns, and prevents your emotions from sabotaging yourself**.

#### The Myth of Age

There’s a common rule of thumb that your split between stocks and bonds should depend on your age: subtract your age from 100, and that is the percentage that should be held in stocks.

But Graham never mentions age in his advice, for good reason. Zweig supports this point, arguing **age shouldn’t affect your investment decisions—your personal circumstances are what matter**.

In particular, you can feel more comfortable holding more stocks if:

  * You do not need to sell your stocks at inopportune times to support your living costs.
  * You can withstand severe drops in the stock market.
  * You do not need your investments to provide cash income. Generally, bonds provide more in interest payments than stocks do in dividends.



Consider two different situations that buck the common wisdom:

  * A retired 80-year-old who has a pension to cover all her living expenses, $2 million in assets, and grandchildren. Investing mostly in bonds is a mistake—she doesn’t need to rely on investments for income. Furthermore, her descendants, who will inherit her assets, have decades of investment in their timeline, and stocks will provide better returns on that timeline.
  * A working 30-year-old who has $50,000 and is saving up for his down payment on a house. It’d be silly to put all of that in the stock market—if the stock market fell, he’d have to change his life plans.



#### Portfolio Rebalancing

Over time, as your investment values fluctuate, the proportion between stocks and bonds will deviate from your desired ratio. For example, if you start with $10,000 and a 50-50 split between stocks and bonds, over time you may end up with $6,500 in stocks and $5,500 in bonds, leading to a 54:46 split. At this time, **you should “rebalance” your portfolio** to return to 50-50. You can do this by selling stocks and buying bonds, or if you have more money to invest, you would buy relatively more bonds than stocks in this round of investment to return to a 50-50 split.

**You shouldn’t rebalance more frequently than once or twice a year.** If you’re checking your investments on a daily basis and spending hours per week, you’re getting too involved to be a defensive investor, and your emotions will likely start ruling your decisions.

#### Dollar-Cost Averaging

If you have a lump sum of money, how would you invest it? Some investors, tempted to get higher than market returns, might choose to “time the market,” waiting until a market dip to invest. The very likely risk is that the investor turns out to be entirely wrong, either losing out on gains as the market rises, or mistiming the bottom.

In contrast, Graham recommends **dollar-cost averaging** —split up the lump sum into multiple investments of equal amounts, distributed over a longer period of time (such as every month or quarter). This is a straightforward strategy that requires minimum thinking and emotional investment.

Graham argues for the psychological benefits of dollar-cost averaging: **you remain emotionally detached from the swings of the market**. Regardless of whether prices are up or down, you invest the same amount.

Practically, this prevents you from overreacting in bad directions:

  * When the stock market crashes, most people become fearful about investing, yet this is the point at which stocks are cheapest. Dollar-cost averaging forces you to invest the same amount.
  * Likewise, in a strong bull market, you might be tempted to buy stocks at steep prices. Dollar-cost averaging prevents you from getting carried away and investing more than is wise.



Psychologically, dollar-cost averaging helps you **avoid the delusion that you can predict the market**. Zweig notes that your response to any investment question should be “I don’t know and I don’t care.”

  * Are technology stocks worth doubling down on? Is this hot new company worth investing in at its premium price? “I don’t know and I don’t care”—if you invest in mutual funds, they already capture a large part of most industries, and any hot company that succeeds will be a part of your portfolio soon enough. 
  * Is the stock market going to rise or fall in the next month? “I don’t know and I don’t care”—if it rises, your existing investments will capture that gain; if it falls, you will invest more later at a lower price.



(Shortform note: Dollar-cost averaging has been studied extensively, with both strong advocates and critics. Critics argue that it leads to subpar performance—in short, if the expected value of your investment is positive, then you should invest as early as possible to capture that expected value. Proponents of dollar-cost averaging suggest that, even if it doesn’t yield superior returns, it carries benefits in psychological ease and simplicity.)

### What Stocks and Bonds to Buy?

Now that you understand the general split between stocks and bonds, what do you actually _buy_? Graham spends a few chapters giving advice on choosing specific individual bonds and stocks because, in the mid-20th century, those were the only options available to investors.

Since then, a large number of **low-cost mutual funds** have become popular. These funds hold a wide basket of assets, such as stocks and bonds, thus providing diversification with minimal effort. (Shortform note: For instance, Vanguard has a fund for the entire US stock market, as well as a fund for short-term Treasury bills. When you buy a share of such a fund, you essentially hold a small piece of everything the fund holds.) Such diversification makes dollar-cost averaging and rebalancing easy to execute, since you only need to buy one fund instead of balancing across dozens of stocks.

And in contrast to high-cost mutual funds in the 20th century, where annual fees might be as high as 1-2% of your investment, these days competition has driven the fees down to the range of 0.05% (a $10,000 investment would cost just $5 per year).

Graham was a big fan of index funds, and **the modern defensive investor may do well simply by investing in index funds** at Graham’s recommended split. But for comprehensiveness, we’ll cover his advice to the defensive investor for choosing specific stocks and bonds.

### What Stocks to Buy?

For any investor, the classic mistakes in buying stocks are:

  * **Paying too high a price for a stock:** This is especially risky in 1) strong bull markets, when the market seems like it can only rise with no possibility of a downturn, or 2) for hot stocks, where speculators drive up the price expecting the company to outperform in the long term.
  * **Withdrawing from the stock market after a steep crash** , when most people view stocks as too risky. At this time, stocks are especially cheap.



To counter these mistakes, Graham issues four simple rules for choosing stocks:

**1\. Diversify, but not excessively.**

Graham advises holding at least 10 and at most 30 stocks.

**2\. Buy large, prominent companies with conservative financing.**

Let’s define each of the three terms:

  * Large: In 1973, Graham defined large as having at least $50 million in assets or revenue. In modern commentary, Zweig suggests the bar is companies with at least $10 billion in market capitalization.
  * Prominent: The company should be a leader in its industry, and be in the top 25% by size.
  * Conservative financing: The company’s market capitalization should be no more than double its book value.



(Shortform note: Critics argue that book value is unreliable in modern times, since book value excludes the value of intangible assets like intellectual property or brand value. Thus, relying on book value alone would eliminate a swath of promising investments.)

**3\. Buy companies with a record of continuous dividend payments.**

In 1973, Graham argued for companies that regularly paid dividends over the past 20 years. In recent times, companies have paid dividends much less regularly, so Zweig adjusts the time frame to the past 10 years.

**4\. Impose a price maximum on stocks you buy.**

Graham argues for a maximum per-share price of 25 times average earnings over the past 7 years, or 20 times earnings over the past 12 months.

Notably, this rule excludes hot “growth stocks,” for good reason. Growth stocks often represent new companies that are growing rapidly but are unprofitable or have only meager earnings. Thus, their price-to-earnings ratio may be far above 20 times. Graham argues that these stocks are too risky for the defensive investor—without thorough analysis, **a defensive investor is very unlikely to repeatedly pick the right stocks at the right times**.

Finally, don’t buy common stock for its dividend income alone. The stock price must still be reasonable, and the company should be fundamentally sound.

We’ll return to more technical guidance on how to pick stocks in Chapters 14-15, after we cover more fundamentals of stock analysis and market mindset.

#### Don’t “Buy What You Know”

In his commentary, Zweig cautions against the common wisdom of “buy what you know.” The premise of “buy what you know” is that, as an ordinary consumer, you know what brands and products you like, and in this sense you might know more about the company than professional stock analysts. Thus, you should buy stocks of companies you like.

Of course, this simple-minded view violates Graham’s universal principles of considering the underlying value of the stock, and the stock price in relation to its value. If you were a disciplined investor, you would consider whether the stock was overpriced, regardless of how much you liked the company emotionally.

This applies generally to **being complacent about what you’re familiar with**. The more you think you know about something, the less you are to probe for real weaknesses.

Notably, this applies to people owning their own company’s stock in their retirement portfolios. Does it ever make sense to have a third of your entire stock portfolio in a single company? If not, then why would it make sense to invest it in your employer?

### What Bonds Should You Buy?

#### Shortform Exclusive: Introduction to Bonds

(Graham skips over explaining what bonds are, assuming the reader already has knowledge. We wrote this introduction in case you’re unfamiliar.)

Bonds represent loans made by an investor to a borrower. As an investor, you can buy bonds from companies, municipalities, states, and national governments. When you buy a bond, you become a creditor—the bond issuer owes you money.

A bond consists of a few components:

  * The **principal** : the amount of money that is borrowed, also known as the “face value”
  * The **coupon** : the interest rate that is paid to bondholders.
  * The **maturity date** : the date at which the principal will be paid back.



For example, say today you buy a treasury bond from the US federal government with a principal of $10,000. The term is 20 years, with a coupon rate of 4%. Every year, you will receive $400 in interest payments. In 20 years, the government will pay you back $10,000.

The bond is also tradeable. You can buy the bond from the government, then sell it to another investor. You aren’t required to hold onto a bond until the maturity date.

The bond therefore has a market price that depends on outside circumstances, particularly the market interest rates. Once it’s issued, a bond is a fixed instrument with defined terms—it will pay certain amounts at certain dates. The fixed amount that bond pays can have changing values in different periods:

  * If the interest rate in the larger market declines, the price of a bond increases. For example, say you have a bond with a 4% coupon while overall interest rates are at 2%. The bond is paying out more than current interest rates, and it thus becomes more valuable. The price of this bond might significantly exceed the $10,000 in face value.
  * Likewise, if the overall interest rate increases, the price of a bond decreases. For example, if interest rates rise to 6%, there are better opportunities to invest elsewhere than in the 4% bond. The price of a bond might fall much lower than the $10,000 in face value.



There are many more complexities to bonds, but this should suffice to build an intuition for how bonds work.

#### Zweig’s Commentary on Bonds

In his modern commentary, Zweig offers the following additional tips:

  * Most bonds are sold in $10,000 lots, and you need at least 10 bonds to diversify away the risk of default. Therefore, unless you have $100,000 to invest in bonds, you should **invest in bond funds instead**. These diversify over a wide basket of bonds without your needing to do individual research.
  * If you really want to buy individual bonds, instead of buying short-term or long-term bonds, strike the middle: 5-10 year maturity dates. These have more dampened fluctuations than long-term bond prices, while they capture more upside than short-term bonds.



#### Types of Bonds

When deciding what bonds to buy, there are more considerations:

  * **Tax status** : some bonds provide tax-free coupon income, while others are taxable.
  * **Maturity date** : are bonds with shorter terms or longer terms better?
  * **Risk of default** : a borrower defaults when it’s unable to make payments on its loans. The borrower may ultimately declare bankruptcy, and the bond may lose a substantial part of its value. Thus, higher-risk borrowers can only issue bonds at higher interest rates—its lenders demand the extra payments to compensate for the higher risk of bankruptcy.



For tax status, the question is straightforward—a taxable bond should compensate for your income tax bracket with a higher coupon. For example, if your tax bracket is 30%, then a tax-free bond with a 7% coupon and a taxable bond with a 10% coupon are equivalent. Thus, a tax-free bond with a coupon rate higher than 7% would be relatively more attractive, and likewise for a taxable bond with a coupon higher than 10%.

**Don’t buy tax-free bonds in your retirement accounts** , like your 401(k) or IRA. In these tax-advantaged accounts, you should hold taxable bonds instead.

To address the other issues, Graham provides an overview of the major types of bonds. While the yields for all types of bonds fluctuate over time, the general properties stay consistent.

##### US Savings Bonds (Series E)

  * Maturity: Up to 30 years
  * Federal tax: Yes | State tax: No
  * Risk of default: Very low



Notes:

  * Allows for redemption at any time. Graham notes that this unique flexibility could compensate for lower returns.
  * Graham discusses Series H bonds, but these were discontinued in the early 2000s.



##### Treasury Bonds

  * Maturity:
    * Treasury bills: Up to one year
    * Treasury notes: Between 2 and 10 years
    * Treasury bonds: 30 years
  * Federal tax: Yes | State tax: No
  * Risk of default: Very low



##### State and Municipal Bonds

  * Maturity: 1 to 30 years or more
  * Federal tax: No | State tax: Yes (unless in state of issue)
  * Risk of default: Moderate (check credit ratings—AAA to A is safe)



##### Corporation Bonds

  * Maturity: 1 to 10 years or more
  * Federal tax: Yes | State tax: Yes
  * Risk of default: Moderate to high (check credit ratings)



Notes:

  * Higher-yielding “junk bonds” provide a higher return with higher risk of default. Graham advises defensive investors to steer clear of these, since they require detailed study to find bargains.



##### Preferred Stocks

Like corporation bonds, preferred stocks are issued by companies, but they’re a hybrid of common stock and bonds:

  * They pay a fixed dividend rate, but only if the company decides to pay a dividend. If the company can’t or doesn’t pay dividends, the preferred stock doesn’t produce any payments.
  * Because the dividend is fixed, it caps the profits available to the preferred stock holder. Common stock does not have this cap.
  * In a company’s liquidation, preferred stock has more senior rights than common stock, but lower than bonds and creditors.



In Graham’s view, this is the worst of both worlds: limited upside combined with higher risk. Thus, he advises defensive investors to stay away from preferred stock. He does note that other corporations might consider buying preferred stock, since corporations pay a lower tax rate on dividends than on income payments from bonds.

##### Income Bonds

Income bonds are issued by companies. With income bonds, interest isn’t guaranteed to be paid, unless the company has enough earnings to pay it. A company that pays interest on these bonds can deduct it from its taxable income, which makes it an especially cheap form of capital.

Graham notes that these should be used more often by corporations, but still have a historical stigma as being issued by financially weak companies.
