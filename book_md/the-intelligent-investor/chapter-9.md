## Chapter 9: Investment Funds

While much of the book is about choosing individual securities (stocks or bonds), there is a simpler way to invest—through mutual funds. Mutual funds pool together money from many investors, then invest those funds along the fund’s strategy. Therefore, when you buy a share of the fund, you hold a portion of the fund’s underlying securities, including a wide array of stocks and bonds.

At the time of Graham’s writing in the early 1970s, mutual funds were a rising force in finance, with roughly $50 billion under management. Since that time, mutual funds have become a juggernaut, with nearly $20 trillion under management (for context, the total market capitalization of the US stock market is around $40 trillion).

This chapter discusses what expectations to have on fund performance, how to choose funds, and which funds to avoid.

### Which Funds to Choose?

Mutual funds come in many flavors:

  * In scope, with some representing the entire stock market and others focused on particular industries such as Internet companies
  * In location, with some focusing on the United States to those focused internationally
  * In strategy, with some actively trading through proprietary strategies and others simply following an index like the S&P 500
  * In degree of marketing, with some actively advertised and with an enthusiastic sales force, and others quietly operating with little marketing presence
  * In fee amounts, with some charging, say, 3% of your holdings in annual fees, and others charging just 0.1%



With thousands of funds in existence, choosing the right one can be as perplexing as choosing the right stocks.

In summary, Graham urges the following cautions:

  * **When you invest in a fund, expect only returns in line with the overall market.** Over history, the vast majority of funds do _not_ outperform the broader market (especially after deducting fees). If you delude yourself into thinking you can vastly exceed market returns by choosing the right fund, you’ll seek out risky funds and deceptive marketing.
  * **Do not choose a fund simply because it has a recent hot streak.** Most often, funds with outstanding recent performance are using risky strategies that have performed well recently but will falter in the long term. (We’ll cover why 
  * **Be skeptical of funds that charge high fees.** The higher the fees, the more the fund has to outperform the market for you to be in line with the market. For example, if the market returns 5%, then a fund that charges 1% in fees has to return 6% to be in line with the market. 
  * **Be skeptical of funds that have aggressive marketing or salespeople.** Salespeople are part of the fund’s operating costs, and thus you’ll be paying for their salaries and commissions with your fees.



Near the end of his life, Graham noted that **index funds should be the default choice of most everyday investors** (his protege Warren Buffett agrees). It’s the “boring” way to invest—you won’t be able to indulge in hot stock tips and boast about your own landmark stock win—but you _will_ reliably accumulate wealth over time and beat most speculators.

### Funds That Are “Too Good to Be True”

Graham comments on the recurring appearance of “performance funds” in history. Like clockwork, the cycle works like this:

  * Certain funds appear with remarkable short-term performance (say, in the previous 1-3 years). Often they claim to have a special strategy or a young, genius stock picker in its leadership.
  * The funds market themselves aggressively to get more investor money, and they balloon in size. Even reputable investors, such as pension funds and universities, may invest in these funds.
  * In reality, **the performance funds’ gains were achieved with risky strategies that simply got lucky in the recent past**. These strategies are untenable in the long-term, and they quickly underperform the market, sometimes severely (say, by 30 or more percentage points).
  * For some time, people become skeptical of these funds. But then they appear a few decades later, with the same promises.



Each time in history, funds appear with new tactics and marketing messaging:

  * In the 1929 boom and bust, money managers often resorted to outright fraud and misleading reporting. These tactics were outlawed by the SEC.
  * In the 1965-1969 period, new funds appeared with newer gimmicks, such as focusing on small stocks and misleading accounting.
  * In the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, Internet funds appeared promising limitless growth but soon crashed more severely than the rest of the market.



(Zweig notes that major boom and busts seem to occur every 30 years, roughly the length of a human generation. By the end of a generation, people who have suffered major losses in previous crashes become less influential, and so societal memory becomes lost and naive optimism reigns again. If true, the next major boom and bust may occur around 2030.)

While most funds tend not to outperform the market, **there is a small minority that _do_ outperform over the long term**. These tend to be small funds that don’t manage vast amounts of capital, suggesting that more capital causes funds to shift closer to market returns. Furthermore, these highly-performing funds tend to be closed to the public and thus out of your reach.

  * (Shortform note: A notable example is the Medallion fund of Renaissance Technologies, which has produced staggering annualized returns of 66% between 1988 to 2018, before fees, compared to roughly 10% for the S&P 500 in the same period. The Medallion Fund manages just $10 billion and is available only to the firm’s employees and their families.)



### Why Most Funds Don’t Outperform the Market

Why is it so hard for funds to outperform the market? With so many smart, highly compensated people at their helm, surely they must harbor some secret to do better than average?

This presumption comes from our everyday perception of skill. There are certain baseball players who hit more home runs than others; there are certain restaurants that prepare better food than others. Surely there must be better fund managers than others. However, the empirical evidence shows overwhelming evidence against this idea.

In his commentary, Zweig explains multiple reasons that funds that were once-promising tend to be mediocre in the long-term. In short, **larger size causes new problems**.

**Forced deployment of capital:** When a fund takes on more money, it is forced to mobilize this money in investments. (If it simply kept the money as cash, it would produce a lower return as a percentage of its assets under management.) A fund might take in money at the peak of the market, when greedy investors pile in, and thus have to invest precisely when the market is overpriced.

**More difficult investment choices:** Funds managing low amounts of money can take small positions in small companies—say, spending $5 million to buy 1% of a $500 million company. Large funds that have to deploy money have two bad choices: 1) they can either buy more of the company, which might cause them to shift the market and thus lower the profits, or 2) they have to invest in many more companies, which dilutes their focus and requires taking on investments they have lower conviction about.

**Rising fees:** Fees may rise with size because it has to make more trades and its trades become more complex. Buying 0.1% of a company is relatively easy; buying 10% of a company is complex and will shift the price.

**Talent exodus:** If the fund has a truly good investment manager, its success may cause the manager to leave for a competitor or to start her own fund.

**Changing incentives toward stability:** When funds take on more money, they can earn a substantial amount in fees. This shifts the incentive from fund performance to simply having a large amount of assets under management. In turn, this causes fund strategies to become more conservative to avoid an outflow of money. Thus, they may adopt the same strategies as the rest of the market, causing them to match overall market performance.

#### Choosing the Few Outperforming Funds

Thus, Zweig offers the following criteria for choosing the minority of funds that might outperform the market:

  * The managers of the fund should be its largest shareholders. If true, they will be incentivized to achieve fund returns, rather than just collect fees.
  * They should offer low fees. High fees simply make it more difficult for you to beat the market after fees.
  * They use non-consensus strategies. If a fund simply follows the market, it will perform in line with the market.
  * They tend to close their funds to new investors. This means they’re optimizing for fund performance, not for fund size. While you might not be able to make it into already-closed funds, you might identify fund managers with a history of closing funds to new investors and invest in their new funds.
  * They don’t advertise or market themselves.



However, selecting funds that outperform is as difficult as selecting individual stocks that outperform. If you’re a defensive investor, by and large you should resign yourself to choosing funds that represent the entire market.
