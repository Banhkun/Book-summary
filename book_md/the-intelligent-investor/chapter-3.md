## Chapter 3: Is It a Good Time to Buy Stocks?

Is it a good time to buy stocks? This is a perennially difficult question to answer. Investment professionals, whose job is to figure this out, constantly get it wrong.

Public sentiment is even less reliable—when a large crash occurs, most people, having incurred large losses, declare stocks too risky; in reality, this is the time of greatest opportunity to buy. Conversely, when people expect growth to continue perpetually, they’re willing to buy at any price; this ebullience is inviting a steep crash to more reasonable levels.

In each edition of _The Intelligent Investor_ , revised roughly every 5 years from 1949 to 1973, Graham gave an assessment of whether stocks were undervalued or overvalued, and thus whether investors should choose to invest or sit on the sidelines. In this chapter, he reflects on those predictions and the general method of evaluating the stock market. (Shortform note: For today’s readers, this is of course less relevant for its actual predictions and more to illustrate Graham’s thinking.)

### Stock Market History

In hindsight, over the past 75 years, stocks have trended consistently upwards. Here’s a chart showing the S&P 500 on a log scale:

![intelligent-investor-chart-0.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-0.png)

(Shortform note: Long-term stock charts are often shown in log scale since they better reflect percentage changes and compounded growth, as opposed to changes in absolute values.)

Over the long term, stocks have tended to rise—in the history of the S&P 500, the annual return is roughly 10%, without adjusting for inflation. Graham suggests this consistent long-term performance supports his advice that all portfolios should have a portion in stocks.

However, he **heavily cautions against simplistically extrapolating from the past, and against the delusion that stocks will always increase** and so are worth investing in at any time, at any price. These conditions tend to breed wanton overpricing, which tends to invite a steep correction downward.

While the general trend is up and to the right, in the short-term, stocks fluctuate. Look more closely at the chart, and you’ll see more detail:

  * A major collapse in 1929, followed by fluctuations up until 1950. The S&P 500 would not reach the heights of 1929 until 25 years later.
  * A strong growth period from 1950 to 1965.
  * A period of relative flatness from 1965 to 1975.
  * Generally strong growth from 1975 to the 2000 dotcom crash, with periodic recessions in between.



As we think about investments today, we don’t have the benefit of future information, and so it becomes important to assess whether the stock market is expensive or cheap.

#### Shortform Exclusive: Inflation-Adjusted Returns

The book doesn’t address inflation in this chapter, but the inflation-adjusted stock returns have a significantly different shape:

![intelligent-investor-chart-1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-1.png)

Notably, during the highly inflationary 1970s and early 1980s, the stock market halved in real value, even though the absolute price stayed relatively flat. After adjusting for inflation, the annual return of the S&P 500 decreases from 10% to 7%.

### Metrics for Evaluating the Stock Market

Of course, when investing today, you don’t have a stock chart for the future. You’ll need to assess the market to decide whether it’s cheap or expensive. Graham uses two major indicators of stocks in this discussion:

**1) Price to Earnings ratio (P/E ratio)**

This is the ratio of the stock price to the company’s earnings. If a company has earnings per share of $1, and its stock is selling at $10 per share, the P/E ratio is 10.

In general, a P/E ratio of 10 or below is low, and the stock is considered cheap. A P/E ratio of 20 or above is high (or the stock is expensive). (Shortform note: However, as discussed later, the P/E ratio is not by itself a good indicator of whether to buy a stock, since a failing company with poor future prospects will also have a low P/E ratio.)

**2) Dividend yield, relative to bond yield**

A stock’s dividend yield is the amount paid in annual dividends per share of stock, divided by its stock price. If a company pays $1 in dividends per share, and the stock price is $20, the dividend yield is 5%.

The bond yield is the return on a bond. Simplistically, if a bond costs $1,000 and pays $100 per year, the yield is 10%.

Comparing the stock’s dividend yield to the bond yield suggests whether stocks are likely to outperform bonds in the short-term, or vice versa. If the bond yield is notably higher than the stock’s dividend yield, it might indicate that stocks are overpriced.

Both of these indicators can be calculated for individual stocks, as well as for a collection of stocks or the stock market as a whole.

### Graham’s Predictions

In each edition of _The Intelligent Investor_ , Graham assessed then-current market conditions and declared whether the market was cheap or expensive. We’ll discuss his reasoning and how his predictions matched reality. (Shortform note: We’ve included stock charts of the Dow Jones Industrial Average up to each prediction time, to better show what was available to Graham at each point in writing.)

#### 1948

![intelligent-investor-chart-2.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-2.png)

**Prediction:** Stocks are not at too high a level.

  * The ratio of stock price to the last 3 years of earnings is at 9.2x. 
  * The yield of stock dividend yield to bond yield is 2.1x.



**Reality:** From 1949 to 1953, the Dow gained 50%.

#### 1953

![intelligent-investor-chart-3.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-3.png)

**Prediction:** Stock prices are favorable, but prices have grown for longer than in most previous bull markets, and the price is historically high. Be cautious.

  * P/E ratio is 10.2x. 
  * Dividend yield to bond yield is 1.8x.



**Reality:** The stock market grew 100% in the following five years. Graham admits they were too conservative in this edition.

#### 1959

![intelligent-investor-chart-4.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-4.png)

**Prediction:** The market is at an all-time high, and investors’ enthusiasm and momentum is likely to carry it to even greater heights. We’re in dangerous territory. Don’t delude yourself into thinking there will never be a downturn, and buying stocks is always profitable.

  * P/E ratio is 17.6x
  * Dividend yield to bond yield is 0.8x.



**Reality:** These were mixed results. The market grew to 1961, then fell rapidly in 1962, but quickly recovered into 1963 and grew from then on.

#### 1964

![intelligent-investor-chart-5.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-5.png)

**Prediction:** Be cautious. It appears the market is no longer held to traditional methods of valuation. We can’t rule out either extreme, that prices will continue growing by 50% or will suddenly collapse by 50%. If in doubt, reduce stocks to 50% of your portfolio.

  * P/E ratio is 20.7x.
  * Dividend yield to bond yield is 0.7x



**Reality:** The market fell to a notably low in 1970, then spent 1972 relatively close to 1965 levels. Graham feels this was appropriately cautious.

#### 1971

![intelligent-investor-chart-6.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-6.png)

**Prediction:** Stocks are still overvalued. There will likely be a major setback in stock value, or a brief bull market followed by an even larger setback.

  * P/E ratio is 18.1x. This is lower than the recent high of 20.7x in 1963. 
  * However, the dividend yield to bond yield ratio is a dismal 0.41x, down from 2.1x in 1948. The situation has inverted, so that bonds are a much better investment than stocks.



**Reality:** The stock market suffered a major drop in 1973-1974, down 37% from the peak. Here’s a chart showing what happened after his last assessment:

![intelligent-investor-chart-7.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/intelligent-investor-chart-7.png)

#### Takeaways

Now that we’ve covered multiple historical data points, what’s important to take away from this?

**1) Even experts like Graham have trouble picturing exactly what will happen in the future.** At times Graham was too conservative in estimating how strongly stocks would grow; at others, he predicted a major setback that didn’t occur for quite some time. Beware of relying on so-called experts; make up your own mind through independent thinking.

**2) Beware of relying too strongly on extrapolating from the past.** Graham himself cautioned in 1953 that the market was at a historical high. The market grew by 100% in the following five years.

In commentary, Zweig notes that during the dotcom bubble, a slew of investment managers claimed this was an unprecedented new era of limitless growth, and they piled on each other with higher and higher price targets for the stock market. The stock market eventually fell over 30%, with some stocks losing over 99% of its value.

**3) Practice contrarian thinking.** If someone says stocks will always go up, ask, “why? If everyone buys stock according to this belief, then won’t stock prices be unreasonably high? And if companies can only earn finite amounts of profit, won’t the stock price at some point exceed a reasonable value for the company?”

In fact, Zweig suggests, the more enthusiastic investors are, the more likely a setback is to occur. And the more that stocks fall out of favor after a large shock, the more likely it’s a buying opportunity.
