## Chapter 1: What Is Investment?

Let’s begin by defining who investors are, in the context of this book.

### Investors vs. Speculators

What are investors? The term is thrown about loosely to describe anyone who buys or sells securities in the market. But since many people trade irresponsibly and by their emotions, describing them as “investors” seems too generous. For instance, if the stock market suffers a major drop, the media will report, “investors became bearish and pulled out of the market.” Yet these moments are precisely when sound investors would be buying stocks on the cheap.

Likewise, people describe “speculation” loosely. Yet after a stock market crash, when sentiment is poor and all stocks are considered too risky, they’re often the most attractive for investment.

Offering a more robust definition, Graham defines **investment as an operation that, through extensive analysis, provides an adequate return and safety of principal**. **Everything that doesn’t fit this definition is speculation**.

Investors and speculators therefore behave very differently.

**Speculators** trade on market movements of stock price They buy stocks as they move up, hoping to sell to someone who will pay more for it. When the price goes down, they sell to capture their gains or cap their losses. In all this, they ignore the fundamental value of the stock. (Shortform note: This style of trading is common in day trading, chart reading, and “technical analysis.”)

**Investors** look at the fundamental value of the stock, independent of the stock price. In fact, Graham suggests that investors should be comfortable buying stock even if they could receive zero future information about its daily stock price. Investors also trade oppositely to speculators—they buy when the market is down, since stocks are cheap. Investors dread bull markets since it makes everything overpriced.

**Speculators** are swayed by popular opinion. They hear optimistic estimates from analysts and buy stock, without questioning the underlying value. They buy when everyone else is buying, and sell when everyone else is selling.

**Investors** are independent thinkers. They use a dependable system for decision-making.

**Speculators** have erratic mood swings, and are impatient. Their feelings govern their behavior, and they don’t act by any methodical, reliable system.

**Investors** control their psychology through ups and downs. They rely on their dependable framework for decision-making and don’t act impulsively.

#### Speculation Disguised as Investment

In addition to trading based on market movements, Graham **cautions against these common methods of speculation that masquerade as investment** :

  * Trading based on short-term earnings reports: estimating future earnings accurately is already difficult in itself. But studying earnings is so common and competitive, with legions of analysts on Wall Street, that even if you get it right, the stock price probably already reflects those earnings.
  * Trading based on long-term growth prospects: here you may have a more optimistic view of certain companies than the overall market. But Graham is once again skeptical that an individual investor has the insight and vision needed to _consistently_ outperform the market on these predictions.



In his commentary, Zweig shares examples of popular formulas that failed to perform:

  * The “January effect”: A strategy published in the 1980s that claimed that small stocks dip at the end of the year and rise at the beginning of the year. The explanation is that investors sell their worst stocks by the end of the year to reduce taxes; investment firms also sell falling stocks by year-end to make their annual performance look better. The January effect looked strong up until the 1980s, after which it began disappearing.
  * In 1996, a money manager named James O’Shaughnessy published a simple strategy in his book _What Works on Wall Street_ : Buy 50 stocks with the highest one-year returns, 5 years of rising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5x revenues. He created funds based around this strategy, but they underperformed the S&P 500 through 2000, and some of those funds promptly shut down.
  * The Motley Fool’s “Foolish Four”: Take the five stocks in the Dow Jones with the lowest price and highest dividend yields; discard the one with the lowest price; invest 40% in the stock with the second-lowest price, and put 20% in the other three. Repeat each year. When published, the technique claimed to produce a 10.1% annual return above market in a back-test over 25 years. But when applied going forward, this failed to perform any better than random stock picking.



The takeaways:

  * **Strategies that seem to work when back-tested against historical data may be illusory.** If you look for enough patterns, you will find some that seem to work, by mere chance, but they will fail to deliver consistent performance over time.
  * Even if the strategy really _does_ work, if it becomes popular, the competitive market will adopt the strategy, thus erasing its possibility for profit. We’ll discuss this more in the last section of the chapter.
  * Any simplistic strategy that mechanically picks stocks, without thorough consideration of the company’s underlying value, does not qualify as investment under Graham’s definition.



Speculation isn’t immoral or necessarily bad for society. Speculation based on the promise of future growth fuels innovation—new upstarts like Google or Amazon needed optimistic speculators to provide capital. But for most people, speculation is a poor way to attain wealth.

#### Don’t Believe the Active Trading Hype

You’ve likely seen commercials for stock brokerages that let you trade more conveniently and with lower fees than ever before. **Beware: brokerages make money when you _trade_ , and not when you _make money_.** Therefore, brokerages hype up speculation for common investors in their marketing, promising riches at unprecedented speed.

(Shortform note: With the advent of mobile apps for trading and zero-commission trading, the barrier to trading is lower than ever. How do brokerages with zero commissions make money through trading? By selling order flow to market makers, who profit from inexperienced investors.)

As a result of these tools, trading activity has increased dramatically, as well as impatience—in 1973, a shareholder kept a stock for 5 years before selling it; by 2002, that shrunk over 80%, to 11 months. During frenzied periods, like the dotcom bubble in 1999, a share might be held an average of _a few days_.

Beyond just making poor investment decisions, active trading has other punishing drawbacks:

  * A frenetic speculator who is desperate to buy or sell a stock may accept unfavorable prices for the sake of speed. For instance, someone who wants to trade 1,000 shares of a stock and misprices by 20 cents per share gives up $200.
  * If you hold a stock for less than a year, any gains on that stock are taxed at ordinary income rates, rather than the lower long-term capital gains rate.
  * (Shortform note: Recent research suggests that individual active traders even tend to earn below-market returns _before_ accounting for fees—individual investors simply trade stocks poorly.)



Thus, accounting for small losses and taxes, **an active trader might need to gain at least 5% just to _break even_**.

A 2000 study by finance professors found that **the most active traders**(who turned over more than 20% of their holdings each month)**underperformed the market by 6.4% per year, while the least active traders**(trading less than 0.2% of holdings each month) **matched the market**.

The message is clear: “active trading is hazardous to your wealth.”

#### Shortform Exclusive: Why Do Individual Investors Do Worse?

There is ample evidence that individual investors do worse than the market. Why is this? Here are reasons borne out by research:

  * **Overconfidence:** In general throughout much of life, people are overconfident about how much they know and how accurate they are. People who rate themselves as smarter than average trade more actively. Men tend to be more overconfident than women, and they trade more and perform worse than women do.
  * **Sensation seeking:** Trading stocks is entertaining and provides emotional, visceral engagement the same way gambling does. In this way, trading can be seen to compete with other entertaining activities; when alternatives such as legal gambling and lotteries are introduced, active trading drops.
  * **Familiarity:** Traders tend to over-invest in companies close to where they live or in the industry or company in which they’re employed. This leads to under-diversification and can have grave consequences when the employer goes bankrupt, as in Enron and Kmart.
  * **Disposition effect:** Individual traders strongly prefer to sell stocks that have risen in value, and hold stocks that have fallen in value. In other words, they sell winners and hold losers. This is largely the opposite of what is prudent—the stocks that rise tend to rise even further, and likewise for falling stocks. (In turn, the reason traders do this can do with loss aversion, narrow accounting, and self-control issues. For more on these topics, see our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)



If investors knew this, they would rationally invest in an index fund and stop trading. Still, many are attracted by the siren song and continue suffering poor returns.

#### Warnings for Speculators

At its most irresponsible, speculation should be seen as gambling. It can be entertaining and instructional, but it should never be confused for investing. Here are warnings for speculators:

  * **Don’t confuse your actions as investing when you’re really speculating.** If your actions don’t require extensive analysis, don’t provide an adequate return over time, or don’t provide safety of principal, you’re speculating.
  * **Don’t be deluded by a speculative method that works in the short term.** Good investing frameworks sustain over the long term. Day trading, chart analysis, and stock-picking systems may work for a short period, but they fail in the long run.
  * **Don’t speculate without knowledge or skill.** Be humble about understanding your experience and track record. Study the results of other people with similar experience and skill.
  * **Don’t speculate with more money than you can afford to completely lose.** If you really want to speculate, set aside some money for a speculation account (say, a max of 10% of your assets), and never add money to it.



### Defensive vs. Aggressive Investors

Having distinguished investors from speculators, Graham then defines two different types of intelligent investors: defensive investors and aggressive (or enterprising) investors.

**Defensive investors** want to avoid spending too much time on investing. They like simplicity and don’t love thinking about investments or money. Their goal is to perform on average in line with the market, and to avoid serious mistakes.

**Aggressive investors** are willing to devote serious time and energy to research stocks and select good ones. They enjoy thinking about money and see smart investing as a competitive game they want to win. Their goal is to achieve better returns than the passive investor (Graham says an extra 5% per year, before taxes, is necessary to justify all the effort.)

Both approaches can be intelligent and can perform well. The key is choosing the right type of investment for your temperament and goals, to stick with it over your entire investment timeline, and to keep your emotions well under control.

In later chapters, we’ll dive much deeper into both defensive and aggressive investment strategies.
