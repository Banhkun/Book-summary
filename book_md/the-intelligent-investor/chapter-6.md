## Chapter 6: The Aggressive Investor, Generally

In contrast to defensive investors, who want to minimize time and get acceptable results, aggressive investors want to devote serious time to investment research to achieve better returns than average.

When describing these investors as “aggressive,” Graham is not urging any carelessness or impulsiveness, despite general connotations of the term “aggressive.” In stark contrast, **aggressive investors should methodically value potential investments, be patient for bargains, and maintain level-headedness when the market is reactive in either direction**.

(Shortform note: Graham uses the terms “enterprising investor” and “aggressive investor” interchangeably—we use “aggressive” since it’s the more well-known of the two terms.)

### Expectations for the Aggressive Investor

#### Effort Required of the Aggressive Investor

**To be successful as an aggressive investor, you must devote your full effort and attention to the task.** You should view your investing as equivalent to operating a full business—just as you can’t be half a business operator, you can’t be half an aggressive investor and half a passive investor.

Since most people can’t put in this effort, they should become defensive investors instead.

#### Expected Gains of the Aggressive Investor

How much in gains should a successful aggressive investor expect? The author says that an **additional 5% per year, before taxes, is necessary to be worth the effort** of all the research and work. (Shortform note: Graham notes repeatedly that good investors should not aim for stratospheric results, but rather modest and consistent returns over the long term. Due to compounding returns, an extra 5% a year makes a huge difference over time.)

#### A Warning from Graham

(Shortform note: This section originally came from Chapter 15.)

The task of beating the market is a difficult one, and Graham issues a caution—the evidence strongly suggests that **most professional money managers do _not_ beat the overall market** in the long term, after deducting fees. These funds employ highly intelligent and motivated people who dedicate their entire working days to researching and choosing individual securities. Yet even _they_ can’t outperform the S&P 500.

Why is it so difficult to beat the market? Graham offers two possible reasons:

**Reason 1: The current stock price already has all existing information “priced in,” and from this point stock market movements are essentially unpredictable.**

There are countless opportunistic investors and investment firms that behave like an aggressive investor—they study a company’s historical performance and future prospects, try to identify bargains and overpriced stocks, and invest accordingly. When the market is made up of many thousands of such people, the market price for a security already reflects the consensus opinion of the company’s value.

From this point on, any developments that affect stock price are unpredictable. When you try to predict the unpredictable, your chances of succeeding in the long term are slim.

**Reason 2: Most investors have a bad strategy. If you adopt a non-consensus strategy, you might be able to beat them.**

Most money managers might have a consistent problem in how they make investments. For instance, they might believe that a promising company’s stock is worth buying, no matter how high the price. They might also believe that certain industries and companies are toxic wastelands to be avoided, no matter how low the price.

In practice, no company’s stock price rises perpetually, and many companies that have fallen into temporary misfortune recover company performance and stock price.

If most traders in the market believe such ideas, then _there_ can exist opportunities that are ignored by the rest of the market. Graham’s personal record as a consistently successful investor, as well as the records of his students such as Warren Buffett, suggests that such opportunities do exist.

### How Should Aggressive Investors Invest, Generally?

To beat the overall market, the aggressive investor needs to practice a disciplined approach that is **unpopular** in the larger market.

Why unpopular? **Investing is so competitive that any straightforward strategy that actually works consistently will quickly be adopted by the rest of the market, and the profits will evaporate**. Graham cites an example from 1949, where buying the Dow Jones index below its intrinsic value and selling it above intrinsic value provided consistent returns over much of the past century. After 1949, this no longer worked—either because people adopted the strategy and thus bid up stock prices past the point where the strategy worked; or the strategy was illusory to begin with.

After all these warnings, what strategy can be used, then? In essence, **Graham’s strategy is to use a framework to value companies reliably, then identify companies that are priced lower than their fair value.** In other words, buy a company when it’s priced more cheaply than it’s worth. That’s what most of the remainder of the book is about.

Why does this strategy not lose its advantage over time, like other strategies? Graham suggests a few reasons:

  * Speculators trade so erratically that, at any time, there will always be stocks that are overvalued and undervalued. 
  * Companies and entire industries may be undervalued simply because they fall out of fashion.
  * Despite the claims of the efficient market hypothesis, there will remain pricing inefficiencies in the market, particularly because market movements are made of people following their own flawed psychology and of such people mimicking each other.



(Shortform note: The implication is that the patient, methodical, emotionally composed method suggested by Graham will continue to be unpopular. Most speculators are swayed by popular opinion, have mood swings, look for simple solutions, and are impatient for riches. Few will have calm control over their psychology and take on the burdensome task of thorough research, and so few will enjoy the fruits of the strategy.)

Enthusiasm is great for endeavors outside of investing. In investing, it will ruin you. Here you need self-control. You cannot let other people’s opinions and emotions sway your own.
