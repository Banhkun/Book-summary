## 1-Page Summary

Investing well over the long term does not require incredible intelligence or deep insight. Instead, it requires two things:

  * A rational framework for making decisions
  * Preventing your emotions, and other people’s emotions, from overriding your framework



With these two elements, and without extensive trading experience, you can do better than more financially-educated people who lack patience, discipline, and emotional control.

**Investing successfully in stocks requires keeping a few key principles in mind:**

  * A stock is not just a mere object you trade. It is a piece of ownership in a business. Therefore, the stock has a fundamental value that is often not the share price. Understand the business, and you understand the fundamental value.
  * Pay attention to the price at which you buy stock. The more you pay for a stock, the lower your return will be. Buying stock carelessly, with the expectation that you can buy anytime at any price and still profit, is a mistake. As Graham says, “buy your stocks like you buy your groceries, not like you buy your perfume.”
  * The market has constant mood swings. At times, it is over-optimistic, which makes stocks too expensive. At other times, it is pessimistic, which makes stocks cheap. The key is to buy from pessimists and sell to optimists.
  * Keep a “margin of safety”—don’t get carried away and overpay for a stock, or a downturn can cause irrevocable losses.



This book covers two major types of intelligent investors—defensive investors and aggressive investors—and advises how each should invest. It also covers general investment principles and market behavior, popularizing Graham’s famous concepts of Mr. Market and Margin of Safety.

Let’s begin by discussing what investment is.

### Investors vs. Speculators

What are investors? The term is thrown about loosely to describe anyone who buys or sells securities in the market. But since many people trade irresponsibly and by their emotions, describing them as “investors” seems too generous. For instance, if the stock market suffers a major drop, the media will report, “investors became bearish and pulled out of the market.” Yet these moments are precisely when sound investors would be buying stocks on the cheap.

Offering a more robust definition, Graham defines **investment as an operation that, through extensive analysis, provides an adequate return and safety of principal**. **Everything that doesn’t fit this definition is speculation.**

Investors and speculators therefore behave very differently.

**Speculators** trade on market movements of stock price They buy stocks as they move up, hoping to sell to someone who will pay more for it. When the price goes down, they sell to capture their gains or cap their losses. In all this, they ignore the fundamental value of what the company is worth.

**Investors** look at the fundamental value of the stock, independent of the stock price. In fact, Graham suggests that investors should be comfortable buying stock even if they could receive zero future information about its daily stock price. Investors also trade oppositely to speculators—they buy when the market is down, since stocks are cheap. Investors dread bull markets since it makes everything overpriced.

**Speculators** are swayed by popular opinion. They hear optimistic estimates from analysts and buy stock, without questioning the underlying value. They buy when everyone else is buying, and sell when everyone else is selling.

**Investors** are independent thinkers. They use a dependable system for decision-making.

#### Don’t Believe the Active Trading Hype

You’ve likely seen commercials for stock brokerages that let you trade more conveniently and with lower fees than ever before. **Beware: brokerages make money when you _trade_ , and not when you _make money_.** Therefore, brokerages hype up speculation for common investors in their marketing, promising riches at unprecedented speed.

In reality, active trading worsens your performance. A 2000 study by finance professors found that **the most active traders**(who turned over more than 20% of their holdings each month)**underperformed the market by 6.4% per year, while the least active traders**(trading less than 0.2% of holdings each month) **matched the market**.

### Defensive vs. Aggressive Investors

Having distinguished investors from speculators, Graham defines two different types of intelligent investors: defensive investors and aggressive (or enterprising) investors.

**Defensive investors** want to avoid spending too much time on investing. They like simplicity and don’t love thinking about investments or money. Their goal is to perform on average, in line with the market, and to avoid serious mistakes.

**Aggressive investors** are willing to devote serious time and energy to research stocks and select good ones. They enjoy thinking about money and see smart investing as a competitive game they want to win. Their goal is to achieve better returns than the passive investor (Graham says an extra 5% per year, before taxes, is necessary to justify all the effort.)

Both approaches can be intelligent and can perform well. The key is choosing the right type of investment for your temperament and goals, to stick with it over your entire investment timeline, and to keep your emotions well under control.

### The Defensive Investor

#### How Should Defensive Investors Invest?

Graham’s recommendation is to split investments between stocks and bonds. **The default split is 50-50 between stocks and bonds**. This allows you to participate in both the gains of stocks as well as the relative safety of bonds.

At times, you can shift your balance in favor of stocks or bonds. If you feel stocks are overpriced and due for a downturn, you can shift your investment to 25% in stocks and 75% in bonds. Likewise, after a steep market downturn or when stocks are cheap, you might shift to 75% in stocks and 25% in bonds. But Graham advises no more than a 75-25 imbalance.

Why not 100% into either bonds or stocks?

  * Stocks on average rise faster than inflation, whereas bonds might not, so holding stocks better protects against inflation. 
  * However, stocks don’t always outperform bonds at all times. At the time of Graham’s last revision in 1973, bonds were outperforming stocks. Keeping a balance helps you weather a variety of economic conditions. 
  * Stocks fluctuate much more than bonds do, and the wild oscillations of a 100% stock portfolio will test your psychology. 



#### Dollar-Cost Averaging

If you have a lump sum of money, how would you invest it? Some investors, tempted to get higher than market returns, might choose to “time the market,” waiting until a market dip to invest. The very likely risk is that the investor turns out to be entirely wrong, either losing out on gains as the market rises, or mistiming the bottom.

In contrast, Graham recommends **dollar-cost averaging** —split up the lump sum into multiple investments of equal amounts, distributed over a longer period of time (such as every month or quarter). This is a straightforward strategy that requires minimum thinking and emotional investment.

Dollar-cost averaging carries psychological benefits: **you remain emotionally detached from the swings of the market**. Regardless of whether prices are up or down, you invest the same amount.

It also helps you **avoid the delusion that you can predict the market**. Zweig notes that your response to any question about the market should be “I don’t know and I don’t care.”

#### Low-Cost Index Funds are the Default Option

In the book, Graham spends a few chapters giving advice on choosing specific individual bonds and stocks because, in the mid-20th century, those were the only options available to investors.

Since then, a large number of low-cost index funds have become popular (such as those by Vanguard). These funds hold a wide basket of assets, such as stocks and bonds, thus providing diversification with minimal effort. Near the end of his life, Graham noted that **index funds should be the default choice of most everyday investors** , rather than picking individual stocks (his protege Warren Buffett agrees).

#### Choosing Individual Stocks

If you do want to choose your own stocks, **as a defensive investor you should buy only stocks of high-quality companies at reasonable prices**. Use these **seven criteria** to filter the options:

  1. **Size:** More than $100 million in revenue
     * Small companies face more volatility and may be unable to survive bad events.
     * Graham’s criterion was set in 1970, and $100 million in revenue may be too small today. Nowadays, sufficient size might mean a market value of at least $2 billion.
  2. **Strong financials:** Assets at least double liabilities, and working capital more than long-term debt
  3. **Dividends:** Paid continuously over the last 20 years, without interruption
  4. **Earnings:** Positive in each of the past 10 years; no unprofitable years
  5. **Earnings growth:** At least 33% total growth in per-share earnings in the past 10 years (a bit less than 3% annually)
     * A company that is shrinking over time will not be a good long-term investment.
     * Use 3-year average earnings at both the beginning and end of the 10-year period.
  6. **Price-to-earnings ratio:** No more than 15 times the average past 3-year earnings
     * Beware of analysts who calculate a “forward P/E ratio” using not historical earnings but “next-year’s earnings.” Predictions are notoriously unreliable, and often the forward P/E ratio is used merely to justify an overpriced stock.
  7. **Price-to-book value ratio:** No more than 150% of book value (also known as net asset value; calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets)
     * In his commentary, Zweig notes that many companies today have a greater amount of value in intangible assets such as brand value and intellectual property, which don’t show up in book value. Thus, more companies are priced at higher price-to-book ratios.



These seven criteria are stringent and often cut away the majority of stocks. This is deliberate—at any time, most stocks are likely not good choices for the defensive investor.

### The Aggressive Investor

In contrast to defensive investors, who want to minimize time and get acceptable results, aggressive investors want to devote serious time to investment research to achieve better returns than average.

When describing these investors as “aggressive,” Graham is not urging any carelessness or impulsiveness, despite general connotations of the term “aggressive.” In stark contrast, **aggressive investors should methodically value potential investments, be patient for bargains, and maintain level-headedness when the market is reactive in either direction**.

#### Expectations for the Aggressive Investor

How much in gains should a successful aggressive investor expect? An **additional 5% per year, before taxes, is necessary to be worth the effort** of all the research and work. (Graham notes repeatedly that good investors should not aim for stratospheric results, but rather modest and consistent returns over the long term.)

Beating the market is difficult, and Graham cautions—**most professional money managers do _not_ beat the overall market** in the long term, after deducting fees. These funds employ highly intelligent and motivated people who dedicate their entire working days to researching and choosing individual securities. If _they_ can’t outperform the S&P 500, do you think you realistically can?

#### Find Bargain Stocks

**Graham’s core strategy is to find companies that are priced lower than their fair value.** In other words, try to buy a dollar for far less than a dollar.

Why would this continue to work, despite the claims of the efficient market hypothesis? Because of human psychology. Markets are made up of people who are impulsive and follow each other. This can cause major fluctuations in price (both up and down) that are irrational relative to the stock’s underlying value.

When a company has fallen _out_ of favor, its price will drop below what the fundamentals of the company would warrant. **The stock has now become a bargain** —if you buy them, they may later recover their prices and be good investments. Graham defines a bargain as **a stock with a price that is below two-thirds of its value**.

Bargains may occur when a large company endures a temporary setback, or when an entire industry falls out of favor. The market may overreact, moving certain stock prices into bargain territory.

#### Aggressive Investor Criteria

Like the defensive investor, start with statistical criteria for filtering all the stocks available. However, you can relax the criteria to include more companies:

  1. **Size:** No requirement for size. You can limit your risk with small companies by carefully identifying good companies and diversifying.
  2. **Financials:** Assets at least 1.5 times liabilities, and debt less than 110% of net current assets
  3. **Dividends:** Some dividends paid recently
  4. **Earnings:** Last 12 months’ earnings is positive
  5. **Earnings growth:** Last 12 months earnings’ more than earnings from 4 years ago.
  6. **Price-to-earnings ratio:** No more than 9 times earnings from the last 12 months
  7. **Price-to-book value ratio:** No more than 120% of book value.



To **decide whether a stock is a good investment, you must do your own reasoned analysis**. There is no such thing as good stocks and bad stocks—only cheap stocks and overpriced stocks.

  * A strong company is not a good investment if its stock is overpriced.
  * A stock at a low price is not a good investment if the company has poor future prospects.
  * A stock with tremendous hype around growth, and high prices to match, is likely too speculative for intelligent investors.
  * Yet a once-hyped stock that falls dramatically in value can then turn into a bargain stock worth buying.



### Market Fluctuations and Mr. Market

When asked to predict what the market would do, the financier J.P. Morgan said, “it will fluctuate.”

You can be sure that the market will fluctuate. In all likelihood, you will not be able to _predict_ when and how the market fluctuates. **You _can_ , however, respond to fluctuations in two critical ways:**

  1. Steel yourself mentally for the fluctuations. Prepare for the idea that your portfolio may decline by 30% from its high point, and don’t tie your emotions to these fluctuations.
  2. Watch patiently and prepare to spot opportunities when they do appear. When the market sours on a stock, it can be an overreaction and present a bargain buying opportunity.



#### Mr. Market

You are not obligated to trade and sell with the market. You should use market pricing merely as an indicator for whether a stock is over- or under-priced, taking advantage of opportunities in your favor.

This sounds like common sense, yet **countless traders behave as the market demands they do**. They buy when stocks are going up and sell when they have gone down.

To illustrate how silly this is, Graham introduces his famous idea of Mr. Market. Say you own a piece of a business worth $1,000. Imagine a fellow named Mr. Market who is a manic-depressive sort of person and visits you once a day, asking to buy and sell your interest.

  * When the market is up, he asks to sell another piece to you at exorbitant prices: $1,500, $2,000. 
  * When the market is down, he comes by asking to buy your stake for a steeply discounted $600.



Should you go along with this odd person, feeling exactly what he feels at every moment and doing what he demands?

Of course not. You know the piece of business is worth $1,000. You’d maintain your own rationality and politely ask this oddly behaving person to leave your house.

Mr. Market represents the whims and folly of other traders. His behavior should not influence yours. **If you know the fundamental value of a business, why should the mistakes of _other_ people influence _your_ behavior? **Behaving this way is like having your emotions and behavior dictated by other people.

You have no obligation to act according to market fluctuations. **You should deliberately _choose_ to transact only when it is in your favor.** You shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely, nor should you blindly follow whatever he tells you, but rather use his prices only when it is to your advantage. You are _not_ obligated to trade with him.

### Margin of Safety

In seeking good investments, Graham always made sure to build in enough margin of safety. In simple terms, **margin of safety is a measure of how much can go wrong before an investment goes bad**. If you make investments with a larger margin of safety, you have a greater likelihood of prevailing in the end.

Warren Buffett offers an analogy: If you’re designing a bridge that tends to support 10,000 pounds in everyday traffic, you should design it to carry 30,000 pounds.

Many of Graham’s investment criteria we’ve covered have margin of safety built into them:

  * **Interest coverage ratio:** If a company’s earnings covers 5 times its interest expenses, then even if it suffers a sudden 20% drop in earnings, it has more than enough earnings remaining to continue paying interest and thus avoiding defaulting on debt. In contrast, a company that can only cover 1 times its interest expense is in danger of defaulting with just small setbacks to earnings.
  * **Price to book value:** If you buy stock in a company when its market value is two-thirds of book value, the company’s book value can shrink by one-third before your investment becomes negative (relative to book value).
  * **Asset to liabilities ratio:** If a company has assets at multiple times its liabilities, it can lose significant value before its bondholders suffer a loss.



**A larger margin of safety prevents you from needing to be clairvoyant or unusually clever**. You may not be able to predict market downturns or company setbacks, but with a large margin of safety, that doesn’t matter—your investment can still be successful.

As Warren Buffett has said about value investing, “if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me.”
