## Chapter 10: Financial Advisors

If you’re not trained in treating medical conditions, you consult a doctor for medical advice. Likewise, if you’re not trained in finance, it’s natural to feel like you need advice from financial experts. Choosing the right advisors is important for you to keep your money.

Finance offers a wide range of advisors, including banks, financial information providers, brokerages, and investment banks. We’ll cover generalities of how to distinguish good advisors from bad ones and how each specific advisor works.

### General Advice on Finding Advisors

**Now that you know how much effort it takes to earn above-average returns, and how few people successfully do it, you should be skeptical of anyone who promises to do this for you.** When finding financial advisors, have grounded expectations for what they should do for you.

  * If you owned a business, you could find consultants for specific aspects of the business (such as marketing or legal compliance), but you should not expect to find a consultant to do the main work of building a profitable business. That is the business owner’s concern and responsibility.
  * Likewise, you should not hire an advisor with the expectation that she can make you outlandish amounts of money without your involvement. 



**What distinguishes good advisors from bad advisors?**

  * Good financial advisors are scrupulous and don’t overpromise. When you communicate your goals and the type of help you’re looking for, they customize what they do for you. Your interests are aligned—they see your financial success as their success.
  * Bad financial advisors seek to pad their own pockets, regardless of what happens to you. They prey on your greed and impulsiveness and will try to override your best judgment. Their incentives may overlap minorly with yours or even be in direct opposition.



Do you actually _need_ an advisor? Graham doesn’t advise much on this, but Zweig suggests that you should seek an advisor in these cases:

  * If you habitually underperform the market
  * If your personal finance budget is out of control—you can’t pay your bills, and you don’t save any money
  * If you experience any major changes or crises, such as leaving steady employment or being unable to plan for college tuition or retirement



Defensive and aggressive investors should look for different things from investors.

  * Defensive investors should find advisors who will help them achieve average market returns—no better, and no worse. Typically, **advisors help defensive investors by protecting them against themselves** and the worst of their own psychology.
  * Aggressive investors should find advisors who will be useful sounding boards for their investment ideas. Aggressive investors should examine the advice they receive and form their own conclusions, rather than simply taking opinions on faith.



Beware of these common pitfalls when seeking advisors:

  * Don’t rely on advisors to make above-average returns _for_ you without your involvement. Finding advisors who can do this is as difficult as finding individual stocks that will outperform. Before hiring someone who can achieve this, you should be able to independently assess the validity of their recommendations, which means you have already become an aggressive investor.
  * Don’t hire advisors simply to have someone to blame for your own mistakes. Some speculators make up their mind on what they want to do and hire an advisor to approve their decisions; when these go poorly, they blame the advisors instead of themselves. 
  * In his commentary, Zweig cautions against advisors who use these red flags in their speech:
    * Guarantees: “It’s a sure thing.” “You can’t lose.” “There’s no downside.”
    * Overpromises: “We can beat the market.” “You’ll retire early.”
    * Secrets only they have: “Our proprietary system.” “No one else can do this.” “Exclusive.”
    * Unfamiliar jargon they aren’t willing to explain: “Commodities trading.” “Options strategy.”
    * Urgency: “You have to act now.” “Opportunity of a lifetime.” “Once-in-a-decade.”



With these generalities in mind, we’ll discuss the spread of financial advisors.

### Investment Counsel and Bank Services

Investment counsel firms manage your money for you in exchange for fees. They can be independent firms or arms of larger banks (often called private banking or wealth management).

According to Graham, **the best investment advisors tend to be conservative in their actions and promises**. They want to deliver acceptable returns and preserve your principal over the long term.

They may also help you meet your financial goals in general, including managing your budget, planning for retirement, and customizing an investment approach for your goals.

The primary role of such advisors may be to protect you from yourself. In times of financial duress, they act as a stabilizer, helping you avoid unwise decisions that you might indulge in alone.

In his commentary, Zweig suggests questions to vet such an advisor:

  * How do you define success? What would a good outcome with me be like in 10 years?
  * What’s your investment philosophy?
  * How many clients do you have? What do you do for them? How often do you talk?
  * What returns are realistic for my investments?
  * Have you ever received a formal complaint?



### Financial Information

These services provide financial information to be used by customers to make their own financial decisions. They often exist as organizations that send out newsletters or provide databases of information. These services cost less than the investment advisors above.

The services vary in how opinionated they are about the information they put out, which then determines how you should approach them.

  * On the most objective end, organizations produce merely statistical data on securities, which is the cornerstone for securities analysis. Examples of reputable firms from Graham’s time include Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.
  * On the more opinionated end, services may issue forecasts on the direction of the market or of individual stocks. There is a large demand from investors for oracle-like advice, and businesses will always exist to supply it. Graham has a dim view of these types of forecasts and often finds them inaccurate, technically unsound, or short-sighted.



For any financial information you receive, do your own research instead of relying solely on recommendations.

### Stockbrokers and Brokerages

The key point to remember about stock brokerages is that **they make money when you trade, not when you make money**. Therefore, brokerages try to make trading as easy and fast as possible, regardless of whether this is actually good for you.

In fact, since speculators nearly certainly lose money on average and in the long-term, if brokerages had their customers’ best interests in mind, they would make trading more cumbersome. But the least they often do is avoid outright _encouraging_ speculation; otherwise, they throw up their hands, saying, “If customers want to trade using our tools, so be it.”

If you deal with any individual brokers, remember that they typically make their money on commissions, so beware of anyone promoting what smells of speculation. (Earlier in this chapter we’ve discussed red flags for language.)

### Investment Banks

Investment banks help companies “go public,” or offer shares to the public for sale. They typically serve as underwriters, meaning they buy the company’s newly issued stocks at a discount, then sell them to the public (thus offering a guarantee to the company that all their stock will be sold, and that the company will raise a certain amount of funds). They also provide marketing and regulatory services.

Investment banking is often seen as the most respected profession in finance, since they accomplish a goal of material societal value—helping companies procure investment to grow.

Today, you likely won’t deal directly with investment banks (unless they directly promote new stocks to you), but you are subject to their marketing. Like many financial advisors, the incentive of investment banks only overlaps partially with yours—they make money when the stock price goes up. Therefore, **they will paint the most optimistic picture of future company performance**.

Graham has already expressed his skepticism of new issues in general, given the enthusiastic salesmanship and that IPOs tend to happen when the environment is most favorable to the company. Resist the ebullient marketing and do your own analysis.

### Other Advisors

Not that you know how much effort it takes to earn above-average returns, you should be skeptical of anyone who promises the same, whether they be your local banker, friends, or relatives. If they don’t have a long track record of strong performance and don’t put in the hard work to be judicious about investments, they shouldn’t be trusted anymore than you trust yourself.
