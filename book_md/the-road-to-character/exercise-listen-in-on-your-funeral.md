## Exercise: Listen In on Your Funeral

One way to examine how you’re living now is to think about how other people will remember you when you’re gone.

* * *

Imagine you're listening in at your own funeral service. What 2-4 characteristics would you like to be remembered for?

Are you actively practicing the virtues that you hope to be remembered for? Why or why not?

Name one “eulogy virtue” that you’d like to develop. What’s one thing you could do today that will help you cultivate that virtue?
