## 1-Page Summary

Would you rather develop a new product or develop your soul? What matters more to you—being a successful CEO or being someone who always lends a helping hand? Having a pile of money in the bank or knowing that your retirement years will be shared with friends and family who adore you?

These are the kinds of questions that _New York Times_ columnist David Brooks makes us consider in his 2015 book, _The Road to Character._ Brooks believes **we live in a cultural framework that emphasizes exterior success** —money, fame, status, work promotions, and other upwardly mobile achievements—**at the expense of our virtue and inner character.**

In order to succeed in that framework, we’ve become narcissists. Because we want to ascend the ladder of success, we put ourselves at the center of our own universe. Almost every minute of our days must be spent working toward some achievement. We inflate our resumés with accolades and promotions. We have lunch with the “right” people. We trade up to larger houses and fancier cars. We enroll our kids in the best schools. **We spend our lives in pursuit of superficial, materialistic gains because we believe this will make us happy.** The problem is that these accomplishments don’t give us deep satisfaction—eventually they leave us feeling hollow and empty, wondering what it was all for.

_The Road to Character_ argues that in order to live more meaningful lives, we need to move toward a moral renewal. **We need to ask ourselves how we can better serve the world instead of just serving ourselves.** If we start paying more attention to living virtuously and strengthening our character rather than building our resumés and stock portfolios, we can enjoy a life filled with purpose instead of shallow victories. And ultimately, we’ll become happier people.

### Our Worldview Shifts From “We” to “Me”

Our culture wasn’t always obsessed with personal achievement. Today’s “me-focused” worldview didn’t arise until the late 1940s. Prior to that time, most Americans accepted the notion of “original sin”—that we’re born deeply flawed, and it’s our task to battle our imperfections. Whether we win or lose that battle, the fight is always worthwhile because **character is built through struggle.**

Because we realized we were flawed, we believed there must be a greater good in the world, a purpose bigger than ourselves. That belief made us more community-minded. People thought it was honorable to be modest about individual successes and more deely invested in the wellbeing of our neighborhoods, communities, or country. **Humility and self-restraint were highly respected traits.**

Consider President George Bush Sr., who was born in 1924 and grew up during the Great Depression. After his speechwriters prepared his speeches, he would go through and cross out every instance of the word “I.” He believed that he needed to serve as the voice of the people, not of himself.

##### Cultural Roots of the Shift

The “me-focused” zeitgeist, which took root in the late 1940s and early 1950s, came about after Americans’ long period of deprivation during World War II. It was psychologically liberating to shift from the hardships of war and poverty to the freedom of consumerism. Advertisements for new, exciting products started to frame a new way of living (and thinking). At the same time, popular books stressed a humanistic psychology that described a more uplifting version of what human life could be. (One of that era’s biggest bestsellers was the 1952 self-help book _The Power of Positive Thinking._) The message switched from “you’re born as a flawed sinner” to “you’re great, so love yourself.” (Shortform note: To learn more about the ideas that caused this shift, read our summary of The Power of Positive Thinking.)

**Over time, the pendulum swung so far in the direction of self-actualization that it has now reached the extreme of narcissism** —we’re all about ourselves—the "Big Me."**** And we’re mostly blind to it. If asked, most of us would say we’re more virtuous than a lot of other people. But therein lies our problem. We have such an inflated view of ourselves that we don't see our own flaws. We have so much confidence in ourselves that we justify our life choices just because they "feel right." We’ve sipped from our own Kool-Aid. **In short, we’ve become self-obsessed.**

However, as we glibly travel along our “me-focused” roads, our lives have lost their sense of meaning. We’re so busy achieving worldly success, there’s no time for soul-searching, pondering our character, or questioning whether we’re behaving in a morally righteous manner. On top of that, we don’t remember what it feels like to devote ourselves to a cause larger than ourselves. We’ve lost the value—and the deep, abiding joy—of sublimating our individual desires for a greater good.

### We Can Still Be Capitalists

The good news is that the two schools of thought—living an achievement-based life versus living a virtuous life—are not mutually exclusive. We can be achievement-oriented without being egotistically “me-focused.” We are resourceful enough to be able to combine our ambition with moral and spiritual development. We don’t need to go off to a mountaintop and renounce all worldly pleasures in order to live a fulfilling life—in fact, our economy depends on us being high-achieving workers who earn and spend money.

**The battle for stronger character and high morals is waged on the inside.** What you do for your vocation can aid in this battle—working in public service is definitely good for the soul—but what matters most is looking inward, admitting to your imperfections, facing life with humility, and struggling to become a better human being. If you devote enough effort to examining your flaws and developing your inner character, you could manage a successful hedge fund while living a life of selfless virtue.

### A New Kind of Happiness

Perhaps the best part of leaving our selfish, self-aggrandizing ways behind is that **it leads to a more fulfilling life.** Instead of chasing whatever superficial goal appeals to us at the moment, we’ll be working toward a higher purpose. We’ll be less concerned about impressing everybody and more concerned with loving others and ourselves. We’ll find more joy in helping our communities than in buying a shiny new trinket. We’ll settle into a mature, relaxed state of self-acceptance, knowing that we’re living a life of profound meaning.

### Real-Life Examples

The bulk of _The Road to Character_ presents a series of profiles, a hall of fame stocked with historical figures who rose above their imperfections and their lives’ challenges to build strength of character. **They did it by employing self-restraint and embracing a vigorous moral code.** The profiles include military and political leaders, crusaders for justice, advocates for the oppressed, and writers and thinkers spread across cultures and centuries. Each of these figures made their mark in history by humbling themselves, admitting to their shortcomings, and working tirelessly to become better human beings. The profiles include:

#### Dorothy Day

Founder of the newspaper _The Catholic Worker_ and advocate for the downtrodden during the Depression era, Day became a better person by admitting her flaws. In her younger years, she suffered from depression and alcoholism, but she used the Christian concept of grace to turn her life of sadness into a life of service. Through deep devotion to her religion, she learned to embrace her own suffering and let it guide and strengthen her character. Her personal struggles became a force for good.

**Takeaways:** To find salvation, devote yourself to a cause that gives meaning and purpose to your life and learn to find the value in your own mistakes and flaws.

#### A. Philip Randolph

One of America’s most prominent civil rights organizers and activists, Randolph worked to end racial discrimination in employment and organized the first predominantly Black labor union in 1925. His dignified manner, impeccable manners, and quiet strength made him a role model for future civil rights activities. He emphasized civil disobedience and nonviolent protests like sit-ins and pray-ins over shouting or violence.

**Takeaways:** Achieve self-mastery and behave with dignity and decorum in all situations. Peaceful protest and nonviolence can be more powerful than violent revolt.

#### George Catlett Marshall

The Army general who helped to lead America through World War II and created the “Marshall Plan” that rebuilt Europe was repeatedly passed over for military positions he coveted. A deeply reserved and private person, he never “blew his own horn,” even though it might have helped his career. He learned to deny himself for the benefit of others and to not allow jealousy to derail him. As a wartime general, he was known for his great dedication to his troops and to the Army as an institution. His quiet, dignified leadership led to him winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.

**Takeaways:** Sacrifice your individual desires for the betterment of a larger institution. Exhibit a reserved, humble demeanor.

#### President Dwight Eisenhower

The general who commanded the Allied invasion of France in World War II and later became an American President was brought up in a strictly disciplined household. His mother taught him self-restraint and self-discipline, which Eisenhower badly needed to reign in his fiery temper. Eisenhower used his childhood lessons to sustain him through many career disappointments. By exercising patience and managing his internal anger, he eventually achieved personal and political success.

**Takeaways:** Don’t act on every emotion that you feel. Self-restraint leads to a better, more successful life, especially for people with passionate dispositions. Great leaders lead with balance and moderation—they make big changes gradually and incrementally, rather than in one startling swoop.

#### Frances Perkins

The U.S. Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945 and the first woman to be appointed to a President’s cabinet, Perkins is known as “the woman behind the New Deal.” She was called into service through a life-changing event—at age 31, she walked out of a Manhattan tea party to witness the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, one of the most famous factory fires in American history, in which 146 garment workers perished. The experience led her on the path to become a crusader for workers’ rights. As she moved through her career in public service, she became even more deeply dedicated to her cause while simultaneously supporting her husband and daughter, who both suffered from bipolar disorder.

**Takeaways:** Seek your true calling and figure out how you can best serve your world. Sacrifice your individual desires for a greater purpose.

#### St. Augustine

The 4th-century theologian learned to reject worldly pleasures and surrender himself to God and grace. Augustine was a classic overachiever who found his many successes unfulfilling, so he went on a search for meaning. Augustine’s “Confessions” are a long meditation on the perils of sin, pride, and selfishness, in which he finally determines that even by becoming a bishop, continually studying the Bible, and praying for divine wisdom, he cannot attain perfection. He finally chose to humble himself and admit to his innate flaws and was then able to revel in God’s grace.

**Takeaways:** Understand that we cannot trust our own desires because we are all born sinful, and our individual desires always lead us astray. Self-pride makes us think we control our own lives, but we don’t. Only God is in control, and by surrendering to His grace, our struggles will become easier.

#### George Eliot

Novelist George Eliot (pen name for Mary Anne Evans) learned to be a better person by opening herself up to selfless love. Her decades-long relationship with partner George Lewes changed her from someone who was childlike, self-indulgent, and needy to a mature adult who was able to do the difficult work of writing soul-searching fiction. She paid a huge price for her relationship—Lewes was technically still married to another woman, so the pair were ousted from polite society—but that sacrifice helped her define her sense of morality and take agency for her own life.

**Takeaways:** Love has a redemptive power, and loving fully and being fully loved increases your ability to be your best self. Also, it’s important to define your own moral code even if it defies society’s conventions.

#### Samuel Johnson

A brilliant writer who made major contributions to English literature in the 18th century as a poet, playwright, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, and editor, Johnson suffered from physical maladies and depression throughout his life. He rescued himself through deep self-exploration, moral inquiry, and feverishly hard work. To combat his insecurities and his fear of a demanding and punishing God, he filled his diaries with self-criticism and vows for self-improvement. Through his lifelong physical and emotional suffering, he learned to have great compassion for others.

**Takeaways:** Every human struggle is a moral struggle. We can never become perfect human beings, but we can build our character by constantly striving for self-improvement.

### Guidelines for a More Moral Life

To help us recalibrate our moral compasses, Brooks outlines a **15-point Humility Code** in the final chapter of the book.**** Following this code will help us circumvent our tendency for narcissism, help us live more virtuous lives, and ultimately make us happier, better people. These are his 15 guiding principles for building character, organized by theme:

#### Think “We” Instead of “Me”

  1. Understand that **we are naturally selfish and self-centered**. We are narcissists at the core, and we have to combat the urge to act selfishly. This requires eternal vigilance because selfishness is deeply ingrained in our natures.
  2. Don’t pursue temporal happiness. Seek moral goodness instead and you’ll find happiness along the way. We aren’t here on earth for the momentary pleasure of buying some new trinket, basking in the praise of others, or increasing our social status. Serving our own self-interest doesn’t bring deep down joy, but serving others’ needs does. **We naturally feel good when we live a life of moral virtue.**
  3. When looking for a career, don’t listen to popular advice to “follow your passion.” Instead, **put your skills and abilities to use to serve the greater good.** Having a vocation that both utilizes your unique gifts _and_ serves your community will lead to a fulfilling life.**** Having a vocation that only does half of that equation will not. 



#### Crush Your Pride and Admit to Your Flaws

  1. **Humility is key** to overcoming any human weakness. Own up to your flaws and imperfections—stop telling yourself you’re fine as you are. You can’t become a better person unless you are willing to humble yourself and learn. You must accurately assess your own flaws, and you must submit to the idea that you are not and will never be perfect. 
  2. To win against weakness, you must **diminish your ego.** Practice restraint. Stop announcing everything you do to the world. Teach your ego to be modest, even reticent. Joy does not come from convincing other people you’re great. In fact, trying to convince others of our greatness is an exhausting proposition. Instead, celebrate other people’s victories. Be a cheerleader for others. 
  3. Pride is our downfall. Pride makes us believe we are fine the way we are. It’s what makes us constantly try to prove to the world how great we are. **Eliminate pride** and we are suddenly able to see ourselves clearly, which means we can then better ourselves. 
  4. **You don’t know as much as you think**. Not even close. The humble person knows that she doesn’t understand everything around her. Start with admitting there is a vast universe of things you don’t know. Even when we have knowledge about a subject, we don’t necessarily have wisdom. 



#### Engage Fully in Your Moral Struggle

  1. Although humans have a multitude of flaws, we also have the capability to overcome those flaws. **We are sinners, but we don’t have to live sinful lives.** We can choose to battle against our flaws and not give in—like an alcoholic choosing to avoid drinking alcohol or a work-addicted person choosing to leave the office and go play with his kids. 
  2. Once we have a roof over our heads and food to eat, engaging in the struggle for character is more important than any of life’s other struggles. **There is beauty in the struggle** because it gives meaning to life, whereas climbing the ladder of success tends to leave us feeling empty. You can work as a high-profile CEO or as a devoted caregiver—either way, your most dramatic battle will be for your own morality and character. 
  3. **Character is built through self-discipline.** You need to develop character-building habits by making good moral choices every day. The more good choices you make—big ones, small ones, hundreds of them every day—the better you become at self-discipline. 
  4. Short-term desires are the devil whispering in your ear. Gluttony or lust or a multitude of other sins will try to lure us, but the rewards are painfully short-term. Building character requires **committing to the long-term.** It means giving up this week’s desire in favor of the much bigger reward that comes from living a good life over a long period of time. 
  5. When you conquer your weaknesses, you reach a state of maturity that doesn’t require a lot of fanfare. You may or may not be an outward success, but that won’t matter much to you. You’re not looking to be praised or congratulated;**the reactions of others are unimportant** because you have found the meaning and purpose in your life. 



#### Seek Help From Other People and God

  1. You can’t build character completely on your own. You need help from family, friends, and God. **You aren’t an island** or a lone wolf; you are one of billions of humans who are engaged in a similar struggle for meaning in their lives. It’s impossible to improve yourself unless someone holds up a mirror for you, so you can truly see yourself. You can also draw on other people’s experiences to help you wage your battle with yourself. 
  2. When we battle against weakness, our fight often takes the form of a few steps forward and a few steps back, then forward again. When you fail, when you feel like you’re moving backward, you must simply **surrender to grace.** Admit and accept your defeat, and let the world embrace you and help you back on your feet. Grace will deliver the message that you aren’t alone in your struggles. 



#### Be a Moderate, Incremental Leader

15\. If you’re a leader, make changes within your organization slowly and gradually. Don’t shoot for big, dramatic, headline-making changes; instead, **make small shifts that people can adapt to and embrace.** Understand that your job as a leader is not to be a ground-breaking pioneer or revolutionary change-maker. Your job is to find a balance between competing goals and interests.
