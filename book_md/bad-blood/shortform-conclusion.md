## Shortform Conclusion: Applying Psychological Biases

Warren Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger has a list of 25 cognitive biases to be aware of in decisionmaking. As he says, when multiple biases are in play simultaneously, a “lollapalooza” happens leading to extremely distorted results. This is as true in Theranos as it is in cults.

Here’s a rundown of major biases that played into perpetuating Theranos’s fraud:

  * Reward tendency - anyone who had a financial stake in Theranos clearly wanted it to succeed. This included its advisory board, investors, and employees.
  * Liking tendency - Elizabeth Holmes was charismatic and seemed genuine. People wanted to follow her and execute her vision.
  * Disliking tendency - Its supporters disliked incumbents like Quest Diagnostics and wanted to depose them.
  * Influence from mere association - Holmes surrounded herself with powerful people, starting with Channing Robertson and going up to Rupert Murdoch and Henry Kissinger. Their prestige rubbed off on Theranos.
  * Social proof tendency - Likewise, seeing other people support Theranos lowered the defenses of new supporters. How could so many people be wrong?
  * Overoptimism tendency - Holmes and Theranos supporters were overoptimistic about the technology, underestimating the amount of work needed to execute their vision.
  * Availability misweighting tendency - You use what little data you have available. For Theranos, little technical data was released, meaning supporters had to draw only on the positive press that Holmes carefully cultivated.
  * Inconsistency avoidance tendency - Once people publicly voted for Theranos, it was hard to backpedal. If they were wrong, they’d look foolish.
  * Deprival superreaction tendency - Investors and partners couldn’t imagine losing their entire investment if Theranos were fraudulent. So they avoided the painful truth and doubled down, hoping for the best.
  * Stress influence tendency - Employees who had a crisis of conscience were threatened by Theranos’s legal team, preventing them from assessing the situation fully and choosing to adopt the less risky path of keeping quiet.



All these influences built on each other, preventing the fraud from unraveling for years, until the accumulation of fraud became too much.
