## Part 3: How Did the Deception End?

**Theranos overreached in ambition, causing them to require delivering at some point.**

  * They promised too much to Walgreens and had to deliver. This prompted them to cheat.
    * Why not wait until the miniLab was ready? Elizabeth Holmes: “When I promise something to a customer, I deliver.”
    * Thus, Theranos continued lying to the public, pretending it had a working device and giving real lab results in Walgreens centers, when really the results were flawed.
  * Elizabeth wanted to achieve the vision of a small device that did everything (immunoassays, general chems, hematology, DNA). The form factor came before the underlying technology worked, and ultimately they couldn’t design something that had a chance of working.



**Theranos stepped too far down the slippery slope of deception, until even their strong-arm tactics couldn’t hold back a conscience.**

  * Embellishing results in prototyping phase was somewhat acceptable. Lying about real patient data, which affected clinical decision making, crossed the line for many employees. 
    * Many employees left; most stayed quiet due to fears of reprisal; some brave whistleblowers let conscience override fear, and they reported to regulators and reporters.
  * Doctors were increasingly furious about incorrect lab reports leading to inappropriate patient treatment. They cooperated with the reporting.



**A journalist fought for the story.**

  * Despite continuing threats of litigation, harassment of his sources, and personal surveillance by private investigators, John Carreyrou pressed forward with his story, knowing it would be big. Arguably, without his story, Theranos would have been allowed to persist for years longer, harming many more patients.



**In the downfall, momentum and vicious cycles are as punishing as they are powerful on the way up.**

  * Once the evidence of Theranos’s failure became clear, the flywheel effect worked in the opposite direction. Walgreens dropped the partnership; regulators fixated their attention on Theranos; the public lambasted her and the gullibility of Theranos’s supporters; sources readily reached out to reporters to share useful information; investors sued Holmes for fraud.
