## Exercise: Turn Lack of Skills into a Strength

Reflect on your perceived weaknesses to find their hidden advantages.

* * *

Think of a personal or career challenge that felt insurmountable because you felt like you were lacking skills. What was the challenge?

Did you feel at a disadvantage? Write down your disadvantages in the situation above.

Now look at each disadvantage. How can you reframe it as an advantage? Is there any aspect of the disadvantage thatâ€™s positive?
