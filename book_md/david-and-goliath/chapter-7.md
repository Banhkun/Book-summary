## Chapter 7: The Limits of Power - The Principle of Legitimacy

Part Three shifts the focus away from the Davids of the world and toward the Goliaths. We’ll discuss two aspects of Goliath’s power that actually make him less powerful: **the limits of authority and the negative effects of the overuse of power.**

What Goliaths, people with overt power, tend to misunderstand about power is that it has limitations. The traditional hallmarks of power—massive weapons, years of experience, society’s blessing—can only take you so far. The degree to which you are powerful depends, in part, on how much power your “subjects” are willing to give you.

### The Principle of Legitimacy

An authority figure’s power over the rest of us is especially limited if we don’t perceive him and his power as being “legitimate.” An authority’s legitimacy is based on **three things** :

  1. We, the subjects, need to **have a voice.** And we need to believe that those in power care about what we have to say.
  2. We need to feel that the law we’re being asked to abide by is **predictable**.
  3. We need to feel that the law and the people enforcing it are **fair**.



**If you’re the one with the power, why does it matter what people think of you?**

People become defiant, rather than submissive, when they don’t view the authority as legitimate. Authorities may make the rules, but they have trouble enforcing them without legitimacy. In fact, if you aren’t “legitimate” and you exert your power, you may get the opposite of your intended effect.

### A Negative Example: Northern Ireland and the Troubles

In the late 1960s, antagonism between Northern Ireland’s Catholic minority and Protestant majority came to a head. The UK government called in the British (mostly Protestant) Army to keep the peace.

Ian Freeland was the general in charge in Northern Ireland. He believed in ruling by force. He intended to meet any resistance with immediate and brutal punishment and didn’t care what anyone, particularly Catholics, thought about it.

Aiming to scare the rioters on both sides, Freeland threatened to shoot anyone caught throwing gasoline bombs. This backfired. **The more Freeland threatened, the more violence occurred.**

  * In 1969, there were 13 deaths.
  * In 1971, there were 184 deaths.
  * In 1972, there were 497 deaths.



In response to the violence, Freeland suspended civil rights and brought in more troops. The army held suspects in prison without a trial, and soon, most Catholics had at least one family member in prison.

**One incident demonstrates Freeland’s soldiers’ liberal use of force (and how it backfired).**

  * After receiving a tip that one house in Lower Falls, a Catholic neighborhood, contained explosives, the army came to search it. The local priest warned that the residents would cause trouble if the soldiers didn’t complete the raid quickly.
  * As the soldiers started to leave the neighborhood in their armored cars, a few young men threw rocks at them. The soldiers stopped the cars and brought out the tear gas. The conflict escalated quickly from there.
  * The priest begged the soldiers to stop the tear gas, promising to restore order if they did, but the soldiers refused to listen. As the priest turned to walk away, he was gassed as well. The army brought in helicopters, declared a curfew, and ransacked every house in the neighborhood, trashing them.
  * After the Lower Falls had been under curfew for 36 hours, residents were running out of food (they weren’t wealthy and many houses didn’t have refrigerators).
  * A woman named Harriet Carson rallied the women of neighboring Ballymurphy to gather bread and milk and bring it to the Lower Falls in prams, in defiance of the army and curfew.
  * At first, soldiers knocked over women who tried to trespass the barricade. As more and more marchers approached with their prams, residents of the Lower Falls started coming out into the streets. The British Army lost control and gave up.



Gladwell maintains that **the British Army’s illegitimate use of power turned a conflict that should have lasted a few months into 30 bloody, chaotic years.**

**What made Freeland’s approach illegitimate? Why didn’t it work?**

To the Catholic minority, Freeland’s actions didn’t seem **predictable** or **fair**.

  * The soldiers sent to be neutral peacekeepers were Protestant. This didn’t seem fair to the Catholics, who assumed that, when push came to shove (often literally), the soldiers would side with the Protestant Loyalists. They weren’t wrong.
    * On one occasion, when Protestant Loyalists marched through the Catholic neighborhood of Ballymurphy, British soldiers stood as a buffer between the marchers and the residents. But the soldiers faced _away_ from the street, giving the impression that they were protecting the marchers from the residents.
  * Suspects didn’t get a trial.
  * The Army shot and killed one young man when he went outside with a friend to smoke a cigarette. This was not an isolated incident.
  * The curfew in some Catholic neighborhoods meant residents were imprisoned in their homes without enough food to feed their large families.
  * Rather than searching one suspicious house, soldiers ransacked the whole neighborhood. (The army had searched _every_ Catholic home an average of two times by the mid-1970s.)



**The Catholic minority refused to abide laws that weren’t fair or predictable, causing more and more trouble** for Freeland and the British Army.

### A Positive Example: Crime Rates in Brownsville

Brownsville, in Brooklyn, is historically one of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods in New York City.

In 2003, Joanne Jaffe became the head of the city’s Housing Bureau and sought to use her power legitimately. Accordingly, she departed from the conventional approach to lowering the crime rate in Brownsville.

Jaffe and her team created a program offering job, education, and medical assistance to Brownsville juveniles with a record, but warned them that if they continued to commit crimes, the team would make sure they stayed in jail, no matter how minor the crime. Jaffe also committed to getting to know the juveniles’ families.

She wasn’t getting anywhere with this approach until a group of her officers bought a particularly antagonistic juvenile and his family a Thanksgiving turkey. Jaffe was touched, and asked the police commissioner for money to buy turkeys for all the families with juveniles in the program.

**When the families felt cared for and heard, they willingly opened their doors to the police.** After this success, Jaffe and her task force started playing basketball with their charges, taking them to dinner, and driving them to doctor appointments. They got involved in their charges’ lives in ways that had nothing to do with the law.

Jaffe got astounding results: Brownsville robberies decreased every year from 2006 to 2011, and robbery arrests of program members decreased from roughly 370 arrests (one year prior to starting the program) to roughly 20 arrests three years later.

**What made Jaffe’s approach _legitimate_? Why did it work?**

  1. The Brownsville families felt **heard**. When Jaffe visited families, she told them she understood why they sometimes hate the police. She said that although it seemed like the police were harassing them, it was because they truly care about them. By getting to know the families, Jaffe opened up honest, direct, and friendly communication between juvenile delinquents and the police.
  2. Jaffe made the law seem more **predictable** and **fair**. Likely all of the juvenile delinquents in Jaffe’s program had a family member who had been in jail. Because so many people they knew were imprisoned, the law didn’t seem fair to these kids and their families. It felt like the police were out to get them. Jaffe made it clear that her goal was to keep program members _out_ of jail. By offering help to families wherever and whenever it was needed, subsequent arrests (if they happened at all) seemed fairer.
