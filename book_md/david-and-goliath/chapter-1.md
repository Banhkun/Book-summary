## Chapter 1: The Advantages of Lacking Skill

If you feel like the underdog, it may be because you lack skills that most people consider necessary to win in your field. You likely think of your shortcomings as obvious disadvantages. But, contrary to common sense, what if you could use your inadequacies to your advantage?

Chapters 1-3 have to do with the various advantages of “disadvantages.” In this chapter, we’ll talk about the advantage of lacking skill.

### The Advantages of Having No Skill

If you’re really terrible at a game, **you _can’t_ follow conventional wisdom and win**—you just don’t have the skills. Being unskilled (but still in the game) forces you to come up with new approaches to winning. Your skilled opponents (who aren’t as desperate as you are) have no reason to come up with novel strategies because the conventional ones work well for them. Consequently, your opponents are not prepared for your new approach. Taking them by surprise gives you an edge.

**Two stories** , one historical and one recent, illustrate situations in which a group’s lack of skill obliged them to implement strategies that were far more effective than the traditional ones.

### Example #1: Lawrence of Arabia

At the end of the First World War,**Lawrence of Arabia** led the Arabs 6,000 miles through the desert, into battle against the highly trained Turkish army occupying Arabia. Lawrence commanded a small, untrained band of Arab nomads, many of whom had never held a gun. The troops only numbered a few hundred, but they beat the Turks’ army easily, only losing two men.

**Why Did Lawrence of Arabia’s Underdog Tactics Work?**

  * **They were unexpected** : The Turks were prepared to defend themselves against an attack from British ships at the Gulf of Aqaba. They left themselves vulnerable to an attack from the desert, never imagining that any troop would be crazy enough to cross it, especially in the summer.
  * **They took advantage of the opponent’s weaknesses** : Like Goliath with his burdensome weapons and armor, the Turks’ extensive material resources weighed them down and rendered them immobile, trapped between the sea and the desert. By approaching from the desert side, Lawrence’s army hemmed the Turks in, leaving them little room for escape.
  * **They didn’t allow their opponents to capitalize on their strengths** : The Turks had modern weapons and material resources, but the Arabs’ surprise attack didn’t give the Turks time to utilize their resources to their full potential.
  * **They used their “disadvantages” to their advantage:** The Arab soldiers carried only a rifle and a hundred rounds of ammunition. They brought little water or food. But, like David, they used their lack of weaponry and supplies to their advantage. Traveling light allowed them to cover upwards of 100 miles a day.
  * **They were audacious** : Traveling 600 miles through the desert in the summer is bold. Few would have had the audacity, which is part of what made their appearance at Aqaba so surprising.



### Example #2: Unconventional Basketball Plays

**Vivek Ranadivé,** an Indian immigrant who had never played basketball, decided to coach his daughter’s National Junior Basketball team in Redwood City.

Not having a group of skilled, experienced players, and without enough time to teach them the skills to make them competitive using conventional strategies, Ranadive took advantage of **two deadlines.** These are moments in a basketball game when the best teams are as vulnerable as the worst:

  * **Deadline #1** : When Team A scores, a player from Team B takes the ball out-of-bounds and must pass the ball to a teammate within 5 seconds.
    * The _conventional strategy_ used by players of Team A, now the defense, is to retreat to the other side of the court.
    * The _unconventional strategy_ used by Ranadivé’s Team A was to stand in front of Team B players and block them from receiving the pass. Flustered, the out-of-bounds Team B player often couldn’t complete the pass, giving the ball back to Ranadivé’s Team A.
  * **Deadline #2** : If Team B does happen to get the ball into one of its player’s hands, it has 10 seconds to get the ball onto their opponent’s side of the court, at the opposite end.
    * Again, the _conventional strategy_ for Team A is to retreat to their side of the court and await their opposition.
    * Just as in their response to Deadline #1, Ranadivé’s _unconventional strategy_ had his 12-year-olds aggressively surrounding the Team B player with the ball, keeping her from getting across midcourt in 10 seconds.



This play style, called a full-court press, kept the talented opponents of the Redwood City team from keeping the ball long enough to use their skills. Ranadivé’s Redwood City team of relatively unskilled players won almost all their games.

**Why Did Ranadivé’s Underdog Tactics Work?**

  * **They were unexpected:** People have played basketball the same way for decades--it never occurred to the teams playing Redwood City that they could play it any other way. Consequently, the opposing teams were unprepared and bewildered when confronted with the full-court press.
  * **They took advantage of their opponent’s weaknesses:** When trying to get the ball into play within the allotted 5 or 10 seconds, even the most skilled players are vulnerable. Ranadivé developed his entire game strategy to take advantage of these moments when even the best teams are under pressure.
  * **They didn’t allow their opponents to capitalize on their strengths:** The best basketball players are highly skilled at dribbling, rebounding, or scoring 3-pointers. The Redwood City players didn’t let their skilled opponents get close enough to the basket to use these skills.
  * **They used their “disadvantages” to their advantage:** Most of Ranadivé’s players were new to the game and didn’t have time to learn the skills. Their lack of skill led them to work much harder than their opponents. Often, you only work that hard when you’re desperate because you don’t have the skills that may have spared you the effort.
  * **They were audacious:** Playing a full-court press is risky--because it’s a physically aggressive tactic, the chances of fouling out are higher. It’s also exhausting.



### If Underdog Tactics Are So Successful, Why Isn’t Everyone Using Them?

Many have fought battles since the Arabs beat the Turks in Aqaba, and in 1971, the Fordham University Rams used the full-court press to beat the nearly unbeatable University of Massachusetts Redmen. Lawrence’s and Ranadivé’s unconventional tactics aren’t unknown. But in general, **underdogs rarely learn from the past and use these unconventional strategies**. Why not?

**Reason 1: Underdog tactics are hard**

Walking 100 miles a day through the desert in the summer is brutal. A full-court press involves being constantly in motion, so the Redwood City team had to be fitter than their opponents. Few but the desperate are willing to work this hard.

**Reason 2: People get angry when you don’t play by their rules.**

Thus, these tactics are best employed by those who don’t care if they upset some people.

If you care what others think of you, you’re less likely to use underdog tactics. (And it’s human nature to care what others think of you, making this difficult.)

  * For example, Lawrence’s British compatriots scoffed at his Bedouin dress and “untrained rabble,” but he didn’t care. He was an archaeologist by trade and wasn’t invested in the good opinion of the military establishment.
  * The coaches of opposing teams were furious that Ranadivé’s underdogs were crushing their skilled players (and that a “skinny, foreign guy” who had never played basketball was coaching the winning team); one was so upset he threw a chair, and the ref kicked him out of the building; another man threatened to beat Ranadivé up.
