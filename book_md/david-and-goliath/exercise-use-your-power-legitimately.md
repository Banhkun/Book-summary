## Exercise: Use Your Power Legitimately

When Goliaths use their power illegitimately, both Goliath and David suffer. Think about the power dynamics in situations in which you’ve been David and situations in which you’ve been Goliath.

* * *

Have you ever had a teacher, supervisor, or boss whom you didn’t respect (perceive as legitimate)? How did you react when he or she gave you direction or feedback? What could have the teacher, supervisor, or boss done to make you more willing to cooperate or give your best effort?

Who are you in a position of power over? (Your “subjects” might be your employees, children, students, or pets.) For an area of your responsibility, do your “subjects” feel: 1) They are heard? 2) You are predictable? 3) You are fair?
