## Exercise: Find Your Advantage in Moderation

Reflect on the ways your desire for more is holding you back, and how moderation can help you move forward.

* * *

Think about something that you love (maybe a food or an activity) or something that you think of as unquestionably positive (perhaps a quality like patience or forgiveness). Can you imagine a point at which thereâ€™s too much of it? What would be the result?

Think of something you _always_ want more of. (Money? A promotion? Attention? Pizza?) How would moderation of this thing be an advantage over having too much?
