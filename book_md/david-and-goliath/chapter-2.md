## Chapter 2: The Advantages of Having Less Than Your Opponent

Most of us tend to believe that when something is good (like strength, money, or small class sizes), more of it is better. But Goliath’s abundance of size, strength, and weaponry didn’t protect him from David’s rock--it made him more vulnerable. There is a point at which the accumulation of resources ceases to be an advantage and another point at which those resources become a distinct disadvantage. The visual representation of this theory is the inverted-U curve.

### **The Inverted U-Curve**

When you graph the relationship between, say, parenting success and money, or class size and student achievement (two examples we’ll explore more below), the shape is an upside-down U.

![david-goliath-inverted-u.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/david-goliath-inverted-u.png)

For instance, if we wanted to graph the relationship between money and happiness, we could chart wealth on the X-axis and happiness on the Y-axis. Picture the beginning of the inverted-U at the bottom left-hand corner, where the X- and Y-axes meet, at $0 and 0 on the happiness scale. (It’s difficult to be happy when you don’t have money and are just trying to survive.)

As wealth increases, the arch moves diagonally up to the right. (An increase in money means an increase in happiness.)

But, at some point (studies say at a family income of around $75,000), an increase in money stops making you happier—you have enough to meet your basic needs and buy yourself and your family a few luxuries. The diagonal ascent of the graph starts to level off, forming the top of the upside-down U—income increases, but happiness levels stay the same.

We tend to think the relationship between wealth and happiness ends here: at some point, how much money you have ceases to matter. But this is our error--we forget that we live in a “U-shaped world.”

**Is there a point at which more money triggers a _decrease_ in happiness, completing the upside-down-U shape?** Many social scientists claim that, yes, you _can_ have too much of a good thing, as we’ll explore further in the example of money’s effect on parenting, below.

The tendency of graphs toward an inverted-U shape shows us that many things we think of as unequivocally advantageous, like money or material resources, aren’t. Nothing is good, evil, or even neutral. An item’s value often depends on how much of it you have. It’s advantageous until you have so much of it that its value becomes neutral. At the point of overabundance, its value goes from neutral to negative. What was an advantage in a limited amount becomes a disadvantage in a large amount.

Let’s see how this plays out in two examples.

### **Example #1: More money does not necessarily lead to easier parenting**

(Shortform note: Gladwell implicitly defines “parenting” as spending time with your children and instilling in them the values of hard work and independence.)

Picture the inverted U again. If the X-axis is wealth and the Y-axis is the “easiness” of parenting (0 being not easy at all), poverty is located at the bottom left of the curve. If you live in poverty, it’s harder to be a good parent. Spending long hours at a demanding job is exhausting and leaves you little time or energy to spend with your children.

An increase in money makes parenting easier...to a certain point. Then the benefits start to diminish in proportion to wealth.

Perhaps surprisingly, there’s a point at which the wealthier you are, the _harder_ parenting is, and the curve makes its downward slope.

**Why would having a lot of money make parenting harder?**

You probably want to raise kids who understand the value of hard work and the fulfillment it brings. If your child asks for a pony, and you don’t have the money for one, it’s relatively easy to say, “No, we can’t afford that.” It’s the truth, and there’s no decision to make: buying a pony is not an option.

On the other hand, if your child asks for a pony and you _do_ have the money, you can’t use the excuse that you can’t afford it. Still, you don’t want to buy your daughter a pony—you want her to learn to work hard for what she wants, rather than depend on her parents to satisfy her every whim. **But it’s much harder to say “I _won’t_ buy you a pony” than “I _can’t_ buy you a pony.”** If you refuse to buy a pony (rather than being unable to), you have to explain to your child _why_ you won’t buy it. To explain why, you have to have clear values (not always easy) and know how to communicate those values (also not easy). Additionally, you have to stay firm in the face of an upset child, no mean feat when you have the resources to make your child immediately (if momentarily) happy.

#### Anecdote: The Hollywood power player

One unnamed Hollywood power player is very aware of how his wealth is a disadvantage for his children. He grew up in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in Minneapolis. If he wanted new shoes or a bike, he had to pay half, and to get the things he wanted he became an entrepreneur at age 10, paying neighborhood kids to shovel snow and rake leaves for residents. He worked throughout college, business school, and law school, and climbed his way up the ranks in Hollywood.

He attributes his success to the values he gained from growing up without financial means and working hard for everything he attained. Now a multimillionaire, **he knows his children won’t have to work for what they want the way he did**. He believes that his children will be less ambitious and won’t know the value of money or even their self-worth.

### Example #2: Smaller class sizes do not necessarily lead to higher achievement

Countries (and parents) around the world have devoted vast amounts of money to keeping class sizes small, believing that the smaller the class, the higher the achievement of its students. But the inverted-U curve tells us that smaller classes are only better for students up to a certain point. Do studies bear this out?

**Large classes:** Kids in large classes, such as those in Israel that regularly have 38 or 39 students, perform worse than those in a class of 20. This makes sense. Smaller class sizes mean more individual attention for each student.

**Medium-sized classes:** Within a range of moderate class sizes (roughly 13-23 kids), student performance is equal.

**Small classes:** But with very small class sizes (under 12 kids), anecdotal evidence suggests student learning is impaired. (Shortform Note: Gladwell studied low class sizes by polling teachers and collecting anecdotes rather than depending on evidence from rigorous studies.)

**Why would small class sizes lead to lower achievement?**

  * In small classes, there is nowhere to hide. Students feel vulnerable, especially the shyest ones.
  * Bullies and students with big personalities are more likely to dominate social dynamics in a small class.
  * Interactions between students are more intense--they start acting like siblings trapped in a car on a long road trip, and when they bicker, they can’t get any significant distance from each other.
  * A small group lacks the energy and momentum that comes with the audience formed in larger classes.
  * Small classes can be isolating and lack diversity. 
    * Small classes may isolate you from others who are confronting the same challenges you are. (A Dutch study showed that the kids who have the best chance of succeeding in school are those who see others grappling with the same issues they are, be they poverty or a learning disability. These children feel less alone and more normal.)
    * Conversely, the smaller the class, the less diverse it is—children aren’t exposed to a range of thoughts and experiences.
  * It’s more challenging to get discussions going in a small group.
