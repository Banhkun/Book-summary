## Chapter 4: Desirable Difficulty #1 - Disability

Part One (Chapters 1-3) discusses how what we perceive to be advantages are often disadvantages, or at least more of a mixed bag than we realize. In Part Two (Chapters 4-6), we see how so-called disadvantages can actually be strong advantages.

### Desirable Difficulties

In Part Two we learn about three “desirable difficulties”: disability, tragedy, and having nothing. What makes these, or any difficulties, desirable?

  * **Not all difficulties are desirable** —the students in the bottom third of an elite college do not benefit from feeling demoralized and discouraged from pursuing their dreams. 
  * On the other hand, **not all difficulties (what we perceive as disadvantages) should be avoided**. For instance, making a task more difficult can actually increase your chances of success on it. 



An experiment involving the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) demonstrates the advantages of a desirable difficulty. The CRT is the shortest intelligence test in the world at three questions long. At Princeton, researchers first gave the test to students in clear, standard font and print size. Students scored an average of 1.9 correct answers out of three. The second time researchers gave the CRT to Princeton students, they printed the test in hard-to-read font that was 10% gray. The average score _increased_ from 1.9 correct answers to 2.45.

Yes, **CRT scores increased when researchers made the test more difficult**. How can this be?

  1. When a task is more obviously difficult and frustrating, you slow down.
  2. You think more deeply about the task and devote more of your mental resources on it. In essence, you think harder.



### Desirable Difficulty #1: Disability or Deficiency

When we are deficient in a skill area that most people depend on for success, we will only succeed if **we find a way to compensate for our deficiency**. We may compensate so well that our skills are more impressive than if we didn’t have the disability in the first place.

**Capitalization Learning versus Compensation Learning**

Most of our learning can be roughly divided into two types:

  * **Capitalization learning** is the type we do when we get better and better at the things we’re naturally good at because we enjoy doing what comes naturally and easily. We capitalize on our strengths.
    * If you sing well and have perfect pitch, you will likely join a choir.
  * **Compensation learning** is the type we do when we need to compensate for a crucial skill we lack. This is learning out of necessity.
    * Schools put a premium on the written word. If you have severe dyslexia and struggle to read, to succeed you need to develop abilities that compensate for your inability to read.



It’s not a given that someone with a deficiency in one area will automatically compensate for it by developing extraordinary talents in another area. But those that can do this are better off than they would be if they didn’t have the deficiency, because compensation learning (gained through struggle) is more powerful than capitalization learning (which is relatively easy).

### Dyslexia: For Some, a Desirable Difficulty

A surprisingly high percentage (one study says ⅓) of successful entrepreneurs and business leaders are dyslexic. Are they successful in their careers despite their dyslexia or, perhaps, because of it?

**People with dyslexia often compensate by developing other skills, including memory, observation, and summarizing skills.**

For instance, David Boies is one of the most successful trial lawyers in the world. But he didn’t learn to read until he was in 3rd grade, and even today, he reads slowly and poorly. Boies credits his dyslexia (undiagnosed when he was young) for his amazing abilities in other areas:

**Memorization**

  * In childhood: Because Boies couldn’t follow along when his mother read to him, he memorized what he heard.
  * In adulthood: In law school, while his classmates were busy taking notes and, consequently, missing parts of the lecture, Boies was able to memorize the content of the lecture.



**Listening and observation**

  * In childhood: Because he couldn’t read (and multisensory learning was not as popular as it is today), listening and observing others was the only way Boies could learn. He got good at these skills.
  * In adulthood: As a trial lawyer, Boies catches hesitations during testimony, red-flag word choices, and nuance in tone and pace of voice that other lawyers miss. He takes advantage of these observations in his sometimes-brutal cross-examinations of witnesses.



**Ability to simplify issues to their key points**

  * In childhood: Without the ability to refer back to a text, Boies became skilled at simplifying complex issues to their basic points, making them easier to remember.
  * In adulthood: Many trial lawyers are academics and have trouble conveying their arguments to a jury because they get bogged down in the details. Boies presents the case to the jury in an accessible way and, therefore, has the advantage in court.



Other dyslexic people compensate in different ways. Movie producer Brian Grazer became skilled at the **art of persuasion**. Grazer’s dyslexia caused him to struggle in all his high school and college classes (which are usually text-based). After he received a grade, he’d go to the teacher and convince him or her to raise his grade by one letter. He says this worked 90% of the time. Grazer **learned to negotiate out of necessity**. This was good training for his eventual career as a movie producer.

### Disagreeableness and Dyslexia

A surprising trait gained by successful entrepreneurs with dyslexia is disagreeableness. How does disagreeableness arise? If you grow up a misfit (due to your struggle with reading), you are practiced in not caring what others think of you. This carries through as an adult.

One psychologist argues that there are three qualities innovators tend to have in common.

  * **Openness:** They are open to new ideas and can think outside the box.
  * **Conscientiousness:** They are disciplined and have enough grit to see an unconventional idea through to the product stage.
  * **Disagreeableness:** They are willing to ruffle some feathers and do things others don’t approve of.
    * (Think of the Brit Lawrence of Arabia dressing in Arab clothing, speaking Arabic, and using unconventional war tactics, or Ranadivé outraging other coaches by instructing his 12-year-old basketball players to play full-court press.)



The first two entrepreneurial qualities make sense, but disagreeableness? Why is it an asset?**If you’re worried about what people think of you, you’re not going to act on your unconventional—possibly revolutionary—ideas.**

#### The Benefits of Disagreeableness—Example #1:

Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA (and is dyslexic), first upset the status quo by selling unassembled furniture cheaply and angering his competitors. He took his second major social risk when manufacturers boycotted IKEA; at the height of the Cold War, he turned to communist Poland to manufacture IKEA furniture. The gamble paid off. IKEA is still an enormously successful company, and it might not be around today if Kamprad had cared about the feelings of his compatriots.

#### The Benefits of Disagreeableness—Example #2:

Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, was held back a year in elementary school. He has dyslexia, and it still takes him about 6 hours to read 22 pages. He got his job on Wall Street when he hopped into a cab with a guy who looked like he might have some power in one of the big brokerage firms. Cohn lied to him: He said he knew all about buying and selling options. (Cohn had barely made it through high school and, at the time, had a job selling aluminum siding. He had nothing to lose.) The following week, the man hired Cohn (after Cohn gave himself a crash course in options trading, no small task, even for someone without a learning disability.) This was a “disagreeable” act, an act in which Cohn didn’t care about the social consequences of pretending to be someone he wasn’t.

A note on dyslexia and success: Many people with dyslexia never learn to effectively compensate for their inabilities. A high proportion of prison inmates have dyslexia. Only when we can learn from our difficulties and overcome the failures they produce do they benefit us.
