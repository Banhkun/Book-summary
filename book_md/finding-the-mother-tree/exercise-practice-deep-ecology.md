## Exercise: Practice Deep Ecology

One of the major conclusions from research like Simard’s is that we need to shift the way we _think_ about nature in order to address impending climate change. The _deep ecology_ movement embraces changing our thought patterns in order to change our relationships with the natural world.

How does Simard’s research shift the way you think about trees, fungi, and nature in general?

If forests are alive with symbiotic relationships and communication between species, do you think you have the ability to communicate with these species as well? How might you deepen your relationship with nonhuman species in nature?
