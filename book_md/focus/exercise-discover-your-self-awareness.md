## Exercise: Discover Your Self (Awareness)

Keen self-awareness—awareness of your physical and emotional sensations and your state of mind—forms the foundations for other attentional skills like empathy and social awareness. Examine the state of your self-awareness to discover how it is impacting your life and if it may need some improvement.

Reflect on your experience of your body. Describe what your physical sensations are like on a typical day. How “loud” or “quiet” are they? Then, on a scale from 1-10, rate how sensitive you think you are to the messages your body sends you (1 being mostly unaware and 10 being extremely aware to the point of distraction).

Reflect on your experience of your emotions. Describe what having an emotion is typically like for you (for example, do you feel emotions in certain parts of your body? Do you tend to block them out? Do you think about them more than you feel them?). Then on a scale from 1-10, rate how sensitive you think you are to your emotions (1 being mostly unaware and 10 being extremely aware to the point of distraction).

Reflect on your experience of your mind. Describe what you notice about your mind on a typical day (for example, does it hop from topic to topic quickly? Does it frequently wander off daydreaming? Does it depend on different factors, like the time of day?). Then on a scale from 1-10, rate how conscious you are of your mind’s activity (1 being mostly unaware and 10 being extremely aware).

Now, reflect on the ratings you gave yourself for feeling physical sensations, emotional sensations, and being conscious of your mind. How self-aware are you? What, if any, areas of self-awareness do you feel need some improvement? (Remember, Goleman highly recommends practicing mindfulness meditation to improve all areas of attention, including self-awareness.)
