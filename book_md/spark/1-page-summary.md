## 1-Page Summary

In _Spark,_ John Ratey argues that exercise is not only good for the body, but it’s also good for the brain. Your brain is the dominant control center of your body, and its health directly affects, among other things, your mood, your attention, and your ability to learn. Ratey argues that your overall physical well-being is so intimately linked to brain function that maintaining it should be a top priority, and he hopes to convince us to make exercise a routine part of our lives.

Ratey is an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and derives his insights from observations of his own patients as well as from scientific discoveries that were revolutionizing neuroscience around the time of the book’s publication in 2008.

In _Spark_ , he shares the science behind what exercise does to our brains and what it means for our mental health. In our guide, we’ll discuss:

  * The evolutionary origins of the mind-body connection
  * What exercise does to optimize brain function and how this applies in specific cases
  * What the best form of exercise for brain health is and how to incorporate it into your life



Along the way, we’ll discuss how the theories of other experts align with or differ from Ratey’s ideas, and we’ll update the science where new insights have emerged in the years since the book’s release.

### Humans Are Built to Move: The Mind-Body Connection

**Ratey argues that our brains are optimized by exercise because of the way humans evolved**. When our ancestors ran down their prey in prehistory, their bodies and brains worked in concert. They not only had to sustain high levels of physical exertion, but they also had to read and respond to their environment quickly and accurately to survive. The brain and body, therefore, became well-conditioned to support each other in a virtuous circle.

Today, our brains still operate as our ancestors’ did. The same neurological systems they used to hunt and gather are the ones we use to program computers, and our minds still function best in a mode of persistent activity. However, in our modern era we no longer face the same challenges our ancestors did. We may not share our ancestors’ reasons for moving, but we do share their _need_ to move on a fundamental, biological level.

> **The Evolutionary Origins of the Brain According to the Adaptive-Capacity Model**
> 
> Ratey never outlines a complete theory of the evolutionary origins of the human brain. He instead only gives a brief sketch of our ancestors’ presumed lifestyles to draw a correlation between exercise and the brain. In the years since the publication of _Spark_ , a more complete theory of the causal link between exercise and brain function has emerged in neuroscience.
> 
> According to the _adaptive-capacity model_ (ACM) of the human brain, our brain adapted specifically to the complex foraging behavior of our ancestors. Searching for edible fruits, plants, fungi, and so on was cognitively demanding: It required complex physical coordination, decision-making skills, and memory. All this complicated behavior had to be done while running long distances, climbing, or otherwise being aerobically active. The evolving brain rose to the occasion by directing resources to areas of the brain that could support this behavior.
> 
> The ACM holds that if a brain is not using the complex structures it evolved to forage, it will adapt to these reduced demands and cut back on the resources it sends to those parts of the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Proponents of the ACM believe this explains why we see more cognitive decline in the brains of people who have a lower educational attainment, fewer social contacts, or live more sedentary lifestyles: These are aspects of a foraging lifestyle that would have impacted our ancestors’ survival, in addition to exercise.
> 
> The ACM thus offers a more complete account of the relationship between the brain and exercise than Ratey’s brief sketch of our ancestors’ lifestyle does, and it gives researchers a framework for studying how our present lifestyles affect our brains.

### Exercise Helps Us Learn

Ratey was inspired to study the connection between exercise and the brain after reading about Chicago’s Naperville public high school. Their novel fitness-first approach to gym class focused on getting students moving through regular exercise. A direct result of this improved fitness was significant gains in student performance. In a 1999 standardized test comparing Naperville students’ science and math knowledge with that of students from different countries, Naperville finished first in the world in science and sixth in math. **Ratey concluded that the school’s focus on physical health was in large part the reason for their academic success.**

> **Correlations Between Physical Activity and Academic Performance**
> 
> Ratey’s conclusion that Naperville’s gym class model improved academic performance is supported by recent evidence—indicating that Naperville wasn’t a fluke.
> 
> In the time since the publication of _Spark_ , national surveys by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have found significant correlations between physical activity and academic performance. A collection of ten intervention studies showed significant improvements in academic performance as well as other markers of healthy cognition like attention and focus. In addition, students who regularly participated in physical activity reported higher self-esteem and confidence in their intellectual capabilities, factors that can lead directly to stronger academic achievement.

On further research, Ratey found that exercise helps us learn in primarily two ways:

  * Exercise strengthens neurons
  * Exercise stimulates the growth of new neurons



#### Exercise Strengthens Neurons

The brain uses a network of specialized cells called _neurons_ to communicate across its various regions. Communication happens when electrical signals move along this network from one neuron to another, crossing the gaps (synapses) between the neurons by jumping from the signaling ends (axons) of one neuron to the receptors (dendrites) of another. Given this system, Ratey observes that **increasing the strength of the signal and the number of receivers on a neuron improves the neural network.**

In recent decades, researchers have identified how exercise improves the neural network: It stimulates the production of a protein called _brain-derived neurotrophic factor_ (BDNF),**** which increases the growth of dendrites on neurons and enhances the electrical voltage of the signal generated in the neuron. **This results in** **more neural connections and better neural communication**. In technical terms, this is called “synaptic plasticity.”

> **Other Ways to Increase BDNF**
> 
> Exercise has been proven to increase BDNF levels but it’s not the only influence on the protein. Experts note that several other factors also affect the amount of BDNF circulating in the body. A few of these factors stand out and should be considered alongside Ratey’s emphasis on exercise. Each of the following increases BDNF in the body:
> 
>   * Sun exposure (Accordingly, there are seasonal variations in BDNF levels.)
> 
>   * Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting
> 
>   * Certain diets, such as the Mediterranean diet and the keto diet
> 
>   * Dietary supplements high in omega-3 fatty acids (for example, fish oil)
> 
> 


#### Exercise Stimulates the Growth of New Neurons

Before the late 1990s, scientists didn’t believe the adult brain could produce new neurons—they thought neuron production (_neurogenesis_) was purely a phenomenon of a child’s growing brain. Discoveries since that time, however, have overturned this belief, confirming that new neurons are born in adulthood.

Most neurons created during adulthood, however, only survive for a short time. Their survival is determined by whether or not they fire (generate an electrical signal): If they don’t, they die.

Ratey explains that exercise has been shown to stimulate neurogenesis in the lab and**** suggests that the effects of BDNF on the neural network (increasing the number of dendrites and enhancing the electrical signal) enable those baby neurons to fire and survive. More BDNF, therefore, results in more functioning, stable neurons.

Furthermore, exercise also releases two other growth factors—vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)—that stimulate the process of cell division, which also powers neurogenesis.

> **Adult Human Neurogenesis Remains a Science Frontier**
> 
> At the time _Spark_ was published, the science on adult human neurogenesis was new—it was some of the “revolutionary new science” Ratey refers to in the subtitle. Ratey based his theories on this new science, but not all experts believe that adult human neurogenesis actually happens—it remains a debated topic in neuroscience.
> 
> In the early 20th century, neuroscientists concluded that neurons were only born in the brains of children—in a mature body, neurons could only decay and die, not be created. This view became the dominant belief in the understanding of the human brain.
> 
> In the middle of the century, evidence started to emerge showing adult neurogenesis in animals. Then, in 1998, an influential paper concluded that neurons are also generated in the human adult hippocampus. The researchers' findings were based on post-mortem samples of adult cancer patients.
> 
> However, because it’s difficult to examine the _living_ human brain for signs of neurogenesis, scientists have had difficulty getting definitive results. A recent review of the state of the science concluded that there’s insufficient evidence to support adult neurogenesis in humans. The reason for this hinges on the lack of safe, non-invasive technologies to support the research.
> 
> So, although promising evidence of adult neurogenesis is continually emerging (studies have found it continuing into “the 10th decade” of life), the field remains a frontier in science. Therefore it’s possible that the positive effects of exercise that Ratey observes aren’t explained by neurogenesis, but instead by another biological mechanism that Ratey doesn’t explore.

### Exercise Regulates Our Stress Response

In addition to helping us learn, Ratey believes exercise has a powerful role in controlling the brain’s stress response system. To help readers understand this, he first offers a clear definition of the term _stress_.

Ratey defines stress as **anything that initiates activity at the level of our cells**. By this definition, our environments present countless stressors. For example, when we move, we stress both our muscles and the brain cells involved in controlling that movement. When we eat vegetables such as eggplant, our cells activate as they work to process toxins the plant has created to protect itself. When we hear an unexpected noise, our brains initiate a stress response as they work to assess the source of the noise and whatever threat it might pose.

(Shortform note: Another biological understanding of stress is that it’s anything that threatens _homeostasis_. Homeostasis is a state in which the body’s physical systems are in balance. So anything that disrupts that maintenance is a stressor.)

Under this narrow, biological definition, stress is neither inherently good or bad; it’s a fundamental biological process. If the body can handle the effects of the stress—for example, if cells can clean up the waste produced by oxidative stress—then the stress won’t have negative effects at the cellular level. It’s when the body can’t keep up with the cellular effects of stress that it starts to feel negative effects. When that happens, we end up _feeling_ stressed, which Ratey explains is a psychological and emotional reaction to cellular stress events.

(Shortform note: Some experts take a different view of just how stress is neither good nor bad. Defining it as a _psychological challenge_ , they observe that people who seem to handle stress well are motivated by it—seeing it as an opportunity to rise to a challenge. By contrast, those who don’t handle stress well are demotivated by such a challenge. These experts suggest that _cognitive reframing_(thinking of the stressor differently) can help to make stress work for you.)

#### Two Kinds of Stress

Ratey points out that there are two different types of stress. Understanding the difference between the two enables us to understand how exercise works to control stress.

##### Acute Stress Can Be Good

Short-term stress is known as _acute_. It has a beginning and ending, and the cell is able to clean up the oxidative byproducts of burning the fuel it took to stay active. **Ratey points out that living systems, like our bodies,_need_ to be exposed to acute stress to become well-conditioned.** We can’t survive without it. Mild stress—whether through exposure to natural toxins in vegetables or challenges to our muscles—strengthens our bodies and minds.

> **Everyone Handles Acute Stress Differently**
> 
> Experts agree that acute stress can be beneficial for the body and brain, but in the case of cognition—tasks requiring figuring or thinking—acute stress can have different effects on different people.
> 
> A recent study found that subjects who were exposed to acute stress and then required to take a Stroop test (where, for example, the word “blue” is written in red ink and the subject is supposed to read the word aloud) were generally more accurate, but slower. The stress response in these people heightened brain activity in their executive control network (ECN), which is responsible for decision making. A significant portion of the test subjects, however, were faster, but less accurate. The stress response in these subjects actually decreased brain activity in the ECN.
> 
> This indicates that Ratey’s theories might not be accurate for every individual and that instead, acute stress might be more beneficial for some than for others.

##### Chronic Stress Is Bad

The second type of stress is long-term, and it’s harmful to your brain. This is known as _chronic stress_. When your body is engaged in a high-stress response, it releases chemicals in a targeted way and for a narrow purpose—survival. In this state, the hormonal and neurochemical equilibrium of your body is askew. **Too much time like this is damaging, as your cells never get the chance to recover.** Excess cortisol in the brain, for instance, corrodes neurons, causing numerous problems such as memory loss, trouble focusing, and learning difficulties.

(Shortform note: John Medina discusses this in _Brain Rules_ , noting that stress hormones released by chronic stress tend to especially damage the hippocampus, which is central to our ability to learn. At its most extreme, he notes, chronic stress can kill cells in the hippocampus, disrupt their neural connections, and disable the gene that creates new cells.)

#### How Exercise Helps With Stress

Given the risks associated with chronic stress, it’s important to understand how exercise can be used to limit our exposure to its negative effects.

##### Exercise Calms Our Mind and Body

As we saw earlier, exercise stimulates the release of proteins that grow and strengthen the neural network: BDNF, VEGF, and FGF-2. This reduces the likelihood that our brains will misperceive threats or lose control of the body’s stress-response system. Beyond this, Ratey argues, exercise counteracts the disempowering effect stress and fear has on your mind. As an activity you voluntarily pursue, it’s empowering, which reinforces a positive feedback loop that bolsters your resistance to the stressors of life.

> **Exercise Reduces Fear**
> 
> The physical and mental stress of exercise can serve as a dress rehearsal for more dangerous situations by conditioning the neural network and increasing your brain’s resilience to stress triggers. Evidence shows that the neural network shuts down in response to fear, redirecting resources away from the prefrontal cortex (responsible for executive function) toward the amygdala (responsible for reflexive threat response). Training for fearful situations can help mitigate this reaction by both strengthening the neural network and enabling your brain to reduce the chemical release of fear signals.
> 
> This is part of the reason soldiers prepare for real battle by being exposed to physically demanding and threatening training regimens. If your neural network is more connected, and you are less apt to feel afraid, your brain’s executive functions will continue to work in the face of potentially fearful situations. This will keep you from entering into a less-controlled reflexive response governed by the amygdala.

##### Exercise Is a Mild Stress

**Ratey contends that exercise, as a form of mild acute stress, is like an inoculant that builds resilience** , toning all the machinery of the brain and body and tamping down our trigger-happy stress response system**.** He points out that this effect is largely a consequence of the way our cells recover after exercise-induced stress—this is part of the activity and recovery process of the body’s stress response. In addition to this recovery mechanism, the broader effects of exercise on the brain condition us to handle stress better.

> **New Insights Into How Exercise Acts Like an Inoculant**
> 
> A recent study has added to our understanding of how exercise acts like an inoculant: Exercise increases the amount of galanin in the brain. Galanin is a neuropeptide that exists in animals of all kinds, and not having enough of it has been linked to heightened stress sensitivity and stress-related disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Knowing this, clinicians have tried to raise galanin levels in patients by using medications, but this doesn’t work in many cases.
> 
> The new study found that mice made to exercise had more galanin in their brains than those that didn’t exercise—and that those higher galanin levels made them more resistant to stressors they were later exposed to. This finding supports the use of exercise as a treatment for raising galanin levels and increasing stress resilience.

### Exercise Improves Our Mental Health

In this section, we’ll explore Ratey’s theories on how and why exercise benefits our mental health. We’ll first discuss neurotransmitters, which are largely responsible for psychiatric well-being, and then we’ll briefly touch on the various mental health conditions Ratey addresses, summarizing the main ways exercise helps. In each case, Ratey refers to the science and to stories from his clinical practice to make his point.

(Shortform note: Defining stress narrowly, in terms of cell biology, positions stress as a through-line in all the mental health concerns Ratey goes on to discuss. He isn’t as explicit about this as he could be, but bear in mind that each condition has some form of stress as a component—whether it’s a cause, a symptom, or some combination of the two. Accordingly, the way exercise combats the negative effects of stress generally applies to the other concerns he explores, such as anxiety, depression, and so on.)

#### Exercise Balances Neurotransmitters in the Brain

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that regulate the signals passing along the brain’s neural network.**When there's an imbalance of neurotransmitters we can experience difficulties such as anxiety, depression, scattered focus, memory loss, and more**. Too much _glutamate_ , for instance, leads to a signal overload that can cause excitotoxic stress. Too little _gamma-aminobutyric acid_ (GABA) undercuts your brain’s ability to stop the signals.

The functioning of these two neurotransmitters is further regulated by three other neurotransmitters you may have heard of: _serotonin_ , _norepinephrine_ , and _dopamine_. The messages that end up getting transmitted throughout the brain are largely regulated by these three chemicals. There’s overlap between their functions, but:

  * Serotonin is largely responsible for signals having to do with mood. 
  * Norepinephrine influences attention and arousal. 
  * Dopamine works in the realm of motivation.



These are the three chemicals targeted by most psychiatric medications. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Lexapro, for example, are used to regulate the disruptive mood states associated with depression by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.

Ratey supports the use of such medications and is careful not to suggest that exercise should be relied on to the exclusion of drugs in particular cases. Such decisions are best made under the guidance of physicians familiar with the case. Nevertheless, **Ratey argues that exercise helps to bring all these chemicals into balance by stimulating the release of each of these neurotransmitters in optimal amounts for mental health.**

> **Exercise as Treatment**
> 
> A theme of Ratey’s approach to mental illness is that you can influence your mind by using your body—exercise, in this light, is a form of treatment. This diverges with another approach that has been dominant in the field since the 1980s—prescribing medications.
> 
> This practice emerged with the idea that common mental disorders were due to chemical imbalances in the brain. It was merely the latest in a series of ideas that prompted treatment strategies: In the era of eugenics (the belief that humans could be improved by selective breeding) poor mental health was seen as a product of genetically inferior brain anatomy—lobotomies (removing parts of the brain) and forced sterilization (to weed out “bad genes” from the human gene pool) were preferred treatments.
> 
> Later, in the Freudian era, psychologists believed that thoughts and behaviors came from the subconscious mind, and psychoanalysis became the preferred treatment
> 
> The more recent pharmaceutical approach to treatment seeks to restore chemical balance in the brain, but even that approach has proven to be an incomplete treatment for most mental health issues. Some experts are even convinced that the rise of psychiatric medications has contributed to the prevalence of mental health illness today. They cite evidence indicating that the use of psychiatric drugs leads to chronic psychiatric disorders with more severe symptoms for many patients.
> 
> Using exercise as a treatment in the way Ratey describes seems to have none of these adverse effects, and, increasingly other clinicians also advocate using it this way.

#### Anxiety

Anxiety is a component of your brain’s stress-response system; it’s a natural response to legitimate threats. When it becomes overly heightened, turning into an undue fear response to misperceived threats, it becomes a disorder. **According to Ratey, exercise alleviates both the symptoms and the state of anxiety by calming our bodies, increasing our sense of autonomy, and retraining our brains to better regulate and reduce fear signals.**

> **Exercise Improves Anxiety Complications of Covid-19**
> 
> Research has shown that the Covid-19 virus causes physiological changes in the brain that induce anxiety. A recent study has found that physical exercise directly counters this anxiety, and in an unexplained way—it replicates some of the mechanisms by which the virus heightens anxiety, but in doing so, it _lowers_ anxiety.
> 
> The virus increases anxiety by attaching itself to a particular enzyme, causing that enzyme to be released in greater amounts. This leads to inflammation, the death of neurons, and heightened anxiety signals in the brains of those infected.
> 
> Exercise also causes this enzyme to be released, but the result is the opposite of the virus’s—a general improvement in mental health and _less_ anxiety. The exact reason the outcome is so different when exercise increases this enzyme as opposed to when the virus increases it hasn’t been definitively determined. Regardless, it demonstrates another biological link between exercise and the control of anxiety.

#### Depression

Ratey argues that depression should be thought of as a breakdown in neural communication. In the depressed brain, the neural network breaks down, disconnecting brain regions from one another. This causes critical parts of the brain to atrophy. A lack of neurotransmitters compounds this state leaving the brain unable to kickstart its attention and motivation tools. **The effects of exercise can break this vicious circle by rebuilding neural connections, restoring healthy brain chemistry, powering neurogenesis, and nurturing a sense of hope.**

> **The Current View of Depression**
> 
> Ratey’s view of depression as a breakdown in neural communication fits with the current consensus about the condition. However, psychologists haven’t always seen depression this way.
> 
> It was once thought that depression was primarily caused by a lack of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. This is part of the picture, but the current understanding is broader: It’s now understood that stress hormones degrade the neural network and atrophy the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the depressed brain. These parts of the brain are responsible for threat detection and cognitive control, respectively. The result is that the depressed brain has a diminished capacity to respond, make choices, and learn, among other things.

#### Addiction

Addiction co-opts our attention resources by making the brain focus exclusively on the object of addiction. For the drug addict, for instance, an overload of dopamine in the brain—triggered by the drug of choice—tricks the brain into attending only to that trigger as if it’s a matter of life or death. **Exercise breaks this fixation by retraining the brain’s motivation system—weaning it off an unnatural dopamine fix in favor of a balance of healthy neurochemicals.**

(Shortform note: Substance abuse and addiction are common markers of trauma. Bessel van der Kolk discusses the unique nature of traumatic memories in _The Body Keeps the Score_. Such memories alter the makeup of the brain itself and often leave the victim feeling fearful and powerless. A key aspect of Ratey’s insights on exercise and addiction is that exercise can give us a sense of accomplishment that helps to overcome this powerless feeling.)

#### ADHD

Ratey argues that people with ADHD have functional but poorly regulated attention systems in the brain. This is caused by low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the ADHD brain, which undermine its ability to prioritize among distractions, sustain motivation, and combat impulses. **Exercise causes brain cells to secrete these key neurotransmitters, builds coordination between the brain’s attention resources, and conditions the systems that support continued attention regulation.** In particular, exercises requiring some structure, risk, or coordination (for example, martial arts) seem to be especially effective in harnessing the attention resources of the ADHD brain.

> **Ratey’s View of ADHD**
> 
> Ratey has done a lot of work in the field of ADHD, and his 1994 book, _Driven to Distraction_ , co-authored with Edward Hallowell, is often touted as a valuable resource for those dealing with ADHD. Their approach sought to overturn misconceptions about the condition, such as the notion that it only occurred in children or that it was a consequence of laziness or too much sugar. Hallowell and Ratey instead saw ADHD in neurological terms and offered insights into how adults and children with ADHD might manage their distractibility and lean into the strengths of their brain function. His advice here on exercise and ADHD is informed by this history.

### Two Special Cases: Aging and Women’s Issues

We’ve seen how exercise helps us learn, regulate stress, and maintain mental health. Two significant consequences of this that Ratey discusses are that exercise protects the aging brain and helps regulate the unique hormonal fluctuations women face over the course of their lives.

##### Getting Old

For all of us, Ratey contends that the toll a lifetime of stress takes on the brain becomes hard to escape. Characteristic features of aging, such as cognitive decline, depression, and dementia, are at least partially caused by the body’s cells being worn down by the stressors of life.

**Ratey argues that as your body becomes equipped to handle stress through exercise, it becomes better able to preserve its resources against the negative effects of aging.** For example, as neurons wear out in the brain, the neural network thins—exercise counteracts this loss by supporting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.

(Shortform note: Researchers have recently found that exercise has a neuroprotective role in staving off cell degeneration caused especially by aging, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. They advise that exercise should be used as an add-on therapy, together with other forms of treatment, to generate the most benefits.)

##### Women

Women face unique stressors related to menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. The hormone fluctuations that attend each of these can lead to anxiety, depression, and attention issues, among other things. During pregnancy, maternal stress can have severe impacts on the fetus.

(Shortform note: A recent analysis found a strong correlation between exercise and the reduction of estrogen. High levels of estrogen have been linked to breast cancer. Subjects who exercised—especially at higher intensities—showed a modest reduction in the total levels of one form of estrogen.)

**Ratey contends that exercise has a powerfully stabilizing effect in the midst of all the hormonal fluctuations women face in life.** Strikingly, he notes that some data suggest it’s even capable of reversing some of the negative effects fetal alcohol syndrome has on the baby.

(Shortform note: Since the publication of _Spark_ , researchers have continued to examine the impact of exercise on children with executive-function disorders, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FASD). The analysis found that children with FASD who exercised showed major gains in the areas of working memory and response inhibition, and they were also significant for attention. Another noteworthy finding of the analysis is that exercise-induced gains were higher for children with FASD and autism-spectrum disorders than they were for children with ADHD.) __

### Building a Routine and Making It Stick

We’ve seen numerous ways exercise supports brain health and contributes to our overall well-being—whether we’re facing anxiety, addiction, depression, or simply the desire to grow and learn, exercise helps.

In this final section of the guide we’ll look at the recommendations Ratey offers for building exercise into our life routines.

We’ll see:

  * What form of exercise is best for reaping the benefits Ratey explores
  * What your maximum heart rate is and how to use it to determine your most effective workout
  * Some ideas for incorporating exercise into your daily routine



#### Aerobic Exercise Is Best

Ratey argues that not all forms of exercise are equally effective for optimizing brain function. Studies show that aerobic exercise is best. This isn’t to say that other forms of exercise aren’t beneficial, it’s just that **aerobic exercise is currently understood to be optimal for tapping into the benefits we’ve explored.**

(Shortform note: Researchers have demonstrated that both endurance exercise (e.g. running) and resistance exercise (e.g. weight lifting) increased the release of factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor. These proteins are critical for strengthening the neural network and reversing cell deterioration. This more up-to-date information suggests that resistance exercise should be included in your exercise routines.)

The benefits of exercise are distributed among three zones of intensity—the more powerful the workout, the more powerful the body’s response. We’ll take a look at how you can determine the intensity of your workout in the following subsection on heart rate.

  * **Low-intensity** exercises are the baseline. At this level, your body begins releasing the neurotransmitters and factors we’ve discussed, and your body starts improving its metabolic function by burning fat. This helps to restore, maintain, and improve your brain’s function, setting the groundwork for more intense exercise. 
  * **Medium-intensity** exercise ramps up these processes and initiates more. At this intensity level, your body is exposed to a good amount of useful stress—the kind that builds resilience in your brain’s systems. New blood vessels are built, the process of neurogenesis is encouraged, your body’s stress response is conditioned and relaxed, and endocannabinoids are released. 
  * **High-intensity** workouts are powerful and must be handled with care. At this level, your body can reach a point where it becomes oxygen-deprived and your metabolism enters an anaerobic state. You feel this as _muscle burn_. Too much time in this state can be damaging for the body, but in moderate doses, it can be extremely beneficial. Accordingly, when you’re in the middle of a high-intensity workout, it’s best to stay just below this point most of the time and occasionally pass it.



(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins suggests that you build a routine of exercise first on moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for a period of two to eight months. Laying the groundwork here, he suggests, will prepare you for engaging in more high-intensity anaerobic exercise.)

A reliable description of the sweet spot for a high-intensity workout is when the exercise feels “somewhat hard.” In addition to all the other effects we’ve discussed, during such a workout the body begins releasing human growth hormone (HGH), which burns fat, increases muscle growth, and grows your brain.

> **Human Growth Hormone Isn’t Always Good**
> 
> Ratey doesn’t note the fact that human growth hormone (HGH or GH) is damaging to the body in high amounts. This isn’t a relevant risk for most people who get their HGH via exercise, but HGH is also prescribed as a pharmaceutical to reverse muscle loss, reduce fat, strengthen bones, and provide energy.
> 
> In most cases, a legitimate doctor’s prescription is judicious and directly effective for treating symptoms of a disease. However, the illicit use of HGH—often sought as a “fountain of youth” drug (a phrase Ratey refers to)—can have serious negative consequences, including heart disease, diabetes, and a shorter life span.

Ratey is careful to remind his readers that doing something is better than doing nothing. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t reach or maintain a high-intensity workout yet. As we’ve seen all along the way, the brain is optimized for movement, so the key is to move.

> **World Health Organization Guidelines on Physical Activity**
> 
> The World Health Organization (WHO) echoes Ratey’s sentiment that doing something is better than doing nothing. According to the WHO, a lack of physical activity is a leading contributor to global mortality: They estimate that, as of 2016, nearly a third of all adults and four-fifths of adolescents were not active enough. Physical inactivity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, in addition to shortening lifespan.
> 
> The WHO recommends that adults aged 18 to 64 should get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate physical activity during the week. Children and adolescents should get at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity.

#### Determining Your Heart Rate

Because individual fitness levels vary, an exercise that’s intense for one person won’t be intense for another. You can determine the intensity of your workout by measuring your heart rate—the faster your heart is beating, the harder you’re working.

The first step is determining your maximum heart rate—the hardest your heart can work. This varies according to your age and overall health, but Ratey shares a rule of thumb for calculating it: Subtract your current age from 220. The intensity of your exercise is determined as a percentage of that maximum rate. The higher the percentage, the more intense the workout. This is simply calculated by multiplying your maximum heart rate by a decimal equivalent to the percentage you’re looking to achieve.

Let’s look at walking, jogging, and running as templates for intensity. Keep in mind that other forms of aerobic exercise can put your heart rate into these different zones (for example, jumping rope or cycling).

  * Walking should put your heart rate between 55% and 65% of your maximum. This is considered _low intensity_. 
  * Jogging is 65% to 75%. This is _medium intensity_. 
  * Running is 75% to 90%. This is _high intensity_. 



> **Monitoring Your Heart Rate With a Smartwatch**
> 
> In _Spark_ , Ratey encourages his readers to buy and use a heart rate monitor to track the intensity of their exercise. In general, these consist of a chest band sensor and a digital receiver of some kind (for example, a watch) that displays a reading.
> 
> In the time since _Spark_ was published, new technologies have made monitoring your heart rate even easier. Smartwatches are now typically equipped with heart rate monitors that are generally accurate for tracking your heart rate during exercise. Current readers of the book will likely be inclined to use a smartwatch. While this is generally fine, it’s important to be aware of caveats about their use in order to get the best information possible.
> 
> Some experts have pointed out some of the shortcomings of the general smartwatch’s ability to give accurate data about your heart rate. They note that the typical sensors used in smartwatches have a higher error rate when used on darker skin or by those with a higher body mass index and their position on the wrist can lead to inaccurate readings. Bearing these facts in mind, with a little care and cross-checking, smartwatches can be helpful for ensuring your exercise is at the right intensity.

#### Making Exercise Stick

Determining the best way to get exercise into your life is a personal decision. With that said, there are several tips Ratey suggests throughout _Spark_ that may help augment its effectiveness and make it stick.

**Do something you enjoy.**

This may sound simple, but if you enjoy riding a bike and despise running, then ride a bike. The more you enjoy it, the more likely you are to do it.

**Try new things.**

Variety can keep it interesting, and interest can go a long way toward keeping you at it. So go ahead and learn a new skill or try a new routine. You may discover other forms of exercise you like.

**Do it with others.**

Humans aren’t only built for movement, they’re also built for social interaction. Exercising with others encourages accountability and magnifies the neurochemical effects of the workout–and it can make it more fun.

> **Exercise Isn’t for Everyone**
> 
> These first three recommendations are mainly designed to help you enjoy exercise, which some experts have identified as a crucial factor in how beneficial exercise might be.
> 
> Neuroscientist Elizabeth Gould believes this. She has played an instrumental role in researching adult neurogenesis and is responsible for some key discoveries in the field.
> 
> For instance, she has found that rewarding experiences affect neurogenesis and cell survival: Activities such as mating and running enhance neurogenesis in rats, and stressful experiences reduce it. While rats enjoy running, many humans don’t. As she sees it, if exercise isn’t a rewarding experience for some people it may not confer neurological benefits to them.
> 
> Scientists have found that some people are genetically predisposed to enjoy exercise and others are not—a significant implication of this is that some people may have a hard time reaping the neurological benefits of exercise.
> 
> Thus, while there’s ample evidence to suggest that exercise is beneficial for the brain, it’s not clear that those findings are complete—a person's enjoyment of exercise, either because of genetics or because of recommendations like these above, might affect how beneficial it is, and mean that not everyone may reap the psychological benefits Ratey discusses.

**Keep at it.**

Sometimes the best way to stick to a routine is to simply remind yourself that you can’t afford not to. When it comes to your mind and exercising, just remember that your body was built to move—it _needs_ to move. So, whatever you do, keep it up. Don’t berate yourself if you miss a day or two, just get back to it as soon as you can.

(Shortform note: Some experts offer other tips for sticking to an exercise routine that can help you keep at it even when you don’t want to. For instance, they recommend that you set small goals for yourself, make charts of your progress, and give yourself meaningful rewards for achieving your goals.)
