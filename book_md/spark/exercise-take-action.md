## Exercise: Take Action

At this point, we’ve seen numerous reasons to incorporate regular exercise into our lives. If you are like most other people and struggle to exercise regularly, let’s take a moment to consider how you can take action.

* * *

Think of an aspect of your mental life that you think could benefit from the effects of exercise on the brain. Do you struggle with depression, stress, lack of focus, or anxiety, for instance? Write about your most recent memories of a time when such a state of mind impacted your daily life.

Consider how exercise might have had a positive effect on that state of mind. Do you think you might have been more at peace, more focused, more connected with those around you after a half-hour jog? In the space below, imagine when or how you could have exercised that day. What would you have done, and when would you have done it?

Now, make a plan. In your calendar or journal, for instance, plan three exercise sessions on three separate days for this week. Take care to make sure they are at a time of day when you can actually do it. Write those three days and times below, and write what kind of exercise you plan to do. Be specific.

Finally, write the names of three people who may be able to be an accountability partner for you. Text or email at least one of them the plan. See if one is willing/able to join you.
