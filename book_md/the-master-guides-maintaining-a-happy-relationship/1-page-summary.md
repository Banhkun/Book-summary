## 1-Page Summary

What’s the secret to a happy long-term relationship? If you’re regularly fighting with your partner or just feeling a little bored, staying happy may seem easier said than done. But maintaining a happy romantic relationship isn’t as difficult as it can seem—as long as you’re armed with the right knowledge.

In this Master Guide, we’ll draw from the work of 11 relationship experts to lay out the secrets to maintaining a happy romantic relationship. First, we’ll discuss the importance of understanding your needs and your partner’s. Then, we’ll share the experts’ tips for sustaining both emotional and physical intimacy. Finally, we’ll discuss why conflict can ruin your relationship—and how to handle conflict effectively so that it doesn’t.

### Understand Your Needs and Your Partner’s

One essential element of maintaining a happy relationship is to understand both your needs and your partner’s. Specifically, relationship experts recommend understanding your attachment styles and your love languages.

#### Understand Your Attachment Styles

In _Attached_ , psychiatrist Amir Levine and psychologist Rachel Heller contend that **the best way to create a relationship that fulfills your emotional needs is to understand both your own and your partner’s attachment styles** —the beliefs and behaviors that determine how you function in intimate relationships. If you know your _own_ attachment style, you’ll better understand what you need in a romantic relationship. If you can decipher _your partner’s_ attachment style, you’ll understand what lies at the root of your conflicts—and how you can resolve them.

There are three main attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant.

  * **Secure attachers** are nurturing, responsive, and comfortable with intimacy. 
  * **Anxious attachers** are preoccupied with making their relationship solid and constantly seek reassurance from their partner. 
  * **Avoidant attachers** are more distant and see intimacy as a threat to their independence.



(Anxious and avoidant attachers are collectively known as insecure attachers.)

**If you’re a secure attacher, your major relationship goal is tomaintain your secure attachment style.** Levine and Heller explain that as a secure attacher, you’re good at recognizing cues that indicate compatibility, so you tend not to get trapped in negative relationships. But since you tend to forgive easily, you may let negative behaviors repeatedly slide and stay in a relationship longer than you should—which can shift your attachment style.

##### What Insecure Attachers Should Do

**If you’re an anxious attacher,accepting your romantic needs is critical to developing a happy relationship.** Levine and Heller explain that many anxious attachers try to ignore their needs for intimacy and reassurance because they’re ashamed of them. But if you don’t accept these needs, you won’t express them and give your partner the opportunity to fulfill them.

**If you’re an avoidant attacher,developing a happy relationship depends on recognizing and combating the techniques you use to maintain emotional distance from your partner. **

One strategy Levine and Heller recommend is to second-guess your negative thoughts about your partner: Is it _really_ a problem, or are you trying to push your partner away?

Similarly, in _How to Not Die Alone_ , dating coach Logan Ury recommends that insecure attachers **practice managing their knee-jerk reactions **in pursuit of happiness. Instead of panicking, anxious attachers should learn productive ways to soothe their nerves when their partners don’t provide immediate reassurance. Instead of withdrawing, avoidant attachers should learn to communicate when they want emotional distance.

#### Understand Your Love Languages

In _The 5 Love Languages, _Gary Chapman agrees that having an emotionally fulfilling relationship depends on understanding both your needs and your partner’s. However, rather than learning each other’s attachment styles, Chapman argues that you need to understand your love languages.

Chapman argues that the way you understand love depends on your _love language_ —the types of actions or behaviors that make you feel the most loved. But since there are five love languages, you may speak a different language than your partner. Communicating love through different languages is like trying to have a conversation in English with someone who only speaks Italian. So to help your partner feel loved, you must learn which language they speak.

According to Chapman, the five languages of love are: **Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.**

**Words of Affirmation** are words or phrases you say to your partner to make them feel good about who they are and what they do. These words can be compliments, words of encouragement, remarks that express kindness, or those that signify your faith in them.

**Quality Time** is time dedicated to being with your partner without distractions. A person with this language wants to simply be with their loved one. The activity is secondary to the act of being together. Time may mean engaging in meaningful conversation, participating in an activity that they like, even if you don’t, or having dinner together without watching TV or using electronic devices.

**Receiving Gifts** is when you interpret being given a gift as a symbol of love. A gift equates to thought, and to a person with this love language, that thought is felt as love. The type of gift is less important than the effort to procure it and the desire to give it.

**Acts of Service** are things done to make life easier for your partner. Whether you remove a burden from their life, help out, or provide space for them to do something, these acts of service will tell a partner with this language that they and their time are respected.

**Physical Touch** is intimate contact. Touches can be large or small and intimate or casual. The most important thing to learn about a partner who speaks this language is their specific preference for touch.

##### Tips for Identifying Someone’s Love Language

According to Chapman, you can identify your love language by reflecting on what makes you feel most loved, what makes you feel hurt or unloved, and how you treat your partner.

To identify your partner’s love language, self-help expert Jack Canfield offers three tips in _The Success Principles_ :

**1\. Listen to what they ask of you.** What people ask for can reveal the ways in which they prefer to be loved or appreciated. For example, if someone asks you for a hug, that might be an indication that their love language is Physical Touch.

**2.** **Watch how they behave with other people.** People tend to speak in their own love language, so observing how they treat others could reveal how they want to be treated. For example, if someone is quick to offer kind words or compliments to others, that could be a sign that their preferred love language is Words of Affirmation.

**3\. Note their complaints.** What people complain about can reveal how they feel underappreciated and how they’d prefer to be appreciated instead. For example, if someone shares that they felt disappointed when their spouse didn’t bring them a gift from a work trip, it may indicate their love language is Receiving Gifts.

**You can tell you’ve identified someone’s love language when they respond favorably to what you did**. But figuring it out can take time. For example, someone’s love language might be Acts of Service, but they may prefer someone cooking them a meal rather than cleaning their house. Be persistent in asking questions, and keep trying until you get it right.

### Maintain Emotional Intimacy

Relationship experts contend that another key to maintaining a happy romantic relationship is to sustain emotional intimacy. Specifically, they suggest that you **regularly connect with each other and let each other and your relationship evolve**.

#### Connect With Your Partner

In _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ , relationship researcher John Gottman and coauthor Nan Silver highlight the importance of connecting regularly with your partner so that you can maintain your connection long term. They explain that happy couples regularly respond to each other’s bids, or overtures for connection. Sometimes, these overtures are obvious, like if your partner asks you to pick up groceries on your way home. Other times, these overtures are subtler—and they may even _seem_ like a complaint. For example, if your spouse huffs that you never want to go out after work, this is _actually_ a request for you to invite her out after work.

Gottman and Silver explain that regularly responding to these overtures improves your marital happiness by building up positive sentiment between the two of you—which allows you to weather life’s inevitable challenges.

To improve how often you respond to your partner’s overtures, Gottman and Silver suggest that you **intentionally reconnect each evening**. Take turns sharing the highs and lows of your days. Put your phones aside so you can stay focused on each other during the conversation, and always back your spouse—even if you suspect they’re in the wrong. Remember that the point of this conversation is to _connect_ with your spouse and to help both of you defuse any externally caused stress (like troubles at work). You can’t do either if you attack your spouse’s choices (although you can express your concerns at another time).

#### Let Each Other Evolve

In _Eight Dates_ , Gottman, his wife—fellow relationship researcher Julie Schwartz Gottman—and married couple Doug Abrams and Rachel Carlton Abrams also highlight the importance of connecting regularly with your partner. The authors explain that **relationships last when both people support the evolution and growth of their partner** , as individuals and as a couple. So to support each other’s growth, you and your partner need to set aside time to continue learning about each other through intentional conversation and open-ended questions.

But rather than recommend that you reconnect each evening, the authors advocate for the power of a weekly date night. They define a date as a designated time that you get together with your partner to connect, talk, and learn more about one another (watching Netflix on the couch together doesn’t count). Moreover, they outline several specific topics you should discuss on these dates to lay a positive foundation for your relationship—such as what you like to do for fun and how you view your finances.

#### Let the Relationship Evolve

While the authors of _Eight Dates_ highlight the importance of letting _each other_ evolve, _How to Not Die Alone_ author __ Logan __ Ury emphasizes the importance of **building a relationship that can grow with you**. She explains that most people recognize that they’ve changed a lot in the past, but they don’t expect to change a lot in the future. But in reality, you (and your partner) will probably change just as much in the future as you did in the past. Therefore, it’s critical to ensure that your relationship evolves, too.

To ensure that your relationship adapts to your changing needs as the years go by, Ury recommends that you **write a relationship agreement** , or a “contract.” In this agreement, articulate your relationship values and how you’ll express them. Revisit this agreement regularly at intervals that work for you—whether that’s yearly or biannually—to review and update it as needed. By doing so, you’ll deal with potential issues early instead of letting them fester and damage your relationship long term.

### Maintain Physical Intimacy

In addition to maintaining emotional intimacy over time, maintaining physical intimacy is a key aspect of maintaining a happy relationship. To do so, relationship experts recommend that you communicate about sex. However, their recommendations for _how_ to communicate about sex differ.

#### Talk About Sex

The authors of _Eight Dates_ argue that **a healthy sex life depends on honest conversation**. Sex and intimacy are particularly sensitive topics for most people, which is why a lot of couples don’t talk regularly about their sex life or sexual desires. However, research suggests that couples that talk regularly about sex have better sex more often.

The authors offer a few tips for talking about sex with your partner. First, make sure you’re _not_ doing it right before, during, or after sex. **Since it’s a delicate topic, bringing it up in the moment is a recipe for disaster**. Second, don’t underestimate the power of humor. Sex doesn’t have to be serious, so don’t be afraid to bring some lightness to the conversation.

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What do you like?
  * When and how do you like to initiate sex?
  * What can I do to improve our sex life? 



#### Try Non-Verbal Communication

In _Mating in Captivity, _couples therapist Esther Perel suggests that talking about sex isn’t always the right choice. Perel explains that****in modern times, talking has become the default language for intimacy**.** This is due to the female influence on modern relationships. As women became more economically independent, they wanted more from their relationships than being financially provided for—they wanted emotional connection too. And because women are socialized to be good at verbal communication, they build (and expect men to build) intimacy by talking.

Men, however, have been socialized to take a more physical approach when expressing themselves. They’re often more comfortable developing intimacy through non-verbal communication, for example, through touch or sex.

So if you communicate verbally and your partner communicates non-verbally, or vice versa, first acknowledge that there’s more than one way to create intimacy. Then, try learning to speak each other’s languages in a non-sexual context to begin with. For example, you can practice non-sexual, non-verbal communication by playing games like leading each other around the room, doing trust falls, and mirroring each other’s movements.

### Handle Conflict Effectively

No matter how well you maintain emotional and physical intimacy, you—like every couple—will inevitably face conflict. But you can still have a happy relationship despite these conflicts, as long as you learn to manage them effectively. Specifically, relationship experts recommend that you learn to **recognize damaging patterns so that you can avoid them and learn to fight in a healthy manner**.

#### Recognize Damaging Patterns

In _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ , Gottman and Silver explain that **conflicts can destroy relationships if they induce regular flooding** —a psychological phenomenon in which one partner feels so emotionally stressed that they’re unable to respond rationally to their spouse. The authors name four damaging patterns of behavior—the “four horsemen of the apocalypse”—that you should watch out for because they may heighten the risk of flooding, which leads spouses to emotionally detach from one another.

**1\. Criticism**. One person expresses dissatisfaction with their partner _generally_ instead of expressing dissatisfaction about a specific issue. For example, they say, “You’re a slob,” instead of “You didn’t clean the kitchen when you said you would.”

**2\. Contempt**. One person expresses dissatisfaction in a way that belittles their partner and signifies a lack of respect. For example, they might say, “I can’t believe you forgot to clean the kitchen. Are you stupid?”

**3\. Defensiveness**. One person, who feels attacked by their partner, tries to protect themselves. But this strategy backfires because it shifts responsibility onto the _other_ person. For example, the spouse who didn’t clean the kitchen might say, “I may have forgotten to clean the kitchen, but I cleaned the bathroom, which you never do.”

**4\. Stonewalling**. One person feels overwhelmed and stops responding. (This person is likely feeling flooded.)

##### How Anxious-Avoidant Pairs Struggle

In _Attached_ , Levine and Heller describe another damaging pattern of behavior that couples may fall into. A couple may get stuck in a cycle of conflict because their intimacy needs clash**.** If one partner is avoidant (generally uncomfortable with intimacy) and the other is anxious (highly desirous of intimacy), the anxious attacher always wants to be closer. The avoidant attacher will occasionally accept increased intimacy but soon grow uncomfortable and withdraw. The anxious attacher responds to this withdrawal by trying to reconnect—which repels the avoidant partner even more.

Levine and Heller note that while these partners may love each other, their **interactions tend to worsen over time because the couple's different needs expand into every corner of life.** For example**,** if Avoidant Annie is reluctant to marry because she wants to maintain her independence, that desire probably won’t disappear after the wedding—and may later manifest in a fight about whether to vacation together or separately. **Every aspect of their shared life becomes a point of contention** , and each partner’s happiness in the relationship deteriorates.

#### Fight Healthily

Now that you’re aware of the types of damaging conflict-related behavioral patterns you may fall into, how can you fight more effectively?

##### Reduce Flooding

As we’ve seen, Gottman and Silver warn against the four horsemen because they heighten the risk of flooding. However, there are things you can do during your argument to stop yourself and your partner from engaging in the four horsemen—and to mitigate their impact if one of you does.

First, the authors suggest that you **adjust the beginning**. If you _begin_ the conversation negatively, you’re more likely to induce a negative response (such as criticism, contempt, defensiveness, or stonewalling) from your partner—which increases the likelihood of flooding. Instead, begin the conversation calmly. First, describe your emotions about the issue. Avoid making accusatory statements that begin with “you,” generalizing the issue, or passing immediate judgment. Second, express your desires (not what you _don’t_ desire) to your partner.

For example, if you’re upset because your partner is on their phone during dinner, don’t say, “I can’t believe you’re on your phone! You never make time for me.” Instead, say, “I’m really upset that you’re on your phone during dinner. I’d like to spend time with you when we’re both focused solely on each other.”

Second, **calm down.** Gottman and Silver note that if you’re feeling flooded—which you may feel if you or your partner engages in one of the four horsemen—you likely won’t be able to have a productive discussion. So pay attention to your emotional and physical state: If you feel as though you're about to blow up on your partner or your heart rate rises dramatically, you’re likely flooded. If so, take a 20-minute break to calm yourself. Do something that prevents you from ruminating on your argument; Gottman and Silver suggest physical exercise or meditation.

Once you’ve calmed yourself, try **calming your partner**. Gottman and Silver explain that if you regularly calm your partner, your partner will connect your presence with a _reduction_ in stress rather than an _increase_ in stress, which will naturally improve your relationship. This does _not_ mean telling your partner to “calm down” mid-argument; this will only anger them further because they’ll feel as though you’re not taking them seriously. Instead, pick a time when you’re not fighting to brainstorm ways to relax each other. Then, after your 20-minute break, do the thing you’ve discussed; giving each other massages is a popular relaxation technique.

##### Fight Like a Secure Attacher

In _Attached_ , Levine and Heller suggest another strategy for fighting more effectively in relationships: Learn to fight like a secure attacher, who generally has a healthy and comfortable relationship with intimacy.

Levine and Heller explain that learning to fight like a secure attacher helps all couples because it teaches you how to clearly and effectively communicate your needs. However, it’s _especially_ helpful for anxious-avoidant pairs. This is because even if you’re an insecure attacher, you can gradually develop a more secure attachment style by repeatedly behaving like a secure person—and the more secure your attachment style, the less likely you are to fall into the damaging anxious-avoidant pattern we described earlier.

So how can you behave like a secure person during a fight? Levine and Heller name four strategies you can adopt to handle conflicts in a way that will bring you closer.

**1\. Show genuine concern for the other person’s feelings.** Remember that a disagreement between partners isn't a zero-sum game where one person wins and the other loses. Your happiness and your partner’s happiness are tied up together, so when both partners feel validated, both partners win.

**2\. Keep the argument centered on the present issue.** Don’t get sidetracked or expand the argument to include other issues. Avoid a full-blown venting session, and just address one conflict at a time.

**3\. Be willing to take part in the discussion.** Don’t disengage or withdraw.**** Both partners need to be willing to address the issue head-on so that it can be resolved in a mutually satisfactory way, even if it means some arguing along the way.

**4\. Openly communicate your needs and feelings _._** No matter how long you’ve been with your partner, you can’t expect them to be a mind reader. Tell them what you need and want clearly and directly.

##### Talk About How You Manage Conflict

Improving your ability to manage conflicts doesn’t just involve changing how you behave _during_ the fight. In _Eight Dates_ , the authors recommend that you have a date night dedicated to understanding how your partner manages disagreements and how you can manage disagreements more effectively as a couple. They explain that to resolve disagreements effectively, you must approach each one as an opportunity to increase your understanding of the other person—not as an opportunity to win.

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What did you learn about conflict or managing conflict growing up? How have you navigated conflict in the past?
  * What are your beliefs about anger? What do you need when you're feeling angry?
  * How would you like to manage conflict differently in the future?
