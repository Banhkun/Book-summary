## Exercise: Try Out the Theory of Circumstantial Morals

Zimbardo’s theory of circumstantial morals is very different from the way most of us judge the behavior of others. See what it’s like to intentionally apply this perspective to the people in your life.

* * *

Think back to the last time you resented someone for hurting you. What circumstantial factors could have influenced them to do you harm? (For example, if one of your co-workers ate your lunch out of the break room fridge, consider that anonymity and depersonalization may be making it easier for them to steal—no one knows they took the lunch (anonymity), and since they don’t know whose lunch it is, they’re not thinking about the person who owns it (depersonalization).)

What change could you make to create circumstances in which someone would be less likely to hurt you in that way again? (For example, you could combat depersonalization by writing your name on your lunch.)

How does it feel to try the theory of circumstantial morals? How has your attitude toward the person who hurt you changed (if at all)?
