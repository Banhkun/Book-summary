## Exercise: Practice Influential Communication

According to Charvet, knowing someone’s mental habits empowers you to influence their behavior. Practice this skill by preparing to influence someone you work with.

* * *

Think of someone from work who’s frustrating you with something they do on a regular basis. Describe what they’re doing and what you’d like them to do instead. For example, perhaps your boss requires you to attend ineffective daily meetings. You’d rather they give you more time to work independently instead.

Identify two or three mental habits you think that person has that are relevant to the given behavior. What have they done or said that makes you think they have those habits? For example, you may recognize that your boss is _reliable_ and a _team player_. You’ve never heard them question whether these meetings are necessary (reliable), and they frequently refer to the benefits of working together (team player).

In a few sentences, write down what you might say to them if you were trying to influence them using language that mirrors the mental habits you’ve identified. For example, you might say to your boss, “To play my part on this team as effectively as possible (team player) and repeat last quarter’s successes (reliable), I need more time to work alone. Would you mind if I start skipping our daily meetings?”
