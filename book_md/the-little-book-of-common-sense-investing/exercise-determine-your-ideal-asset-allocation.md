## Exercise: Determine Your Ideal Asset Allocation

Bogle argues that your ideal asset allocation between stocks and bonds depends on two factors: your financial position and your degree of risk aversion. In this exercise, evaluate these two factors to determine your ideal portfolio.

* * *

Which financial liabilities do you have looming in the future (for example, mortgages or retirement costs)? Write down these liabilities and their specific costs.

To determine your risk aversion, imagine that the stock market dipped and your portfolio just dropped $1,000. Describe your initial reaction to this loss—for example, are you inclined to withdraw your funds to prevent further losses? Or are you unphased by this short-term loss?

In light of your previous answers, what do you think your portfolio’s ideal ratio of stock to bonds is (Bogle recommends anywhere from 80-20 for young investors with low risk aversion to 25-75 for mid- to late-life investors who value stability)? Why do you think this ratio is ideal?
