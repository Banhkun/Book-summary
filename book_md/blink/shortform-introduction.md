## Shortform Introduction

Throughout our lives, we’ve been taught that our decisions are sounder if a lot of time and effort have gone into making them. In _Blink_(2005)_,_Malcolm Gladwell questions this assumption, asking: **How do our snap judgments compare to our rational, well-thought-out decisions?** He argues that our snap judgments are often just as good as our deliberate decisions.

### About the Author

A _New Yorker_ staff writer, Gladwell has made his name writing books that make social science research accessible and digestible to the layperson. He’s garnered praise for both his lucid, enthusiastic presentation of cutting-edge research and the novel connections he makes across a wide range of fields. His books include _The Tipping Point _(2000), _Outliers _(2008), _David and Goliath_ (2013), and _Talking to Strangers_ (2019).

Some have critiqued Gladwell’s work for oversimplifying complex concepts, relying too heavily on anecdotes rather than research, and generally lacking academic rigor. Such an “impressionistic take on the scientific method” has earned him the moniker “America’s Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer.” But, as Gladwell has said in multiple interviews, he is primarily a journalist and a storyteller, and he’s unabashed about his desire to write at the intersection of good stories and interesting research.

Whether you love him or hate him, you can’t ignore Gladwell: His reach is extraordinary—his books, the first five of which were _New York Times_ best sellers, have sold millions of copies in dozens of countries, and he’s popularized now-well-known concepts such as the “broken windows theory” (in _The Tipping Point_) and the “10,000-hour rule” (in _Outliers_). If you’re familiar with the Pareto principle, the “stickiness factor,” or the “talent myth,” chances are good you have Gladwell to thank.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Gladwell’s personal experience with racial stereotyping prompted him to research and write _Blink._ When Gladwell, who is half-Jamaican, let his hair grow, he noticed that police and security guards began to treat him differently. He was issued more speeding tickets and targeted by the police as a potential rapist. This led him to think more carefully about the far-reaching effects of snap judgments.

#### Intellectual Context

_Blink_ was Gladwell’s second book. It followed his bestseller _The Tipping Point _(2000)_,_ in which he debuted his signature anecdotal style in book-length format. (He had already been producing similar stories for _The New Yorker_ for several years.) _The Tipping Point_ examined the science of epidemics and translated this into a study of social epidemics and “viral” trends, helping to push these concepts into the mainstream.

As we might expect from “the 21st century’s defining zeitgeist surfer,” his choice of topic for _Blink_ was similarly ahead of the curve._Blink_ was one of the first in a wave of pop psychology books that aimed to explain the workings of the human brain to a general readership. It followed cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker’s _How the Mind Works _(1997) and _The Blank Slate _(2002)

and psychologist David Myers’s _Intuition: Its Powers and Perils_ , which covers much of the same ground in a more rigorous but less absorbing way. _Blink_ was followed by Dan Ariely’s _Predictably Irrational _(2009), Richard Thaler’s _Nudge_ (2009), and Daniel Kahneman’s _Thinking, Fast and Slow _(2011).

#### The Book’s Impact

Among other honors, _Blink_ was one of _Fast Company_ ’s best business books of 2005, and it spent over a year on various bestseller lists.

The book’s light, anecdotal style helped it to find a wide audience. For many readers, it provided an accessible entry point into cognitive science, reinvigorating the pop psychology genre and igniting public interest in the inner workings of the mind.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Most reviewers of _Blink_ praised its stylistic elements __ while expressing some reservations about its rigor and overall structure. _Time_ reviewer Lev Grossman, for example, praised the intellectual clarity that Gladwell brought to Blink and likened him to “an omniscient, many-armed Hindu god of anecdotes,” while at the same time questioning the basis for some of Gladwell’s claims. Similarly, _Kirkus Reviews _commended the anecdotal style but went on to say that the narratives “don’t add up to anything terribly profound.” Reviewer David Brooks wrote in The New York Times __ that the snap judgment part of his brain had been engaged and impressed by _Blink_ , while the more analytical part was left unsatisfied.

_Blink_ sparked a number of memorably titled reviews and responses, including _Blinkered_ (in which reviewer Richard Posner described _Blink_ as “written like a book intended for people who do not read books”), _Blink and You Miss It: The Meaninglessness of Malcolm Gladwell_ , and the conservative rejoinder _Think! Why Crucial Decisions Can’t Be Made in the Blink of an Eye_.

#### The Book’s Approach

_Blink_ is highly anecdote-driven. The individual narratives have strong internal momentum, but the whole book doesn’t read as much more than the sum of its parts. Gladwell himself, looking back on the book __ three years later, acknowledged that his general approach at the time had been “This is a lot of cool stuff! Do with it as you will!”

Gladwell tends to present his articles and books as mere “conversation starters,” encouraging interested readers to find and read the original academic work and expand their intellectual horizons from there.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we flesh out Gladwell’s arguments by adding scientific discoveries about the phenomena he covers. We also review more recent research, pointing out where it supports Gladwell’s ideas and where it throws them into question.

Gladwell’s style is anecdote-heavy and can be meandering. In this guide, we’ve focused on his main principles, retaining and discussing a few important examples. We’ve also updated the research and provided alternative explanations for some of the scenarios he presents.
