## Exercise: Confront Your Ingrained Biases

Acknowledging your biases is difficult and uncomfortable. It’s also crucial to improving your snap judgments and aligning your unconscious attitudes with your conscious ones. Reflect on your experiences and how they may have influenced your biases.

* * *

Try not to think too much about your answers to the following questions. Capture your gut reactions: When you read the word “leader,” who do you picture? What about “lawyer”? “Parent”? “CEO”?

Take a look at your “pictures.” Do they tell you anything about your inherent biases? Do your pictures follow historical gender norms? Do the people in your gut-reaction images share your skin color?

Think about your hometown and the schools you attended. Think about your childhood friendship groups. Did the people you spent the most time with look like you? Did they share your culture? Your religious beliefs? Your values? Jot down a few of the shared beliefs and cultural attitudes of your community, schools, or friendship groups.

How might your community and past experiences have influenced your unconscious beliefs about who can be a leader, lawyer, parent, or CEO?

What conscious steps can you take to counter these biases? (Remember, you can change your experiences to change your unconscious beliefs.)
