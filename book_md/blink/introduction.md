## Introduction: The Power of Snap Judgments

We usually think of snap judgments as lazy, superficial, and probably wrong. But are they really? Gladwell argues that snap judgments can be just as good as—or even better than—the decisions that we make by analyzing a situation carefully.

According to Gladwell, **both logical, conscious decision-making and snap judgments have their time and place.** Our brain uses **two broad strategies for making decisions:**

#### Strategy #1: Conscious Thinking

This thinking is also known as rational decision-making. When we think consciously, we use past experiences and current information to make a decision logically.

#### Strategy #2: Unconscious Thinking

This thinking is also known as the **adaptive unconscious, intuition,** or making **snap judgments**. When we think unconsciously, we make decisions without understanding why, or sometimes even without realizing we’ve made them.

Gladwell says that **we use these two different thinking strategies in different situations.**

> **Kahneman’s Two Systems of Thinking**
> 
> Another way to think about these two thinking strategies is as two “systems,” as Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman does in his bestseller _Thinking, Fast and Slow _(2011).
> 
> **System 1**
> 
> In Kahneman’s conception, unconscious thinking is “System 1” thinking. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control.
> 
>   * Examples: Detect that one object is farther than another; detect sadness in a voice; read words on billboards; understand simple sentences; drive a car on an empty road.
> 

> 
> **System 2**
> 
> Like Gladwell’s conception of conscious thinking, “System 2” thinking allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It’s often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
> 
>   * Examples: Focus attention on a particular person in a crowd; exercise faster than is normal for you; monitor your behavior in a social situation; park in a narrow space; multiply 17 x 24.

In this guide, we’ll begin by talking about the benefits of snap judgments (Part 1). Part 2 talks about the drawbacks of snap judgments and the dangers of relying on them in the wrong circumstances. Part 3 explores the mysteries of unconscious decision-making processes, including why explaining our snap decisions can get in the way of making good ones. Part 4 looks at personal preferences: They may seem straightforward, but sometimes we’re not very good at identifying what we do and don’t like. Part 5 looks at how to decide between making a snap decision and thinking through a problem carefully, including some strategies for making your snap decisions as accurate as possible. Part 6 concludes with two examples of good and bad snap judgments, and Gladwell’s final takeaways.
