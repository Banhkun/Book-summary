## Exercise: Find Your Specialized Product or Service

In this exercise, you’ll find a product or service your business can specialize in that’s also scalable, as Warrillow recommends.

* * *

List your (or your company’s) strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you run a store that repairs and sells electronic devices, you might be good at repairing equipment, but bad at selling used computer parts.

Based on your strengths, think of a product or service that you could specialize in that would differentiate your company from competitors. For example, since you’re best at repairing electronics, you might decide to make that the core of your business.

How might you design your product or service so it’s easy for others to learn how to provide or make? For instance, to teach new employees how to service computers, you might create a training plan starting with how to fix phone and laptop screens.

Finally, note some ways to make your product or service repurchasable to ensure you have repeat customers. For example, you could offer customers a membership program that gives them a discount on all future repairs, so they keep coming back to you.
