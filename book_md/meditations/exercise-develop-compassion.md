## Exercise: Develop Compassion

Developing compassion for people who have wronged you is a difficult, but important task. Take a moment to think about someone you currently dislike and consider how you can feel compassion for them. While answering the questions, remember that the only things that can really hurt you are those that damage either your character or your community.

* * *

Describe someone who you dislike. Why do you dislike him or her? What has this person said or done that’s _truly_ hurt you?

What’s one strategy that might help you feel more compassionate toward that person (for instance, can you think of a time when you’ve made a similar mistake, and remember what drove you to do it)? Why do you think that particular strategy will be effective?
