## Chapter 5: The Book of the Void—Achieving Perfect Harmony

The final book, the Book of the Void, is the briefest and most abstract in _The Book of Five Rings_ , and it is best treated as a sort of addendum to the first four books. Musashi suggests that **the “Void” is a state of spiritual enlightenment, in which you find the virtue and wisdom that make up the true Way of the warrior.** To discover the Void and access it at will during combat, you must do two things:

  * **Seek knowledge of all things.** It is only through deep knowledge that you can learn to distinguish between being and nothingness, virtue and vice, and the true from the false. You must therefore be a perpetual student, always seeking to broaden and deepen your understanding on all matters.
  * **Train and put the principles into practice every day.** As Musashi has repeatedly stressed throughout the prior four books, anyone wishing to be a successful warrior must train _constantly_. In the Book of the Void, Musashi says that you must train your heart, your mind, and your powers of perception to achieve a calm spirit. 



> **Zen Buddhism and “the Void”**
> 
> In speaking of “the Void” and its importance for the warrior, Musashi draws upon a key concept in Zen Buddhism known as “sunyata.” _Sunyata_ is the state in which your sense of self becomes immersed in the five skandhas, or elements, of existence:
> 
>   * **Form.** Material matter, including natural elements and the five senses of taste, sight, sound, touch, and smell.
> 
>   * **Sensation.** The feelings of pleasure or pain induced in you as a reaction to different types of material matter and circumstances.
> 
>   * **Perception.** The thinking process, in which you recognize and process the objects and circumstances around you.
> 
>   * **Mental Formations.** The thoughts that lead you to behave in a good way or in a bad way, affecting your _karma_ in the process. Buddhism teaches that thought and action are always directly linked.
> 
>   * **Consciousness.** Awareness, which allows us to experience the other four _skandhas_ above.
> 
> 

> 
> Achieving _sunyata_ leads to mental and physical harmony through the abandonment of an egotistical, individualistic notion of “self.” Instead, the warrior who achieves _sunyata_ understands the nature and ephemerality of the _skandhas_ ,__ and can exist harmoniously amongst them without clinging to his former notion of “self.”
