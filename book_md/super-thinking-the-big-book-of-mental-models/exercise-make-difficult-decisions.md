## Exercise: Make Difficult Decisions

Weinberg and McCann offer multiple decision-making models designed to analyze increasingly complex decisions. In this exercise, practice applying these models to decisions you’ve made in the past as well as decisions you’ll make in the future.

* * *

Think back to a time when you made a difficult decision. Why was the decision so difficult? What method(s) did you use to reach the decision?

How could you have used one of Weinberg and McCann’s models (pro-con list, cost-benefit analysis, or decision tree) to inform that decision? Use one of the decision-making models to reevaluate your decision.

Describe one difficult decision that you’re either facing, or will face in the near future. Why do you expect this decision to be difficult?

Apply one of Weinberg and McCann’s decision-making models to this decision. How did the model make the decision easier or harder to make??
