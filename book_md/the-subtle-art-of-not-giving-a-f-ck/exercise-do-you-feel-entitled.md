## Exercise: Do You Feel Entitled?

A feeling of entitlement can stand in the way of improving yourself and succeeding in your work and relationships.

* * *

Have you ever thought in an entitled way? (This might mean you feel your problems are unique; that the rules don’t apply to you; that you deserve special treatment; that you consider yourself a victim.)

After reading this chapter, what is a more emotionally healthy way to think of yourself?

Do you currently feel inadequate in any area of your life? What is it? Who are you comparing yourself to?

Consider the possibility that you might just be average in that area — how does that make you feel? Do you feel less pressure to achieve a particular expectation?
