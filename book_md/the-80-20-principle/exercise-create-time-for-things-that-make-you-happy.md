## Exercise: Create Time for Things That Make You Happy

Koch says we need to be ruthless in cutting down the time we spend on the 80% of people and activities that make us unhappy, and increase the time we spend on the 20% of people and activities that make us happy.

* * *

Describe the people, activities, and situations in your life that make you _un_ happy (for example, attending long meetings, cooking meals, or listening to a friend complain).

What actions can you take to reduce your exposure to those people or situations? (For example, consider whether you can stop attending some meetings, prepare meals in batches ahead of time, or cancel recurring get-togethers with negative friends.) Write down at least two ideas, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. (Remember: Koch says that happy, successful people find unconventional ways to use their time.)

Now, describe the people, activities, and situations in your life that make you _happy_ (for example, doing yoga, talking to your best friend, or reading books).

What actions can you take to increase your exposure to those people or situations? (For example, consider whether you can take a yoga class during your lunch break, set up a weekly friend date, or join a book club.)
