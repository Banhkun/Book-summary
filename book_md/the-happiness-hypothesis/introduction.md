## Introduction

One of the primary human impulses is to maximize our happiness. Indeed, this is the goal of the modern field of positive psychology. But **in our pursuit of happiness, we also have much to learn from the philosophical and literary wisdom of past thinkers** , from Buddha to Sigmund Freud.

In this summary, we’ll survey the world’s intellectual, philosophical, and theological ideas on happiness, from ancient India and Greece to the present day. But we won’t just explore these ideas in isolation—we’ll integrate them with one another and evaluate them using the insights we’ve gained from modern psychology. Using our better understanding of how the human mind really works, we will figure out how we can best use these ideas to gain the most joy out of our own lives.

As we’ll see, **our satisfaction in life is driven by our emotions**. And our emotions, in turn, are determined by the ways in which our mental filters cause us to interpret and react to events and situations. The human brain is perpetually divided against itself in the struggle between emotion and reason. Emotion demands that some need be satisfied; reason tries (and often fails) to control such impulsive needs.

Neither western ideas about the fulfillment of goals nor eastern notions about the elimination of desire as being the path to happiness are 100 percent right. As we’ll explore, the key to happiness is to strike the right balance between the two—to use reason to focus the mind _away_ from desires that will only bring fleeting happiness, while giving in to those desires that will bring lasting fulfillment.

First, we’ll need to delve into some evolutionary anthropology to establish why the elephant is so much more powerful than the rider. Understanding the dynamics of this fundamental division within our brains will guide our analysis of human happiness. Once we do that, we’ll be able to explore specific strategies for maximizing happiness. In general, these strategies are centered around:

  * Overcoming negativity by moving to the upper range of your affective style
  * Practicing reciprocity and tearing down self-delusions
  * Desiring the right things
  * Improving your relationships
  * Learning to overcome adversity
  * Cultivating your virtues
  * Discovering the divine or sacred in your life
  * Living a purposeful life



Our analysis of all these strategies will blend insights from positive psychology, ancient and modern philosophy and religion, and evolutionary anthropology.
