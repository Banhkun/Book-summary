## Exercise: Identify Adversity

Think about how overcoming challenges has shaped you.

* * *

In a few sentences, identify an incident in your life when you experienced an unexpected setback or loss.

How did you cope with and overcome this setback? Were there people in your life that helped you get through it?

What did surviving that experience teach you about yourself and the relationships in your life? Did you find that you were more resilient than you thought youâ€™d be? Elaborate in a few sentences.
