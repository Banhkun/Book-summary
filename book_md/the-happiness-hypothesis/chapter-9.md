## Chapter 9: The Purpose of Life

To discern the meaning of life, it is crucial to understand human beings as they actually are.

As we’ve seen, we are _not_ hyper-rational beings. In most situations, the elephant is in charge, not the rider. Philosophers seeking to explain or understand the human condition need to incorporate this fundamental psychological truth into their work.

Knowing this is important because it determines what the most effective strategies are for living a purposeful life. We explore those strategies in this final chapter.

### Occupational Self-Direction

**One of the essential conditions for a satisfying life is meaningful work.** We need to engage in pursuits that fill our lives with purpose and meaning. Work doesn’t have to be narrowly defined as a career. It can be anything that’s action-oriented and sets things in motion.

We have a need to see that our actions have an effect on the world around us. This is a psychological need known as effectancy. Anything from simple child’s play to a stable adult career can provide effectancy, satisfying our hunger to see that there are results associated with the labor we provide.

The most meaningful and satisfying work is that which people find intrinsically rewarding. Those who enjoy their jobs the most are not motivated by money and don’t treat their employment as a means to an end. Such individuals would do their jobs even if they didn’t have to because it provides purpose and fulfillment beyond extrinsic rewards.

**Importantly, people desire occupational self-direction—work that is complex and challenging, engages their interests or talents, and allows for a high degree of independence and autonomy.** It is what Csikszentmihalyi called “flow” in Chapter 4. This kind of work harnesses the progress principle to maximize our happiness, rewarding us for each baby step we take toward the goal.

One need not be engaged in white-collar or highly paid work to enjoy occupational self-direction. Blue-collar and manual workers can enjoy this same feeling of self-worth if they believe what they do is critical to the achievement of a larger mission. In one NYU study, the janitors who cleaned the bed pans reported some of the highest levels of satisfaction of anyone working in the hospital surveyed by the research team. These janitors believed they were making a visible and meaningful contribution to the creation of a safe and healthy environment for patients.

**The key is to find work that engages your strengths, which will initiate a cycle of more positive thinking**. You’ll start to connect the dots between your work and the achievement of larger goals. Without these intrinsic rewards, you’ll just be doing a job on a purely translational basis, seeing your work only in isolation and connecting it to no larger purpose.

### Religion and the Birth of Altruism

Our happiness is intimately connected to our experiences with others. We do not operate in isolation. We all have physical brains; that physical brain creates the mind, the set of mental patterns and structures that govern our conduct and guide our interpretations of reality; and, collectively, our minds form societies and cultures, our shared sets of beliefs and values. Happiness comes from the seamless interaction of these three levels of existence. And **religion is one of the most important elements in binding these levels of existence together.**

In Catholicism, for example, the faithful partake in rituals that create sensory feelings like the sensation of kneeling in the pews or the taste of the communion wafer on one’s tongue; these physical sensations encode themselves as memories and emotions that the individual associates with faith and transcendence; and they connect it all to a larger social and cosmological superstructure that orders one’s place within God’s kingdom.

People who are not themselves religious may be skeptical about religion’s relationship to morality. But it really did play a decisive role in creating the moral structures that govern our lives. We saw earlier that altruism can be partly explained by natural selection and the reciprocity reflex—it was advantageous for individuals to be altruistic to other individuals within the group, because that altruism would ultimately be rewarded.

But this explanation cuts out group selection: in which _group_ , not individual, traits are the main unit of natural selection. Historically, evolutionary biology focused on genes, which can only be passed within kinship groups. The field paid little attention to group selection.

**But humans didn’t just evolve genetically—they also evolved _culturally_.** And culture is inherently a group phenomenon. Cultural characteristics like beliefs or technologies can be vital in natural selection, but they occur completely outside of genetics. Thus, some groups can win at the natural selection competition on the basis of culture.

As a cultural trait, religion encouraged patterns of mutual trust and obligation—altruism—that aided in group survival and success in the competition with _other_ groups. It gave the group a cohesion and unity of purpose that enabled it to overcome the individual incentives for selfishness and free-riding. It also helps to explain the role of synchronized prayer and movement, subsuming the individual within the larger religious community. These are devices that nearly every religion has.

We’ve seen how important attachments and connections are to any individual’s enjoyment of life. By binding the individual to a community, connecting that individual to a higher purpose, and facilitating intrinsically rewarding altruistic behavior toward members of the group, religion has served as a great facilitator of human happiness.

### The Key to Happiness

**We are responsible for creating the conditions for our own happiness**. This comes from having the right relationships to other people, to your work, and to some sort of higher purpose that is greater than yourself.

It is about finding the right balance between connecting to your community and connecting to yourself. Happiness comes from your attachments to the world around you, but it also comes from the cultivation of inner virtues—training the elephant to explore its full potential, while respecting its power over the rider.

But by aligning the rider with the elephant, you will discover your own path to purpose, meaning, and, ultimately, happiness.
