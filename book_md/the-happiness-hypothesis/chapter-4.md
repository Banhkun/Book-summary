## Chapter 4: Adjusting Your Happiness

A cornerstone of Buddhist belief, and that of many other Eastern religious traditions, is that the striving for status and possessions will leave you spiritually unfulfilled and, ultimately, joyless.

These faiths encourage breaking all emotional attachment to things and refraining from trying to attain what you don’t have. The striving, according to this view, is the root of human unhappiness.

And it’s true that we often feel hollow and unfulfilled even after we get the things that we want (or, at least, we _think_ we want). But the self-denying philosophy of Buddhism gets some things wrong about human psychology. It turns out that some things _are_ worth striving for. **The key is not to eliminate desire; it’s to start desiring the _right_ things.**

### The Fleeting Joy of Achievement

Before we delve into what we _should_ be striving for, it’s worthwhile to explore why so many of the things we _do_ strive for leave us feeling unfulfilled. We often experience only brief, temporary happiness when we achieve some long-held goal like landing a promotion, getting a new car, or getting good grades. Soon after, we feel the unquenchable urge to reach the _next_ milestone. Why are we never fully satisfied?

The answer is actually rooted in evolution and neurochemistry. Our brains evolved to respond to immediate pleasures like food or sex (which both advance species success) with jolts of dopamine, which serve as a reinforcement mechanism. But the effects of any reinforcement mechanism are immediate and short-lived. We wouldn’t have advanced very far as a species if every baby step we took toward a goal were rewarded by a permanent period of elation—we would be content never reaching the goal! **The pleasure, instead, comes from the baby steps you take along the way. This is known as the progress principle.**

#### Accepting a New Normal

There is a fundamental truth of human psychology that follows from the progress principle—**no single event is likely to permanently alter your affective style, because you’ll just reach a new plateau. This idea is known as the adaptation principle.**

In the long run, we are much more sensitive to positive or negative changes _relative_ to our baseline than we are to _absolute_ changes. We can see this in happiness studies comparing lottery winners with people who’ve become paraplegic due to injury or illness.

One might think that the lottery winners exist in a state of constant elation, while the paraplegics are trapped in a state of endless despair. And this is true—for the short period after winning the lottery or losing the use of one’s legs. But, after time, studies show that both groups adapt and settle into a new normal. Lottery winners become used to their new riches and find themselves no longer thrilled by their change in status (and often come to resent it because they are hounded by friends and relatives asking them for money). Meanwhile, paraplegics come to accept their condition and discover that life can have its joys even in their new normal.

#### Can’t Buy Happiness

Many people strive for money and social status. But happiness research shows that **having a high income or a position of prestige and authority is not well correlated with happiness at all**. Rich, white Americans, for example, do not report being any happier than poor, minority Americans, despite the former’s obvious material and social advantages.

It’s true that, _all other things being equal_ , money is slightly correlated with higher happiness, but with very little marginal value for each dollar once someone has already met a certain financial threshold. Impoverished people do become much happier once they acquire enough money to meet basic needs like food and shelter. But after that, each _additional_ dollar adds very little in the way of happiness.

**Strong connections to other people and to something greater than yourself matter more**. Being in a good marriage is a series of joyful interactions with your partner, without a big “payoff,” keeping well with the progress principle. It’s no coincidence that good marriages and connections to religious communities are strongly correlated with happiness—topics we’ll explore in greater detail in later chapters.

### The Happiness Range

As we saw earlier when we explored affective style, it’s more useful to think of an individual’s happiness as operating along a range or spectrum instead of as a fixed amount. It’s certainly influenced by genes, but **one’s precise level of happiness is not predetermined.**

According to experts within the field of positive psychology (which we’ll explore further later in the summary), our happiness (H) is a function of:

  * Our biologically set happiness range or affective style (which we can label “S”)
  * The conditions (C) in our lives, including those that we can’t control like age or race, but also those we can control like wealth and marriage status 
  * The set of voluntary activities (V) we engage in like exercise, meditation, and learning



Expressed as a formula, it reads: H=S+C+V.

We already explored S when we discussed the concept of affective style in Chapter 2. Now, let’s explore the other two variables to complete our model of the happiness formula and give us some insight into the goals we _should_ be striving towards.

#### Conditions

Although some conditions of life are beyond the ability of an individual to alter, **there are changes you can make to your life circumstances to bring lasting happiness.**

Simple things like reducing exposure to unwanted noise, cutting down on commuting time, and improving your perceived body deficiencies (like being overweight or being too skinny) have been shown to make people happier in the long term.

Having more _autonomy_ over the conditions of your life is also important. In one study done at a nursing home, patients who were given responsibility for watering the plants in their rooms and who got to decide which movie they would watch on movie night got higher scores on all measures of happiness and had better health outcomes than did the control group that had been given no such autonomy.

Strong relationships, however, are the most important. Bad relationships (whether with spouses, coworkers, or others) have extraordinary power to make life unbearable. They feel inescapable and color all aspects of life, even when you’re not around the person with whom you have a bad relationship. **Meaningful and joyful connections to other people are central to happiness.**

Knowing that we can affect our overall happiness by improving the conditions of our lives should cause us to rethink the idea that the elimination of desire will lead to happiness. Striving for autonomy and for better relationships with the people around you _will_ increase your happiness in the long run. As we said at the start of the chapter, don’t stop striving; start striving for the right things.

#### Voluntary Activities

Voluntary activities (V) represent the only variable in the happiness formula that lies completely within our control; thus, focusing on our voluntary activities is the most effective way for us to increase our level of happiness.

Positive psychology co-founder Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi finds that **people are happiest when doing a task that is difficult, but closely aligned to their strengths**. For a bodybuilder, this might be lifting a heavy weight; for a violinist, it might be practicing a particularly complex piece of music. Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” or what we might call “being in the zone.”

It follows from what we know about the progress principle, which we explored earlier in the chapter. We derive more pleasure from the baby steps we take along the way to accomplishing our goals than we do from the actual achievement of a goal. **The key to flow is that you are receiving constant positive feedback; the _progress_ toward the goal sustains you**. In flow, the elephant and rider are perfectly synchronized, with the elephant chasing what it wants and the rider guiding it along and spurring it to action.

It’s important to draw the distinction between short-term _pleasures_ like food and sex that quickly dissipate (because our evolutionary reinforcement mechanisms are designed to make the dopamine rushes these activities bring temporary) and _gratifications_ that challenge you and draw on your strengths.

The pleasure of eating your favorite meal will dissipate the second you take your last bite; gratifications like doing acts of kindness for others will make you feel satisfied for a long time afterward.

### Conspicuous vs. Inconspicuous Consumption

**Another effective way you can boost your happiness through striving for the right things is by shifting from conspicuous consumption to inconspicuous consumption.**

Conspicuous consumption is when we buy visible, materialistic things for the purpose of demonstrating our wealth, prestige, or status to others. Examples would include things like a sports car or a piece of fancy jewelry. These aren’t things we buy for their intrinsic value; they’re things we buy for what they’re supposed to project about _us_ to _others_.

Conspicuous consumption naturally leads to an endless competitive cycle—in response to your purchase, someone else buys something even _more_ expensive, leaving you dissatisfied because it devalues your own purchase. The only way you can regain that happiness, of course, is by purchasing your next big-ticket item.

Closely related to the idea of conspicuous consumption is the way in which we tend to value _relative_ happiness more than _absolute_ happiness. We are willing to accept less overall happiness, as long as we know we have more than others. One study showed that most subjects preferred a job in which they earned $90,000 and their coworkers earned $70,000 to one in which they earned $100,000 but their coworkers earned $150,000. That is, they were willing to accept less money as long as they knew they would be making more than their peers. The added social prestige was worth at least $10,000 to these subjects.

**Inconspicuous consumption, by contrast, refers to the kind of spending we do for _our_ benefit, on things that make us intrinsically happy. **These are things that we value for their own sake, not for what they convey about us relative to other people. Positive psychology research suggests that money spent on experiences like vacations is far less likely to fall into the conspicuous consumption trap than money spent on material objects like cars or expensive watches. People tend to compete with one another over who owns the biggest house or the nicest car; they don’t, however, try to one-up each other with who took the longest vacation or who traveled the furthest.

Why do we treat experiences so differently than objects? Because **experiences tend to bring us into contact with other people.** We forge deeper connections with others through enjoying them together.

### Happiness Within and Without

As we close this chapter, let’s come back to where we started, with the ancient Buddhist or Stoic schools of thought that urged self-denial and the elimination of desire for externals (things that reside outside the self). In ancient times, when societies could be unstable and war or plague could threaten one’s existence at any moment, these ideas about abandoning attempts to control the circumstances around oneself made sense—you really _did_ have substantially less control over what happened to you.

But this is less the case in modern societies, especially wealthy and democratic ones. In the industrialized world in the 21st century, we do have the ability to make plans, formulate goals, and achieve them. And, as we’ve seen, if you choose the right ones, you can find meaningful and lasting happiness.

**Embracing, in moderation, the pleasures of life and forging meaningful attachments is a key part of what it is to _be_ human. Happiness can come from within; but it also comes from without.**
