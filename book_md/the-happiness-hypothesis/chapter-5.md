## Chapter 5: Attachment

In previous chapters, we’ve touched upon how our social attachments and relationships are central to our happiness and speak to a basic human need.

This is not a new insight by any means. In the 19th century, sociologist Emile Durkheim’s studies showed that people with fewer social attachments were more likely to die by suicide. And people with lots of meaningful relationships and connections to other people have been shown to have better health outcomes and report being happier.

In this chapter, we’ll explore the dynamics of our attachments to others and how pioneering research transformed how we think about the importance of love to human development.

### Behaviorism

Before we talk about how crucial love is to human development, however, we need to discuss how psychology _used_ to treat love. In the early days of psychology, the school of thought known as behaviorism taught that unconditional love was something to be avoided. The behaviorists believed that human action was governed by conditioned responses to reinforcements. Accordingly, people would only engage in behaviors they associated with rewards and refrain from behaviors they associated with punishment.

Behaviorism informed how institutions like schools and hospitals were administered, often with unfortunate results. Behaviorists argued against the provision of unconditional love to children, believing that providing this positive reinforcement regardless of the underlying behavior would make children weak and dependent. They believed that babies needed nothing more than milk from their mothers, leaving love and emotional attachment entirely out of the equation.

### The Case for Mothers

**Psychologists Harry Harlow and John Bowlby succeeded in discrediting much of what behaviorists believed about the role of love and attachment.**

In his research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Harlow observed that monkeys engaged in many problem-solving tasks for which there was no conditioned reinforcement—they simply enjoyed solving problems for the intrinsic joy they derived from them.

Harlow’s most famous experiment, however, was with baby rhesus monkeys who had been separated from their biological mothers. Harlow and his team of researchers wanted to test the behaviorists’ idea that the mothers’ sole purpose was to provide milk for their young. His team managed to create a milk formula that substituted for mothers’ milk, enabling a group of baby monkeys to be separated from their mothers. But Harlow found that these monkeys, raised without their mothers, were completely unable to socialize or form attachments once they were placed within a group.

This raised the idea that perhaps there was something about mother or mother-like figures that was crucial for development, beyond their ability to give milk. Accordingly, the team created two types of artificial mothers for the caged monkeys—one made of wire, one made of cloth. The monkeys would be raised alone in a cage with one of each type of artificial mother. For one set of monkeys, the _wire_ mother was outfitted with a tube that could provide milk; for the other set of monkeys, the _cloth_ mother was equipped with this technology. If the behaviorists were correct that the provision of milk was a mother’s sole function, then the babies would attach to whichever mother provided the milk.

But this was not the case. **The babies formed close bonds with their cloth mothers, regardless of whether or not these were their milk providers**. They nestled, cuddled, and burrowed themselves within the folds of their cloth mothers. Harlow concluded that the monkeys required what he called “contact comfort,” a need to nestle in the warmth of their mothers.

### Attachment Theory

Around the same time, John Bowlby’s work with maladjusted and orphaned children in post-World War Two Europe revealed the same thing—that **love was paramount to a child’s development, and a loving mother or mother-figure was crucial in the provision of this love.**

Bowlby found that children who’d been deprived of the love of a parent because of the war had great difficulty forming healthy relationships. They were either cold and distant or tended to form close attachments to anyone who showed them the slightest attention. Bowlby merged his own observations with Harlow’s experimental data to create what is known today as attachment theory.

**Attachment theory states that children have two primary needs—safety and exploration**. From an evolutionary perspective, both are necessary. Safety guarantees survival, while exploration enables children to develop the skills they need to succeed as adults and have children of their own.

The two work in tandem. When the safety level drops too low during exploration or play, the child instinctively cries out for its parent to restore safety to the right level (children do this instinctively when they reach their arms up for their parents to hold them when they are distressed).

This knowledge that the parent will always be there to act as a guardrail gives the child the sense of security she needs to develop independence. Accordingly, when children are deprived of their attachment figures, they become insecure and unable to develop the emotional security and independence needed to thrive in adulthood.

According to attachment theory, therefore, the behaviorists had it exactly wrong. Unconditional love does not inhibit the development of independence; it’s what makes it possible in the first place.

#### Attachment Style

A developmental psychologist named Mary Ainsworth further developed attachment theory. In her experiments, Ainsworth temporarily separated children from their mothers in a controlled environment where the children could play with toys in a room with a stranger. The children generally had three different reactions to the separation.

  * Most became distressed when the mother left, but were quickly calmed when she returned and the bond of attachment was restored. **Ainsworth labeled this the secure attachment style.**
  * A smaller subset behaved differently; some seemed to try and work through the pain of separation on their own and seemed outwardly not to care if their mothers left. But it was clear that they were nonetheless distressed. **Ainsworth labeled this type of insecure attachment the avoidant attachment style.**
  * Others could not be calmed even when their mothers returned, refusing all attempts to get them to settle down. **Ainsworth labeled this type of insecure attachment the resistant attachment style.**



Ainsworth theorized that the attachment style was the product of the history between mother and child and the views that each had come to form about the other. The explanation likely arises from the affective styles of both parent and child, combined with the history of how the parent has responded to the child’s cries for help in the past. These come together to set the template for the attachment style between the two. The attachment style is molded over the course of countless interactions between the pair and likely can’t be attributed to any single factor or event.

### Human Sexuality

Of course, our parents are not the only figures with whom we form close and lasting attachments. Research shows that **our childhood attachment styles carry forward into our adult romantic relationships** , setting the pattern for how we form bonds with other people for the rest of our lives.

Human sexuality differs from the sexuality of other animals. Unlike with animals, human sex is not solely for reproduction, and fathers fall in love with their mates and their children. Why are we so different?

Our large brains may provide the answer. In Chapter 3, we explored how our settlement in communities made it advantageous for us to develop tools like language, which required larger brains. But these large brains on infants would have made it difficult for women to pass them through the birth canal.

But the evolutionary process found a way around this—human infants, almost uniquely among animals, are born with their brains highly underdeveloped. While this enables women to pass them safely during birth, it renders human infants helpless and requires their mothers to provide constant care; they cannot survive otherwise.

This means that males, if the survival of their genes is the ultimate evolutionary goal, must play a significant role in protecting the mother and child. _This_ is the evolutionary root of paternal love and affection, as well as sexual jealousy by the male for the woman. It explains the curiously close bond between parents, a behavior that is nearly unmatched in other species.

#### Passionate and Companionate Love

These basic evolutionary truths about human sexuality, however, have been distilled into some modern notions about romantic love, namely that it is passionate and eternal. But the real picture of romantic love is more complicated than this. **Love researchers identify two types of romantic love—passionate love and companionate love**

Passionate love is the all-consuming kind that new lovers fall into and is often romanticized in songs and films. It is addictive, triggering dopamine releases in the brain just as narcotics like heroin and cocaine do. And like all drugs, it can lead to withdrawal symptoms; the highs eventually wear off as your body develops a higher tolerance. When we are in the throes of passionate love, the elephant is in full stampede—with the rider gleefully spurring her along.

Companionate love, on the other hand, is the stable kind of love we feel for those whose lives are inextricably linked to ours. It is based on caregiving and attachment. These are the lasting bonds that sustain marriages for decades and give us the kind of rich and fulfilling relationships that form the bedrock of so much of our happiness. Passionate love may well grow into companionate love; and the best relationships contain a mixture of both. But companionate love is what our most durable and lasting relationships are made of.

### Love and Philosophy

Even though today’s popular culture celebrates romantic love, philosophers and theologians of an earlier age were skeptical about its merits. Eastern traditions often downplayed the importance of romantic relationships, with Buddhist teaching viewing it as yet another attachment that one needed to deny oneself in order to reach enlightenment. Confucianism, meanwhile, saw love as interfering with the more important values of filial piety and proper social hierarchy.

The philosophers of ancient Greece also disdained romantic relationships. Prizing reason (the rider) above all else, thinkers like Plato believed that romantic love was an intoxicating spell that turned a rational man into an irrational beast. For the Greeks, love was not just trifling—to fall in love and place one’s happiness in the hands of another was akin to self-enslavement, something that was deeply corrupting to the dignity of the individual.

Much of this ancient moralizing about the dangers of sex and romance seems to be more about social control—especially of the young by the old—than about any higher principle. Young people tend to flaunt society’s rules when they’re in the throes of romantic love, so it made sense for ancient thought leaders to try and discredit the idea of love entirely.

But we know now that attachments to others through marriage and love are intimately linked to human happiness. The ancients lacked the insights of modern psychology that we now enjoy. Therefore, **we should embrace attachment and love, confident in the knowledge that we are doing ourselves a great psychological disservice by avoiding them.**
