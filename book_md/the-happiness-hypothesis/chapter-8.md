## Chapter 8: Divinity

If we could plot human experience on a graph, we might define it as existing along two axes.

On the horizontal X-axis, we have the world of connection and relationships; here, we make distinctions between strangers and friends, known and unknown.

On the Y-axis, we have the world of hierarchy; those we perceive as being our social superiors or inferiors. But there seems to be a third dimension, a Z-axis. This is what we might call divinity; a sense of uplifting when we witness something extraordinary or beautiful. It is its own unique moral dimension.

In this chapter, we’ll explore this dimension of sacredness and how, by drawing closer to the divine, we can experience the joyful emotion of elevation.

### The Logic of Disgust

Before we talk about spiritual uplifting, we should explore the opposite sensation. Many ancient religious texts are concerned with purity and cleanliness (i.e., rules about handling corpses, not eating certain kinds of meat, ablution rituals). There seems to be an ancient sensitivity to the emotion of disgust.

As has been the case with so many of the ancient writers and thinkers we’ve surveyed, this preoccupation with disgust actually reflects deep insight into human psychology and evolution. Our sense of disgust was probably an advantage in natural selection, as it would have prevented us from coming into contact with decayed or poisoned things that were harmful to us.

This is seen in ancient proscriptions against the eating of animals that come into contact with corpses, excrement, and garbage; as well as the transmission of human bodily fluids, which the ancients knew could cause illness, even millennia before our modern germ theory of disease.

This logic of disgust extended into the realms of sexual norms and body appearance. There seems to be a hard-wired idea, universal across cultures, that one must treat one’s body as a temple and never defile it with impure or corrupt foreign externals.

### Separating the Disgusting From the Divine

**This notion of cleanliness connects us to the divine, elevating us above the animals (who, after all, perform the same crude biological functions we do)**. Our disgust at impurity and our desire to conceal or sanitize many aspects of our animal behavior, whether it is the elimination of waste or the act of mating, is one way that we travel along the divine Z-axis.

Hindu teaching even mandates that recitation or study of the holy scriptures like the _Bhagavad Gita_ should never be done during eating or elimination, ensuring that the spark of divinity within each individual is always separate from the baser functions of our biology.

These notions go far beyond mere tools of hygiene or social control (as a non-believer might be tempted to think). They speak to something much more profound and universal. To fail to treat one’s body as a temple is to degrade and diminish the godliness within oneself. This leads to bad karma and reincarnation as a baser animal in the next life.

Even in the west, where (as we explored in Chapter 7) our ethics are more based on individual autonomy—do what you want as long as you don’t harm others—this relationship with divinity still exists. We see this in writings from the Victorian Era, when writers argued that young men needed to guard their virtue and purity by refraining from indulging their more animalistic impulses like masturbation.

**These rules separate the disgusting from the divine**. It is hardly a coincidence that all religious traditions have designated times and spaces for religious observance, a way of walling off the worldly from the otherworldly.

#### Secular Divinity

Even secular people and cultures retain some vestiges of this. We have a special psychological reverence for certain times (like anniversaries) and spaces (such as those where significant life events took place, like one’s childhood home) that have no immediate religious connection. We also touch divinity through secular experiences like seeing natural beauty or appreciating great art.

Even taking some hallucinogenic drugs like LSD or psilocybin (“magic mushrooms”) can bring about these feelings of transcendence. It is no coincidence that many religious traditions make the ingestion of psychoactive plants a key part of initiation into the spiritual community.

### Elevation

If disgust and the desire to separate our bodies from the divine represent a “downward” movement along the Z-axis, what about the opposite?

We feel a very unique but difficult-to-describe set of emotions and physical sensations when we witness someone doing a good deed, often accompanied by a desire to follow suit and do good deeds of our own. This is when people move “up” along the Z-Axis, moving closer to the divine. **This is elevation, an emotion that we might think of as the opposite of disgust.**

Elevation is best described as the feeling you get when you are:

  * Experiencing awe and wonder by sharing moments of transcendence with others
  * Becoming attuned with the most noble parts of yourself; and
  * Witnessing phenomena that are larger than yourself and beyond the capacity of your limited mental structures to fully process



It is a calming feeling, possibly activated by the vagus nerve, which controls the heart rate. Notably, studies have shown that people point to their chest when asked to describe their physical sensations during elevation. This same nerve also produces oxytocin, the hormone that encourages bonding and attachment in mothers and triggers milk production. One study showed that women were more likely to lactate and engage in warm and nurturing behaviors with their babies after watching an elevating video.

**The feeling of experiencing God’s love as part of a congregation is a common manifestation of elevation**. It’s why religion is found in every culture at every time across the world; it fulfills a basic human need to connect with something greater. If we look back to the lessons of Chapter 6, religion powerfully enriches our self-narratives by placing us within a larger cosmic story.

### The Self

Alone among animals, humans have a highly cultivated idea of the self. We create narratives and self-conceptions and then judge our actions by the standard of that narrative. It gives us rich interior lives, but it can also lead to egotism and self-consciousness. We are our own worst critics and our own worst enemies because of the endless self-commentary and self-criticism.

Eastern traditions generally de-emphasize the self, seeing it and its needs as obstacles to true enlightenment. Thus, they urge meditation and self-denial. This de-emphasis of the self also exists in western thought. Many moral debates in the west boil down to how important the self should be.

Should the ethic of autonomy—do what makes you happy as long as you don’t hurt others—be dominant? Or should we hew to the ethic of divinity—self-sacrifice or denial of the individual in service of a set of shared spiritual ideals? The progressive left generally favors the former, believing that enshrining community ethics will trample upon individual liberty and lead to the persecution of minority groups. The traditionalist right tends to favor the latter, believing that excessive individual liberty leads to a values-free society in which any immoral conduct can be justified or rationalized.

But the debate is a false choice. Ultimately, we need both. **We need to acknowledge the fundamental human craving for shared experiences of the divine, while not pushing a version of it that excludes people who might not share the spiritual beliefs of the majority in a given society.**
