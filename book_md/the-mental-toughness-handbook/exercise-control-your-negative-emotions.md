## Exercise: Control Your Negative Emotions

Zahariades says that to cultivate mental toughness, you have to manage negative emotions like anger, sadness, and fear so they don’t overwhelm and control you.

* * *

Describe a time when you were consumed by a difficult feeling and made a decision you regretted.

What did your inner critic say to you during and/or after the decision?

If you find yourself in that situation again, what’s one thing you could do to manage that feeling differently?
