## 1-Page Summary

In _The Mental Toughness Handbook_ , Damon Zahariades provides a step-by-step guide to building mental fortitude and resilience so you can confront challenges and navigate adversity courageously. Mental toughness is a state of mind that you learn and earn through hard work, persistence, and patience. You build it by controlling negative emotions, cultivating your self-confidence, and reframing failures and setbacks as opportunities so you can bounce back from them better.

Damon Zahariades is a productivity expert and owner of ArtOfProductivity.com, where he explores time management strategies, reviews productivity apps, and teaches people how to create habits to get more done and enjoy their free time. He has authored other books on these topics, including The Time Management Solution and The Art of Letting Go.

This guide is broken into two parts. In Part 1, we’ll examine what mental toughness is and some of its key benefits. In Part 2 we’ll discuss how to cultivate mental toughness. Along the way, we’ll also contextualize, compare, and contrast Zahariades’s work with that of mindfulness, mental health, and other experts.

### Part 1: Mental Toughness

Before we talk about how to cultivate mental toughness, you need to know what mental toughness is and how it can benefit you.

#### What Is Mental Toughness?

Zahariades defines mental toughness as strength and fortitude in the face of stress and obstacles. **Mental toughness centers on your ability to effectively manage negative emotions like anger, fear, and sadness so they don’t control and lead you to make bad decisions.** It also reflects your persistence and resilience in moments of hardship. Mental toughness isn’t something you’re born with, but a state of mind you can cultivate with patience, passion, and hard work.

(Shortform note: Experts say that the concept of mental toughness is rooted in the work of sports psychologist Dr. Jim Loehr, who worked with champion athletes. He defined mental toughness as the ability to consistently perform at the height of your talent and skill level regardless of who your competition is. Other experts honed Loehr’s definition to reflect a psychological edge that keeps you more focused, confident, and in control than your competitors are in the face of stress. They’ve also added that mental toughness comprises values, behaviors, and emotions that help you progress toward your goals in good times and in hard times.)

#### The Benefits of Mental Toughness

You can see the perks of mental toughness in the behavior of people who are mentally strong. Like them, when you become mentally tough, you’ll be able to:

**1) Act rationally and confidently under duress.** Mentally tough people are attuned to and resist negative emotions like anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety, as well as negative self-talk. When you refuse to allow negative feelings and critical thoughts about yourself to consume you and cloud your judgment, Zahariades says you’ll avoid making poor decisions or quitting altogether. Instead, you’ll be able to think with a clear head and stay the course.

(Shortform note: Experts say that when you classify emotions as “bad” or “undesirable,” as Zahariades does, you actually _increase_ your risk of derailing yourself because you’re more likely to try to suppress feelings you believe are undesirable. This is different from _resisting_ negative emotions, as Zahariedes recommends, because instead of focusing on not allowing the feelings to control you, suppressing emotions attempts to bury them. This can lead to difficult emotions, like anger, building up inside you to the point that, eventually, you explode.)

**2) Maintain a clear focus**. Mentally tough people know the underlying reasons they’re pursuing their goals, and they don’t allow their need for immediate gratification or their emotional pain to derail them. When you cave to your impulses or let past mistakes and grievances haunt you, you don’t have time or energy to stay focused on what you’re trying to achieve. Understanding the purpose of your actions serves as a grounding force that you can remind yourself of when you encounter roadblocks, making you more likely to persist and achieve your goals.

(Shortform note: In _As A Man Thinketh_ , James Allen builds on the idea that purpose serves as a guidepost, explaining that purpose gives you a positive, productive place to center your thoughts so your mind doesn’t drift and get lost in feelings of fear, doubt, and self-pity. By consistently focusing intensely on your purpose and resisting pessimistic thoughts, you can train your mind to attune itself only to thoughts that lead to positive behaviors, which will create healthy thinking patterns and increase your ability to control your life.)

**3) Have a positive yet realistic mindset.** This mindset enables mentally tough people to function at their highest level. It’s rooted in the fact that they accept that: a) the world is unpredictable, b) obstacles, setbacks, and change are a natural part of life, and c) the way to make progress is by confronting these realities head on. When you have this mindset, Zahariades says, you can remain realistic yet positive in the face of uncertainty, look for opportunities and hope where others don’t see it, and make the most of bad situations.

(Shortform note: Experts say it’s tricky to balance a realistic and optimistic mindset when you’re going through a tough time, but striking that balance can help you and inspire others to persist. They offer advice for attending to these two disparate concepts simultaneously: First, set aside five minutes each day to both acknowledge positive things in your life and consider challenges you need to address. Second, look forward to the future while also acknowledging that changes you hope to make will take time. Finally, reflect on your tendency to be overly positive or overly negative, and adjust, where needed, to bring these factors into alignment with reality.)

Critically, mentally strong people also distinguish between what they can and can’t change—and channel energy only into what they can. Zahariades explains that when you focus exclusively on the things you _can_ influence, you won’t lose time on, or get discouraged by, trying and failing to change things beyond your control.

(Shortform note: If you have a hard time stopping yourself from focusing on things you can’t change, you may be prone to rumination, a mentally harmful process where negative thoughts repeat in a loop in your brain continuously. For example, if you’re concerned about mass shootings, you may fixate for hours on the thought that you’re at risk of being shot every time you go to the grocery store. Research suggests you can reduce rumination with quick hits of activity like vacuuming or going for a jog. You can also choose to not feed your ruminating thoughts by naming and talking back to them: “I see you, ‘Grocery Store Shooting Fear.’ I’m not engaging with you now.”)

**4) Be resilient in the face of setbacks** **and failure**. Mentally tough people recognize that disappointment, mistakes, and failure are natural parts of life, seeing them as opportunities to learn and grow. When you stop seeing failure as a reflection of your adequacy or worth, Zahariades says you’ll be more open to taking risks and trying new things—and you’ll feel less defeated each time you hit roadblocks, which will help you to bounce back more quickly.

(Shortform note: Experts suggest several other ways to bounce back from failure and setbacks. First, apply the 10/10/10 test: Ask yourself whether the failure will matter 10 weeks, 10 months, or 10 years from now. This will give you a sense of perspective so the offending event doesn’t consume you. Second, resist the urge to hole up and isolate yourself after the failure or setback. Instead, reach out to a friend who you know will make you feel better by distracting you or making you laugh.)

### Part 2: Cultivate Mental Toughness

Now that we’ve mental toughness and the benefits it will bring to your life, we’ll look at six strategies Zahariades recommends to become mentally tough.

#### Strategy 1: Control Your Negative Emotions

Zahariades says you have to embrace, understand, and manage negative emotions to perform at your peak. As we discussed earlier, emotions like anger and fear can derail you by leading you to make poor decisions or fail to take action.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson offers a rationale for why managing difficult feelings may help you perform at your best: Emotions are feedback tools that point you toward useful change. Negative emotions signal that you need to take action, while positive emotions signal that you’re on the right track. For example, if you feel sad that you’re alone, that’s a cue that you need company. If you feel happy that you washed all the dishes and straightened up your home and can now enjoy your calm space—that will encourage you to continue to keep your surroundings neat and tidy.)

**To do this** : Practice controlling your negative emotions regularly:

**1\. Rationally analyze anger, fear, and sadness as soon as they arise**. Ask yourself whether the negative feeling is aligned with logic and reason and whether it’s hindering your progress.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness experts agree that you should acknowledge difficult emotions as they arise, but they recommend a different approach for dealing with them: Welcome them with kindness. When you approach challenging emotions with warm curiosity, you’ll feel more comfortable examining and trying to understand where they came from, and you’ll be better able to respond to them compassionately instead of with judgment. This will make the emotions less overwhelming and likely to control you and more likely to dissipate without incident. The more you engage in this practice, the more integrated and fluid it will become.)

**2\. Meditate for five minutes each day**. During this process, aim to observe negative emotions that arise without criticizing or labeling them, and challenge the veracity of negative self-talk when you become aware of it.

(Shortform note: Zahariades doesn’t go into detail about how to meditate but you can follow this guide: Find a quiet place to sit, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and focus just on your breath flowing in and out of your body. If thoughts or emotions arise that distract you from focusing on your breath, notice—without judging yourself—that your mind has wandered, then refocus on your breathing. To avoid judging emotions like fear, frustration, anger, and sadness, which Zahariades classifies as “negative,” recognize that no feeling is “bad”—emotions are simply emotions with no value attached to them.)

**3\. Practice gratitude**. Take a few minutes each morning, afternoon, and evening to reflect on things in your life that you appreciate, that have gone well, and that you can celebrate. Doing this repeatedly will give you small victories that trigger the reward system of your brain, leading to sustained feelings of happiness. Further, Zahariades says this practice will prevent you from hyper-focusing on things that are going poorly, which can leave you swirling in a toxic brew of disappointment and unhappiness and prevent you from making positive change.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that the simple act of writing a letter expressing gratitude can improve your mental health by shifting your focus away from toxic emotions and making it harder to ruminate. Further, this practice appears to have lasting impacts on the brain, lighting up the area associated with learning and decision-making and training it to become more sensitive and responsive to the experience of gratitude over time.)

#### Strategy 2: Build Your Confidence

Zahariades says that to be mentally tough, you have to be confident in your ability to navigate difficult situations. You can increase your confidence by challenging negative self-talk and validating yourself.

##### Respond to Your Inner Critic

Zahariades says that we all have an inner critic that judges and tells us we’re doing things poorly. The critic’s goal (though misguided in its messaging) is to keep you safe from harm—a relic of evolutionary strategies aimed at managing risk by assuming the worst. When your inner critic bombards you with negative talk, like, “You’ll _never_ make it!” “ _Everyone_ thinks you’re stupid!” and “You can’t do _anything_ right!” respond to it with positive self-talk. This will prevent it from eroding your confidence in your ability to manage difficult situations and try new things, which can limit your progress.

(Shortform note: In _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_, Dale Carnegie argues that you should be your own worst critic so you can: a) prevent others from beating you to the punch, and b) learn and grow from what’s not working. Recognizing and welcoming hard-to-hear criticism that comes from a well-intentioned place (which Zahariades says is what your inner critic is doing) will give you feedback that will help you become better and stronger.)

**To do this** : Be on the lookout for attacks from your inner critic. When they arise, address them immediately by showing yourself the same kindness you’d show a close friend who’s feeling down.

For example, if your inner critic says: “You can’t do _anything_ right!” counter that negative message with: “That’s not true. Today I fed and walked my dog, worked so I can pay my bills, and called my grandmother to say ‘hi’, which made her feel special.” Being compassionate toward yourself will make you feel more confident, which will help you deal with difficult situations more effectively and increase your willingness to take risks, fortifying your mental toughness.

##### Validate Yourself

When you rely on others’ approval to feel confident and tell you what, when, and how to do things, Zahariades says you learn not to trust yourself and your capabilities. In contrast, when you validate yourself—by recognizing your unique talents, skills, and knowledge base—you can navigate challenges and uncertainty more effectively.

**To do this** : List the biggest things you lack confidence about and steps you can take to diminish their impact on your self-assurance. For example, if you lack confidence in your ability to make decisions, commit to making at least one low-stakes decision each day to increase your confidence. This might be something as small as choosing a new salad dressing at the grocery store or reading a new book every other week to expand your knowledge base. Doing this repeatedly will build your confidence in and positively reinforce your ability to make decisions.

(Shortform note: Mental health experts say that validating yourself comes with another benefit: It allows you to be your most authentic self, which helps you strengthen your identity and manage challenging emotions. They recommend two strategies to validate yourself: First, when you doubt yourself, reflect on your past successes to remind yourself of your capabilities. Second, focus on staying in the present moment so you can attune to your genuine needs, which will help you be true to yourself.)

#### Strategy 3: Confront Challenges Courageously

Zahariades argues that to be mentally tough, you have to demonstrate courage in the face of adversity even when the outlook is poor. When you identify and address challenges proactively and with an action-oriented mindset, you offset feelings of paralysis and prepare yourself to respond to the obstacles you face productively and with confidence.

**To do this** : Accept the situation directly and refuse to let it overwhelm you. Zahariades acknowledges that this can be a tall order if, for example, you’ve been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness or lost a loved one. But, he says, when you’re able to regain control over your mind, you’ll be better prepared to address the problem.

(Shortform note:__ In _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard argues that high performers confront difficult situations by adopting a mindset of gratitude for hardship that helps them overcome fears and navigate obstacles. Getting into this mindset starts with appreciating that adversity is often required to achieve success and that it toughens you up by helping you develop a thick skin and character. To cultivate this mindset, welcome the challenge. Recognize that there’s no easy road to success and that tasks that frustrate you will help you grow. And when the road gets rough, remind yourself that better times are ahead and that you’re working toward your goal.)

#### Strategy 4: Reframe Failure and Obstacles As Opportunities

Zahariades says that when you change your perception of failure, you won’t feel like a victim of difficult situations. To be mentally tough, view failure as an inevitable part of life and valuable feedback that you can learn from—rather than something that’s bad or a reflection of your poor character or inadequacies.

When you’re open to learning from your mistakes, you’re telling yourself that it’s okay to not be perfect, and you have the capacity to grow, persist, and succeed. When you repeatedly approach setbacks with this mindset, you train your brain to see future challenges as opportunities to grow from, and you can make the best of challenging situations. Zahariades says this will leave you feeling inspired, not defeated, bolstering your ability to manage the situation and your mental toughness.

(Shortform note: Reframing failure is crucial to cultivating a growth mindset, which is based on the belief that you can always improve your abilities with hard work, persistence, and the right learning strategies. In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck provides a step-by-step guide to adopting a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset (the belief that your personality and intelligence are innate and unchangeable). First, consider _when_ and _why_ your fixed mindset appears. Second, name your fixed mindset persona to remind yourself that that’s not who you want to be. Third, tell your fixed mindset that you won’t allow it to control you.)

**To do this** : When you make a mistake or fail, immediately acknowledge and dispute any negative thoughts that arise by telling yourself that this is a chance to learn and become better. Zahariades says this fosters a non-toxic headspace that will allow you to engage in the situation with a positive, creative mindset. Engaging in this process repeatedly will make it habitual.

(Shortform note: In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed offers a step-by-step process to learn from your mistakes. First, think about a habit you’d like to develop—for example, to play the piano an hour each day—and begin that habit. Second, each time you finish playing the piano, reflect by journaling about the experience. Third, note any mistakes you noticed and your thoughts on where things fell apart: Maybe you realize you had a hard time concentrating because you had too many cups of coffee that morning. Finally, use that data to get a better outcome next time: The next morning, drink just one cup of coffee before you practice the piano.)

#### Strategy 5: Develop Long-Lasting Habits

Zahariades says that developing habits bolsters mental toughness by giving you a consistent, stable practice to turn to in difficult times. Habits aren’t just a thing you do, they’re a reflection of your values and priorities. For example, if you run every day, you likely care about your health and, maybe, the time and mental space that running gives you to think and clear your head. Because habits are rooted in things you care about, they serve as an anchor in a way that willpower, motivation, and inspiration—which can come and go—do not.

(Shortform note: In _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard says that high performers consistently engage in six common habits that support their other goals. Two key habits are: (1) **improving your health** , which builds energy, focus, and contentment, and requires that you regularly eat healthy foods, work out, and get enough sleep; and (2) **developing a network of people who support you** by being generous and helping others in order to earn their trust and respect.)

Zahariades recommends that you practice building several mental habits to increase your mental toughness, including self-restraint, focusing exclusively on situations you can impact or control (and ignoring those you can’t), and committing to embracing change.

##### Habit 1: Self-Restraint

Zahariades says that learning to resist your immediate impulses—whether that’s eating a piece of cake or telling someone you went on one date with that you love them—teaches you to tolerate discomfort. Training your mind to live without the thing you crave at any given moment improves your cognitive resilience and ability to ignore distractions, bolstering your mental toughness.

(Shortform note: Researchers say that people with high levels of self-control are typically described as having a strong ability to _resist_ temptation. But current research suggests they’re actually better described as being able to avoid temptation. In a study, researchers found that participants with high levels of self-control opted to work in distraction-free environments over more appealing settings with more distractions. Further, people with high self-control reported resisting impulses less frequently than those with low self-control _precisely_ _because_ , researchers theorize, they avoid temptations entirely rather than leaning on their self-control to resist them.)

**To do this** : Make a plan for how you’ll resist your impulses when they arise. This could include finding a substitute for the thing you desperately want—preferably something healthy—to ward off the worst of your temptations. For example, if you’re craving cherry Pop-Tarts, grab a bowl of actual cherries. Further, reward yourself for resisting your impulses. When you positively reinforce yourself for doing the hard work of not caving to your craving, you’ll be more inclined to continue doing it.

(Shotform note: Psychologists offer other suggestions for dealing with temptation. If you can’t avoid it entirely, do your best to work around the situation. For example, if you’re trying not to eat sweets and are at an event with a tempting dessert table, stay as far away from that table as possible. If that’s hard to do, find a way to distract yourself: Find someone to talk to or take a walk to the bathroom. Finally, think about ways to make the thing that tempts you less appealing: When you look at the plate of cookies, picture someone presenting you with a tray holding a five pound bag of sugar on it and telling you that you have to eat the entire bag at once.)

##### Habit 2: Focus Only on Situations You Can Impact

Zahariades says it’s a waste of time and energy to focus on things beyond your control, so it’s important to recognize what you _can_ and _can’t_ change and focus only on the former. This frees your mind to focus your attention where it’s most valuable.

**To do this** : Pay attention to the amount of time you spend thinking about things you can’t control, and refocus your energies on things you can impact. For example, instead of wasting time wondering if your boss will think the report you’re working on is good enough, focus on making it as good as it can be.

(Shortform note: Another reason to focus only on things within your control is that when you focus on too many things your brain goes into information overload, which can negatively impact your memory. When you push the brain’s working memory beyond its capacity, your cognitive functioning and efficiency deteriorate—and when you continually overload the circuits you harm both short- and long-term memory functions. To avoid overload, neuropsychologists recommend two things: First, filter out information you don’t need by taking a break from technology, so you’re not perpetually bombarded with it. Second, prioritize the flow of information you receive by turning off your push notifications.)

##### Habit 3: Commit to Embracing Change

When you consistently seek out and commit to change, Zahariades says you normalize the process of stepping outside your comfort zone and into the unknown. Welcoming this practice as an opportunity to take control of your life rather than waiting passively for change to happen builds and reinforces your confidence and ability to do it more often.

**To do this** : Set small, achievable goals to increase your chances of success and the feeling of reward you experience when you accomplish them. This will encourage you to continue setting and achieving new goals.

For example, if you’re not a naturally neat person but want your house to feel less cluttered, don’t set a goal of cleaning your entire house all at once, which could overwhelm you and stop you from starting. Instead, start with a small goal each day, like making your bed when you get up or washing dishes right after you use them. You’ll see immediate progress in your neatness and have less physical and mental clutter around your home, which will allow you to relax in your home.

(Shortform note: In _Switch_ , Chip and Dan Heath say the earliest stages of change are the most challenging because even after you’ve made a change, you still have to give it time to sink in. Even though this can be uncomfortable—because new behaviors don’t feel normal or familiar—there’s good reason to stick it out: The more you do the new thing, the more you’ll get used to and appreciate it, experiencing the “mere exposure effect.” In addition, when you repeat behaviors enough, you begin to associate your identity with them, making it easier to do them. For example, if you bake every day, you’ll start to see yourself as a baker, which will encourage you to continue baking.)

#### Strategy 6: Embrace Boredom

Zahariades says that boredom is a natural part of the process of mastering anything, including mental toughness, so you have to welcome it in your life. He argues that practicing any skill over prolonged periods of time—whether throwing a baseball or practicing the oboe—comes with moments of tedium, so it’s important to view boredom as an opportunity, not something you dread.

**To do this** ;

  * **Acknowledge boredom when you feel it**. When you pay attention to and recognize that you’re bored, you won’t be consumed by negative feelings associated with it, like irritation or frustration (which can happen if your brain is on autopilot).
  * **Meditate**. When you bring your mind into the present moment you’re better able to stay calm when you feel bored. This allows you to refocus and move forward more productively. ****
  * **Remind yourself of your bigger goal**. When you stay focused on the goal that your boring work leads to, you’ll be more able to stay committed to achieving it.



(Shortform note: Experts say that boredom isn’t just something you have to deal with, it’s actually good for you. Boredom gives your brain a chance to recharge and can trigger creativity and problem-solving. When your brain completes an intense task, it stops exerting significant energy and goes into a resting state where a network of regions works to consolidate memories, process learning, and daydream about the past and future. During this time the brain also wanders “mindlessly,” thinking freely and safely, developing solutions to problems. You can embrace boredom by spending time in nature, taking a break from technology, and giving yourself time away from activities to rest.)
