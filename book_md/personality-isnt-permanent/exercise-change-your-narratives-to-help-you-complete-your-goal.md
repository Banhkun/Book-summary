## Exercise: Change Your Narratives to Help You Complete Your Goal

Hardy says that unhealthy narratives that frame you in a negative light prevent you from accomplishing your primary goal. This exercise will help you identify an unhealthy narrative you have about yourself and change it so you can meet your primary goal.

* * *

What’s an unhealthy narrative—one that frames you as disempowered and incapable of change—you regularly have about yourself?

How does this narrative get in the way of meeting your primary goal? For instance, this narrative might tell you that you’re bad at a skill necessary for completing your goal or that you’re stuck with a personality trait that gets in the way of completing your goal.

Which one of Hardy’s strategies for changing your narratives (identifying with your future self, focusing on the positives, or considering more of the context) is a good starting point for changing your unhealthy narrative? How might that strategy help you change your narrative so you can make progress on your primary goal?
