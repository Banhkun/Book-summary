## Exercise: Visualize Your Optimal Self and How to Become Them

Hardy argues that the most effective way to become who you want to be is to imagine your optimal self and complete the steps necessary to becoming that person. This exercise will help you consider _your_ optimal self and how to become this person.

* * *

Take a moment to imagine your optimal self. What is their personality—their traits, preferences, and temperaments—like? What kind of lifestyle do they have?

What’s a primary goal that would require you to become this optimal self? What desired aspects of your optimal self would this goal help you attain?

Think about a recurring behavior or life choice of yours that stands in the way of meeting this goal. In what ways is it incompatible with your primary goal? How can you change it in service of meeting your goal?
