## 1-Page Summary

In _Unreasonable Hospitality_ , hospitality guru Will Guidara details how he transformed Eleven Madison Park from a so-so brasserie in the middle of Manhattan into the World’s Best Restaurant in 2017. Guidara contends that the secret to the restaurant’s success was his commitment to providing “unreasonable hospitality”—a level of dedication to providing guests with a fantastic experience that stretched the limits of what seemed sensible. Guidara believes that anyone with a service-based business should _also_ commit to providing unreasonable hospitality—both to their employees and their customers.

Guidara first joined Eleven Madison Park in 2006, when the restaurant’s then-owner tapped Guidara and chef Daniel Humm to transform the restaurant into a fine-dining establishment. Guidara and Humm succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, garnering widespread acclaim and buying out the restaurant in 2011 to create their own company, Make It Nice. This company developed several other restaurants before Guidara left to pursue his own ventures in 2019—including running Thank You, a hospitality agency, and writing _Unreasonable Hospitality_ , which was published in 2022.

In this guide, we’ll trace Guidara’s career and share the lessons he learned from each stage—from his journey to becoming general manager (GM) of Eleven Madison Park (EMP) to transforming it into a three-star, a four-star, and then the world’s best restaurant. We’ll also include advice from experts in other industries about managing a world-class team and delivering exceptional service to your customers.

### Guidara’s Journey to Eleven Madison Park

Guidara’s interest in restaurants was influenced by his father, who worked in the industry. This interest was bolstered by a fantastic experience in a restaurant on Guidara’s 12th birthday. He graduated from the restaurant management program at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration and spent years working at several restaurants before accepting the position at EMP. In this section, we’ll discuss the lessons Guidara learned from these experiences.

(Shortform note: Guidara’s father knew that his son could be successful in the restaurant industry due to his own experience: The senior Guidara was the president of the dining management company Restaurant Associates (RA) before spending several years as the CEO of restaurant chains like Au Bon Pain and Pizzeria Uno. And by 2013, dining room jobs were in demand among Ivy League graduates (like those from Cornell), who could make up to $150,000 annually at restaurants like EMP.)

#### Lesson 1: Hospitality Matters

Thanks to a class he was taking at Cornell, Guidara made a connection with famed chef Daniel Boulud and even spent an evening partying with him and his team. This connection proved to be a great relief just a few months later when, soon after Guidara’s college graduation, his mother passed away. Shortly afterward, Guidara and his father happened to be in New York City—so Guidara emailed Boulud to ask if they could eat dinner at Boulud’s restaurant. Boulud gave them the most exclusive table available, served them a superb meal, and didn’t charge them a cent.

Although Guidara knew from a young age that he wanted to work in restaurants, this meal at Boulud’s restaurant taught him the true power of hospitality. His 12th birthday dinner taught him that hospitality can enthrall you on your best days. His meal with his father at Boulud’s restaurant during their season of grief showed him that great hospitality can _also_ enchant you and provide comfort when you most need it.

(Shortform note: Although Guidara has only good things to say about his meal at Boulud’s restaurant, many people feel “happiness guilt”—a sense of discomfort with the happiness they feel when they are also in the middle of great pain. Adopting Guidara’s perspective can help you through these situations; experts argue that you should let yourself enjoy happy moments because they will provide the strength you need to endure difficult periods.)

#### Lesson 2: Find the Balance of Control

After graduating from Cornell, Guidara began working as a manager at a restaurant owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG). Guidara quickly fell in love with the restaurant group’s “restaurant-smart” culture, which prioritized teamwork and cultivating trust in both the kitchen and the floor staff to do their jobs well.

(Shortform note: In _Setting the Table_ , Danny Meyer provides further context on why USHG had a restaurant-smart culture. For many years, Meyer believed that running his restaurants as a group and creating corporate structure would ruin the individuality and soul of each restaurant. As a result, he resisted turning USHG into an official restaurant group—and as a consequence lacked several essential departments, such as marketing and public relations—until 2003, shortly before he opened his restaurants at the MoMA (Museum of Modern Art).)

However, Guidara’s father warned him that he needed to work somewhere with a “corporate-smart” culture—a more business-like attitude to running restaurants that favored more controlled, corporate systems over on-the-ground staff autonomy. So Guidara joined RA, his father’s old company, first as their assistant purchaser and controller and then as assistant general manager and controller of Nick + Stef’s Steakhouse in Madison Square Garden.

(Shortform note: Restaurants have two broad departments: the front of house and the back of house. The front of house is made up of guest-facing roles such as the general manager, the servers, and hosts, while the back of house is the team that keeps the restaurant running behind the scenes: the chefs, purchasers—who buy what the restaurant needs from third parties—and finance people, including the controller who oversees accounting and payroll. Guidara thus had a well-rounded experience at RA, which gave him a more holistic view of the restaurant business.)

> **Switching Jobs May Come With Culture Shock**
> 
> Thinking of moving to another company? Keep culture in mind. Not everyone has an easy time switching between companies that have vastly different cultures. Many companies hire for “culture fit”—and while this is ostensibly a method of evaluating whether a potential employee shares your company values, it often translates to hiring the person who looks and acts like everyoneelse at your company.
> 
> So if you come from a company with a different cultural style _and_ your background is different from that of your potential new coworkers’, you may struggle to break into a company. Guidara may have had an easier time switching to corporate-style culture due to his family connection; after all, 22% of American men with non-absentee fathers join the same company as their father.)

Guidara’s time working at RA taught him that it’s essential to have _some_ but not _too much_ control over your employees. Sometimes, control can help your employees. For example, when RA noticed that the increased price of lobster was negatively affecting a restaurant’s profits, the controller banned their chefs from using the ingredient. The controller’s focus on the restaurant’s bottom line freed the chef to focus on serving great food without having to worry about serving a financially viable lobster dish.

(Shortform note: It may be tricky to determine how much control is _too_ much. Some research suggests that the degree of control may vary depending on the task and circumstances: Controls seem to work best in jobs that require performing routine tasks, while more autonomy may work better for jobs that require creativity—in the case of RA, the controller only had control over the bottom line, but didn’t dictate what the chef could serve, enabling the chef to exercise culinary creativity.)

That said, too _much_ control can harm your employees. While working at Nick + Stef’s, Guidara fired a server who regularly disrupted the dinner service due to his unprofessional behavior. While USHG would have trusted Guidara’s decision, RA’s head office rehired the server, explaining to Guidara that this server made the company a lot of money because his customers loved him. Guidara was furious; he believed that the server’s profit potential didn’t outweigh the damage that he did to the rest of the dining team—damage that the head office couldn’t see because they weren’t in the dining room every evening.

(Shortform note: Guidara’s assertion that company leaders should defer certain decisions to employees who are in the restaurant every day reflects a common military tactic. In _Superforecasting_ , Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner describe the military principle of “mission command,” in which commanders determine the overall _strategy_ of their forces but defer decisions on how to _execute_ that strategy to on-the-ground troops. This allows troops to make flexible decisions based on the dynamic situations they encounter firsthand—as Guidara did when he fired the disruptive employee.)

#### Lesson 3: Spend Wisely

Guidara eventually left RA when a chance encounter with Meyer led to a job as general manager for Meyer’s new casual-dining spaces at the MoMA. This gave him the opportunity to combine the lessons he’d learned at RA with Meyer’s vision. (Shortform note: The authors of _Positioning_ recommend that you stay in touch with people outside your current organization because you’ll get most of your big opportunities through these contacts—as was the case with Guidara.)

One way Guidara did so was by developing “The Rule of 95/5:” Cut costs as much as possible on 95% of your budget, but spend the last 5% extravagantly—as these extravagant touches will be the most memorable and will keep your guests coming back for more. Guidara created this rule when he added an ice cream cart to the museum’s sculpture garden and invested in expensive but artistic spoons. The memorable spoons drew praise from the guests, and the cart remained profitable despite the expense because Guidara had cut costs elsewhere.

(Shortform note: At its core, the Rule of 95/5 reflects the idea that a small percentage of what you do has an outsize impact, and so you should focus on that small percentage. This idea is not original to Guidara. The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, states that 80% of your outputs stem from 20% of your inputs. As such, several business experts—such as _The One Thing_ author Gary Keller—also advise finding the 20% of your actions that have the most impact and focusing on those. But it’s crucial to find the _right_ 20%—and it’s not clear whether Guidara focused on the _right_ 5%. Guidara doesn’t provide any empirical data to support his implication that the expensive spoons played a key role in maintaining the profitability of the ice cream cart.)

#### Lesson 4: Be Flexible

Guidara loved working at the MoMA. His passion attracted the attention of Daniel Humm, who Meyer had recently hired as EMP’s executive chef after the restaurant received a disappointing two-star review from _The New York Times_. Humm suggested to Meyer that Guidara could help Meyer achieve his vision of turning EMP into the fine-dining jewel that Meyer envisioned.

(Shortform note: in _Setting the Table_ , Meyer provides further context regarding why he replaced both the chef and the general manager after this disappointing two-star review from the _Times_. Not only did the critic dislike most of EMP’s food, but he also thought that the service felt disingenuous, which threatened Meyer’s philosophy of hospitality.)

Guidara initially hesitated to become EMP’s general manager. He’d never wanted to work in a fine-dining restaurant because he didn’t want to work in an establishment that prioritized the chef’s vision above all else. However, he agreed to speak with Humm—and after discovering that Humm _also_ wanted to run a restaurant that equalized both the kitchen and the floor staff, Guidara agreed to try the job out for a year. This decision sparked a partnership that would lead to great success for both men—a partnership that would never have happened without Guidara’s willingness to be flexible and join EMP despite his earlier hesitation.

> **Why You Should Be Flexible—but Not Too Flexible**
> 
> Like Guidara, _The World Is Flat_ author Thomas L. Friedman highlights the importance of being flexible in modern times; technology can change the world in an instant, so you must be willing to quickly adapt to keep up. Guidara’s willingness to be flexible may have rubbed off on Humm—even after their partnership, in 2021, Humm made headlines for turning EMP meals vegan in an effort to make the restaurant more sustainable—an effort that, despite some speed bumps, earned the restaurant three Michelin stars in 2022.
> 
> However, too much flexibility can be dangerous as it could lead you to compromise your core purpose. For example, Humm appears to have strayed from his original vision of running a restaurant that didn’t prioritize the chef above all else. In 2022, Humm was plagued by reports that he was paying most EMP staff minimum wage while not letting them accept any tips.

### How Guidara Turned EMP Into a Three-Star Restaurant

Guidara joined EMP in 2006 to help Meyer transform the casual brasserie into a three-star fine-dining restaurant worthy of its spectacular location—and by 2007, Guidara achieved that goal. In this section, we’ll detail what Guidara did to transform EMP into a well-regarded three-star restaurant.

#### Lesson 1: Clarify and Communicate Your Priorities

When Guidara joined EMP, the restaurant was suffering from poor relationships and erratic levels of service. In an effort to transform the brasserie into a three-star restaurant, Meyer had brought on several service professionals who’d trained in fine-dining restaurants and so brought with them a set of expectations regarding how a fine-dining restaurant is run. The original EMP staff bristled at these expectations, which were both new and confusing given that different managers had different standards for the same thing. For example, one server was made to hold a tray in two different ways by two different managers.

(Shortform note: Guidara’s description of how the EMP team functioned when he arrived reflects what _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team _author Patrick Lencioni calls inattention to results. This is when team members focus on what’s good for _them_ rather than their _team_ —like the two managers who wanted the server to hold the tray in whatever way each one thought was right. Solving this problem requires making the expectations clear (like deciding which way to hold the tray) and linking rewards to the achievement of specific outcomes (like doing a certain task correctly) rather than vague outcomes (like “working hard”).)

After spending some time learning how EMP ran things and why it wasn’t working, Guidara’s focus turned to **clarifying and communicating the restaurant’s priorities.** Guidara started by having a daily 30-minute meeting shortly before the restaurant opened. This meeting served two important purposes: First, it made clear to the staff what they needed to know—since Guidara required the managers to share typewritten handouts that he’d pre-approved. Second, it gave Guidara a regular opportunity to reinforce the culture he was trying to build; Guidara regularly praised employees’ successes and shared stories to inspire a good night’s work.

(Shortform note: Guidara conducted meetings in a way that aligns with the experts’ recommendations for having the most efficient meeting possible. He had clear objectives for the meeting and clear indicators of success, and he insisted on having all necessary materials prepped in advance. And while experts agree that having a regular meeting helps clarify and communicate your company’s priorities, there are other methods, too. For example, you could focus on embodying those priorities yourself as a leader and instituting rewards for employees who embody your core values.)

Then, several months into his tenure, Guidara invited all the staff to a “strategic planning meeting.” He wanted the entire team to have a voice in deciding what type of restaurant they wanted to build. After some discussion, the team landed on the pillars that would define their culture—notably, excellence and hospitality. Guidara contends that these two concepts are somewhat contradictory, given that excellence involves meeting an exacting standard while hospitality involves connecting with the guest—sometimes to the detriment of that exacting standard. But acknowledging that _both_ were important gave them the tools to provide the best experience possible for their guests.

> **The Benefits and Risks of Letting Your Team Choose Your Values**
> 
> Guidara wanted the entire team to define EMP’s culture, which may have improved the effectiveness of the team. In _Smarter Faster Better_ , Charles Duhigg explains that psychological safety—the belief that you can share your opinion without being immediately rejected—is a hallmark of an effective team; you can develop this safety by demonstrating to team members that their voices matter, as Guidara did.
> 
> But what if you ask your team to name your company values, and they return with contradictory values—as Guidara’s team did? Consider following _The Happiness Trap _author Russ Harris’s advice: Define which value is most important and which is most urgent; knowing these will help you decide what to do when conflicts arise.

#### Lesson 2: Help Your Employees Succeed

Guidara knew that EMP would succeed only if they invested in the team. He assumed that most employees had _something_ valuable to offer the restaurant, so he focused on **ensuring that each employee’s position made the best use of their particular skills**. For example, Guidara noticed that one poorly performing employee had excellent organizational skills, so rather than fire the employee, he reassigned him to a position that made use of those skills.

(Shortform note: The authors of _First, Break All the Rules _agree that to maintain a strong organization, you must guide employees toward the right fit according to their talent. However, they point out that this can be easier said than done. Guidara was able to move his poorly performing employee into a different position in the company. But you may face a situation where you have an employee who’s performing _well_ in their current position but want to move up the ranks into a management role that they’re not suited for. To deal with this situation, look for alternative ways to reward employees that don’t involve promoting them into jobs they won’t do well in; for example, you might give them a raise.)

Guidara saw and took advantage of an opportunity that would both set EMP apart _and_ support his employees. He **set up “ownership programs,”** which involved giving employees full control over specific aspects of the restaurant. For example, he put the server who loved beer in charge of developing EMP’s beer program. The programs benefited everybody involved. The staff liked taking on more responsibility, Guidara’s workload was reduced, the customers enjoyed the results (like the better beer that EMP served), and the customers’ happiness reflected well on the restaurant.

(Shortform note: In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano elaborates on why giving employees full control over specific aspects of the company (as Guidara did at EMP) may improve the employees’ experience: When employees feel autonomy and are free to take risks and seek out novel solutions, they provide the change they want to see in the organization—which increases a feeling of ownership in the company. Marciano emphasizes that if you want your employees to be more autonomous, you must provide them with the information necessary to understand the goals of the organization; only then can they make independent decisions that don’t detract from the team.)

#### Lesson 3: Pay Attention to the Details

In 2006, the food critic for _The New York Times_ appeared at the restaurant for lunch. His presence signified that _Times_ might soon review EMP. The restaurant’s three-star review appeared in the _Times_ nearly a year later.

(Shortform note: The _New York Times’_ rating system maxed out at three stars until 1964, when the fourth star was added to indicate that a restaurant was “extraordinary.” The newspaper explains that the stars “reflect the reviewer’s reaction primarily to food, with ambience, service, and price taken into consideration.” The star system has received some criticism from readers given that a reviewer’s experience is highly subjective. However, the _Times_ has chosen to keep the system, noting that readers can glean more detail from the review article than from how many stars a restaurant receives.)

Guidara attributes the three stars to EMP’s continued commitment to the details, which EMP staff demonstrated in two ways.

First, EMP staff **focused on consistently mastering the smallest details.** These details didn’t seem individually important, but altogether they contributed to providing an _overall_ atmosphere of exceptional service. Guidara contends that this atmosphere was palpable not just to the guests but also to the staff and improved everybody’s experience. For example, the staff carefully curated how loudly they played the music depending on how many people were in the restaurant.

Guidara argues that seeing this consistency helped servers when they were having a difficult time due to uncontrollable circumstances—such as guests in a bad mood—as it reminded them that there were some things they still could control.

(Shortform note: Several self-help authors maintain that when you face an obstacle, you should focus on what you _can_ control rather than what you can’t. Some go even further: In _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale contends that _any obstacle is defeatable_ —as long as you _believe_ that you can surmount it. If this seems unreasonable, try to think of creative ways that you might be able to overcome the obstacle. For example, adjusting the music at EMP may have had a bigger impact than Guidara realized. Studies indicate that adjusting the volume of restaurant music can improve how good customers think the food tastes, while switching to classical music can increase customer spending.)

Second, EMP staff **followed the “one-inch rule”** that Guidara developed. Guidara points out that no matter how well you prepare something, you can mess it up at the last minute. At EMP, the staff learned to remain focused during that last “one inch” so they could execute everything __ perfectly instead of ruining something due to inattention in the final moments.

(Shortform note: It’s not always crucial to do everything perfectly or to focus on the last “one inch.”. Finishing the last details of a task may be particularly difficult for people with ADHD. If you have ADHD and struggle to complete tasks, one productivity expert recommends first envisioning what the project will look like when it’s 100% done. Then, envision what getting 90% done will look like—and re-evaluate whether completing that final 10% is worth the effort. If it isn’t, consider just not doing that final 10%, consulting with other stakeholders as necessary.)

### How Guidara Turned EMP Into a Four-Star Restaurant

Guidara wasn’t content with turning EMP into a three-star restaurant. He, along with Humm, had a larger mission: They wanted to transform the fine-dining landscape into something more modern and inclusive. To do that, they _needed_ to become a four-star restaurant, as this was the barrier to entry: Four-star restaurants are fine-dining restaurants, but three-star restaurants are not. Humm and Guidara achieved that dream in 2009, but they faced several challenges along the way. In this section, we’ll describe the lessons Guidara extracts from overcoming those challenges.

(Shortform note: Humm and Guidara’s relentless chasing of more stars worked out well for them, but this isn’t always the case. Many chefs grow so obsessed with receiving stars from various rating establishments that it damages their restaurants and their mental health, and some have even “given back” stars because the pressure to maintain their rating was overwhelming.)

#### Lesson 1: Re-evaluate Your Policies

Some of Guidara’s successes at EMP stemmed from his willingness to push back against long-standing policies. For example, all of Meyer’s restaurants closed on Thanksgiving to allow employees to spend time with their families. But in 2007, Guidara proposed that they open on the holiday, pointing out that most of EMP’s employees’ families lived far away, so they couldn’t spend the holiday with them anyway. Meyer agreed—and so EMP opened on Thanksgiving Day. Not only did Thanksgiving become a popular day at EMP, but the profits also allowed the restaurant to close for a few days in January so employees could go home to visit their families.

(Shortform note: Business experts agree that you should change policies if they’re not working in the way that you want them to. However, rather than wait for someone to notice that a policy isn’t working—the way Guidara did when he realized that keeping EMP open wouldn’t allow employees to spend time with their families—they recommend scheduling regular time every few years to re-evaluate all your policies and change the ones that are no longer useful. Remember to prioritize what _you_ and _your employees_ care about; for example, restaurant owners and employees often enjoy opening on Thanksgiving, while retailers tend to close in part because they worry that their employees will quit if forced to work.)

#### Lesson 2: Take Care of Your People

Keeping EMP open on Thanksgiving Day didn’t just make the restaurant more money; Guidara used it as an opportunity to **create a new tradition that brought the team together** by serving the staff a traditional Thanksgiving meal after the restaurant closed. By doing so, Guidara created a space where the staff could connect on a deeper level with each other—and so become a stronger team.

(Shortform note: Cultivating regular events that bring the team together may be particularly important for remote-first companies. These companies tend to prioritize regularly bringing their employees together so that they can improve their relationships by bonding in person. For best results, experts recommend _not_ packing these events with activities; providing your employees with bursts of free time allows them more opportunities to meet and get to know each other.)

In addition to creating traditions, Guidara took care of and brought together his team in two more notable ways. First, he **systematized asking for help**. At EMP, a server who was struggling could touch her lapel and immediately receive assistance from somebody who noticed this distress call. Guidara contends that introducing this code made it easier to ask for help—and so made it more likely that the employees who needed help would _actually_ ask for it, which reduced overwhelm and potential burnout.

(Shortform note: Many people struggle to ask for help because they fear that doing so will make them come across as inconsiderate. But at EMP, creating a non-verbal system of asking for assistance helped tackle this fear. Not only did employees have an easy time _asking_ for help, but employees were also easily able to _offer_ help—and employees who felt inconsiderate asking for help felt less inconsiderate if they regularly helped others.)

Second, he **learned how to convey criticism.** Guidara argues that criticism is a necessary part of managing people, as it demonstrates that you care about how well they do. But not all criticism is created equal. People receive criticism in different ways; some people need to be yelled at, some need a rational explanation, and some need a gentle rebuke. As a manager, it’s up to you to personalize how you deliver criticism in the way that your team member is most amenable to it.

(Shortform note: In The Culture Map, Erin Meyer also highlights the necessity of delivering negative feedback in a way the listener understands. She explains that in some countries (like the United States), people tend to deliver negative feedback _directly_ and explicitly. But in other countries, they tend to deliver negative feedback _indirectly_ , often couching these messages in positive affirmations and mitigating language. Understanding your feedback-receiver’s type is crucial: If you deliver indirect feedback to someone who’s used to direct feedback, they may not realize you’re criticizing them. Conversely, delivering direct feedback to someone who’s used to indirect feedback may make you seem cruel.)

#### Lesson 3: Highlight Your People

In 2008, EMP decided to apply to join Relais & Châteaux, a prestigious restaurant organization, but the restaurant missed the application deadline. Boulud offered to ask the group to consider EMP anyway, and he brought in two rock star chefs—Thomas Keller and Patrick O’Connell—so that all three could ask together. Guidara noticed how awestruck his team was at these chefs’ presence and realized how much this validation boosted their morale. (The chefs loved the restaurant, and EMP was accepted into Relais & Châteaux).

(Shortform note: In _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell argues that people who succeed earlier in life have an advantage, as these early opportunities tend to snowball into larger advantages. EMP’s addition to Relais & Châteaux may be an example: Had Guidara not met and befriended Boulud while at Cornell, he may not have had the connection necessary to apply to the organization even though they’d missed the deadline, and he might not have seen the validating impact that bringing in Keller and O’Connell had on his team.)

As a result, Guidara started to **share external praise** of his team members with the team member in question. This included having media personalities speak with the most relevant team members—even if that wasn’t Guidara. These actions helped his team members gain recognition and further supported their growth.

(Shortform note: In _Extreme Ownership_ , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin elaborate on why you should pass on praise to the relevant team members. By directing praise to your team, you set the tone for everyone on the team that success is achieved as a unit, creating a culture that’s focused on the good of the team.)

#### Lesson 4: Find the Silver Lining

In November 2008, the world plunged into a financial crisis—and took EMP along with it. Due to the shaky economy, EMP’s usual customers cut back on expensive meals. The restaurant survived only because EMP owned Shake Shack, a casual fast-food USHG restaurant that exploded in popularity because it was now a cheaper option in the area.

However, Guidara learned to **find the silver lining** in these financially challenging times. For example, EMP started a $29 lunch special. This allowed young people who couldn’t previously afford EMP to eat at the restaurant—and in later years, many of these people became more financially successful and continued patronizing the restaurant.

> **What You Can Learn From How EMP Survived the Financial Crisis**
> 
> Guidara doesn’t detail just how badly EMP was doing financially during this time. The restaurant’s struggles after the 2008 crash were amplified by the fact that EMP had undergone a several-hundred-thousand-dollar renovation shortly before the financial crisis hit, and despite Shake Shack’s support, EMP was still losing money in 2009. However, EMP knew that to get four stars, the _Times’_ food critic had to think the restaurant was doing well. So they didn’t just rely on attracting customers with a budget lunch special; the restaurant staff packed the dining room with friends on nights they suspected the critic might appear.
> 
> So if you’re struggling as an entrepreneur, consider relying on your friends. Even if they can’t help you financially, they can provide essential moral support during tough times. And take a cue from EMP and focus on developing relationships, since most of your business will come from repeat customers, who tend to spend more per visit.

### How Guidara Turned EMP Into the World’s Best Restaurant

In 2010—one year after EMP earned its fourth star—the restaurant was nominated for the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Guidara and Humm were initially thrilled…but then mortified at the awards ceremony when they discovered that they had only received 50th place. This embarrassment prompted Guidara to commit to making EMP the world’s best restaurant by cultivating a culture of “unreasonable hospitality”—a commitment that ultimately led to EMP winning World’s Best Restaurant in 2017.

(Shortform note: When you compare yourself to others who are doing better than you, you’re engaging in “upward social comparison.” This can inspire positive outcomes, as it did for Guidara and Humm, who channeled their feelings of inadequacy into transforming EMP’s culture so they could ultimately win World’s Best Restaurant. However, upward social comparison sometimes also has negative effects; comparing yourself to others can damage your mental health and even make you try to undermine the efforts of those who are doing better than you are.)

In this section, we’ll share how Guidara and Humm successfully transformed EMP into the world’s best restaurant and the lessons they learned along the way.

#### Lesson 1: Get Creative

As we learned previously, Guidara defines “unreasonable hospitality” as a level of dedication to providing guests with a fantastic experience that stretches the limits of what seems sensible. However, Guidara saw an inherent tension between this concept and running a food business. After all, as a customer, you purchase the experience at restaurants—but the act of purchasing detracts from the hospitality of this experience by highlighting that you’re exchanging money for a service rather than making a connection.

As a result, Guidara decided to hide everything that felt too businesslike and detracted from the experience of hospitality. This required him to**get creative in unexpected areas**. For example, the most businesslike element of a meal at the restaurant is when you pay for it. To make that a hospitable experience, Guidara decided that when each table received a check, they’d also receive a full bottle of nice cognac and instructions to have as much as they liked. As a result, even receiving the check felt like a nice gesture because it was combined with a gift.

> **Does Guidara’s System Work in Other Restaurants?**
> 
> Guidara works extensively to hide the financial aspect of hospitality and emphasize the connection between the restaurant and its guests. However, one writer contends in a 2023 piece that restaurant guests have become increasingly demanding, and service industry professionals must present clear boundaries to protect themselves. For example, in contrast to Guidara hiding the check with a cognac bottle, several high-end restaurants now demand money _before_ diners even arrive with a non-refundable deposit meant to prevent no-shows.
> 
> Guidara’s creativity regarding hiding the businesslike aspects of the restaurant may have only worked because he had few financial worries (like no-shows); by 2012, EMP had a 200-person waiting list every night.

#### Lesson 2: Systematize Gifts

As Guidara was looking for ways to provide unreasonable hospitality, he overheard a table of tourists who’d chosen EMP for their last meal in New York. The group mentioned that they’d eaten everything they’d wanted to eat—except for a classic New York hot dog. So Guidara ran out to purchase some, had Humm plate them, and served these hot dogs to the guests as one of their courses, explaining to them that he’d overheard their conversation and wanted to provide them with the best possible experience. The delight of the guests convinced Gudiara that this was something he should be doing regularly—and so Guidara systematized such gifts in two ways.

(Shortform note: The hot dog story appeared in several news outlets as a prime example of how unreasonable hospitality can transform the customer experience, but not everybody was impressed. One blogger contended that this story was _only_ impressive because EMP had an impressive backdrop with which to serve the hot dog, writing that “It’s patronizing for Guidara to behave as though a $2 hot dog can make everyone a hospitality hero.”)

First, he **created a position dedicated to providing unexpected gifts**. Guidara understood that, while a meal at a restaurant is by definition consumed, the guests could relive their restaurant experience as long as they had a great story to tell. As a result, he started hiring “Dreamweavers”—people whose job it was to research the guests beforehand or listen during their meals and provide personalized touches to awe the guests and give them a great story. For example, the Dreamweavers turned the private dining room into a makeshift beach for a couple who unexpectedly couldn’t make their planned beach vacation.

(Shortform note: EMP wasn’t the only restaurant of its day to collect personal data on its customers. Boulud’s restaurant installed cameras in the dining room so that staff could serve the next course at the perfect time. And while Guidara touts only the benefits of paying close attention to your customers, some people may feel uncomfortable if you give them gifts based on information they didn’t share with you—like the fact that they were going on a beach vacation. This concern may be relevant even if you don't have full-time staff dedicated to providing personalized service. For example, a customer who uses a QR code-based menu may unwittingly provide that restaurant with personal information they didn’t mean to share.)

Second, Guidara **created standard gifts for repeatable moments.** The personal nature of the Dreamweavers’ gifts sometimes meant that they were expensive, but Guidara found a more budget-minded way to systematize gifts. He looked for repeatable moments—the memorable things that happened regularly at the restaurant—and created standard gifts for those moments. For example, many couples got engaged at EMP. So Guidara partnered with Tiffany to create custom champagne flutes; he’d pour them a champagne toast in the flutes at EMP and gift them the flutes in Tiffany boxes.

(Shortform note: Guidara’s concept of budget-minded gifts is inaccessible to many people. In 2023, a pair of regular champagne flutes from Tiffany retailed for $125—which is still a bargain compared to the nearly thousand-dollar price tag of dining at EMP in 2012. If you’re financially unable to provide extra gifts for the repeatable moments in your business, consider upgrading the gifts you already provide. For example, many companies provide branded swag at events to increase brand awareness or to advertise to new customers. In that case, a well-thought-out (branded) party favor—like a high-end water bottle—will likely have a bigger impact than cheaper swag (like a plastic pen).)

#### Lesson 3: Educate Your Employees

In 2010, Guidara and Humm received an offer to run The NoMad, a restaurant in a new luxury hotel opening a few streets away from EMP. Guidara and Humm were thrilled at the opportunity to bring fine dining back to hotels, whose restaurants had depreciated in quality over the years. However, Meyer couldn’t justify allowing the pair to run EMP while also owning a competing restaurant nearby—and offered to sell EMP to them instead. Guidara and Humm agreed to the sale and by 2012, they were running both The NoMad and EMP under the umbrella of their new company, Make It Nice.

(Shortform note: Guidara and Humm‘s success with The NoMad sparked a trend of hiring famous chefs at hotel restaurants. But it may never have occurred if Meyer hadn’t predicted the challenges he might face: In a _New York Times_ interview, Meyer explained that he agreed to sell EMP in part because he didn't want to try to re-invent the restaurant without Humm and Guidara.)

The NoMad received three stars in its first _New York Times_ review—a feat Guidara attributes largely to how successfully the employees quickly embodied the team’s culture of unreasonable hospitality. To achieve this, Guidara prioritized **educating the new employees.** He spent a lot of time training the staff—both by providing booklets on the culture and bringing in mostly long-time EMP employees to manage The NoMad—so that they could embody Make It Nice’s culture effectively from the first day the restaurant was open.

(Shortform note: In _What You Do Is Who You Are_ , Ben Horowitz contends that a company’s culture derives from what leaders state explicitly and also what they enforce implicitly. Guidara exemplified both: He _explicitly_ told The NoMad’s team what the culture was by providing them with a culture booklet and _implicitly_ taught them the culture by bringing in long-time EMP employees. Without both, The NoMad might not have developed the culture that garnered them three stars. In _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ , Clayton Christensen warns that if leaders define a culture but don't embody or enforce it, the company will evolve a different culture based on the priorities and processes that have worked and become embedded.)

#### Lesson 4: Acknowledge Your Failings

Despite The NoMad’s success, it wasn’t all smooth sailing back at EMP. While opening The NoMad, Guidara remained general manager of EMP because he didn’t think anybody else was prepared for the job. But the EMP team struggled to move forward without a clear supervisor to make the final call on important decisions. Guidara finally agreed to promote a longtime employee to GM after a tough conversation with a friend and colleague led him to realize that his decision not to promote anyone was doing the EMP team a disservice.

EMP also faced a blow after receiving terrible press in September 2012. The _Times_ published an unflattering column after the restaurant introduced a new tasting menu, which the servers delivered with a memorized speech about each dish. (Fortunately, the column wasn’t an official review that would have done far more damage to the business.)

Guidara learned from both these incidents to **acknowledge his failings** so that he could work around them. Both his refusal to promote anyone to GM of EMP and his demand that the servers memorize a speech to share with guests demonstrated a lack of trust in his employees: He didn’t trust anybody to run EMP, and he didn’t trust his servers to judge how much information individual customers wanted to learn about each dish. So Guidara learned that he was too much of a perfectionist and needed to let go and give his team the control they needed to do their jobs well.

> **The Hidden Benefits of Perfectionism and How to Combat It Anyway**
> 
> In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown argues that perfectionism is often an attempt to try to control other people’s perceptions of you. So while it was perfectionism that caused Guidara to make decisions that damaged the health of his restaurants, one could argue that this same perfectionism was what caused him to reverse course, given that he gave his employees more responsibility only after it became apparent that other people (specifically, the EMP team and the _Times_ critic) had developed a poor perception of him.
> 
> Guidara caught his perfectionism in time, but not all leaders do. In _The Laws of Human Nature_ , Robert Greene warns that perfectionist leaders often burn out because they spend so much time trying to control everything. So if you’re a perfectionist leader and want to follow Guidara’s example by giving your employees greater control, look for signs that they’re ready—such as doing well in their current role and being eager to take on more responsibility.

#### Lesson 5: Keep Evolving

By 2015, EMP was thriving. After taking the criticism they’d received in 2012 to heart, the restaurant’s popularity had exploded and it rose in the World’s Best Restaurant ranking every year. So Guidara was disappointed when their ranking slid for the first time—going from fourth to fifth place. This disappointment prompted Guidara to re-evaluate the restaurant. After he and Humm shared a meal at EMP, they realized the problem. In their chase to become the world’s best restaurant, they’d added on so many elements that they were disrupting the diners’ ability to enjoy their meal.

So EMP evolved again. But this time, instead of _adding_ elements, Guidara removed them, keeping only those that embodied the culture of unreasonable hospitality to its fullest. For example, they realized that serving a pre-set menu and not allowing the guest to decide what they wanted to eat wasn’t a hospitable practice. So instead, they served a meal based on a pre-meal conversation with the guest where she explained what she was and wasn’t in the mood for. These changes allowed Guidara to finally provide the fantastic experience he’d been aiming for—and in 2017, his efforts were rewarded when EMP was voted the World’s’ Best Restaurant.

> **How Others Respond to Criticism**
> 
> By revisiting and changing aspects of EMP after their disappointing ranking, Guidara and Humm embodied what _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ author Dale Carnegie implies is the ideal response to criticism. Carnegie contends that the best way to deal with justified criticism is to recognize that it’s a valuable learning opportunity. The EMP owners recognized that the criticism was legitimate and used it as a jumping-off point to re-evaluate and adapt their actions.
> 
> Not all restaurant owners reacted the same way. In 2019, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants chose not to allow previous #1 restaurants on the list; in other words, Eleven Madison Park can never again be the World’s Best Restaurant. This decision was criticized in part because it was proposed by chefs whose restaurants’ rankings had fallen (and their reputations along with it).
