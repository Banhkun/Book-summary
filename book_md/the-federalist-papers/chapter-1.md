## Chapter 1: The Case for the Union (Essays 1-14)

**The adoption of the proposed Constitution was necessary for the preservation of the Union and the safeguarding of the liberties won during the Revolutionary War.** Indeed,**** the successful ratification of the Constitution was a great moral and philosophical test for the young nation. Crucial questions hung in the balance. Were human beings capable of designing a government that properly protected liberties _and_ promoted national welfare? Or were they destined to devolve into despotism and disunion?

While the opponents of the Constitution may have been motivated by genuine conviction, they were wrong to fear that the strong central government it sought to establish would, by definition, infringe upon their liberties. Instead, historical experience had shown that it was the _lack_ of a strong government that posed the greatest threat to human freedom.

In this section, we will explore why the preservation of the Union was so important—and why the Constitution was the best way to maintain it.

### The Necessity of the Union

**The prosperity and freedom of the American people depended upon the continuance of the Union.** Surprisingly, however, many politicians were questioning the usefulness of political unity in the years after independence. But this skepticism flew in the face of the American historical experience.

The country had _always_ been linked by a generally shared political and cultural connection to a common British heritage, similar political institutions between the colonies, and a high degree of economic interdependence (aided by North America’s navigable rivers, which boosted commerce). Moreover, it was only through military and political cooperation that the colonies had been able to win the war and free themselves from the oppression of the British crown.

In short, the Union had been the truest safeguard of American liberties in the past; it would continue to be so in the future. The only alternative to the Union was political dissolution into rival confederacies of states, which would represent the death of the young nation and the failure of the republican experiment.

### National Security and the Prevention of War

To see why the Union was so vital, let’s examine its role in enabling the government to fulfill one of its most elemental functions—securing the safety of its citizens. **The Union, bound together by a strong national government, was far less likely to start wars than small states or confederations of states.**

This was because smaller confederations would each be pursuing their own interests and independent policies. Unconstrained by the steadying hand of a unifying federal government, they would be free to act aggressively toward other nations, provoking more wars.

This was no mere thought experiment. Overzealous states had _already_ put the nation at risk by provoking conflicts with the Native Americans. Indeed, the majority of armed skirmishes between white settlers and Native Americans had been at the instigation of individual states— _not_ the national government (feeble as it was under the Articles of Confederation). This danger of warfare remained high, considering that many states shared land borders with French, British, and Spanish territory.

Of course, the danger went the _other_ way as well—**foreign powers would be more easily able to exploit weak confederations that were not supported by a strong federal government**. Such confederations would lack the financial resources to levy armies and navies to prevent or turn back the aggressive actions of other countries. Moreover, states or confederations would have little reason to aid their neighbors in a war against a foreign power, because they would barely be part of the same political nation. Foreign nations, of course, would be well aware of this state of disunity and would eagerly seek to exploit it by playing the rival confederacies against one another—creating more conditions for war.

**Thus, unity was crucial to national defense, prosperity, and the protection of liberty**. As a historical parallel, Great Britain would never have become a world power if its military and financial resources had remained divided between the constituent nations of England, Scotland, and Wales. A national government would be able to better provide for the national defense, because it would have the resources to combine the various state militias, levy a national army, and collect the revenue to maintain a strong navy to protect American commerce on the high seas. These would act as deterrents, preventing other nations from behaving aggressively toward the United States.

A national government would also be more cautious and broad-minded in its conduct toward other nations because it would be less beholden to local interests and parties than the states. It would be able to act with more singular purpose and adequately defend _all_ the states, thereby reducing the likelihood of war for each of them.

#### The Danger of Commercial War

**There was no reason to believe, as many opponents of the Constitution did, that a commercial republic like the United States would be less prone to foreign wars than a monarchy**. Republics, because they contain representative institutions, are liable to be driven to acts of aggression when the people become impassioned by some perceived slight against them; and commercial rivalry had historically been just as much a cause of war as had royal vanity.

Indeed, commercial republics like the Netherlands, Venice, and even ancient Athens had been constantly at war with their neighbors. In a disunited America, mutually hostile confederations would inevitably come to seek the aid of foreign powers in order to secure advantage over their rivals. They might even invite foreign armies to land on American soil to defeat their neighbors. Thus, America would become like Europe—a war-torn continent of competing nations, each meddling in the others’ internal affairs.

#### The Threat of Civil War

The states themselves, if split into confederations, would devolve into mutual hostilities, particularly as some would inevitably grow to be stronger and more powerful than others. If history was any guide, they would quickly find themselves in competition with one another for scarce resources and resort to warfare.

**If the Union were dissolved, the vast tracts of western lands, subject to competing claims by the states, would rapidly become the focus of war.** History again showed that territorial disputes were one of the main causes of conflict. Publius did not have to imagine such a scenario taking place in North America—it was _already_ happening, with hotly contested disputes between New York and the states of New England over land in what later became the state of Vermont.

#### Against Standing Armies

The proponents of disunion feared the encroachments of strong central government, most dreadfully represented by the institution of standing armies.**But disunion wouldn’t prevent the formation of standing armies—in fact, it would all but _guarantee_ it.**

If the Union were to devolve into a smaller set of rival confederacies, each of those confederacies would be faced with the constant threat of military encroachment by the others. Under such circumstances, it would become necessary for each of them to raise standing armies, to be ready to defend their nation at a moment’s notice. This would again transform America into something like continental Europe—a political landscape marked by a series of heavily armed kingdoms and petty republics, where the soldier was elevated above the citizen. This development would naturally be dangerous to republican values.

By contrast, a strong Union would have no need to maintain a large standing army. It would not face internal threats, and the physical distance from Europe and its colonies would likewise make external threats unlikely. Local militias, run by free citizens, would be sufficient to maintain order.

#### A Strong Navy

**A strong federal government would also have better resources to build and equip a navy.** The navy would bring an economic stimulus to the states that provided the materials and labor for its construction.

In addition, it would serve to protect American merchant seamen from the privations of European navies on the high seas, who often treated American cargo ships as objects of plunder.

### Against Factions

**A** **large and strong Union, comprising all the states, was the best remedy against the dangers of factionalism**. A faction is any group of citizens, whether they constitute a majority or a minority, who seek to advance their interests and passions without regard to the rights and interests of others.

_Any_ republican form of government, of course, would give rise to factions, because factions are a natural by-product of human nature. They spring from the innumerable sources of division between groups of people in a society, like language, geography, or religion. One of the main sources of division is wealth and property—between those who have them and those who don’t. The haves will always seek to preserve what they have; the have-nots will always aim to acquire what they don’t have. The only way to _entirely_ remove factions from public life would be to remove liberty and free government entirely, something that would be antithetical to the principles upon which the nation was founded.

#### Democracy vs. Republic

Given the unavoidable nature of factions in a republican system of government, it was better to look for ways to control and minimize their most harmful effects. One of the best ways to illustrate how to do this is to compare the operations of a direct democracy with those of a representative republic.

A direct democracy, in which the people themselves meet in person to make political decisions, is only practicable in small communities. Because of this smallness, however, a majority faction will likely come to dominate, trampling upon the liberties of the minority.

A republic, by contrast, can work successfully over a larger geographical area comprising a larger number of people. This is because decisions are made by _representatives_ meeting in a designated capital, not by the people themselves in person. **In a republic, popular passions are filtered through and tempered by more sober-minded representatives, making it harder for any single faction to achieve dominant status.**

Moreover, representatives in a large republic have to take into account the views of a more diverse set of citizens, further making it unlikely that a single faction will come to dominate the society.

#### Strength in Numbers

This logic extended to the Union created by the proposed Constitution. A large and populous country like the United States would be safer from tyrannical factions within the Union than it would be if it were split into a number of petty confederacies.

Even if a faction seized control in one of the states, the largeness of the Union would make it difficult for it to extend that domination over _other_ states, let alone _all_ of them. The size of the political community itself limited the spread of the political contagion.

Every state and every citizen stood to gain from joining together in a strong federal government. With many states bordering on what were then foreign lands, they would be better protected if they were part of the Union. Moreover, the American people had more that united them than divided them. As majority Western European Protestants, they mostly shared a common language, ancestry, and religion. Furthermore, they shared the heritage of struggle and sacrifice during the Revolution. _These_ were the ties that would strongly bind the young nation together.

### The Economic Case for the Union

**Disunion would also have harmful effects on the economy.** Rich states like New York would be able to extract extortionary customs duties and fees on their smaller and weaker neighbors like Connecticut and New Jersey, inhibiting commerce between states.

There would also be no effective mechanism for paying back or apportioning the national debt. If the states were only joined in a loose league rather than a compact union, the individual states would be extremely reluctant to contribute money to help pay the debts of _other_ states.

This would be especially true considering the fact that _any_ apportionment of the national debt among the states of the confederacy would be unequal. The highly indebted states would be clamoring to offload their debt onto the others; the less-indebted states would be unwilling to contribute money to help the others. As a result, debts would go into default. This would have a harmful effect on the establishment of strong national credit.

#### Uniform Commercial Policy

**A strong Union, by contrast, would enhance trade both between the states and between the United States and other nations.**

Under the Union, the states would not be able to place restrictions on each other’s goods, boosting free trade. Scarcities of a commodity in one state would be remedied by its residents being able to purchase that commodity from another state that had it in abundance.

By enabling the United States to act with a unified commercial policy, the Union would also give the nation greater leverage in its economic relations with other countries and enable it to secure more favorable terms of trade. For example, if it were acting as a single entity, the United States could credibly threaten to block British access to American markets unless the British government allowed American merchant seamen access to British markets on favorable terms. But in a state of disunion, this would be impossible. European colonial powers would always be able to undercut any of the states or confederacies in trade by playing them against one another.

#### Better Revenue Collection

**A strong Union would also provide better and more efficient means of revenue collection than would a series of independent or semi-independent states.** Given the difficulty and cost of assessing and collecting direct taxes (like income taxes) in the 18th century, most states raised revenue from _indirect_ taxes, mainly in the form of duties on imported goods.

But if _each_ of the 13 states were independent, they would _each_ be levying their own customs duties. This would be burdensome for merchants and would give strong incentive for evasion. Moreover, the sheer size of the land borders between states, the existence of a common language, and the availability of navigable rivers would make it far too easy for merchants to evade state customs duties. Therefore, even if each state spent extraordinary (and duplicative) resources to crack down on this contraband trade, they would still only apprehend a small number of illegal traders and remain perpetually short of crucial revenue.

By contrast, a strong federal government would only need to patrol goods coming into the country from Europe via the Atlantic Ocean. This would be a much simpler task that could be done with a minimal amount of force and at much less expense. Merchants would thus have to contend with only one customs regime, rather than 13, which would stimulate trade. This stimulation of trade would further enhance revenue for the federal government.
