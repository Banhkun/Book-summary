## Chapter 5 Part 2: Structure of the New Constitution (Essays 67-85)

In this chapter, we’ll continue our analysis of the structure of the new federal government. In particular, we’ll outline the main functions and responsibilities of the presidency and examine the role of the federal judiciary in the new constitutional system. We’ll also look at the important issue of why the original draft of the Constitution contained no bill of rights—and what its supporters and detractors thought about this omission.

### The Presidency

**The presidency, the chief executive of the federal government, was perhaps the most controversial and hotly contested feature of the Constitution.** The president would have the power to:

  * Veto bills passed by both houses of Congress, thus serving as an important check on legislative power;
  * Propose legislation;
  * Negotiate treaties;
  * Nominate executive officials and federal judges;
  * Make temporary appointments when Congress was not in session;
  * Adjourn Congress when it could not agree on a time of adjournment;
  * Issue pardons, except in cases of impeachment; and
  * Direct and oversee the armed forces as commander-in-chief



Anti-Federalist critics argued that these powers rendered the office tantamount to a monarch, a supreme and unaccountable despot dressed up in republican garb. But this was patently false. The President was nothing like a king—and attempts to mischaracterize the office as such were nothing more than demagogic efforts by the Constitution’s opponents to mislead the public.

#### A Chief Magistrate, Not a King

**Despite the considerable powers of the presidency, the office’s authority was heavily restricted by the provisions of the Constitution.** Unlike a monarchy, the presidency was _not_ a hereditary office conferred upon the incumbent by right of birth and held for life; instead, the president was elected (albeit indirectly) by the people through the Electoral College and served a fixed term of four years. Presidents could run for reelection as many times as they wished, but, unlike a king, would face political competition for their office.

The specific powers of the president, meanwhile, differed in important respects from those of European monarchs. The king of Great Britain’s veto was final; that of the president could be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in each house of Congress. The veto was nevertheless an important check on the power of the legislative branch, one that would prevent Congress from passing bad laws or waging constitutional warfare against the other branches.

Publius reckoned, however, that presidential vetoes would be rare. Even the all-powerful British monarch almost never invoked his absolute veto power over laws passed by both houses of Parliament. It was unlikely, therefore, that a president, operating under much greater institutional constraints, would be _more_ aggressive in his use of this power. Indeed, critics were more likely to accuse the President of vetoing bills too _infrequently_.

Although the President could negotiate treaties on his or her sole authority, **all treaties needed to receive the approval of the Senate before becoming law**. Kings faced no such check on their power in this regard.

Similarly, all presidential appointments had to be confirmed by the Senate. The king, meanwhile, could freely appoint favorites and cronies to councils of state and even confer lands and titles of hereditary nobility without Parliament’s assent.

While the President could adjourn Congress, this could only be done when both houses of Congress failed to reach agreement _about when to adjourn_. On no other occasion could the president exercise such a power. By contrast, the British monarch could prorogue Parliament at will.

**The presidential pardon power was likewise, constrained by the Constitution**. Importantly, the president could not issue pardons in cases of impeachment. This meant that he would not be able to inoculate his co-conspirators in high crimes and misdemeanors for which they had been duly punished by Congress. But it was nevertheless important to vest the pardon power in the executive branch. The legislative branch, composed of representatives of many parties and factions, would be less able to use the pardon power fairly, especially in situations of national insurrection. A single, more sober-minded executive would be able to wield their pardons more justly, wisely, and effectively.

Lastly, while the president would be commander-in-chief of the armed forces, his power to use them would be greatly constrained by Congress. **The president would have no power to raise armies, levy the taxes necessary to pay for them, and, most importantly, declare war without Congress.**

Hardly a monarch, the powers of and constraints upon the president were broadly similar to those of state governors all across the country, including New York and Massachusetts. A robust system of checks and balances ensured that the presidency would not become too powerful.

#### A Unitary Executive

Some opponents of the new Constitution feared that it was dangerous to place executive authority in the hands of one individual. But this was the only way such authority could properly be wielded. **Experiments in government by committee had proven unsuccessful** , whether with the consuls of ancient Rome or with the executive councils that had existed in some of the states and colonies.

In times of great national emergency, such as war, executive councils failed to move with the necessary speed and decisiveness required for effective action. They tended to be torn by rival factions and forced to settle on compromise solutions to pressing issues.

Furthermore, they made it difficult for the public to properly assign blame or credit for acts of government—a crucial right in a free republic. People would never be sure which factions or individuals on the executive council were responsible for which decisions.

With the checks on executive authority we described earlier in the chapter, it was clear that the President would not become too powerful. It was unnecessary, therefore (and dangerous) to dilute the power of the chief executive by placing it in multiple hands.

#### Continuance in Office

**It was also important that the president be elected to a term that was long enough for him to gain sufficient experience with national administration**. Having a fixed, four-year term would provide the young nation with the stability and predictability in government that it had so sorely lacked under the Articles of Confederation.

There was little to fear in this, as many state constitutions elected their governors to even _longer_ terms. If the people disapproved of the president’s performance, they were free to vote him out at the next election.

**The ability of the president to run for reelection was also essential to effective government.** If the President was barred from maintaining his office past the next election, he would have little motivation to do it effectively. After all, there would be no reward for good performance.

Term limits deprived the people of the option to reelect presidents of whom they approved. Imposing term limits would hamper the effectiveness of the executive branch (making the president a lame-duck the second he assumed office), introduce destabilizing inconsistency in government, and deprive the nation of the talents of capable officials who had proven themselves to be effective leaders.

(Shortform note: These warnings against presidential term limits went unheeded almost immediately. George Washington began an informal precedent of only serving two terms, one that was followed by every president for nearly 150 years, until Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940 and a fourth in 1944. The Twenty-Second Amendment, passed in 1951, gave Washington’s precedent the force of law, limiting presidents to two terms in office.)

### The Judiciary

The third branch of government, the judiciary, is unique. Unlike the executive branch, it possesses no army, navy, or other powers of enforcement to compel adherence to its decisions. Unlike the legislature, it has no direct power of the purse.

**Despite these limitations to its practical power, the courts are powerful and important players on the constitutional system.** They are the referees, policing the conduct of the other two branches with respect to the Constitution.

#### Judicial Review

**The way that the federal courts exercise this power is through judicial review.** This is the power of the courts to declare null and void those laws or executive orders that are in violation of the Constitution. For example, the Constitution expressly prohibits Congress from passing any bills of attainder—that is, a bill declaring an individual guilty of some offense without recourse to a trial, and punishing them accordingly. If Congress were to pass and the president sign such a law, the judiciary would have a duty to declare it unconstitutional.

In general, the federal courts rule on matters pertaining to the Constitution, the laws of the United States, treaties, matters arising on the high seas, cases involving ambassadors or citizens of other countries, and disputes between the states or between citizens of different states.

**The state courts could not be trusted to be impartial in cases to which the states themselves were parties.** Such cases could only be fairly handled by the federal court system, whose judges would have no particular loyalty to any state. There would also be occasions in which federal courts would rule on matters pertaining to state laws themselves. Typically, these would involve cases where states had passed laws that they were prohibited from passing by the Constitution (such as laying customs duties on imports from other states, as we discussed in Chapter 3). In such cases, the federal courts would have the power and duty to declare such laws unconstitutional.

Judicial review would serve as a powerful check on both the executive and legislative branches. While courts generally do not have many formal powers to enforce their rulings, Congress and the president have historically complied with court orders, even when they disagreed with them.

(Shortform note: Compliance with court rulings is an important norm, or unwritten law, of democratic governance. When players in the system begin disregarding rulings that they dislike, it threatens to undermine the entire system. For a fuller discussion of the importance of governing norms in healthy democracies, read our summary of How Democracies Die.)

#### Lifetime Appointment

Given its crucial function, and judges’ comparative lack of enforcement power, **it was important that the judiciary be independent from the executive and legislative branches.**

This was to ensure that these latter branches wouldn’t be able to use either military or police force (in the case of the executive) or financial incentives and threats (in the case of the legislature) to sway judicial decisions. This is why the Constitution mandates that judicial salaries cannot be reduced during a judge’s time of service, thereby removing the possibility of legislators blackmailing judges to obtain favorable rulings.

Most importantly, judges were to serve for life, provided that they maintained “good behavior” on the bench. Absent any egregious offenses like soliciting bribes, which would violate the Good Behavior Clause, judicial appointments would be permanent.

(Shortform note: Impeachment by Congress of federal judges has proven exceedingly rare. As of 2020, only 15 judges—and zero Supreme Court justices—have been impeached, most of them on charges related to bribery and making false statements.)

There are good reasons for this. **Judges were meant to make their rulings solely on the Constitution, not for political considerations**. If they had to be renominated and re-confirmed, they might feel the need to curry favor with Congress and the president, which could exert a corrupting influence on their jurisprudence. Likewise, if they had to stand for direct election by the people, they might improperly make popular opinion—not constitutional law—the basis of their rulings.

#### The Supreme Court

**The highest court in the land was to be the United States Supreme Court.** While Congress was authorized to create and abolish inferior federal courts (like regional district courts and appellate courts), the Supreme Court was created by the Constitution itself to be the final arbiter of legal controversies.

In the main, the Supreme Court acted as an _appellate_ court—issuing final rulings (for those cases it chose to hear) on cases that had worked their way through the inferior federal courts. The only cases where the Supreme Court would have _original_ jurisdiction would be cases involving ambassadors or cases in which a state was a party to a suit.

Publius rejected the argument that there should be no supreme judicial tribunal and that the final arbiter should be the Senate (similar to the role performed by the House of Lords in Great Britain). This would have been a clear violation of the principle of separation of powers. It was incompatible with free government to have the same body that had a decisive role in _creating_ laws to have the final say in _interpreting_ those laws.

Moreover, people would not necessarily be elected to legislative bodies for their independence or strict adherence to constitutional principles; rather, they would often be regional or party favorites. As elected politicians (who would be up for reelection), they would therefore be more likely to base their judicial decisions on improper political considerations.

#### Trial by Jury

**The Constitution guaranteed a trial by jury to all defendants who requested one—but only in criminal cases**(involving offenses against the state)**.** There was no such provision for civil cases (involving private disputes between individuals).

This led critics and opponents of the Constitution to fear that the document explicitly _prohibited_ trial by jury in civil cases. But Publius argued that this was faulty reasoning. Just because a right was not expressly _guaranteed_ did not mean that it was _denied_.

Furthermore, it was not clear that trial by jury in civil matters was, in fact, desirable. Would _every_ petty civil dispute require a jury to be empaneled, at great cost to the public? Moreover, many civil cases involved highly specialized areas of law, such as probate or admiralty law. In such cases, it was questionable whether juries would have the necessary expertise or judgment to render sound verdicts.

Even in _criminal_ appellate courts, many jurisdictions did not use trial by jury. Instead, they relied upon a single judge or panel of judges. Universal trial by jury in civil cases was not a realistic standard, nor was it one that had precedent, either in the states or Great Britain.

Most of the states already used special tribunals, not juries, to adjudicate civil cases. Therefore, it made little sense to hold the federal judicial system to a standard that wasn’t being held by the states.

### No Bill of Rights?

**One of the primary objections to the Constitution was that it contained no bill of rights.** Publius, however, argued that a Bill of Rights was entirely unnecessary. The Constitution _already_ guaranteed the liberties that such a bill would plausibly contain.

  * Trial by jury in criminal cases;
  * A prohibition on bills of attainder and _ex post facto_ laws (laws that criminalize and punish an action _after_ its commission);
  * A guarantee of _habeas corpus_ (the requirement that a person under arrest be brought before a judge) except in cases where the country was under attack or insurrection
  * A prohibition against the conferral of any titles of nobility; and
  * A guarantee that impeachment could only result in removal from office



The Constitution already incorporated common law principles from English law, as well as long-established guarantees of political rights that existed in the state constitutions. Moreover, many state constitutions themselves lacked a bill of rights. It made little sense, therefore, to demand one from the US Constitution.

(Shortform note: Despite these arguments, even many supporters of the Constitution—including _Federalist Papers_ co-author James Madison—argued that a bill of rights _was_ crucial to secure those liberties that the Constitution did not explicitly protect. The United States Bill of Rights was ultimately ratified in 1791 as the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Among other liberties, they guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, due process, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to bear arms.)

### An Efficient Government

Critics also feared that the new federal government would be too costly. But on this point, there was also little cause for concern. Many government functions assigned to the federal government under the Constitution were already being done by the states under the Articles of Confederation. Taxpayers might end up paying more for the federal government, but they would pay less for their state governments. It might have represented a change in paymasters, but not an increase in _total_ costs.

Because much of the day-to-day administration would be done by the president, Congress (which had housed both legislative and executive functions under the Articles of Confederation and was therefore in constant session) would be able to adjourn more frequently. A part-time legislature would be a less burdensome public expense than a full-time one.

Lastly, **state legislatures would be freed from having to handle national business** , as they would no longer be the primary agents tasked with implementing mandates from Congress, as they had been under the Articles of Confederation. They would be able to devote their attention _only_ to state affairs, which would cause them to be in session less frequently—further saving public expense.
