## Conclusion

In short, **_The Federalist Papers_ outline a plan of government that promised to be far superior to the Articles of Confederation. **The new Constitution aimed to create a stronger bond between the states, lay the foundation for national prosperity, establish a strong national defense, create a more efficient and energetic national administration, and safeguard the liberties of the states and the people.

The plan that came out of the Philadelphia Convention was not perfect. It was, however, the best that could have been hoped for under the political circumstances of the time. The authors of _The Federalist Papers_ urged the swift ratification of the Constitution, which they argued was the only path forward for national renewal and a fulfillment of Americaâ€™s great potential.

**Inevitably, future generations of Americans would see the need to update the Constitution to meet new challenges**. The Framers could not anticipate what these needs and challenges would be, but they created a process by which the Constitution could be amended.

But Publius cautioned against hasty changes. It was prudent, instead, to let the merits of the new plan of government reveal themselves over time. Time and experience would prove the wisdom and effectiveness of the new, supreme law of the land.
