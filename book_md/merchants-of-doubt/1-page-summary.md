## 1-Page Summary

**“Merchants of doubt” (MODs) are people or organizations who create the impression that scientific findings that threaten their agenda or ideology are unsettled or flat-out wrong.** The goal is to stave off regulation to keep the economy free.

The tobacco industry pioneered techniques for manufacturing doubt when scientists discovered that smoking caused cancer, and other MODs had been attacking science using the same techniques ever since.

### What Is Science?

Most of us don’t really understand what science is. We think it’s iron-clad proof that something is true. In reality, **scientific knowledge is expert consensus—a group of qualified scientists agrees that a claim is correct when there’s enough evidence to support it.**

#### Peer Review

Expert consensus comes from peer review. **No science is considered legitimate until it passes peer review.** Typically, the process works like this:

**Step #1:** A scientist comes up with an idea, collects evidence to support it, writes a paper, and then submits it to a scientific journal for publication.

**Step #2:** The journal sends the paper to three other scientists to review. Reviewers must be subject matter experts and mustn’t have a close relationship with the paper’s author. They look for bad science and mistakes and provide comments. If the reviewers provide conflicting comments, the journal might send the paper to more scientists or the editor might provide notes.

**Step #3:** The journal sends the reviewers’ notes back to the paper’s author to address. The author may write multiple drafts as she implements and receives new feedback. If the author ultimately fails to revise well enough, the journal won’t publish the paper. The author has to start over or try a different (less prestigious) journal.

#### How Does Uncertainty Work?

Even after a paper has passed peer review and been published,**there will always be some uncertainty regarding the details—science is always evolving, so while we may know a lot, we’re never going to know everything about any topic.** This is normal and important—it’s what drives scientists to keep discovering new things.

  * For example, climate modelers can’t effectively capture hurricanes because they’re too small (on a global scale). 



**When presented with an uncertainty, the question shouldn’t be whether there’s _any_ doubt, but whether there’s any _reasonable_ doubt.** If there’s reasonable doubt, the matter isn’t settled. If there’s doubt on the details, that’s normal.

### Who Are the Merchants of Doubt?

By nature, **science challenges the status quo and ruling class because its purpose is to change our understanding of the world around us.** Science often reveals market failures and suggests regulation as a solution, so merchants of doubt tend to be defenders of the free market such as:

  * **Free market fundamentalists** who believe that free markets are the _only_ economic system that allows for freedom
  * **Cornucopians or technophiles,** who believe that technology will fix every one of humanity’s problems as long as markets stay free (so inventors will be motivated to innovate by huge rewards)



**Four notable individual merchants of doubt—Fred Seitz, William Nierenberg, Robert Jastrow, and Fred Singer—were involved in doubt-mongering multiple scientific questions from the 1960s-2000s.** All of them were media-savvy, well-connected, politically powerful, fiercely anti-Communist physicists (though none of them did much original science after 1970—they wrote reviews or editorials, but didn’t publish much in peer-reviewed journals).

### Doubt-Mongering Techniques

There are 10 techniques that the merchants of doubt use to create debate around issues that are scientifically settled. This appearance of debate can influence public opinion and delay or even halt regulation.

#### Technique #1: Emphasize Uncertainty

**MODs play up the natural uncertainty inherent in science to suggest that _everything_ is uncertain**.

Example #1: When scientists were studying the possible effects of a nuclear weapons exchange, the science was all based on projections because the only way to get evidence would have been to start a nuclear war and observe what happened. **MODs claimed there was too much uncertainty around the possible consequences of an exchange to justify exposing the country to the dangers of disarmament.**

Example #2: After scientists discovered that smoking caused cancer, there were still uncertainties, such as how _exactly_ smoking causes cancer and why not all smokers get lung cancer (this is still unknown today).**MODs tried to exaggerate these uncertainties into uncertainty about the whole question of whether smoking caused cancer.**

#### Technique #2: Cherry-Pick Data

**MODs only cite or publicize data that support their position, and they ignore anything that doesn’t.**

For example, in 1989, the Marshall Institute (run by Jastrow, Nierenberg, and Seitz) put out a report that claimed the steady increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide couldn’t be responsible for global warming because the Earth’s surface temperature hadn’t steadily increased—there was warming before 1940 (before significant emissions), cooling from 1940-1975, and then more warming.

To support this, the report included a diagram that plotted CO2 against temperature.**The lines didn’t match up particularly well, but that was because the MODs had only included _part_ of the diagram. **The full diagram was multiple graphs that plotted the effects of CO2, the sun, _and_ volcanoes against temperature. Because all these factors affect surface temperatures, all of them had to be considered, and when they were, the temperature did line up.

#### Technique #3: Fund Other Studies in the Hopes of Getting More Favorable Results

**If MODs don’t like what mainstream science has discovered about a subject, they often spend large amounts of money funding research that might “debunk” mainstream science or show that uncertainty is greater than previously thought.** Sometimes they funnel the money through front groups or think tanks to disguise that they’re the source of the funding.

For example, after scientists had determined that smoking caused cancer,**** the tobacco industry recruited Seitz to allocate $45 million worth of funding to scientists doing biomedical research on the leading causes of death in the U.S. **The industry hoped for a discovery that would help them defend against the science that said smoking was unhealthy.**

#### Technique #4: Create the Appearance of Debate in the Scientific Community

**MODs recruit people with good credentials (including scientists) to challenge evidence and repeat non-consensus claims.** They also put out publications that look like real scientific findings. This makes the public think that the scientific community as a whole is in debate.

Example #1:**The tobacco industry recruited famous researcher Martin J. Cline to testify** in its favor against a nonsmoking flight attendant who had gotten lung cancer from secondhand smoke in airline cabins.

Example #2: **The CFC industry sent Richard Scorer, a professor of theoretical mechanics, on a tour of the U.S. to denounce a Climate Impact Assessment Program (CIAP)** study. Scorer spread misinformation: Human activities were so small as to have a negligible effect on the atmosphere and the discussion of ozone destruction was fear-mongering.

#### Technique #5: Call for “Equal Time” and Balanced Media Coverage

**MODs convince journalists that it’s only fair to present “both sides” of a story when there’s a dissent.** Some journalists don’t understand that dissenters already received fair consideration during the peer review process and feel like both views really do deserve to be aired. Other journalists allow themselves to be schmoozed, and still others don’t have enough time before their deadlines to dig deep into the research.

In fact, **“balanced” media coverage of science actually results in _more-biased_ coverage because minority voices end up with proportionally more time than consensus ones.**

**Equal attention for all views only makes sense when applied to _opinions_.** For example, two political parties might have differing views on an issue, so it makes sense to hear both. However, there is no opinion in science—it’s either right, wrong, or unknown.

For example, **tobacco industry MODs threatened journalists with the Fairness Doctrine** —an FCC rule in effect from 1949-1987 that TV journalists had to give equal airtime to both sides of controversial issues. As a result, journalists gave the same amount of coverage to the industry as the mainstream science finding that smoking kills.

#### Technique #6: Publish in Mainstream Media

Most scientific research is first published in scientific journals, which the average person doesn’t read. Therefore, **if MODs can get their “facts” and views into mainstream media such as newspapers and magazines, those are the facts and views the public will see.**

Example #1: When Fred Singer wanted to spread doubt about global warming, **he published a piece in a popular magazine called _Cosmos_.**

Example #2: In 1990, **MOD Dixy Lee Ray published _Trashing the Planet_ , a trade book easily available to the public** and reviewed by mass media.

#### Technique #7: Deflect and Distract

**MODs take public focus away from the real issue and direct it toward something else—often true or important, but irrelevant.**

For example, when merchandising doubt about the ozone hole, **Fred Singer argued that there are plenty of causes of skin cancer besides UV radiation** (the hole allowed UV radiation through). This was true, but irrelevant to the point that UV radiation causes cancer.

#### Technique #8: Claim the Solution is Worse Than the Problem

**MODs claim that the solutions to issues science has unveiled will create more problems than the original issue.** Therefore, it’s better not to act.

  * Example #1: After scientists announced that CFCs (chemicals used in refrigerators and aerosols) were destroying the ozone layer, **MODs claimed that CFCs alternatives (which didn’t exist at the time) would be toxic, dangerous substances.**
  * Example #2: After scientists discovered that sulfur emissions were causing acid rain, **MODs wrote that controlling acid rain would have huge economic consequences.**



This technique is supported by rational decision-theory analysis—if there are unknowns, the best course of action is usually to do nothing because acting has costs, and if you’re not sure you’re going to get any benefits, they’re not worth it. (Additionally, the costs are usually in the present and the benefits in the future.) This is part of why doubt-mongering works so well.

#### Technique #9: Attack Other Scientists’ Reputations and Accuse Them of Having Political Motivations

**If a scientist discovers something an MOD doesn’t like, the MOD will often personally attack the scientist.**

Example #1: MODs accused Rachel Carson, who revealed that the use of DDT (a pesticide) was damaging the environment, of being “hysterical.”

Example #2: MODs accused Benjamin Santer, who helped prove that climate change was caused by humans, of secretly editing an International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and corrupting the peer review process. **MODs and fact-fighters wrote that Santer admitted he’d doctored a report to make it fit political policy (he didn’t), tried to stop Santer from publishing a defense of himself, tried to get him fired, and contributed to the break up of his marriage.**

#### Technique #10: Attack Science

The final technique is **to call science that doesn’t support your position bad or junk science.** MODs might make claims that scientists massaged the numbers or rigged the experiment to further their agenda.

For example, MODs accused the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of doing bad science on secondhand smoke. **They claimed the EPA wanted to regulate so badly that it manipulated the science to support regulation.**

### Protecting Yourself From Doubt-Mongering

**You can’t do the science and original research yourself—you don’t have the expertise in every single field you might be interested in.** Therefore, you have to rely on the information that other people provide.

When you encounter a piece of information, keep in mind the following:

**1\. The information tends to be legitimate when it comes from a reputable source like:**

  * Scientists who are experts in a relevant field, who regularly publish in peer-reviewed journals, and who are independently funded.
  * Organizations who have been asked (for example, the National Academy of Sciences) or self-organize (International Panel on Climate Change) to investigate something.



Example #1: Benjamin Santer’s papers and presentations about climate change were legitimate because he was a climate modeler and part of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Example #2: Fred Seitz _was_ a scientist, but he was a physicist, not a medical professional, and he was funded by think tanks and the tobacco industry. Therefore, his input on tobacco was more likely to be doubt-mongering than real science.

**2\. Dissent can be doubt-mongering when the attacker is:**

  * In disagreement with expert consensus
  * A known contrarian who often plays the devil’s advocate
  * Associated with a group with an agenda
  * Emotional or displaying intense conviction



For example, MOD Steve Milloy regularly and dramatically attacked a variety of issues he didn’t agree with (among other things, he accused Rachel Carson of being a mass murderer). He worked with strongly pro-industry organizations.
