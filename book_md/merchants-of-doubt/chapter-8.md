## Chapter 8: Climate Change

In the last chapter, we looked at an example of science successfully informing policy despite the interference of the merchants of doubt. Now, we’ll look at the opposite case—the MODs discrediting science enough to stop policy on one of the more important issues of the day: global warming and climate change. Climate change is a hugely inflammatory issue for the MODs because addressing it would involve regulating energy use, which is the keystone of economic activity.

### Discovery of the Problem

Research on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and its effect on climate started over 150 years ago:

  * In the mid-19th century, experimentalist John Tyndall discovered that CO2 in the air traps heat in the atmosphere. 
  * In the early 20th century, geochemist Svante Arrhenius discovered that CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels could change the planet’s climate. Engineer Guy Callender found evidence that CO2 might _already_ be creating the “greenhouse effect” (the atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, letting heat in but not letting it out).
  * In the 1950s, chemist Charles David Keeling measured CO2 and found that it had been steadily accumulating in the atmosphere (the data is known as the Keeling Curve).
  * In the 1960s, U.S. scientists brought up the problem with politicians.



#### Roger Revelle

In 1965, Roger Revelle summarized the possible impacts of the warming caused by CO2. **There were still a lot of unknowns, so he focused on sea-level rise because it seemed the most certain.** He estimated that by 2000, there could be notable changes in climate because there would be 25% more atmospheric CO2. As the planet warmed, sea ice would increase in size due to thermal expansion (volume increases when material warms up), and this would push water farther inland.

Lyndon Johnson read the report but had bigger problems (such as the Vietnam War) and didn’t do anything about it. The next president, Nixon, did consider atmospheric changes, but he was focused on the greenhouse gas effects of water (from supersonic transports (SSTs)), not CO2.

#### Drought and Famine

In the 1970s, there was drought in Asia and Africa that caused famine. The famines affected the whole world because the price of food increased globally. **This brought some attention to the fragility of the global food supply, which would be affected by changes to weather patterns and global warming.**

#### The Jasons Study

**In 1977, the Department of Energy asked the Jasons, an independent, elite scientific group, to review the science on climate and CO 2. **The Jasons group:

  * Confirmed that agriculture was vulnerable to climate change
  * Used a model to determine that if atmospheric CO2 concentrations doubled from preindustrial levels, the earth’s average surface temperature would rise by 2.4 degrees Celsius. The poles would warm 10-12 degrees. 



**Other scientists had already established all this, but the Jasons were highly regarded and their study attracted attention from the White House.**

### Further Exploration of the Science

None of the Jasons were climate scientists, so President Carter’s science advisor asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review their study. The NAS put Jules Charney, an MIT professor and eminent meteorologist, in charge. He put together a panel to review the existing knowledge and additionally invited two climate modelers to share the results of their latest, state-of-the-art climate models. The models had similar results to the Jasons’. **They found that doubling the concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere would likely increase the surface temperature by three degrees Celsius.** (Exactly how much the surface temperature would change as a result of increased CO2 was one of the major uncertainties.)

The panel looked at natural processes that might slow down the warming—for example, if cloud cover increased, clouds would block some sunlight and less heat would make it into the atmosphere to be trapped by CO2. However, **they didn’t think any of the natural processes would be enough to prevent warming.**

Additionally, **none of the complications the models couldn’t capture** —like ocean circulation, clouds, or winds—**would change the math much.** They were factors that would affect the second decimal place of the temperature change, not whether or not the warming was happening at all.

**Charney’s panel didn’t know how long it would take to see changes because the models didn’t account for the storage of heat in the oceans.** It takes a long time to warm up an ocean, and the time required depends on a variety of factors including how much the oceans mix and how deeply the heat goes. **The panel estimated that ocean mixing would hold the warming off for decades** —while the atmosphere had _already_ changed, the effects wouldn’t be clear for years.

### The MOD's Response

The White House Office of Science and Technology asked the NAS to keep looking into climate change and answer some of the uncertainties Charney’s work hadn’t, particularly, how far off climate change was. The MODs got involved with both assessments.

#### 1980 Letter Report

In April 1980, a NAS committee chaired by economist Thomas Schelling that included Bill Nierenberg and Roger Revelle submitted a letter report. Schelling’s letter:

  * **Focused on uncertainties.** No one knew much or had really studied the social and political consequences of global warming, and Schelling suggested that the consequences might not all be bad. 
  * **Argued that climate change wouldn’t actually change the climate,** just redistribute earth’s climate zones. Humans could migrate or adapt if one region became inhospitable, as they’d historically done. (He did acknowledge that it would be more challenging because we have borders now, but still thought adaptation was the best idea.)
  * **Predicted that market forces would solve the problem for us.** Fossil fuels would become more expensive in the future, which would discourage people from using them and slow down emissions. 
  * **Recommended doing nothing except funding more research** —we could learn faster than climate change could take effect. 



#### Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee

The NAS’s Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee started on another assessment. **Meteorologist John Perry had suggested that the committee review existing work (which was normally what the NAS did), but Bill Nierenberg wanted new research done.**

Nierenberg won out and became head of the committee. **Energy Department officials didn’t want to hear anything alarming; they just wanted “guidance,”** so Nierenberg chose members who would agree with this position.

The report was published in 1983, and unusually for NAS, wasn’t jointly authored. Instead, **it was composed of seven individually authored chapters because the committee couldn’t agree on a collective assessment.**

**Five of the chapters were written by natural scientists** and covered the evidence for anthropogenic climate change. They all agreed that humans had increased atmospheric CO2 and that, unless something was done, the increase would continue and have biological and physical consequences. **The natural scientists agreed that there was still uncertainty about the details, but we needed to act now.**

  * For example, Revelle’s chapter covered what would happen when the West Antarctic Ice Sheet started to melt. If the temperature increased by 2-3 degrees Celsius, thermal expansion would raise sea level by 70 centimeters. If the sheet disintegrated, sea level could rise five to six meters, which would flood every single port facility in the world as well as low-lying regions like Florida.



**The other two chapters were written by economists** and covered emissions and impacts. The first chapter, written by William Nordhaus, was about CO2 emissions and energy use in the future. Nordhaus agreed with the natural scientists that anthropogenic CO2 emissions were increasing due to burning fossil fuels, but instead of labeling this a problem, he focused on uncertainty about future effects, and on economic and social consequences. **Nordhaus wrote that a permanent carbon tax would be too impractical, there was little to be done about climate change, and the most economical way to “handle” it was inaction.**

**The last chapter was written by Schelling and rejected the idea that focusing on CO 2 was the solution.** Schelling insisted that climate change in general (not anthropogenic climate changes specifically) was the issue. Therefore, anything that changed climate (such as natural variability) needed to be considered. He wrote that even if the problem was caused by CO2, the solution might be elsewhere, like adapting.

**Schelling also assumed that climate change wouldn’t take effect for over a hundred years, after the policymakers of the day were dead and gone.** Future leaders would be able to make better policies than today’s politicians because they would have a better idea of the future society’s needs. For example, today’s humans couldn’t know the energy needs or climate preferences of future humans.

**The assessment’s Executive Summary focused on the economists’ chapters, and these chapters were placed first and last.** The synthesis was clearly at odds with the rest of the report, but the report was published (one scientist said Academy review was lax at the time).

##### Criticism of the Report

Some scientists criticized the report, notably physicist Alvin Weinberg, who had been one of the first in his field to realize how dangerous climate change might be. He wrote that there was no evidence to back up the recommended inaction and the synthesis didn’t reflect what most of the report said. **Most scientists, however, just ignored the report because they knew it was junk science.**

**Economists had problems with the report too.** In the late 1960s, some economists had concluded that the free market was by nature a danger to the environment because it focuses on growth. The earth doesn’t grow—it has a finite capacity to absorb pollution and a finite amount of resources.

##### White House Response to the Report

**The White House approved of the report and used it to refute other reports** (such as two Environmental Protection Agency ones) that recommended action. It was exactly what they wanted—it appeared united, encouraged inaction, and said that future technology would handle anything that did come up.

**The press prioritized the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report.**

### Further Exploration of the Science

In 1987 (not much happened on climate change while atmospheric scientists were busy with the ozone hole), climate modeler James E. Hansen testified in a climate hearing. The media ignored him. However, in 1988, there were high temperatures and drought in the U.S. and the public started to take global warming more seriously. **Hansen re-testified in 1988 and announced that anthropogenic global warming had _already_ started.**

**New research showed that over the past eight years, the planet was half a degree warmer than the 1950-1980 average** , and there was only a 1% chance that this was due to natural events. Hansen and his colleagues also modeled some scenarios for the future: The surface temperatures could be higher than they’d been 120,000 years ago.

**This time, Hansen got media attention.** He was on the front page of the _New York Times_. Some scientists, who didn’t like the attention or were perhaps jealous, criticized him because there were still uncertainties and it seemed premature to announce warming was already happening.

### Policy and Public Action

**Hansen created political pressure and presidential candidate George H.W. Bush promised to do something about climate change.** Bush would propose funding research and send people to climate science meetings.

### Further Exploration of the Science

**In 1988, Bob Watson and Bert Bolin put together the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).** The panel was to involve over 300 scientists and complete an assessment by 1990.

Bolin divided the panel into three groups: one to report on climate science, one to look at the impacts, and one to figure out what to do about it.

### The MOD's Response

In 1989, **the MODs tried to blame global warming on the sun’s variability. The Marshall Institute**(Jastrow, Nierenberg, and Seitz) **put out a report that claimed that the warming didn’t line up with the increase in CO 2.** There was warming before 1940 (before significant emissions), cooling from 1940-1975, and then more warming. Atmospheric CO2, on the other hand, had continually increased. Since the trends didn’t match, CO2 couldn’t be the cause.

To support this, **the report included one of Hansen’s diagrams, which plotted CO 2 against temperature. The lines didn’t match up particularly well, but that was because the MODs had only included _part_ of the diagram.** The full diagram was multiple graphs that plotted the effects of CO2, the sun, _and_ volcanoes against temperature. Because all these factors affect surface temperatures, all of them had to be considered, and when they were, the temperature did line up.

**The paper claimed the “real” cause of temperature changes was the sun, which went through periods of higher and lower output.** There was a 200-year-cycle, and it was just about finished, so things would cool down soon. The Marshall Institute piece didn’t mention the fact that the sun’s energy output hadn’t increased in the 1970s, so there was no way that the warming period had been caused by the sun (changes in sun output _did_ happen in the other warming period in the 1940s).

**There was another large flaw in this argument—the changes in solar output were small, so if they’d affected climate, the climate must be very sensitive.** If it _was_ very sensitive, small changes in atmospheric CO2 could cause large changes to surface temperatures too.

**The Institute asked to present their work to the White House, were approved, and Nierenberg gave a briefing.** Many politicians took it seriously. Bert Bolin wasn’t invited or didn’t realize he had to ask.

### Further Exploration of the Science

The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published their First Assessment in May 1990. It:

  * **Confirmed that unless fossil fuel burning was regulated, warming would increase.** It would create a climate and environment humans had never been exposed to before. 
  * **Addressed and refuted the Marshall Institute’s work** —greenhouse gases had a much bigger effect than solar variability on climate.



### The MOD's Response

The merchants of doubt continued to plug their sun theory and attack the IPCC, but they started going after individual scientists too.

#### Discrediting Roger Revelle

Roger Revelle was an important voice in the climate change discussion. He was also Al Gore’s mentor, so **if the MODs could make it look like Revelle had changed his opinion on global warming, it would not only sow doubt, it would hurt Gore’s 1992 presidential campaign,** which focused on the environment.

Singer attended one of Revelle’s talks and approached him about writing an article together that would be called “What To Do about Greenhouse Warming: Look Before You Leap.” Revelle agreed but shortly after, he had a heart attack. An operation saved him, but there were further complications and his health deteriorated. **He and Singer continued working on the article**(though Revelle appeared to have lost enthusiasm), **and Revelle may not have been able to look closely or check changes due to his health.**

**While still working with Revelle, Singer wrote his own article with almost the same title**(“What To Do about Greenhouse Warming”). This article reused the Marshall Institute’s work and focused on uncertainty.

In February 1991, Singer and Revelle met to discuss their paper. **They argued about how sensitive the climate was to CO 2.** The current draft of the paper claimed that the warming would be “well below the normal year to year variation” and less than 1 degree Celsius. Revelle corrected the numbers in the margin. Singer ultimately cut the numbers, so the next draft read that a “modest average warming” and still contained the phrase about the warming being below the normal variation. **The historical record doesn’t show whether Revelle ultimately agreed to this wording, but everyone who knew him expected he hadn’t.** Revelle was well aware of natural variability because he was a geologist (natural variability is determined from paleoclimate data).

The article appeared in _Cosmos_ (a non-scientific journal with low circulation) and **because Revelle was listed as the second author, it looked like he had agreed that the warming wasn’t significant or outside of normal.** One of Revelle’s colleagues stated that Revelle was embarrassed by the paper (Revelle died shortly after it came out).

While few scientists read _Cosmos_ , the article made its way into public consciousness. In 1992, **Al Gore’s critic Gregg Easterbrook attacked him for failing to mention that Revelle had ultimately concluded that there was too much uncertainty to act.** The quote Easterbrook used to support this was from Singer’s _solo_ 1990 paper with a similar title to the co-authored one. Other critics repeated the attacks.

##### Setting the Record Straight

People tried to set the record straight:

**1\. Revelle’s daughter published an op-ed.**

**2\. Two of Revelle’s colleagues wrote to _Cosmos_.** They wrote that Singer had written the paper, not Revelle, and that Singer had probably only included his name as a thank-you for advising and reviewing. _Cosmos_ wouldn’t publish their letter, so they sent it to _Oceanography_(a scientific journal mainly read by scientists).

**3\. Justin Lancaster, a colleague and close friend of Revelle:**

  * Wrote to the journal that had published Easterbrook’s attack. The journal refused to publish Lancaster’s letter. 
  * Tried to get Singer to remove Revelle’s name from the paper when it was republished. Ultimately, the republication had a footnote to another of Revelle’s papers that presented his thoughts on climate change. 
  * Complained about the _Cosmos_ article at Revelle’s memorial symposium and continued to go public about Singer pressuring Revelle. Singer filed a libel lawsuit. Lancaster tried to fight it, but he didn’t have the money and had to settle.



**Revelle probably didn’t actually change his mind about global warming.** In November 1990, he wrote an unpublished introduction to a meeting (Oreskes and Conway found it in his papers), which states that he thought that climate was serious and we should act.

### Policy and Public Action

In June 1992, the U.N. held an Earth Summit to address what to do about climate change. The MOD's techniques were working and President Bush only decided to go at the last minute. **The conference produced a Framework Convention that 192 countries signed, committing to preventing dangerous anthropogenic activity.** The Framework didn’t include any emissions limits; however, it was just a principle.

### Further Exploration of the Science

By 1992, it was clear that global warming was real and happening now. **The only major to-do was to prove that it was caused by humans—if it was, contrary to what the MODs claimed, there was definitely something we could do to slow or stop it.**

To prove that humans were causing global warming, scientists looked for ways in which anthropogenic warming was distinct from other causes of warming. This approach was called “fingerprinting” or detection and attribution.

**A possible fingerprint of greenhouse gases was the temperature of all the layers of the atmosphere.** If the sun was the source of warming, since it was outside the atmosphere, the _entire_ atmosphere should warm. If greenhouse gases were the source, however, only the lower atmosphere (where the gases trap heat) would warm up. The outer layers of the atmosphere would actually _cool_ because less heat than usual was making its way through the inner layers to the outer. (In Chapter 7, Singer brought this up when doubt-mongering ozone depletion.)

Climate scientist Benjamin Santer began looking at the vertical structure of the atmosphere. He had worked on checking the accuracy of climate models as a student, and he learned about fingerprinting at one of his first jobs. In 1994, **the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) asked Santer to be the convening lead author for Chapter 8 of their next (second) assessment.** The IPCC wasn’t very prestigious at the time but Santer agreed after some convincing.

#### International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment

Santer’s job would be to organize a chapter about fingerprinting based on available information—basically, coordinate the writing and put together everyone’s individual parts. His chapter had 36 authors and they met in August 1994 to start work.

In October and November, Santer went to the first drafting session, where all the lead authors of the entire report met. **The first hiccup was whether to discuss the uncertainty of the model and observations in Chapter 8. Uncertainty was already covered in other chapters, but Santer wanted to include it in Chapter 8 as well** because readers might not read the report in full, and Santer had no say in how it was discussed in other chapters. Santer got his way and his chapter would also include a discussion of uncertainty.

**Next was the first round of Chapter 8’s peer review.** Approximately 20 detection and attribution scientists, everyone who had participated in writing the chapter, and all the other chapters’ lead authors reviewed Santer’s chapter.

In March 1995, there was a second drafting session, and in May, **the whole report and policymakers’ summaries went to reviewers selected by the governments who were members of the IPCC.** Santer also sent his work to _Nature_ around the same time for review.

In July 1995, there was a third drafting session. Santer hadn’t received the government reviewers’ notes yet (he had been chosen as the lead author later, so the other chapters were further along), so he presented his _unreviewed_ results. He and his team had been working on the vertical structure of the atmosphere and **might have proved that humans had changed the climate.**

**In September 1995, the whole report was leaked and Santer’s chapter made the news, though the _New York Times_ didn’t quite get the story right.** It reported that scientists had just now started to think human activity was likely a cause of global warming. In reality, scientists had thought it was likely for years and had just _proven_ it.

### The MOD's Response

Proof that the warming was anthropogenic was bad news for the MODs. In early November 1995, the Republican majority in Congress held hearings in which they questioned the science. One of the witnesses, **ozone-depletion denier and climatologist Patrick J. Michaels explained that the IPCC had gotten it wrong because the model predictions didn’t match the observed temperatures measured by NOAA weather satellites.** He’d mentioned this in his peer review of the report but the IPCC had ignored him.

Witness **Jerry Mahlman, a NOAA scientist, explained that the model didn’t match the observed weather data because it wasn’t supposed to.** The model deliberately ignored the effects of the sun or volcanic dust because the point was to isolate the effect of CO2. However, the satellites measured real life, which included the sun and volcanoes, so obviously the temperatures were different. The model and observations weren’t looking at the same thing, so it didn’t make sense to compare them.

**The hearing didn’t get much media attention (everyone knew the Republicans opposed environmental action by now), but it did reinforce Republicans’ confidence in doing nothing.**

### Further Exploration of the Science

In November 1995, there was a final IPCC plenary session. At this meeting, Santer received the government reviewers’ comments. **When Santer presented his results, two government representatives immediately opposed his chapter (Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) and one delegate (Kenya) thought the report shouldn’t even cover fingerprinting.**

The IPCC chairman put together a drafting group to revise the chapter and sort everything out. The drafting group included the lead authors, delegates from other countries, and the delegates who had opposed the chapter (except the Saudis didn’t send anyone). **When Santer shared the revised chapter, the Saudis still didn’t like it.**

The group put the discussion on hold to finish the Summary for Policymakers. There was disagreement here too—everyone had different opinions about the adjective used to describe the anthropogenic influence on climate. After trying almost 30 words, they ultimately settled on “discernable.”

Santer coordinated implementing the changes requested from the plenary. The major change was organizational—all of the other chapters in the report had summary statements at the beginning, but Chapter 8 had statements and the beginning and end, so the chairman told Santer to take out the statement at the end of his chapter.

### The MOD's Response

#### Writing to _Science_

**In February 1996, before the third IPCC assessment was released, Singer published a letter in _Science_** that claimed:

  * **Some satellite data had shown no warming and actually showed cooling, so the models were wrong.** (This claim was unsupported by data—the models and satellite matched. There _were_ differences between satellites and balloon instruments, but that was normal because they were in different locations and didn’t measure the exact same things.)
  * **The fingerprinting work shouldn’t have been included because it hadn’t been peer-reviewed yet,** and doing so violated IPCC’s rules. (The IPCC rules allow the inclusion of non-peer-reviewed materials as long as the IPCC peer reviewers have access to the same material. This is so that the report uses the most current information. Additionally, the specific study Singer mentioned _was_ peer-reviewed.)
  * **The panel ignored a U.S. government report** that concluded warming might be only half a degree Celsius. (This report wasn’t cited.)
  * **The IPCC had called climate change “the greatest global challenge facing mankind,” which Singer felt was unreasonable.** (No IPCC documents contained the phrase Singer quoted. In fact, the IPCC avoids extreme and alarming statements—remember the argument over “discernable.”)



Tom Wigley, one of the Chapter 8 authors, responded, debunking everything. Singer’s only response was to provide the missing citation.

#### Accusations of Secret Edits

In May 1996, before the IPCC report was published, Santer and Wigley gave a briefing on Chapter 8 on Capitol Hill. **An industry lobbyist and representative of the American Petroleum Institute accused them of secretly editing the report.** Santer _did_ make changes after the plenary session to address the discussion, government comments, and structure, as requested. But the MODs accused him of cutting out sections about uncertainty and ignoring other scientists’ dissent.

**The Global Climate Coalition (an industry group) attacked the IPCC and put out a report called “The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing.”** Nierenberg received a copy and in an interview, repeated its claims even though they were impossible to verify (the report hadn’t been published yet, so there was no way to compare older drafts to the final one to see if anything really had been cut). Nierenberg also claimed the IPCC had cut out bits about uncertainty, which was a lie—Santer had insisted on including a discussion of uncertainty in his chapter back in the first drafting session.

Fred Seitz continued the attack—in June 1996 in the _Wall Street Journal_ , **Seitz accused Santer of making unauthorized changes and corrupting the peer review process**. He suggested finding a more reputable authority than the IPCC because they couldn’t follow their own rules.

### Setting the Record Straight

**Santer and 40 cosigners wrote to the _Wall Street Journal_ to explain what had really happened**—the IPCC chairman told him to make changes and this was normal—it’s how peer review works. The only differences between the IPCC review and standard peer review were:

  * The reviewers weren’t all scientists; some were government representatives.
  * Santer made the changes later in the process than usual because he didn’t receive the reviewers’ comments until later. 



**Santer also pointed out Seitz couldn’t back up his claims—he hadn’t had anything to do with the report and he wasn’t a climate scientist.** The _Journal_ initially refused to publish Santer’s explanation. It finally did, but only after editing it and cutting the names of the cosigners. The IPCC chairman and Bert Bolin also wrote the _Journal_ , and it edited their letters too.

**The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and American Meteorological Society boards republished the unedited versions of the letters to show how the _Journal_ had edited them.** They called the MODs on systematically merchandising doubt.

### The MOD's Response

**In July, Seitz, Singer, and ozone-hole-denier Hugh Ellsaesser responded in the _Journal_ and denied the charges.** Singer accused the IPCC of coming to a “feeble” conclusion but also claimed that it was scare-mongering.

Bolin and Santer responded, and Singer tried to attack them again, but the _Journal_ wouldn’t publish him. **Singer circulated an email instead with wild claims:** There was no evidence for warming, the chapter had been based on “unpublished work,” and Patrick J. Michaels should have been a lead author because he was the only person to publish on climate fingerprinting before 1995. (**All of this was verifiably untrue** —for example, the first paper on fingerprinting was published in 1979, and Santer circulated his own email to explain.)

In November, **Singer kept making claims that were easily fact-checkable** —for example, he claimed that the discussion of uncertainty in Chapter 8 had been cut, but the report had been out for months and anyone who looked at it could tell it included six pages about uncertainties. **However, the mass media publicized his and other MOD's views and voices.** (A 2004 study that looked at media from 1988-2002 discovered that over 50% of articles were balanced and 35% did acknowledge that one position was correct but still included the deniers' views.)

### Policy and Public Action

**Even though the MOD's claims were false, their work influenced Bush, members of Congress, and millions of members of the public** who read the _Wall Street Journal_. The U.S. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, which committed countries to reducing greenhouse gases, in 1997.

### Further Exploration of the Science

In 2001, the IPCC’s latest assessment found more and stronger evidence of anthropogenic climate change. In 2007, the assessment named it “unequivocal.”

### Policy and Public Action

**Despite the strength of the science, the “debate” persisted.** In 2006, only 56% of Americans thought that the average global temperature had increased. 85% thought it was happening but 64% thought there was still a lot of conflict between scientists. In 2009, the number of people who believed there was evidence for global warming actually _declined_ from 71% to 57%.

### 2020 Update

The original edition of _Merchants of Doubt_ was published in 2010 when, despite the science, the MODs had so effectively merchandised doubt that there was little policy change on climate change. When Oreskes and Conway updated the book in 2020, the MODs were still at work on the subject.

Though doubt-mongering ultimately failed to stop U.S regulation on action on tobacco, the ozone hole, and acid rain, **it did delay regulation by decades. The authors argue that we don’t have that kind of time when it comes to climate change** —we only have around 10 years to change things before the earth would be irreparably changed.

In this section, we’ll look at some of the highlights from the past decade when it comes to climate change.

(Shortform note: Parts of this section appeared in the original book’s Postscript.)

#### California

In 2006, the California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) went into effect and required the reduction of greenhouse gases to 15% below the 1990 levels. The deadline was 2016.

The MODs claimed:

  * **Wind and solar power are too expensive.**(In reality, both types of energy cost the same or less than energy generated by fossil fuels—solar is about $50 per megawatt-hour and wind $30-50 per megawatt-hour. Today, it’s more expensive to run a coal plant than build a new one powered by renewables.)
  * **The legislation would kill jobs and hurt the economy.** (In reality, there are now fewer jobs in fossil fuels than in renewables, and renewables are growing quickly.)
  * **Renewable energy is unreliable.** (In reality, most blackouts aren’t caused by problems at plants; they’re caused by transmission failures.)



California made most of its reductions in the electrical utility sector and met the target in only 10 years. **Regulating emissions didn’t cause any of the problems the MODs warned would come to pass.** From 2006-2016, the population increased and the economy _grew_ 41%_._ This showed that all of the MOD’s claims were unfounded.

Like California, lots of other states have good conditions for solar and wind power, so the MODs keep reprising the doubt-mongering arguments they tried in California.

**There is one _real_ problem with wind and solar energy in Texas—sometimes, there’s _too_ _much_ energy, which drives the spot market prices into the negatives. **The grid manager in California reduces production to deal with it, but there are better (though currently more expensive) options already in existence:

  1. **Grid integration,** which is when the entire country's grid is connected so that when there are surpluses in one place (say, a windy day in Oklahoma), the energy can be transferred somewhere else where there’s a shortage (nighttime in Nevada). This would require the cooperation of all states and the federal government.
  2. **Storage.** Excess energy can be stored in batteries or by using it to pump water uphill and running it through a hydroelectric generator to access it again.
  3. **Adjust demand,** which involves changing the price of electricity depending on how much is available (for example, electricity is cheaper at night) in the hopes that consumers will adjust their usage and the grid will be more stable. Not all consumers pay attention to adjustments, and there’s a time delay, but some companies have been working on smart appliances that can automatically adjust their usage as the prices change. For example, a fridge might turn itself off for a moment when the price jumps.



#### Electric Cars (EVs)

Moving from fossil-fuel-powered cars to electric ones is another way to reduce emissions, but **EVs have been slow to catch on, even in California.** In May 2019, less than 3% of passenger vehicles were electric.

Electric cars are less numerous for three reasons:

**1\. Misinformation.** MODs spread disparaging information about EVs, often on social media where there are no gatekeepers such as journalists to refuse to publish them. Their major tactics are:

  * Complaining about subsidies and incentives.
  * Claiming EVs are elite. (This is untrue; there are affordable models.)
  * Claiming EVs are worse for the environment. (Also untrue.)



**2\. Retail infrastructure.** Many people aren’t aware that electric cars perform well or are available because:

  * Most people buy cars from dealers, and dealers often don’t like EVs because they don’t break down very often. Therefore, dealers don’t make enough money from repairs.
  * Only one of the major U.S. car manufacturers makes EVs (General Motors’ Chevy Bolt).
  * Tesla Motors doesn’t advertise and doesn’t have a dealer network, and some states don’t allow direct sales.



**3\. Charging infrastructure.** Charging stations aren’t nearly as widespread as gas stations, which limits where people can drive and live (most people who have EVs charge them at home, and if you rent, you may need your landlord’s signoff to install a home charger).
