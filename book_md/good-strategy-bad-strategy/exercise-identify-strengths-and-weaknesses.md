## Exercise: Identify Strengths and Weaknesses

Good strategy is often most effective when it reveals unexpected strengths in your own organization and unknown weaknesses in your competition, and pits the first against the second.

* * *

What are your organization’s obvious strengths (the ones that are easily identified to outside observers, or the ones you might list in a company description)? What are some _hidden_ strengths of your organization? (Think about strengths that insiders would notice more easily than outsiders—for instance, logistical efficiencies or unique policies that might give you an edge over your competitors.)

What are your rival’s obvious weaknesses? What might be some hidden weaknesses in your competitors? (Consider policies and organizational structures that might be outdated or technology that they’re not taking advantage of.)

In what ways might you be able to use any of your strengths listed above, either known or hidden, against any of your rivals’ weaknesses listed above?
