## Exercise: Make a List of Challenges

The process of crafting good strategy often starts with the basic exercise of making a list of the most important things for your organization to address in the near future.

* * *

Make a list of the top challenges facing your organization. This can be a list of just a few things or it can be a dozen.

Examine your list and start to prioritize which of these action items is the most crucial. (For instance, which needs to be accomplished before the others can be accomplished? Which can be accomplished now, given your current resources?)

How well is your current strategy addressing your organization’s top challenge you identified? If it’s not, how might you amend your strategy to better address it?
