## Exercise: Create Feasible Objectives

A good strategy will focus on achievable, realistic objectives that enable it to reach its larger, more overarching goals.

* * *

Name one long-term goal of your organization. (Be as specific as possible; avoid general statements like “long-term success” and focus more on a specific way your organization can differentiate itself in the marketplace or something specific that it can accomplish.)

Name one objective you want your organization to accomplish in the next year or two that will bring it closer to this long-term goal. (Think of something specific and achievable given your current resources.)

List one or two actions your organization can take to move you closer to the short-term objective listed above. (Think of specific and achievable actions that you can reasonably plan for.)
