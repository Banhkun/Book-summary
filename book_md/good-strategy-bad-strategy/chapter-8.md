## Chapter 8: Putting It Together With a Case Study of Nvidia

The trajectory of the 3-D graphics chip company Nvidia illustrates how an organization can use many of the above concepts to craft good strategy and propel itself to success.

Nvidia was formed in 1993 by three executives from other computer-development companies and quickly rose in prominence, ultimately surpassing the more established industry firms and becoming the dominant designer of 3-D graphics chips. To do so, it developed a solid, clear strategy that incorporated many of the techniques discussed here:

  * **It made an insightful diagnosis of the challenges facing it.** Nvidia saw that although there was a lot of buzz about the possibilities of multimedia, the multimedia industry had no standardized technology: Not every computer was compatible with multimedia technologies such as audio and video cards. Thus, a company trying to build a presence in the field would have trouble interacting with a wide variety of users. Nvidia itself wasn’t a large enough company to impose its own standards, so its founders recognized that they couldn’t be competitive in multimedia. They saw that the better bet would be to focus their efforts on developing 3-D graphics chips for the narrower market of desktop PCs. This meant they’d concentrate on the gaming industry.
  * **It formed a clear, focused guiding policy.** The company decided it would focus on _designing_ these graphics chips, and it would outsource the actual _manufacturing_ of them. Further, to set itself apart in the industry,**it committed to releasing upgraded products every six months.** Because technology advanced such that semiconductors jumped in capability about every eighteen months (a tendency known as “Moore’s law”), most companies released new products at that rate. Nvidia recognized that if they could beat that industry standard, they’d have an almost-insurmountable competitive edge.
  * **It developed a set of coherent actions.** Nvidia determined it could release new products every six months if it used three separate teams working with overlapping schedules. It put together these three development teams and invested heavily in technology that would prevent problems from arising along that way that might delay their tight schedules. 
  * **It correctly predicted market demands.** The company judged that customers would continue to want faster and more realistic graphics, and it focused its strategy on meeting that demand. With this insight, it was able to see the “ideal state” that the industry was headed towards, based on customer preferences. 
  * **It took advantage of the inertia of rivals.** Nvidia observed that companies like Intel were using advances in technology to save costs rather than to increase capability. For example, as more and more transistors could be squeezed onto a chip, Intel was shrinking the size of its chips to make them cheaper to produce. Nvidia chose instead to keep the size of the chip the same but to add more transistors onto it, thereby boosting performance. It correctly deduced that its customers would value this more and that doing so would give the company a competitive advantage over companies who prioritized cost savings over innovation.
  * **It handled change well.** After its first release, it received industry and customer feedback about different aspects of the quality of the chip, which it incorporated into future designs. 
  * **It set feasible objectives and worked toward them in a step-by-step fashion.** Nvidia first worked to attain market leadership in graphics performance, and then it started to focus on next-step issues such as extra costs created by its board makers and driver problems. 
  * **It leveraged its advantages.** It used its expertise and its strategy of rapid product releases to ensure that rivals would have trouble keeping up with its improvements and upgrades. Some competitors actually had to close after spreading themselves too thin trying to imitate Nvidia’s pace without establishing the underlying resources to do so first.
