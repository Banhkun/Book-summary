## Exercise: Anticipate Change

Fundamental changes come from a variety of sources including rising costs, deregulation, changes in technology, and changing buyer preferences.

* * *

What are some possible changes facing your industry in the next few years?

How will those changes affect the competitive landscape for your industry? For instance, do you predict theyâ€™ll create conditions more favorable to certain organizations over others?

How will those changes affect your organization specifically?

What can you do to prepare for this upcoming change? (For example, what might be some changes you can make that will position your organization to either take advantage of the coming opportunities or weather the coming storm?)
