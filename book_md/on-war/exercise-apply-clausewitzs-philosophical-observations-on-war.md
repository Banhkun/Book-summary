## Exercise: Apply Clausewitz’s Philosophical Observations on War

In the following questions, we’ll revisit Clausewitz’s philosophical discussion of war and give you a chance to reflect on how some of the issues he addresses apply to you.

* * *

As we discussed, Clausewitz identifies physical violence—people trying to kill each other—as the essence of war. He also makes the point that, in general, war only happens when people fight back against an aggressor instead of yielding to the aggressor's demands. Do you believe it’s ever appropriate to resort to violence in resisting someone’s demands? If so, when is it appropriate? If not, why not? Note your thoughts below.

Clausewitz makes the point that war is just a tool for achieving political goals or enforcing political policy. He also observes that politicians don’t always use war correctly: Sometimes they wage wars that are counterproductive to their political goals. Think of the tools that you use to pursue your goals in life or business. For instance, your tools might include schedules, meetings, social networking sites, vocational training, and so on. When was the last time that one of these tools ended up being counterproductive? How could you change how you use that tool to prevent the problem from recurring?

Similarly, Clausewitz observes that sometimes politicians let wars shape political policy instead of making the war conform to their political goals. Again, think of the tools that you use to achieve your goals in life or business. When was the last time you found yourself trying to conform yourself or your goals to one of your tools instead of using the tool to achieve your goals? (For example, have you ever found that instead of managing your schedule, your schedule was managing you?) What did you do to solve this problem, or, if you haven’t resolved the issue yet, what could you do to solve it?

Clausewitz makes the point that theories of war that model soldiers and commanders as impersonal, perfectly rational agents are not accurate because soldiers are human: Conflict between humans often becomes personal, even if it was started for impersonal reasons. When was the last time someone took something you did or said more personally than you expected or intended? Taking human nature into account, what could you do differently next time you’re in a similar situation?
