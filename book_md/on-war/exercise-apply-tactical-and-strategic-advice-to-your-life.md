## Exercise: Apply Tactical and Strategic Advice to Your Life

In the following questions, we’ll revisit some of Clausewitz’s tactical and strategic advice, giving you a chance to consider how it might be applicable to your own situation.

Clausewitz stresses the importance of traveling light so that the army can move faster and focus on its main objectives, rather than devoting a lot of manpower to coordinating supply lines. A similar principle applies to travel in general: The more baggage you carry, the more energy you’ll expend lugging it around, and the less you’ll have left to focus on the purpose of your trip. Think about your most recent vacation or business trip. Did you pack any items that you never used on the trip? If so, what were they? What items did you bring along that you could have purchased or borrowed locally when you needed them?

Clausewitz observes that rivers are an obstacle to an advancing army when the river is guarded by the enemy. But he argues that the obstacle is relatively easy to overcome, provided your forces are superior to those guarding the river. Think about obstacles that you’re currently facing in your career or life, especially obstacles that might seem insurmountable at first glance. List one obstacle that you’re currently facing and describe the ‘forces’ you’d need (resources, connections, and so on) to overcome it.

Clausewitz observes that under the stress of battle, soldiers tire out, lose focus, and cease to fight effectively. He recommends keeping some reserve troops out of battle to send in later so that their energy and focus can help the whole army refocus and continue to fight effectively. Think about the last time that you—or one of your subordinates, if you’re in a management position—got tired or burned out with a project to the point where it was hard to make any further progress. In that situation, who could you call or send in to provide a fresh perspective and help get the project moving forward again? In other words, who were your reserve troops?

Clausewitz points out that when you can’t win a battle, it’s better to retreat with your army intact than to let the enemy kill or capture your entire force. But, of course, you can’t win battles if you retreat at the first sign of danger. The same principle holds true for business ventures and other projects: To succeed, you have to strike a balance between taking big risks and cutting your losses when projects begin to fail. Think about the last time you decided to pull the plug on a project or venture. What was it that convinced you it was time to sound the retreat? Or how do you determine when a project no longer has any meaningful chance of success?
