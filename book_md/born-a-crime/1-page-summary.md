## 1-Page Summary

Trevor Noah, the acclaimed comedian and host of _The Daily Show_ , is mixed race. His mother is a black South African, and his father is a white Swiss-German. **At the time Noah was born, during the racial oppression of apartheid in South Africa, his existence was a crime.** Apartheid dictated that blacks had no legal rights as humans and were to remain separated from the white South Africans. **By creating a child together, both his parents broke the law and could have been sent to prison for five years.**

### A Woman’s Quest to Overcome Apartheid

Noah’s mother, Patricia, raised Noah by herself against all odds. She’d grown up impoverished, as all black families did, and was sent away to live with her paternal aunt as a young child. In this new environment, Patricia was one of more than a dozen children whose families couldn’t afford them or simply didn’t want them. They were put to work, helping farm whatever meager rations could be scraped together from the infertile land to which blacks were relegated.

Patricia was fortunate in her ability to attend a missionary school nearby, where she learned English. She took her education and used it to better her life, enrolling in a secretarial course and finding work in Johannesburg through a loophole in the laws. **Willfully independent, always brazen, and consistently determined, Patricia moved secretly among white society** , posing as a maid so she could live in Johannesburg (where blacks were forbidden to live). She decided to have a son with a white man as an act of defiance against the laws of oppression.

### An Illegal Life

Noah’s early life was one of confinement. Apartheid was still law for the first five years of Noah’s life, and a mixed child in white society raised questions. Patricia could not be seen as Noah’s mother, since a black woman with a mixed child would be conspicuous. And Robert, Noah’s father, could not have any public involvement in his son’s life. **The only times Noah and his father could visit were in Robert’s apartment for fear of being found out.**

As Noah grew older and concealing his skin became more difficult, Patricia engaged the services of a colored woman to pose as his mother because of their likeness in skin tones. The colored race is a culturally constructed categorization of people with varied ethnic and racial heritages. It was not illegal to be a descendent of the colored race, meaning having two colored parents, but it was illegal to be the product of race mixing, or having a black parent and a white parent. During these moments, Patricia would follow Noah and this woman, posing as the black maid.

Even in Soweto, the black township Patricia was from, Noah was kept indoors. If the neighbors or police caught wind of a mixed-race boy belonging to a black family, Noah could be sent to a colored orphanage and his family imprisoned. **A life without friends and freedom encompasses Noah’s earliest memories.**

### A New World Brings New Questions

When Nelson Mandela was freed and apartheid abolished, Noah was able to enter the world, but his struggles to belong were just beginning. **Noah struggled to fit into a cleanly categorized race, which further separated him from his community and children at school**. He felt black because he was raised within the black culture, but his light skin tone told another story. He looked colored, but he was not culturally colored. He was part white, but no one thought of him as such.

It wasn’t infrequent that Noah would find himself stranded on a playground not knowing which group he belonged to. **The quandary of how he fit in would rear up again and again as Noah moved from school to school, neighborhood to neighborhood, with Noah always feeling like an outsider.**

To counteract his ostracization, Noah became a master of languages. There were 11 official languages in South Africa, a policy created to ensure no black tribe felt unrepresented in the new democracy. His mother made English his first language to give him a leg up in life, and he spoke her native language of Xhosa, his father’s language of German, the language of his oppressors (Afrikaans, created by the Dutch colonists pre-apartheid), and many other African tribal languages he picked up on the streets. **Speaking the languages of others allowed him to relate and be viewed as “one of them,” rather than “different.”**

Noah also started a lunch delivery business in high school to move among all groups and be accepted. He became known as the “tuck-shop” guy, the tuck shop being the food cart where students bought lunch. These entrepreneurial skills endeared him to his fellow classmates. He expanded his business to selling pirated CDs, finding a prowess for sales and his niche in the social sphere. Noah’s success at these business ventures would carry him through life after high school. There were no jobs available for young black men, and **after meeting a friend who lived in one of the poorest and most volatile black townships, he spent the next three years engaged in a life of petty crime.**

### The Bond Between Mother and Son

Noah was never weak or felt sorry for himself. His mother’s strength and mission to give him a better life gave him confidence and made him inquisitive about the world. **Patricia inundated his early life with books and excursions into wider society, preparing him for a world that would one day accept him.**

His relationship with Patricia was loving but volatile. Noah was a rambunctious child who got into trouble frequently. He would run wild and shoplift. He pulled pranks at school and had a penchant for fire. His actions would cause him to burn down a house and, later, land himself in jail. **Patricia was a fierce disciplinarian, trying to raise her child to be a good man so he wouldn’t fall victim to a world stacked against him.** Despite these disputes, they were always a team.

But a man named Abel would change all of that. Patricia met and married Abel after apartheid ended but still during Noah’s childhood. **At first, Abel was a kind and charismatic man, but his alcoholism and temper would change him into an abuser.** He started to beat both Patricia and Noah, and no one, not even the police, could stop him. It would take all of Noah’s adolescent life and some of his early adult years before Patricia would find the strength to leave Abel, but by this time, the damage had been done. Noah, unable to live in the toxic environment any longer and angry at Patricia for staying with this man, separated himself and became estranged. He wouldn’t reunite with his family for years, until Abel’s rage had grown to such fierce heights that he attacked Patricia in front of her new family and shot her twice, including once in the head.

### An Uncertain Future

Noah and Robert lost touch when he was 13, mostly owing to Abel’s disapproval of the relationship. **A decade passed before Noah finally tracked his father down and reunited.** All of the doubt and distance Noah felt about his father disappeared the first time he saw Robert again. By now, Noah’s career had taken off, and Robert had been following his son’s progression the whole time. He was proud of who Noah had become.

### Racism in South Africa

More than just a memoir, **_Born a Crime_ is also part history lesson, part social commentary about one of the most significant examples of institutionalized racism in history.** The origins of colonial intrusion in South Africa and the lasting effects of greed, power, and oppression are paired with anecdotes both from Noah’s life and life in general. **These anecdotes explore not only the illegitimacy of apartheid, but also the manner in which it created suffering and long-term detriment in the lives of black citizens.**

For example, the high unemployment rate for blacks post-apartheid relates to the inability of employers to afford regular wages once the massive pool of slave-laborers were given rights. Furthermore, because of the lacking educational system geared toward blacks during apartheid and the illegality of work beyond manual labor or domestic service, blacks had few skills and little knowledge to take into the new world. Without knowledge or resources, many were unemployable and unable to change their circumstances.

#### Learning to Survive

Noah describes apartheid from an insider’s perspective, finding connections in his life that relate directly to the legacy of the laws. He was fortunate to have been able to change his circumstances and become a successful, financially independent person. **He credits his mother for educating him and never forcing him to limit his life based on race.** He credits the help of friends and family for supporting him when he was in trouble and providing the resources he needed to make something of his life. He knows that without resources and a support system, he would have had no options beyond the fate of most black South Africans: a life of poverty and survival.
