## Chapter 4: Learning to Fit In

**Being mixed in a black family was basically the same as being white for Noah.** He wasn’t punished by his grandmother like his black cousins were. He was treated more leniently, being let off for bad behavior that was much worse than what his cousins were being beaten for.

**Growing up this way helped him understand why whites are quick to hold onto their privilege.** He never argued with his special treatment. He would rather allow his cousins to be punished for his misdeeds than take the beatings himself.

But as a small child, Noah didn’t understand that his skin color was the cause of the special treatment. He thought of color as types of chocolate, just different flavors of the same thing. His flavor was simply the combination of dark and white chocolate. He was milk chocolate. When other blacks referred to him as white or treated him as such, he just thought they didn’t know much about colors. He thought his special treatment was specific to who he was. It was a “Trevor” thing, not a “race” thing.

His lack of understanding was compounded by the fact that there were no other people who looked like him as a point of reference. **In Soweto, with a population of nearly one million people, Noah was the only mixed person for miles.** In fact, after apartheid ended and he could venture outdoors, his grandmother’s neighbors started using him as a landmark: “Take a right at the light-skinned boy.”

Kids would point at him like a spectacle. Some tried to feel what his skin felt like. Others ran away from him. The other children had rarely seen a white person and didn’t know the difference. They didn’t have TV, never left the township, and police didn’t count.

### The Boy of Many Languages

**Another way apartheid created discord in the black community was through language.** There were many tribes and languages spoken in Soweto. During apartheid, members of certain tribes were only allowed to learn that tribe’s language. Zulu kids learned Zulu, Xhosa kids Xhosa, and so on. Therefore, different groups of blacks believed they were different because they spoke different languages.

Speaking a different language than someone makes you an outsider. In contrast, speaking the same language makes them see you as being “one of us.” **Therefore, in a world where skin color is meant to separate people, language can be used to bring people together.**

Noah understood that language signified identity and community. As he grew older and realized the color of his skin would always make him different, **Noah saw language as his only avenue for fitting in**. He was inspired by the way languages had helped his mother move through the world and manage difficult situations. For instance, when a white store clerk told a security guard in Afrikaans to follow Patricia and make sure she didn’t steal, Patricia turned and, in perfect Afrikaans, told the clerk to follow her to show her where to find what she needed.

Noah learned many languages. He spoke English as his first language because his mother wanted him to have a leg up in society. He spoke Xhosa because that was his home language. He spoke Afrikaans because Patricia believed in knowing the language of your oppressor. He spoke other languages his mother had picked up as a way to survive. He spoke German because of his father.

He started using language like his mother did. **When he would get suspicious looks or find himself the target of unwanted attention, speaking whatever language the other people spoke helped him assuage the conflicts.** One time, a group of kids behind him was plotting to rob the “white” kid. Noah turned and spoke their language, saying they should rob someone else together. The kids laughed and apologized for not knowing he was one of them.

### You Are Who You Surround Yourself With

When apartheid ended, all-white schools opened their doors to other races.**** Through his mother’s job, Noah was able to attend a private, elite Catholic school with kids who were black, white, Indian, and colored. There was no sense of segregation. They wore uniforms, had the same classes and teachers, and every social group comprised different races.

But this existence was unrealistic. **In this environment, he was sheltered from the realities of race in the real world.** Noah wasn’t treated differently, so he didn’t know to feel different. His mother never forced one race or another on him, so Noah never had to choose what race he was. **He never set limits on who he could be or what he should be doing based on race.** But in the real world, choosing sides was required, and he was about to learn which side he would choose.

After sixth grade, Noah changed schools, going to a government school instead. He was required to take an aptitude test and scored well enough to be placed in the advanced class. On his first day, Noah saw that all but four of the thirty kids in his class, including him, were white. This fact, in itself, was not particularly significant. But when it was time for recess, he understood how race worked in his new school.

Once outside, he saw that there were, in fact, a lot of black kids in the school. He also noticed that the social breakdowns followed the racial divides**.** White kids played together. Black kids played together. And there Noah was, in the middle with no group. **It was the first time he realized that people could occupy the same space and not be together.**

An Indian kid from his class took pity on Noah and befriended him. When this kid found out Noah spoke several languages, he took him around to the various black groups and had him speak, like a parlor trick.

The black kids couldn’t believe Noah spoke their languages. They weren’t used to white or colored people knowing African languages because they were seen as inferior to English or Afrikaans. The black students wanted to know how he knew their languages, and Noah said it was because he was black—he had only ever been raised around black people. The black kids disagreed, but **his knowledge of their languages made them believe he was okay**.

**Noah realized where he belonged: with the black students.** He asked the school counselor to be transferred from the advanced class to the regular class. The school tried to dissuade him, assuring him that the black kids were going to hinder his progress. He didn’t care. **He wanted to be with people he understood, even if it meant being held back.**

After that day, **Noah identified as black because he saw that he was culturally black**. The world saw him as a colored or mixed person, but with the black kids, he could just be himself, the only person he knew how to be.
