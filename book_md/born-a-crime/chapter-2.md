## Chapter 2: A Mixed Child Born a Crime

**Noah’s birth was a crime under the laws of apartheid.** Blacks and other races were not allowed to have relations with whites, and vice versa. The narrative under which apartheid existed was that blacks were fundamentally inferior and whites had no desire to engage with them, hence the segregation. Therefore, **a child born as a product of racial mixing served to debunk the theories upholding apartheid.** Because of this, a mixed child became a symbol of treason.

The government made the no-relations law the priority, strictly enforcing it through secret surveillance tactics. **The punishment for interracial relations was five years in prison.** However, often the white partner would be given a mere warning, whereas the black partner would be jailed or charged with rape if he was male.

A mixed child was not a new phenomenon during apartheid. In fact, there were plenty of mixed-race people by the time apartheid started. These people had historically been classified as a separate race: colored.

#### The Colored Race

The history of the colored race extends to the origins of South Africa**.** The Khoisan were the original tribe in South Africa, similar to Native Americans.**** When the colonials first came, along with the land, they ravaged the Khoisan women. Those women gave birth to mixed children as a result.

Other slaves were brought in from surrounding regions and procreated with the Khoisan people, further decreasing the bloodline. The original tribe was becoming extinct, either through war and slaughter or inter-tribe relations.

**The combination of generations of people descending from the Khoisan created a race of diverse heritages and racial make-ups.** Because many were descendants of white men, they tended toward white culture.

Most coloreds speak Afrikaans and don’t know other Afr**ican languages.** Almost all aspects of the colored culture come from the Dutch Afrikaners.

The plight of the colored race during apartheid is a messy one. The government didn’t know how to classify colored people. To mitigate this, **coloreds were granted second-class status, what was colloquially considered “almost white.”** They had more privileges than blacks but not as many as whites. They were caught in the middle, teetering on the cusp of an almost-full life.

### A Mother’s Protest

**Patricia knew having a mixed child was a crime** , but she saw it as her way of resisting the unjust laws.

**Many aspects of Patricia’s life at that time were illegal.** During apartheid, there were few jobs available for blacks. Men worked as manual laborers on farms, in factories, or in mines, and women worked in factories or as domestic workers. But Patricia was never one to conform.

As a young woman living in the township of Soweto with her family, she took a typing course. Skilled jobs or executive positions were reserved for whites, making her efforts seem futile**.** But the government, under pressure from international communities regarding the unjust nature of apartheid, rolled back the restrictions on labor in the 1980s.**** White business owners could now hire “diversity hires,” or the token black person, in clerical positions low on the corporate ladder. Patricia was able to find secretarial work for a large pharmaceutical company located in a suburb of the rich white area of Johannesburg.

It was forbidden for blacks to live in Johannesburg. **All blacks had been relocated to townships developed by the government, places close enough to white towns that laborers could get to their menial jobs but far enough away to remain segregated.** But Patricia had grown tired of life in Soweto. So, one day, she packed what little belongings she had and moved to Johannesburg. She was 22.

#### Hiding in Plain Sight

**Patricia had to find a way to live in a city that forbade it.** At first, she slept in public restrooms. Then, she met a few Xhosa prostitutes who helped her learn how to live in the city. **The women helped Patricia disguise herself as a maid so she could walk around undetected.** They helped her meet white men who were willing to rent apartments to black women for a price, which was often not monetary. Fortunately, Patricia made enough from her job to pay rent and didn’t have to barter with her body.

She was often caught and arrested. Black maids were forced to carry documentation validating their labor status and right to move around the city, which other laborers were not allowed to do. Patricia didn’t have this documentation, but she always had money to pay the fine. She would be released from jail and go back to doing the same thing.

#### A Subversive Haven in the City

Patricia’s apartment was in a culturally active, artistic community called Hillbrow. **This location was more liberal and home to whites who disapproved of or didn’t care about apartheid.** One of these people was a Swiss-German named Robert.

The threat of police was always close in this neighborhood. Neighbors were encouraged to spy on one another. Women who dated the white men in the apartments might turn a black woman in, especially a prostitute. Some blacks were even employed by the government to spy on other blacks.

At any point, Patricia could have been turned in to the police or suspected of being a spy, which had other consequences. Her ability to trust the people was small, but Robert lived on her floor and seemed trustworthy. He was quiet, reserved, and uninterested in the laws of apartheid.

Robert was almost twice Patricia’s age, and their relationship was more friendship than lovers. Still, one night, she propositioned him about having a child. Not only was having Robert’s baby a form of resistance for Patricia, it was also advantageous. She wanted a baby, not a marriage, and Robert said he didn’t want a child. Also, because it was illegal, he could have no legal claim to the baby. He said no many times before finally conceding.

On February 20, 1984, Patricia gave birth to Noah. She told the doctors the father was from a different country to explain Noah’s complexion. Despite their dubiousness, the doctors accepted her story because they had to fulfill the requirements of race and nationality on the birth certificate. **On Noah’s birth certificate, there is no one listed as his father and his nationality simply says “another country.”**

#### Concealing Her Crime

Before Noah was born, Patricia found a new apartment in an adjacent neighborhood. She thought this would ensure her freedom from Robert’s involvement. But **when Robert saw her afterward and Noah wasn’t with her, he realized he couldn’t have a child and not be involved**. The period that followed would become one of dire secrecy for both Patricia and Robert.

Because Robert couldn’t be seen with Noah in public—**a white man with a mixed son would raise too many questions** —Patricia would take Noah to a park, and Robert would join them at a safe distance. This worked most of the time, but once, Noah noticed his father and ran toward him, yelling “Daddy! Daddy!” Other people started to look, and Robert tried to run away. Noah chased him, thinking it was a game of tag.

Soon, Noah could only visit Robert at his home, which was safest for everyone. It was equally dangerous for Patricia to be seen with a mixed child. As a baby, she could wrap him up in a swaddle to hide him, but as Noah grew bigger, hiding him became problematic.

She found a solution. **Patricia acted as if Noah was a colored child, meaning he had colored parents, which wasn’t illegal.** She sent him to a colored daycare and found a colored woman in her building who agreed to pretend to be Noah’s mother when they went out. Patricia would act as the maid. If Patricia had to take Noah out alone, she’d have to pretend he wasn’t hers if any police were around.

#### Noah’s Sheltered Life

After Noah was born, three years after her departure, Patricia took him to Soweto to meet her family. Noah started staying at his grandmother’s house for weeks at a time and during holidays. **But even though Soweto was a black township, being mixed was still a problem.**

Police in Soweto wore riot gear on the streets. They were more like a military presence, and they watched for malfeasance more closely. Because of this police presence, **Noah was never allowed outside the confines of his grandmother’s walls for fear of being seen**. If he was caught, the police could send him to an orphanage in the colored district. His family could be deported or thrown in prison. He had to be smuggled in and out of the house.

Never one to sit still long, or follow rules, Noah dug a hole in the yard one day and ran off. His family searched for him frantically. He had no idea what sort of trouble he could have caused.

**Most of Noah’s memories of growing up during apartheid are indoor memories.** He didn’t have any friends because he couldn’t play with the other kids. But he was good at being alone. He lived inside of books or his imagination. To this day, Noah has to remind himself to be social and not get too comfortable alone.

#### “We Could Have Left?”

**As a celebrity, Noah travels often and meets other mixed South African adults around his age.** Their stories all start out similarly. Their parents met in Hillbrow or Cape Town and lived secretly in an apartment. The difference is that most of them were taken away to grow up in exile with the white parent.

When Noah first heard these stories, he couldn’t believe his ears. He had no idea leaving had been an option. When he asked his mother why they didn’t leave, she responded, “This is my country. Why should I leave?”
