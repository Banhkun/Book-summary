## Part III | Chapter 13: The Big Man on Campus

Before Noah expanded his own enterprise to include pirated CDs, he sold them for a white student two years older named Andrew. The two met after Noah overheard Andrew complaining about being ripped off by the black students. The black students would buy items on credit and never pay. He was too afraid to collect.

Noah offered to partner up and manage the black students for a fee. Around this time, Noah also convinced Patricia to buy him a computer for school work. At first, he just wanted to play video games. But Andrew was a whiz at computers, and he helped Noah improve his with more memory and features and taught him how to download music.

Noah worked for Andrew for a year. When it came time for Andrew to graduate, he gave Noah his CD burner to keep the business going. Suddenly, Noah had everything he needed to go into business by himself.

Noah was a natural at the bootleg game. He was good at selling and had a product that was a hot commodity. **CD burners were expensive and uncommon, so Noah had a monopoly on the pirated-CD market.**

Part of what helped Noah’s business was that he catered to everyone’s tastes. He still didn’t know about popular music because it wasn’t allowed in the house, and he didn’t listen to music when he was downloading it. He was able to amass a large variety of music without bias.

One day, Noah’s employee Bongani gave him the idea of making CDs with only the best tracks of different albums, rather than whole albums. So, Noah started selling mixed CDs, which was a boon for business. Bongani had another idea: make the tracks fade in and out so the momentum of the beat wasn’t lost between songs. Again, Noah listened, and his party mixes were a hit.

Noah was making hand over fist with these new products. **At one point, he was making 500 rand a week, which is more than some domestic workers still make today.** For the first time, Noah was financially independent.

#### The Importance of a Helping Hand

Noah was living the dream, and he had Andrew to thank for it. **Andrew’s generosity made Noah see the world through a different lens.** He saw how important it was for marginalized communities to be given the proper resources in life after they’ve struggled for so long. Because Andrew was white, he’d been afforded more resources and opportunities. But how could the poor be expected to change their circumstances when they aren’t given the proper tools?

People saw providing resources to the needy as a handout, but Noah understood that **a resource was nothing without ingenuity and hard work**. Noah had the tools he needed, but a CD burner alone wouldn’t have made him a success.**** It takes both money and ingenuity to change your life. Someone may have one, but without the other, success is unlikely.
