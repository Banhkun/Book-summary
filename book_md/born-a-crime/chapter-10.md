## Chapter 10: The Entrepreneur

Noah started eighth grade at Sandringham High School, a school mixed with different races and run like a charter school in America. **The school was large and represented every race of South Africa, serving as a sort of model of how the country at large could or should be.**

**Despite the diverse student body, Noah found himself again on the outside of the different groups.** The cliques, more often than not, comprised mostly one race. However, this breakdown had more to do with class structure, geography, and activity interests than race. Kids from the suburbs hung out with other kids from the suburbs, and the same was true for kids from townships. Athletes hung out with athletes, computer enthusiasts the same, and so on. Certain social classes or races of students were more likely to play certain sports or have interests in certain clubs.

Noah didn’t fit into any of these groups. He mostly hung out with the poor black students, but he never got to see them outside of school. He didn’t ride their buses to the townships and couldn’t hang out with them on weekends because Patricia never had enough money for gas. **Whenever school was not in session, Noah was alone.**

Noah’s family didn’t live close to the school, so his walk was long, which meant he was always late and, consequently, getting detention. During each day’s assembly, his name was always on the detention list announced to the student body. He was so famous as the detention kid that when his name wasn’t announced one day, everyone cheered.

### Finding His Niche

After the assembly was lunch, and most everyone got snacks and food from the tuck shop, a market stand. Noah was a fast runner, and he’d always be the first to make it to the tuck shop. Being first in line was a big deal. The sooner you were able to get food, the sooner you could eat, and the rest of the lunch break would be free time. There was also the chance that the tuck shop would run out of food.

Seeing that Noah was always at the front of the line, kids started asking him to buy food for them, even offering to give him part of the change in exchange. **Noah recognized the economic opportunity in front of him and became the “tuck-shop guy.”**

He started taking orders at the assembly. He started doing so much business, he had to turn people away. Eventually, he started accepting only five orders a day, offering his services to the highest bidders. Soon, Noah was making enough money to buy his lunch with his profits and keep the money from his mom as petty cash.

**Noah found it easy to maneuver among the different groups as the tuck-shop guy.** His presence was non-threatening and non-intrusive. He blended in, popping in long enough to participate in whatever each group was discussing or playing, maybe tell a few jokes, then move on.

The other kids accepted these intrusions because Noah provided a service they wanted. **He was still an outsider, but at least he wasn’t an outcast anymore.**
