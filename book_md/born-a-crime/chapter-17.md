## Chapter 17: The Good Mother

**Noah and his mother had always been a team.** They argued, they fought, but there was always love between them, even when Patricia teased him about his looks. For instance, after the matric dance, Noah kept getting his hair relaxed and braided. Patricia teased him about putting so much effort into his appearance. But on Sundays, she’d dress to the nines for church. She’d tease Noah that he wasn’t the prettiest one in the house anymore.

Noah couldn’t help but agree. He saw his mom as a beautiful, strong woman, inside and out. **But as he got older, a wedge would form in their relationship.** This wedge was named Abel.

### A New Member of the Team

After Patricia met Abel at the garage where she took the Beetle, she and Noah would visit him often. Noah was six and didn’t understand adult behavior, but he knew this man was suddenly part of their lives.

Abel was tall, with strong arms and large hands. He was moderately handsome, funny, and charismatic. He always helped whoever was in need. The world knew him as a good man. **But at home, he was abusive.**

At first, Abel was just Patricia’s cool friend they sometimes hung out with. But after the fire, when Abel moved into their Eden Park home, their lives changed forever.

When Patricia told Noah she was marrying Abel, he tried to talk her out of it.**** He wasn’t angry or jealous. He just had an inclination that Abel was bad news. Noah had seen Abel’s fury the night at the mulberry tree when he beat up a child, and it hadn’t surprised him a bit. Furthermore, Abel’s name held the answer to his character. His Tsonga name was Ngisaveni, which meant “be afraid.”

### The Wolf at the Table

After a year of marriage, Patricia gave birth to Andrew. Abel took the family to his parent’s house over Christmas in the Tsonga homeland of Tzaneen. Abel’s family was traditional, believing in stereotypical gender roles, in which women were subservient.

Patricia hated the customs.**** She didn’t believe in bowing to men (which was something women literally did) and made a mockery out of bowing when called upon.

In Tsonga tradition, the firstborn is cherished, especially a firstborn son, and treated with more reverence than the other children. To Abel, bringing home his firstborn son was a monumental event, and Patricia was supposed to play the dutiful woman. **Her refusal to perform the customs were taken as a personal affront.** He felt she was disrespecting him, and they argued the whole time. Patricia never went to visit Abel’s family again.

#### Paradise Lost

Once Patricia married Abel, she started to lose control of her life. **Abel tried to make their family a traditional Tsonga family.** He created new rules for the house, such as relegating Fufi and Panther to the yard. He thought going to church all day was disrespectful to him. What kind of wife spends the whole day away from her husband? What would people think?

Abel stopped fixing the Beetle so Patricia couldn’t drive to church. She took minibuses instead, but without the car, Noah wasn’t able to visit his father. Abel refused to drive them, feeling it was insulting for his wife to spend time with her ex. Noah’s relationship with Robert dwindled; then Robert moved to Cape Town.

Abel’s drinking also became a major problem. He was drunk every night by the time he came home from work. Some nights, he didn’t come home at all.

One night, Patricia and Noah awoke to a fire in the kitchen. Abel had come home late and passed out with a pot on a burner.**** The kitchen was scorched. Patricia woke him up and cursed him for being so irresponsible. Abel didn’t care. He was drunk.

Patricia called her mother and started to complain. Abel came in and disconnected the call, which incensed her more. She started yelling at him about his behavior. After taking it for a minute, **Abel smacked her across the face so hard, she went flying.** Noah grabbed Andrew and watched the scene from the doorway.

Patricia couldn’t believe it. It was the first time she’d ever been hit by a man.**** She jumped up and kept arguing. He hit her again, and she grabbed the boys and ran out of the house.

**Patricia went straight to the police station to press charges, but what she found were patronizing officers.** The cops accused her of making Abel angry and deserving it. They told her she didn’t want to get her husband in trouble. They said it was family business and to handle it at home. They refused to press charges. When Abel walked in, still drunk, the station became like a locker room, and the matter was laughed away.

Noah was nine and couldn’t believe what was happening. He thought cops had a duty to help. **That night, he learned that police were just men with badges, not defenders of the law.**

Patricia took the boys to Soweto, and Abel followed a few weeks later to apologize. His easy way and charm made his apology seem ingenuous. Patricia wasn’t sold, but her mother convinced her to go back. She said all men hit women, even Temperance. Patricia went home with Abel, and things went back to normal for a few years.

### What We Do for Love

Abel was a talented mechanic and known for his skills. Patricia believed in him and wanted to help him succeed. When the garage where they’d first met closed down, Patricia used her savings to help Abel buy it. But the garage was drowning in debt, and they inherited all of it.

**Keeping the garage alive became their lives.** After school, Noah would do his homework there while Abel worked. Sometimes, he would sleep in a car if Abel was behind and had to work through the night.

The whole family started spending nights in the garage. Eventually, Patricia sold the Eden Park house to support the business. They lived in the garage full time. Noah was 11 years old.

The garage was a cold cement room filled with machines, cars, and parts. Abel, Patricia, and Andrew slept in the office on a floor mat. Noah slept in cars. He became a connoisseur of car sleeping, knowing which ones provided the most room and which ones were the most comfortable. American cars were the best with their big bench seats.

Noah had to clean himself in a janitor sink, use rearview mirrors to do his hair, then put on his school uniform without soiling it. **He never wanted the kids at school to know where he lived.**

Noah also had to work at the garage after school. He couldn’t play anymore. He couldn’t do his homework anymore. He’d change from his uniform to work clothes and climb under the hood of a car. He could do tune-ups and basic service tasks by himself.

Despite all the work, the business wasn’t making any money. At one point, they couldn’t afford food anymore. For a month, Noah and his family ate a dish of wild spinach and caterpillars. It was the poorest they’d ever been.

**Noah hated this period of life the most—always working, nothing to eat, getting dressed for school at the garage.** He wasn’t mad at Abel and his mother, though, because he could see how hard they worked. But he soon learned that their life was worse than it needed to be.

Abel was a poor businessman and was buying parts on credit with crazy interest rates. He was amassing huge debts. Instead of paying off the debts with the money he was making, he used the money to buy alcohol, drinking the business into the ground.

Patricia quit her job and started doing the books to help. She used her office skills to turn things around. She was making it work, and customers and vendors noticed. But Abel started to feel like she was taking over the business, and he didn’t like it.

Finally, after a year of striving for nothing, Patricia left the business. She wasn’t going to sacrifice her life so he could get drunk. She found another secretarial job and bought the house in Highland North. Not long after, the garage closed and Abel moved his shop to the back yard.

### Lessons of War

**After the move to Highland North, Patricia divorced Abel, but only financially.** A couple could be legally divorced for financial independence but still traditionally married as a union. Patricia took back control of her own finances and started using her maiden name again, but they were still a family under one roof.

Patricia was moving up at work and making more money. **She paid for everything, which made Abel feel even less like a man.** He started drinking more. **He became violent more often** , including one incident when he trapped Noah in the kitchen pantry and punched him in the ribcage for a small school infraction. He started beating Patricia more regularly, as well. Each time, the police were called. Each time, they buddied up with Abel and did nothing.

Even with these episodes, Abel’s funny, charismatic character was always there under the booze. **Their lives were encased in terror, but when he wasn’t abusing them, it was hard not to love him.**

Then Abel bought a gun. That was the beginning of the end for Noah. Life became toxic in the house.**** Noah grew to almost the same height as Abel. If Noah had been Abel’s son, it would have been fine. But he wasn’t, and that made him a threat to Abel.

In addition, Noah had become a representation of Patricia’s former life, a life that Abel couldn’t control. **Abel hated Noah for reminding him of Patricia’s past** , and Patricia told Noah he needed to leave. She feared what Abel would do to Noah and helped him move out after high school.
