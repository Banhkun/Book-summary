## Chapter 12: Girls

Patricia frequently talked to Noah about women. But her comments were always about grown-up relationships. She taught him what it meant to be a man and how to respect a woman. But she never taught him how to navigate puberty and girls his own age. Noah would have to learn those lessons on his own.

### The First Love

After he moved from Catholic school to the government school, Noah found himself on the cusp of Valentine’s Day having no idea what it was. Catholic schools didn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day. When he found out what Valentine’s Day was, he thought it was bizarre. But he still wanted to be part of it.

His friend suggested Noah make a girl named Maylene his valentine.**** Maylene was colored, the only colored girl in the school. She and Noah looked the same, so people thought they should be together.

Noah already knew Maylene. When he still lived in Eden Park, they had walked home together from school. But Patricia and Abel had gotten married and had a son, Andrew. They’d moved out of their old neighborhood.

Noah liked Maylene, not romantically, but he thought she was smart and cute. If his friend hadn’t suggested her as a valentine, the thought never would have occurred to him. But Noah was motivated by his friend’s assurance that Maylene liked him, something he’d never experienced, so he asked how to make it happen.

Noah got a crash course in the mating rituals of adolescents. It was the typical “have your friends talk to her friends and work it out” scenario. Her friends gave his friends the green light, and Noah asked Maylene out after school one day. She said yes and gave him his first kiss.

Noah was over the moon. **Not only did he have a valentine, but he had his first girlfriend.** He wanted to make Valentine’s Day special. He saved his money and bought flowers, a card, and a stuffed bear. He even wrote a poem in the card using Maylene’s name. When the anticipated day came, Noah took his gifts and waited for Maylene to come out of class.

Standing alone in the hallway, Noah watched other couples exchanging gifts and becoming giddy with the spirit of the day. There was no sign of Maylene, but still, he waited.

**When Maylene finally appeared, she told Noah she’d found a different valentine and was that guy’s girlfriend now.** She still took the gifts. Noah didn’t know what to think. He assumed this was normal behavior. Also, the other kid was white, popular, and attractive.

Even though he was hurt, Noah had to admit the situation made sense. **That day, he realized the good-looking guys would always get the girls, and he wasn’t one of them.**

### The Ugly Duckling

**Noah didn’t age gracefully during adolescence.** He had such severe acne over his face and neck, it was considered a medical condition. He was too poor to afford a haircut and wore a large, unruly Afro. He was also growing so fast, Patricia was constantly having to buy him new clothes. Sick of this waste of money, she started buying his clothes a couple of sizes too big so he would grow into them. He was tall, gangly, and had big feet. Needless to say, **he was not in demand by the ladies**.

After the lessons learned from the Maylene debacle, Noah accepted his fate as the funny, unattractive guy. **He didn’t try to ask girls out because he figured there was no point.** He also didn’t want to upset the balance of his burgeoning business. His role as tuck-shop guy worked because he was nobody to everybody.

### The One Who Got Away

During his freshman year, Noah met a girl who made him rethink his entire position on dating. He was friends with a girl named Johanna, whom he’d gone to school with off and on over the years. Johanna was popular and beautiful, but her best friend, Zaheera, was gorgeous. Noah had a huge crush on her. Although Noah knew he wasn’t dating material, he _was_ good friend material and knew how to make girls laugh.

He devised a plan. **He would become best friends with Zaheera.** He would become so close to her that by senior year, he could ask her to the matric dance, or the South African version of prom. It was a three-year plan.

One day, Noah got up the courage to ask for Zaheera’s phone number. He was surprised she gave it to him and even more surprised when they started talking frequently on the phone, sometimes for an hour or more. They were also hanging out more at school. The plan was working better than expected.

**Noah was adamant that he wasn’t going to tell Zaheera how he felt.** They were getting closer, and he didn’t want to screw things up. Plus, Zaheera was in an on-again, off-again relationship with a popular boy named Gary. Noah was content to bide his time as the dutiful friend through the whole thing.

After the holiday break freshman year, Noah returned to school, but Zaheera wasn’t there. When he asked Johanna where she was, he learned Zaheera’s family had emigrated to America for her father’s work over the break.

But that wasn’t all he found out. Johanna told him that **Zaheera’d had a huge crush on Noah and was waiting for him to make a move.** Noah was heartbroken that she was gone. More so, he was ashamed of how he’d never had the courage to tell her how he felt. All the times he could have said something, and now he would never get the chance.

### A Recipe for Disaster

When apartheid fell, a focus became making sure all blacks felt represented in the new democracy. To ensure no one felt left out, **the new government made all of the major languages official languages in South Africa. There are eleven.**

**With so many languages, communicating became a daily struggle.** No one knew other languages beyond what was picked up here and there, such as at parties where three or four languages were spoken and quick translations were made. Somehow, the people made it work and could get by. But sometimes, they couldn’t.

### The Most Beautiful Girl in the World

Noah was a straight-up businessman near the end of high school. **No longer just the tuck-shop guy, he now sold pirated CDs as part of his enterprise.** With this new addition to his business brought the need to expand his footprint. He hired two other kids, Tom and Bongani, to help him sell the CDs.

The matric dance was on the horizon, but Noah still hadn’t made much headway with girls by his senior year. He still wasn’t cool or an insider, and he assumed he wouldn’t be going to the dance, or at least not with a date.

When Tom found out Noah didn’t have a date to the prom, he came up with a solution. Tom said if Noah gave him more of the CD profits and some free music for himself, he would find Noah a gorgeous date. Noah agreed, thinking nothing would come of it.

Then, one day, Tom showed up and said he’d found the most beautiful girl Noah had ever seen. He took Noah into the city to meet her. Still, Noah was dubious.

#### Tom the Hustler

Tom was also the son of a domestic worker but went to a different school than Noah.**** Tom sold Noah’s CDs at this other school. Tom was a born salesman. He was charismatic and could talk anyone into anything. Noah saw the extent of this ability when Tom took him to a township talent show.

The township was called Hammanskraal, a black settlement in the middle of nowhere. The only nice thing Noah owned were a pair of Timberland boots, the same kind made popular by American hip-hop artists. Tom told Noah to make sure to wear his boots, and Noah complied.

When they arrived at the show, the host announced that a well-known American rapper, Spliff Star, who worked with Busta Rhymes, was going to perform. Noah couldn’t believe it. What was an American rap star doing in the ghetto?

As Noah looked around, he noticed that everyone was looking at him. It turned out that Tom had told everyone he could bring Spliff Star to the talent show, but it would cost them. The organizers had paid him upfront, and now Tom wanted Noah, in his boots, to play the part.

Noah initially refused, but eventually, Tom convinced him to go on stage. It was ridiculous. **Tom beat-boxed while Noah faked his way through a few Busta Rhymes’ songs.** It was a terrible performance, but the crowd went wild, believing it was the best thing they’d ever experienced.

This was the kind of guy Tom was. So, when he and Noah arrived at the future prom date’s house, it came as no surprise that Tom had skin in the game. Tom was setting Noah up with this girl as a way to have a chance with the sister.

#### The Silver Lining

Noah forgot all about Tom’s duplicitous ways when the girl, Babiki, showed up. She had light skin and beautiful eyes and was the most beautiful girl Noah had ever seen. There was no one like Babiki at his school.

Noah didn’t know what to do. He wasn’t used to talking to beautiful women. The saving grace was that Babiki was also shy and said little except “hi” and “bye.” Noah couldn’t believe his luck. He’d never thought he would ever go on a date. Now he was taking this stunner to the dance for everyone to see, and she was just as nervous as he was.

During the weeks leading up to the dance, Tom and Noah continued to visit Babiki in the city. He learned her family was Pedi, a smaller South African tribe. The Pedi were known to be poor, but they had a tendency toward scraping up whatever money they could to buy expensive clothes. Babiki was no different; she was a fashionista.

Noah and Babiki never went out alone.**** They didn’t talk much owing to her bashfulness and his nerves. But they enjoyed themselves with the group, and she would always hug him and sometimes kiss him goodbye.

The dance was approaching, and Noah kicked into high gear to get everything ready.**** He wanted the night to be as perfect as Babiki was beautiful. For that to happen, he needed a car, dress clothes, and a haircut.

#### Gearing Up

Abel offered to let Noah take one of the used cars from his garage, which was now located in their backyard. Noah was grateful, but what he really wanted was to take Abel’s BMW. He told Abel he needed a nice car because Babiki was no ordinary girl.

Abel made him a deal. If Babiki really was as beautiful as Noah said, he could take the BMW. Tom and Noah brought Babiki to Noah’s house and introduced her to Abel. Abel and Babiki chatted for a while, and then they took her back home. When Noah got back, Abel said the BMW was Noah’s to take.

With the car lined up, Noah turned his attention to his outfit. He knew he needed to look good, but he had no idea what good fashion was. He’d become accustomed to wearing a brand of sweat clothes called Powerhouse. He owned five of the same pants and sweatshirt ensembles in different colors. But Powerhouse would not cut it on prom night.

Bongani, Noah’s other employee, took it upon himself to give Noah a makeover.**** Noah, in love with American movies, wanted a long leather coat like Neo in _The Matrix_. But Bongani steered him toward a similar black leather coat that was more realistic. Paired with a nice sweater, pants, and suede shoes, Noah’s outfit was complete.

The last thing to handle was Noah’s immense unkempt Afro. Bongani took him to a black salon in the township where he lived. Noah decided to cornrow his hair, but he had to relax it first. The chemicals used to straighten black hair are harsh and toxic. But because Noah had never had it done or seen it done, he didn’t know how powerful they could be.

The stylist told him to let her know when the relaxer started to burn so she could wash it out. Noah wanted his hair to be perfect, so he withstood the first burning sensations. But soon, his scalp was on fire. He’d waited too long, and the chemicals had burned parts of his scalp.

Still, when the process was over, he liked the way his hair looked straight and combed back. He felt like a pimp. Six-hours later, his hair was cornrowed. Noah was floored by what he saw. He never thought he had a chance with girls, so he never thought to put any effort into his appearance. **For the first time, he liked what he saw in the mirror.**

#### The Big Night

When the night of the dance came, Noah was ready. Everything was perfect. But when he went to get Abel’s BMW, things took a turn for the worst, and they kept turning.

Noah and Tom found Abel drunk. He didn’t remember the dance, and he said if they wanted the car, they had to buy him beer first. After they came back with the beer, **Abel still wouldn’t let Noah take the BMW.** Noah pleaded for 30 minutes before giving up and taking a used red Mazda.

After wasting all that time with Abel, **Noah was an hour late to pick up Babiki**. She looked even more beautiful in her dress, but she was furious. She didn’t say a word to Noah. Unfortunately, her mood worsened after Noah got lost on the way to the dance, which was being held at a location off campus. Noah drove around the unfamiliar neighborhood for an hour before finding the venue.

**When they finally arrived, Babiki refused to get out of the car.** Noah tried to apologize and coax her out, but she only responded with “No.” Desperate, Noah ran inside to find Bongani. When Bongani came outside to help, he was taken aback by how beautiful she was. Rather than helping Noah, he ran back inside to tell the others.

Within minutes, the car was surrounded by a group of boys all vying for a look at Babiki. No one could believe she had come with Noah. All Noah could think about was how he’d spent all of high school trying to avoid embarrassing himself, and here he was, humiliated the first time he had a date.

Bongani was trying to help talk Babiki out of the car. Suddenly, he stopped and walked over to Noah. **He wanted to know if Noah knew Babiki didn’t speak English.** Noah didn’t believe Bongani. He walked to the car and said something to Babiki in English. The blank stare he got in return was all the evidence he needed.

Noah’s mind raced back through their time together since they’d met. **It suddenly dawned on him that he and Babiki had never talked when they hung out.** He hadn’t realized it because he was shy and she was shy. She always spoke Pedi, which was one of the few languages he didn’t speak.

One of the reasons he never noticed their lack of communication was that Babiki’s sisters spoke English. He was always able to pick up the gist of what was being said through their translations. And that was just how his mind worked. **He knew many languages, but his mind always translated what he heard into English.** Therefore, when he thought back on conversations, he remembered them in English.

He also remembered seeing her speak to Abel, but Abel spoke Pedi. He hadn’t been paying enough attention and just assumed they were speaking English. At the end of the day, the only English Noah could remember her saying were greetings and salutations.

He was mortified. Here, **he thought he’d had his first girlfriend ever for more than a month, and they’d never had a proper conversation**.

In a panic, Noah ran inside the dance looking for someone who spoke Pedi, but he didn’t find anyone. Babiki never got out of the car.**** Those few minutes inside were the only part of the dance Noah got to attend.

Noah stayed in the lot until the dance was over, then drove her home in silence. When they got to her home, he tried to find some way to relay how sorry he was. But Babiki leaned over and kissed him. After she said “Bye” and left, all Noah could think was that he didn’t understand women at all.
