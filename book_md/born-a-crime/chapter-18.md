## Chapter 18: From Abuse to Attempted Murder

Patricia eventually moved into her own bedroom for a year or two. Noah was counting the days until Andrew was eighteen and would leave home. He wanted his mother to be free to leave Abel once and for all. But when Andrew was nine, she became pregnant again.

**Physically, this pregnancy should never have happened.** Patricia’s tubes were tied after Andrew, and she was middle-aged. Not even the doctors knew what to say. But Patricia saw it as a sign from God. God wanted her to bring more decent men into the world. **She seemed regretful of her new predicament, but she was determined to make it work.**

Noah, on the other hand, saw that she would forever be stuck in that house with Abel. When the new baby, Isaac, was born, **Noah retreated from the family**. He didn’t visit often. Then, another event would make him stay away for good.

Noah had gone over to the house for a visit and found police cars out front. Patricia had intervened when Abel was fighting with one of his workers, and Abel used Andrew’s bicycle to beat her. As always, the police acted like old chums with Abel, and nothing happened.

After that incident, Patricia hired people from work to build her a small dwelling in the backyard, where she started living with Isaac. Noah was incredulous, but she told him it was the only power she had. No one was going to help her, but she would make sure Abel was shamed by a wife living in the backyard instead of with him.

Noah stopped calling and visiting. **As much as he hated Abel, his anger was directed more at Patricia. He blamed her for staying and choosing to be abused.** He was too young to understand domestic violence or how it affects people. He didn’t understand relationships at all.

Noah didn’t realize the predicament Patricia was in. Abuse was part of life for African women. No one stepped in, not even the police. What was she supposed to do with children from different fathers in a male-driven society that refused to acknowledge her suffering?

The last time Noah fought with her about Abel, **she told him if she tried to leave, he would kill all of them**. She was calm when she said it, matter-of-fact. Noah never mentioned it again.

Patricia did finally leave Abel, though. Noah doesn’t know why because he wasn’t around. He had started working as a comedian and was traveling more. Patricia bought a different house in the same neighborhood and met someone new.

### Tragedy Strikes

Life moved forward for years for Patricia and the younger boys. Then, one Sunday, she was coming home from church with her new husband and his family, her two sons included, when Abel got out of the car with his gun.

Abel pointed the gun at Patricia, telling her she ruined his life. Andrew stepped up and tried to reason with Abel, as he’d always been able to do. Abel had always listened to Andrew, but this time, Abel threatened to shoot him. Andrew could see it was a real threat and stepped aside.

Abel started shooting, and Patricia jumped in the way to protect the others. She was hit in the bottom and collapsed. She yelled for everyone to run.

Patricia was on the ground trying to get up when Abel pointed the gun directly at her head. He pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. He tried again. Another misfire. He kept trying to pull the trigger, but the gun kept malfunctioning.

When Abel became distracted by the gun, Patricia pushed him and ran for the car. Andrew jumped in beside her. Just as she got the car started, another shot rang out, and Patricia’s blood splattered the windshield. **Abel shot her in the back of the head through the rear window.** Andrew pulled her out of the way and got behind the wheel. He drove straight to the hospital.

#### A Son’s Love

Noah was in bed when he got the call from Andrew. He didn’t have to ask when Andrew said their mother had been shot. He knew it was Abel.

Noah raced to the hospital, worried but not scared. Andrew had been calm on the phone, even making small talk at first. **But when Noah learned she’d been shot in the head, he cried harder than he ever had.** He felt a pain so big there was no other way to release it.

Noah was able to see Patricia in the ER. He lost it at the sight of her covered in blood, a hole in her face, and part of her nose missing. Seeing her like that made him rage. He called Abel’s number, and Abel answered. Noah shouted that Abel had killed his mother. Calmly, Abel acknowledged it and said if he could, he’d kill Noah too.

A nurse told Noah and Andrew that Patricia would be taken to a state hospital because she didn’t have insurance.**** She’d canceled it because she never used it. Noah, now a burgeoning celebrity, said he would pay for her treatment. The nurse argued that the bills could be expensive. They didn’t yet know how much damage was involved. The bill could be as much as six hundred thousand rand. Noah would be paying off that debt forever.

**For an instant, Noah considered whether he should pay.** What if he lost all his money and she didn’t recover? What if it was up to him to raise his brothers now? He wondered what his mother would say. **She never wanted Noah to have to pay the black tax.** Noah was afraid of getting sucked back into poverty, but this was his mother. He gave the nurse his credit card.

The doctor came out after examining Patricia and didn’t know what to say. **She’d survived nothing short of a miracle.** Both bullets had passed through her body without hitting any major organs, arteries, veins, or nerves.

The bullet in her head slipped past the spinal cord, ricocheted off her cheekbone, and left through her nose. What Noah had seen earlier was just the aftermath. In actuality, Patricia had only lost a small bit off the side of her nose. Other than that, she was fine. They hadn’t even performed surgery. She was home within four days and back to work after another three.

Noah sat with her in recovery and felt regret. He was angry that he’d abandoned her and his brothers. He was mad that the police had never taken Abel’s abuse seriously. He was sorry he hadn’t killed Abel when he’d had the chance. He was furious with God. All of her devotion to Jesus, and this was what she got?

When Patricia woke up, she joked and said at least Noah was the prettiest one in the family now.**** They both laughed until they cried.
