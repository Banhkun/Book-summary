## Afterword

In an Afterword published in 2012, the four authors reflect on what they learned in 10 years of teaching their dialogue principles and getting feedback from people who used the principles in crucial conversations. Their insights included:

  * A crucial conversation can pop up at any time and you need to be alert to the signs.
  * Your position or title in your company doesn’t matter. Guiding a crucial conversation is the responsibility of the first person to recognize the key moment.


  * Be suspicious of your convictions during moments of strong emotion.
  * When you’re driven by a desperate need to be right, you don’t see others as they really are — they become threats.


  * Your emotions are incredibly fluid. In crucial moments they’re almost always wrong. You can learn to change them. And as you change your emotions you learn to change how you see those around you and change you own life as well.


  * When the other person doesn’t want dialogue, dialogue won’t happen.


  * The crucial conversation is the beginning of a dialogue, rather than your only chance to solve a problem.
  * You can use the dialogue skills to improve relationships over time (their use is not restricted to one-time interactions).


  * If you persist over time, refusing to take offense, making your motive genuine, showing respect, and constantly searching for mutual purpose, then the other person will almost always join you in dialogue.
