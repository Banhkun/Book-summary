## Chapter 7: Share Your Stories

Sharing your point of view when you have something difficult to say isn’t easy, but you can learn to do it successfully. Remember, it’s important that everyone’s information, no matter how controversial, be included in the shared pool.

Most conversations start on autopilot with friendly small talk, but in high-stakes conversations your emotions kick in and you don’t do as well.

When it comes to sharing touchy information:

  * People often say nothing.
  * They’re too blunt.
  * They say only part of what’s on their mind — they understate their views for fear of hurting others, or they sugarcoat their message.



However, **the best approach is to speak your mind completely, but in a way that makes it safe for others to hear and respond**.

> **Example: The Suspicious Affair**
> 
> A wife finds a hotel receipt and mistakenly thinks her husband is having an affair. The worst way to handle a touchy situation like this would be to plunge in with an accusation followed by a threat — that’s what most people would do.
> 
> But there’s a constructive way the woman can share and resolve her concerns using several dialogue steps (with the acronym STATE). More on those steps in a moment.

### Setting the Stage

To speak honestly when it could offend others, you have to maintain safety by blending confidence and humility.

**Confidence** : You must have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the appropriate person (and not complain to someone else), and confidence that you can speak honestly without attacking the other person.

**Humility** : You must be humble enough to realize that you don’t know everything, and you don’t always have to get your way. Your opinion is a starting point for discussion. With new information you might change your mind — so you express your opinion and also encourage others to express theirs.

### STATE Your Path

To have a healthy conversation about a tough topic, you must take care not to violate respect or safety with threats and accusations, despite your worst fears. To create conditions conducive to dialogue:

  * Start with heart: Think about what you really want and how dialogue can help you get it
  * Master your story: Realize you may be jumping prematurely to a clever story: victim, villain, or helpless. 
  * Think about other possible explanations, to open your mind to dialogue.



Use five skills with the acronym STATE to talk about sensitive topics:

  1. Share your facts.
  2. Tell your story.
  3. Ask for others’ paths.
  4. Talk tentatively.
  5. Encourage testing.



The first three skills involve _what_ to do. The last two are _how_ to do it.

### _What_ Skill #1: Share the Facts

Facts set the stage for all sensitive conversations. Start with the facts alone (which are observable), not your emotion-driven story (your conclusions). For example, a hotel receipt in your husband’s name is a fact — you can see it. Your belief about why he visited the hotel (absent his explanation) is a conclusion.

Starting with your worst-case scenario or conclusion creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you blurt out your conclusions, it’s ineffective. You expect bad results and get bad results. Or you hold the story inside because you feel it’s too risky to share — tension builds up and you blow up, getting the bad results you feared.

Starting with facts avoids these problems. Here’s why:

  * **Facts are the least controversial:** They provide a safe beginning. Facts are objective and noncontroversial while conclusions are highly subjective and controversial.
  * **Facts are the most compelling:** Starting with factual observations is the best way to get others to listen. You want to give others a basis for understanding how a reasonable person could think what you’re thinking. You’re not trying to win but to get your meaning added to the pool and to get a fair hearing.
  * **Facts are least likely to offend:** Because they’re neutral observations, facts are the least likely to offend or put others on the defensive. Starting with your story, on the other hand, could surprise and insult, and consequently derail dialogue. 
  * **It’s important to begin at the beginning:** Let others see the experience from your point of view, starting with your facts. When you offer your conclusions (your story), they’ll understand why.



### _What_ Skill #2: Tell Your Story

If you simply mention the facts, the other person may not understand the implications. For example, if you tell an employee, “I noticed you had company software in your briefcase,” they may not understand that you’re talking about a potential policy violation. You have to follow-up that observation with your conclusions.

It’s the combination of facts plus the conclusion there’s a problem that requires face-to-face discussion. When you tell your story:

  * **Take the risk:** When you move from the facts to your conclusions, others can become defensive. But it’s necessary to take the risk.
  * **Be confident:** It takes confidence to share a potentially upsetting story. However, if you’ve objectively examined the facts, you’ll come to a reasonable conclusion that deserves a hearing. You can be confident in adding important, though controversial, meaning to the pool. 
  * **Be selective:** Don’t just unload a pile of negative conclusions. Revise your villain story, so you can start in a non-threatening way: “My first reaction was to oppose your recommendation, but after thinking about it I realize I need to know more…”
  * **Be alert to safety problems:** As you share your story, watch for signs that others are feeling threatened. If people get defensive, restore safety by contrasting what you _don’t_ want and what you _do_ want. But don’t minimize your message — be confident enough to speak your mind.



### _What_ Skill #3: Ask For Others’ Paths

Remember that the key to sharing controversial ideas is to blend confidence and humility. Express confidence by sharing your facts and stories clearly. Then, **express humility by asking others how they see it**. Encourage them to express their facts, stories, and feelings. Listen closely and be willing to rethink your story as more information is presented.

### _How_ Skill #4: Talk Tentatively

**You’ll get people to listen if you describe both your facts and stories in a tentative, non-dogmatic way.** Speaking tentatively means telling your story as a story, not presenting it as an incontrovertible fact. For example, start with phrases indicating you’re sharing an opinion, not asserting a fact: “In my opinion...”, or “I’m beginning to wonder whether…” (rather than, “The fact is…” or “It’s obvious to me that...”).

Speaking tentatively also means sharing in a way that shows confidence in your conclusions, but that also suggests you’re open to challenges.

**You soften the message because you’re trying to add meaning to the pool, not force it on people**. If you’re overly assertive, your information won’t be accepted (won’t make it into the pool).

In fact, when talking with people holding opposite opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant they’ll be. Speaking in absolutes decreases your influence. Conversely, **the more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions**.

**Being tentative isn’t manipulative**. You’re tentative because your opinions may not be totally accurate or your information may be incomplete. At the same time, you shouldn’t pretend to be less confident than you are. Just be aware that your observations and stories could be flawed.

**The Goldilocks Test**

Your presentation should be neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. For example, if someone insists on telling you how to do something, don’t say: “I’m not stupid, you know.” (too hard) or “I know I’m a klutz, but…” (too soft). Instead, say: “I’m starting to feel like you don’t trust me. Is that what’s happening?” (just right).

### _How_ Skill #5: Encourage Testing

Sometimes others are reluctant to share their paths (facts, stories, and feelings), and you need to be more encouraging. You need to make clear that no matter how controversial their ideas, you want to hear them. If they don’t feel comfortable speaking up, you can’t test the accuracy/value of your views.

This is especially important if you’re talking with someone with a tendency to move to silence (to make the fool’s choice of not saying anything to avoid risk). When others are reluctant to speak up, try these steps:

  * **Explicitly invite opposing views.** Make it emphatically clear that you want to hear their views, no matter how different. If others disagree, you appreciate it and respect them for their courage in expressing their views. You need additional information to complete your story. Ask proactively: “What am I missing?”
  * **Be sincere:** Sometimes an invitation for opposing views sounds more like a threat than sincere request: “Well that’s the way I see it; any disagreement?” Be inviting with both words and tone.
  * **Play devil’s advocate:** Sometimes you can tell people disagree, but aren’t speaking up. To encourage sharing, play devil’s advocate. Counter your own view: “Maybe I’m wrong here; what if...?” 
  * **Persist:** Sometimes, others still don’t believe you really want their opinions. They may be skeptical: maybe you’re just trying to get them to agree with you, or you’re luring them into a trap where you’ll jump on them. This is particularly true if you’re an authority figure, or if they’ve experienced this in the past. You have to press as vigorously for opposing views as you do for you own view.



> **Example: The Suspicious Affair (cont’d)**
> 
> Revisiting the example of a wife confronting her husband about hotel receipts shows how to apply the dialogue skills for discussing a sensitive subject.
> 
> Instead of immediately accusing him of infidelity, the wife applies STATE skills.
> 
>   * Share your facts: She simply states that she has discovered a receipt for a hotel near their home.
> 
>   * Tell your story: She shares that the receipt worries her because that’s how her sister learned that her husband was having an affair.
> 
>   * Ask for others’ paths: She invites him to help put her mind at rest.
> 
>   * Talk tentatively: She explains that while her husband hasn’t given her reason to doubt him, she’s still worried.
> 
>   * Encourage testing: She asks him to call the hotel immediately, which he does. They learn there was a billing error.
> 
> 


### When You Go Overboard

You can get into trouble by pushing your point of view too hard. It gets heated and you feel you have to win. Others resist, argue, or retreat into silence, so you push harder. In the end no one is listening, and nothing is added to the pool of information.

Here’s how things go wrong.

  * **You feel you’re right.** When you push your ideas on others, it’s generally because you feel you’re right and they’re wrong. You feel there’s no need to expand the pool of information because you have the answer.
  * **You feel justified in using verbal tricks.** You stack the deck with supporting information, leaving out any contrary information; or you exaggerate or use inflammatory language. But the more forceful you become, the more resistance you generate.



**How To Change**

When you feel compelled to convince others that your way is best:

  * Stop.
  * Think about what you really want. Ask yourself, how you should behave to achieve what you want.
  * Use your STATE skills
    * Share your facts
    * Tell your story
    * Ask for others’ paths
    * Talk tentatively
    * Encourage testing
  * **Monitor conditions:** Notice when people start to resist. Notice what you’re doing — for instance, leaning forward, getting louder, filibustering, etc. The more strongly you feel, the more likely you are to go overboard.
  * **Tone it down:** Open your mind to the idea that others might have something relevant to say and ask them for their views. This isn’t easy— backing off when you feel strongly is counterintuitive, but passion can work against you.
  * **Stop yourself:** When you start to feel frustrated that others aren’t getting it, be aware you’re on an unproductive path and back off. Hold onto your belief but moderate your approach.
