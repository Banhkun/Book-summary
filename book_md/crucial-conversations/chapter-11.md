## Chapter 11: Tying It All Together

When you’re involved in a fast-moving crucial conversation, it can be hard to remember and apply the dialogue skills and principles. This chapter offers a simple suggestion for getting started, as well as a quick review of the principles and skills.

### Focus On These Two Things

First, the suggestion: One way people have succeeded in improving their handling of crucial conversations is by focusing on just two key principles: Pay attention to what’s happening, and ensure safety.

**1\. Pay attention to what’s happening:** Constantly ask yourself whether you’re in or out of dialogue. This makes a huge difference.

Even if you can’t remember the acronyms or steps you can help maintain dialogue by noticing whether you or others are falling into silence or violence. Even if you don’t know exactly how to fix the problem when you see it, it’s worth trying something to restore the dialogue.

You can use the statement, “I think we’ve moved away from dialogue,” to get back on track.

**2\. Ensure safety:** When you notice that you and others have moved away from dialogue, do something to make it safer — for instance, asking a question and showing interest in others’ views.

Just do something to make others comfortable: smile, apologize if you’ve moved to silence or violence, or request a brief timeout. Although the book suggests specific skills (such as contrasting, mirroring, priming), there are many other things you can do to increase safety.

### Prepare for a Crucial Conversation

The next step is applying the book’s seven dialogue principles. To help you coach yourself or someone else through a crucial conversation, here’s a quick reference guide.

**Quick Reference: The Seven Dialogue Principles**

**1\. Know your heart**

_Skills_ : Focus on what you want; refuse the fool’s choice

_Crucial questions_ : What do I really want? How should I be behaving to achieve what I want? What do I _not_ want?

**2\. Make the conditions safe**

_Skills_ : Be alert to the point when the conversation turns crucial. Look for safety threats. Beware of reverting to your style under stress.

_Crucial questions_ : Am I, or others, moving to silence or violence?

**3\. Make the content safe**

_Skills_ : Apologize if needed, use contrasting to ensure understanding, and use CRIB (Commit, Recognize, Invent, Brainstorm) to create a mutual purpose

_Crucial questions_ : Why is safety at risk? Do we have a mutual purpose and mutual respect? What can I do to rebuild an environment of safety?

**4\. Control your emotions**

_Skills_ : Retrace your path, separate fact from story, watch for clever stories, tell the full story.

_Crucial questions:_ What’s my story? Am I ignoring my role in the problem? Why would a reasonable person do what the other person did? How can I move toward what I want?

**5\. Share your stories**

_Skills_ : Share your facts, Tell your story, Ask for others’ paths, Talk tentatively, Encourage testing

_Crucial questions_ : Am I actually open to others’ viewpoints? Am I expressing my own viewpoints?

**6\. Explore others’ paths**

_Skills_ : Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, Prime (AMPP); Agree, Build, Compare (ABC)

_Crucial questions_ : Am I exploring others’ views? Am I using ABC skills to advance the conversation?

**7\. Move from conversation to results**

_Skills_ : Decide how you’ll decide. Document tasks and follow up.

_Crucial questions_ : How will we make decisions? What deadlines do we agree to? How do we stay updated on progress?

> **Example: Dividing the Family Estate**
> 
> Here’s an extended example to show the principles in action. It’s a discussion between you and your sister on dividing your mother’s estate, starting with the summer house. You want to be compensated for your expenses and hands-on care as your mother’s primary caregiver, while you feel your sister hasn’t contributed as much as you.
> 
> You discuss selling the summer house to pay for your expenses in taking care of the mother. Your sister snaps back: “Don’t guilt-trip me. I was working just as hard at my job and I sent money back to take care of Mom. If I weren’t traveling so much, I would have been happy to take care of her.”
> 
> It’s clear the conversation is getting heated. Take a step back.
> 
> **Know your heart:** Ask yourself what you really want (to be compensated fairly for money and time you contributed beyond what your sister contributed). Then ask yourself how you should best behave to achieve this goal.
> 
> **Make the conditions safe:** You see that you lack mutual purpose. You’re both defending your actions rather than discussing how to split the inheritance.
> 
> **Make the content safe:** Use contrasting to help your sister understand your purpose.
> 
>   * You: “I don’t want to drive a wedge between us, and I don’t want to make you feel guilty. But I do want to talk about how I feel I took on the bulk of the responsibility over the last few years. It took a big strain on me.”
> 
>   * Sister: “I did just as much as you did. Don’t you think I suffered?”
> 
> 

> 
> **Control your emotions:** You feel strongly that you deserve more. Retrace your path to understand the facts driving your feelings.
> 
> **Share your stories:** Share your facts and conclusions in a way that will make your sister feel safe in sharing her story.
> 
> You: “I spent lot of my money taking care of Mom, and I gave up a lot of time and career options to take care of her personally, instead of hiring a nurse. I feel I did more caregiving than you did, and I feel it’s fair to use what she left us to repay part of what I gave up.”
> 
> **Explore others’ paths** : Use inquiry skills (Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, Prime) to explore your sister’s views. Then use ABC skills (Agree, Build, Compare) to explain how your view differs.
> 
> You: “Do you see it differently? I’d really like to hear.”
> 
> Sister: “I know I was traveling a lot and wasn’t around to take care of Mom in person as much as you. But I sent money back, and I visited whenever I could. I offered to pay for a nurse. I thought I was doing equal amounts of work as you, and so your complaint is coming out of nowhere.”
> 
> You (mirror, paraphrase): ”So you feel you were doing everything you could, and you’re now surprised that I felt it was unequal?”
> 
> Sister: “Yes.”
> 
> You (agree, build, compare): “I agree. You did help out a lot. Giving up money wasn’t easy for you, and your travel to see us was expensive. In terms of the nurse, Mom preferred someone she knew to take care of her, so I stepped in. On top of this, one thing you might not know about is her expenses near the end got pretty high. The new medication was more expensive, and insurance covered just a part of her costs. It added up, and I never talked to you about it.”
> 
> **Move from conversation to results** : Come to a consensus on what will happen, who will do what by when, and how you will follow up.
> 
> Sister: “So it’s these expenses you want to cover? How about we look them over and decide how to pay for them?”
> 
> You: “Sure - I’ve kept a record of all of these and of your contributions. How about we tally them up, and if there’s an inequality at the end, we use the inheritance to pay for the inequality first, then split the rest?”

### Conclusion — Achieving Results

How you are currently handling crucial moments when your actions can disproportionately affect your relationship or organization is determining the quality of your life and your effectiveness as a leader.

Next, take action. **Identify a crucial conversation that you could improve right now** , identify the principle and skill that will help, and try it. You needn’t be perfect, but if you persist, you will see dramatic improvement in your relationships and results.

At crucial moments, a little change can make a big difference.
