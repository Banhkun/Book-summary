## Exercise: Decision-Making

Four common ways of making decisions are: command, consult, vote, and consensus. Which method to use depends on the circumstances. You choose based on four questions: Who has a stake, who has the knowledge, who needs to be on board, and how many people need to be involved.

* * *

Think of an important decision you recently took part in or were affected by. How was the decision made?

What other decision making method could have been used? How might it have affected the decision?
