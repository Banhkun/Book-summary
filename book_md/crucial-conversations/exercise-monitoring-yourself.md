## Exercise: Monitoring Yourself

You can get so involved in the content of an intense conversation that you lose track of what youâ€™re doing and how others are reacting (your brain disengages and your emotions predominate). For conversations to be successful you need to pay attention to both the content and the conditions, so you can adjust if a dialogue goes off track.

* * *

Think about some of your toughest conversations. What were the cues (physical, emotional, behavioral) that your brain was beginning to disengage, and your emotions were driving you away from dialogue?

How can you respond to those cues in the future to stay in constructive conversation?

What is your style under stress? When conversations become heated, do you typically respond with silence (withdrawing) or violence (becoming verbally aggressive)? Give an example of a recent crucial conversation where you behaved that way.

Taking cues from the chapter, what could you do differently under stress?
