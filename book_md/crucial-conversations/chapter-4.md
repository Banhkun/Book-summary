## Chapter 4: Make the Conditions Safe

The first prerequisite for healthy dialogue is safety. You can’t have constructive dialogue when people don’t feel safe, because they start acting in unproductive ways and stop contributing their information to the shared pool.

To maintain safety in a conversation, you must consider two elements: what is being discussed and what’s happening in response — both the _content_ and the _conditions_ of the conversation.

Most people focus on the content, but the conditions are equally important.

  * **If conditions are safe, you can say almost anything and people will listen**. 
  * If you’re not afraid you’re being attacked, you can hear almost anything and not become defensive. **People rarely become defensive because of what you’re saying (content), only when they don’t feel safe.**
  * **You’re receptive to potentially threatening feedback** when you believe the other person has your best interests in mind and you respect their opinion. You trust their motives and don’t feel a need to defend yourself. Conversely, if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take _any_ feedback. You suspect even well-intentioned comments (“What do you mean by saying I look good?”).



Nonetheless, it’s easy to get caught up in the content and care so much about the subject that you don’t notice what’s happening to the dialogue**,** which can quickly become unproductive. For instance, you or someone else may be speaking too forcefully; others may feel threatened and shut down, or become increasingly forceful themselves.

**You need to monitor both content (the topic) and conditions (what people are doing in response) simultaneously**. Look at what and why: People are getting upset. Why is this happening?

The rest of this chapter focuses on how to monitor and maintain safe conditions for conversation, while Chapter 5 focuses on making the content safe (discussing difficult topics safely).

The steps for keeping conditions safe are:

  1. Spot the turning point: Notice when the conversation becomes crucial.
  2. Watch for signs of a safety problem.
  3. See if others are moving toward silence or violence.
  4. Beware of reverting to your style under stress.



### 1\. Spot the Turning Point

Stay alert for the moment a conversation turns from harmless to crucial so you can avoid getting sidetracked by emotions and can intervene if others go off track. Reprogram your mind to pay attention to signs — physical, emotional, and behavioral — that suggest you’re in a crucial conversation.

  * Physical: Your body sends signals — for instance, your face may flush or your shoulders may tense up. These are your cues to step back and remember your original purpose.
  * Emotional: You or others start to feel afraid, angry, or hurt. You begin to react to or suppress these feelings. These are cues to slow down.
  * Behavioral: People raise their voices or become quiet.



### 2\. Watch for Signs of a Safety Problem

Once you see that a conversation is starting to turn crucial, pay attention to safety: **Watch for signs people are becoming fearful.** When this happens they take a fight or flight response:

  1. Force their views on others (fight), for instance by talking over other people. They do this when they fear that people aren’t buying into what they’re saying.
  2. Withhold their opinions for fear of being attacked (flight).



When people begin to feel unsafe, they may push, insult, be sarcastic, or make fun of you. While you should be thinking about how to make them feel safer, it’s difficult when you feel under attack — you may get emotional and respond in kind (or withdraw). At this point, you’re not dual-processing but becoming part of the problem as you get pulled into the fight.

**When your emotions start ratcheting up, your key brain functions start shutting down**. Your peripheral vision actually narrows — when you feel genuinely threatened you can’t see much beyond what’s right in front of you.

By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking at conditions objectively, you reengage your brain and your vision returns. **When you give your brain a new problem, it functions better**.

Reinterpret others’ aggression as a sign they don’t feel safe — be curious, rather than angry or fearful — and take steps to change the conditions of the conversation.

### 3\. Look for Silence and Violence

When people resort to silence or violence — either withholding meaning or trying to force it on the shared pool — there are some common behaviors and tactics to look for.

**Silence**

Silence is any act to purposely withhold information from the pool of meaning. People usually go silent to avoid problems.

Behaviors include playing verbal games or avoiding a person entirely. But the most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.

  * **Masking** : Understating or selectively showing your true opinions using sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching. For example: “Oh, _sure_. _That’ll_ work like a charm.” 
  * **Avoiding** : Steering completely away from sensitive subjects; you talk without addressing the real issues. For example, when someone asks how you like their outfit, you respond: “Well, you know red’s my favorite color.”
  * **Withdrawing:** Pulling out of a conversation; withdrawing or even leaving the room. For example, “I just can’t talk about this right now.”



**Violence**

Violence is a verbal strategy to convince or compel others to accept your point of view. Trying to force meaning into the pool violates safety. Behaviors include name-calling, filibustering, and making threats, but the most common are controlling, labeling, and attacking.

  * **Controlling** : Coercing others to your way of thinking by either forcing your views on others, or dominating the conversation. Methods include cutting others off, overstating your facts (hyperbole), speaking in absolutes, changing subjects, or using directive questions to control the conversation. For example: “Everyone knows they have the worst customer service in the universe.”
  * **Labeling** : Attaching a label in order to stereotype or dismiss someone or their idea. For example, “You sound like a Neanderthal.”
  * **Attacking** : You move from winning the argument to making the other person suffer. Tactics include belittling and threatening. For example: “You’re a real jerk! I’m sorry but someone has to tell the truth here.”



### 4\. Understand Your Style Under Stress

The most difficult thing to watch for as you’re dual-processing is your own behavior. Paying attention to your behavior takes a back seat — it’s hard to pull away from the lure of an argument, plus you have to be alert to others’ tactics.

However, you need to become a vigilant self-monitor — **pay close attention to what you’re doing and the impact it’s having** , then alter your strategy if necessary. Watch specifically to see whether you’re having a good or bad impact on safety. (Many people toggle between holding back and being too forceful).

To increase your self-awareness, think about what you do when conversations become difficult. When you understand your style under stress, you can find ways to improve your effectiveness in crucial conversations.

**Your Stress Test**

Here’s a quiz to see how you respond under pressure (using defensive tactics or dialogue skills). To answer the questions, pick a relationship (at work or home), and consider each statement in that context. Then consider which of the following behaviors/tactics you’re most inclined to use:

**Withdrawing**

  1. When others become aggressive in conversations, I clam up.
  2. I hold back rather than speaking candidly or giving my full opinion.



**Masking**(understating or selectively showing your true opinions using sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching)

  1. Rather than say what I think when I’m frustrated, I may use jokes or sarcastic remarks.
  2. When I have something critical to say, I try extra hard to soften the blow



**Avoiding** (steering away from sensitive topics)

  1. I try to change the subject when people bring up something awkward.
  2. I try to stay away from people I’m having trouble with.



**Controlling** : (hyperbole, absolutes, changing subjects, directive questions)

  1. When discussing a topic that’s very important to me, I sharply counter every opposing view.
  2. I might cut people off or change the subject to return to what I want to talk about.



**Labeling** (attaching a label in order to stereotype or dismiss someone or their idea)

  1. When others make points that I think are stupid, I say so.
  2. Sometimes I can’t help myself when I’m stunned by a comment, and I say things like, “Give me a break!” or “Are you serious?”



**Attacking** (making the other person suffer)

  1. In a heated discussion, I can be tough on the other person; they may end up feeling I insulted them.
  2. When the discussion gets heated, I have started saying things to hurt them personally, rather than discussing their points.



**Ensuring safety**

  1. When things get tense, I try to find out why people are upset.
  2. When others misunderstand me and get defensive, I quickly clarify what I mean by using contrasting (what I don’t and do mean).



**Exploring others’ paths**

  1. When others hesitate to share their views, I listen more intently.
  2. After I share strong opinions, I urge others to share opposing views.



**Controlling your emotions**

  1. When others misunderstand me and get defensive, I clarify what I mean by using contrasting (what I don’t and do mean).
  2. When I get upset about something and start blaming others, I stop and ask myself how I contributed to the situation.
