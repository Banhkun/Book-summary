## Chapter 10: Tough Cases

People often think their situations are unique and that dialogue skills outlined in this book don’t apply, or won’t work. According to the authors, the skills do in fact apply to virtually any issue, although some problems are more challenging than others.

This chapter looks at some tough (but not uncommon) challenges and how to handle them.

### Harassment

You’re uncomfortable with the way you’re being treated, although you don’t view it as blatant harassment.

#### Challenge

You find the behavior offensive, but it’s so subtle or sporadic that you’re hesitant to go to your boss or HR for fear of looking like you’re overreacting. Getting caught up in a villain story could drive you to respond in ways that end up hurting you.

**Solution**

Tell the full story. Admit it if you’ve put up with the behavior for a while without saying anything. Then discuss it with the other person. Try to treat the person as reasonable — even if the behavior isn’t.

After establishing a mutual purpose for the conversation, STATE your path. If you can be respectful but firm, the individual usually will stop the objectionable behavior. If the behavior ever crosses the line, contact HR to ensure your rights are protected.

### Overly Sensitive Spouse

What can you do when your spouse is highly sensitive to criticism? When you try to give constructive feedback they overreact.

#### Challenge

When one or both partners in a marriage have short fuses, they may tacitly agree to not say anything about most problems to prevent blow ups. Issues have to be huge before they’re discussed.

#### Solution

To start with, STATE your path: Share your facts,Tell your story, Ask for others’ paths, Talk tentatively, Encourage testing.

Also:

  * When something bothers you, address it right away. 
  * Use contrasting statements (what you don’t/do want).
  * Ensure the conversation is safe for both parties.
  * If the other person still becomes defensive, don’t give up — rethink your approach, increase safety, and try again.



Having a confidante and coach to give you helpful feedback is an important benefit of a healthy relationship.

### Letting the Team Down

At work, you get together as a team and talk about how to improve, but some of your teammates don’t do what they agreed to do.

#### Challenge

In an effective team every team member is accountable. Team members speak up when they see violations. Lesser teams ignore problems or let the boss deal with them.

#### Solution

It’s your responsibility to speak up. When team members agree to a course of action, they must be willing to confront any team member who doesn’t live up to the agreement — or the whole thing can fall apart.

The team’s success depends not on flawless performance, but on teammates who hold crucial conversations with each other when necessary.

### Deference to Authority

People who work for you seldom take initiative on anything. They hold back their opinions and say what they think you want to hear.

**Challenge**

When leaders experience deference or kissing up, which stems from fear, they make one of two mistakes:

  * They deny they are causing people to be afraid of them. That’s because they’re unaware of how they act under stress. The way they speak and carry themselves is creating fear/deference. 
  * They try to solve the problem by just telling employees to stop deferring. People agree to stop deferring, but they don’t. Extreme deference may stem from treatment by past bosses. You need to determine if you’re living with a ghost, or if you’re the cause of the fear.



**Solution**

Determine how you contribute to the problem. Ask a peer for honest feedback about your behavior. Develop and implement a plan, and seek ongoing feedback.

If the problem originated under previous leaders, bring it up at a team meeting and ask for advice. In your interactions with employees, reward risk takers, encourage opposing views, thank people when they’re honest, and play devil’s advocate.

### Failed Trust

Your colleague missed an important deadline, Now you wonder whether you should trust him again.

#### Challenge

Trust isn’t an either/or proposition where you either trust someone or you don’t. It can evolve and it’s specific to the situation. You may trust someone in some circumstances but not others. You may trust someone’s motivation in a situation but not her ability.

#### Solution

Focus on the issue, not the person. Take small steps to rebuild trust — first, just try to trust them in the moment. You don’t have to trust them in every circumstance. Discuss your concerns using STATE skills: Talk tentatively about what you see happening.

### Spouse Doesn’t Want to Talk

Whenever you try to talk about an important problem, your spouse withdraws.

#### Challenge

If someone doesn’t want to talk about tough issues, It’s because they believe it won’t do any good or they don’t feel safe doing so.

#### Solution

Work on yourself first (practice your skills).

Start with the least threatening issues. Try to make conversation safe. Be alert to when your spouse becomes uncomfortable. Speak tentatively (“I’m pretty sure you’re not intending to…”). Explore your partner’s path. Practice dialogue skills whenever you can.

Establish mutual purpose — help the person see a compelling reason for having the conversation.

### Shows No Initiative

Your team members do what they’re asked, but no more. If they encounter problems they give up.

#### Challenge

It’s a straightforward process to point out and address obviously bad behavior or performance, and to reward good performance. Dealing with people who lack initiative or persistence falls into a gray area and is more challenging to address.

#### Solution

Deal with the overall pattern, rather than a specific instance.

If you want someone to take greater initiative, tell them. Give examples of when they faced a problem and gave up. Brainstorm ways the person could have been more persistent in coming up with a solution.**** Tell them you’re raising the bar.

Also, be aware of the ways you’re enabling someone’s lack of initiative. Clarify your expectations and put the responsibility on them.

### Persistent Problem

You keep having to talk with people repeatedly about the same problem. You feel like you have to choose between nagging and putting up with the problem.

#### Challenge

Some crucial conversations are ineffective because you’re focusing on the wrong thing.

For example, consider how you deal with someone who is habitually late. If you focus on the specific problem (being late) without talking about the bigger problem or pattern, you’ll have the same conversation repeatedly as the person continues to be late.

#### Solution

Focus on the pattern rather than on a single event — monitor behavior over time.

Use STATE skills to talk about the pattern (facts/observations, story, feeling, action).

For example, if a person is late for a meeting and pledges to be on time in the future, then is late again, discuss their failure to keep a commitment rather than their lateness. This issue is now about trust and respect.

### Insubordination

How should you respond when people get angry, and then insubordinate?

#### Challenge

Insubordination is rare, so when it happens it catches many leaders off guard. They buy time to figure out what to do. But this lets the person get away with egregious behavior, and it encourages future abuses.

(In dealing with rebellious kids, parents tend to respond in kind rather than buying time — they become angry and insulting.)

#### Solution

You cannot tolerate insubordination — speak up immediately. You need to stop disrespect before it gets worse. Change topics from the issue under discussion to how the person is currently acting. Let her know she is heading in a dangerous direction.

For instance, respond: “Let’s set aside this scheduling issue for a moment. The way you’re raising your voice and the words you’re using are disrespectful. I want to address your concerns, but I can’t do so if this continues.” If this doesn’t alleviate the problem, seek help from HR.

### Sensitive Personal Issue

What can you do if someone has a hygiene problem, or something else that makes people avoid him but are embarrassed to bring up?

#### Challenge

Because people avoid discussing sensitive issues, offenders can go for years without getting information that would be helpful to them.

Instead of directly addressing the offense, others often progress from silence to violence, making jokes, and being sarcastic and disrespectful. But the more time that elapses, the more painful it will be to the person when you do raise the issue.

#### Solution

Start by using contrasting: You don’t want to hurt the person’s feelings, but you do want to share important information.

Establish mutual purpose. Explain that you’re reluctant to raise a personal issue, but need to because it’s undermining the person’s work. Tentatively describe the problem without exaggerating, then move on to solutions.

### Verbal Games

Some people, especially children, play word games to excuse their actions or inaction when you confront them. For instance, when you tell kids they shouldn’t have done something, they respond that you never explicitly told them not to do it. How can you stop getting caught up in these games?

**Challenge**

Some creative individuals can come up with endless ways to explain why they didn’t know any better. Eventually they wear you down, and get away with slacking while others carry an unfair share of the load.

**Solution**

Focus on the pattern rather than the specific instance. Use STATE skills to discuss the pattern of playing word games and let them know they aren’t fooling anyone. Preempt word games by telling them how you expect them to behave in all instances in the future.

For example, you might respond: “You’re hurting your sister’s feelings when you call her ugly. Don’t say that or anything else that might hurt her feelings.” Then hold them accountable.

### No Warning

Sometimes when employees run into problems with an assignment or project, leaders don’t find out until it’s too late.

#### Challenge

Leaders who are regularly being surprised are allowing it to happen. Typically, the first time an employee says, “Sorry but I ran into a problem,” leaders focus on the problem and fix it, thereby conveying that it’s OK to surprise them; they’ll take care of things.

#### Solution

Establish a clear “no surprises” rule. When you give someone an assignment, make clear that they need to either complete it as planned, or inform you immediately if they run into a problem.

The first time someone has a problem but didn’t inform you when the problem first came up, address it immediately: “We agreed you’d let me know immediately if you had a problem. You didn’t contact me — what happened?”
