## Exercise: Direct Emotional Energy to Your Ideal Version of Reality

Zeland argues that you can control _which_ version of reality gets reflected back to you by matching your emotional energy with what you want to experience. This exercise will walk you through his three methods for achieving this.

* * *

Write down at least one joyful or inspiring thing that you’d like to experience in your ideal version of reality. (For example, you want to be a best-selling author.)

Imagine how you would think, feel, and behave if you were already experiencing your ideal version of reality. Write down any details that come to mind. (For example, you’d think of yourself as successful, feel creative, and create an office environment that’s conducive to writing.)

Write down at least one way that you can practice thinking, feeling, and behaving as if you were already living in your ideal version of reality. (For example, you might set aside time to write for at least an hour each day.)

Zeland claims that you can continually transmit positive emotional energy by focusing only on what you want to experience and appreciating all of the good things in your life. Write down at least three things in your life that make you feel positive when you think about them.
