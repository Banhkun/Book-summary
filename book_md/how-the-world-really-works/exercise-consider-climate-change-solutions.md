## Exercise: Consider Climate Change Solutions

While Smil focuses more on the challenges of ending our dependence on fossil fuels than on potential solutions to climate change, he also discusses a range of methods for cutting down on carbon emissionsâ€”from projects that must be undertaken at a corporate and governmental level, such as transitioning to renewable or nuclear energy, to actions that individuals can implement themselves, such as insulating their homes or eating less meat. Consider your use of fossil fuels and the potential solutions to climate change.

* * *

Which mass use of fossil fuels surprised you the most (energy use, food production, or materials)? Describe how that sector affects your life personally.

Do you believe your country or community can realistically reduce the use of fossil fuels in that sector? If so, how? If not, why?

Are there any individual actions that you would be willing to implement in your own life to combat climate change (for example, driving an electric car, voting or getting involved in local politics, eating less meat, supporting environmental organizations)? Why or why not?
