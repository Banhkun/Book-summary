## 1-Page Summary

To have lasting influence, aim to create works that will stand the test of time, lasting for decades instead of months.

The most important requirement is to **create a product that is so good it spreads by word of mouth**.

  * Word of mouth is the only marketing channel that really endures in the long term, long after the PR and ads have stopped.
  * People share when they believe it helps others or themselves. 



Works that speak to universal, timeless truths last longer. They don’t chase trends.

  * **Chasing trends is dangerous because** 1) the competition is high (because the strategy of copying competitors is easy); 2) it’s not clear the trend will last.
  * Jeff Bezos: “Focus on the things that don’t change.”
  * Books that solve timeless problems last for a long time (like social relations and _How to Win Friends and Influence People_)
  * Works that cover timeless archetypes, like the hero’s journey (Star Wars, Harry Potter), or speak to timeless human emotions and experiences (The Alchemist)



### Creating for Longevity

First, examine your motivation for creating. It should be **because you have something you desperately need to say or are burning to solve a problem**. You _can’t not_ do this.

  * If you’re doing this only out of curiosity or to become rich/famous, **you won’t have the willpower to drive through the darkest valleys** of the creation process. And you’re competing against people who are pouring their soul into their works.
  * **Once you define your mission, you must forsake all other missions.** Creation is so difficult that you need to avoid watering down your efforts with other projects.



Next, you actually need to do it.

  * **Don’t dream about it or talk about it.** Ideas are cheap. There are oceans of people who “ _know_ they could be big hits, who have _brilliant_ ideas, _if only_ [their excuse].” These are people who want to _have_ a success; they don’t want to _create_ a success.
  * Don’t think about being “the idea person” and leaving the cruft work to others. No one cares more about the creation than you. No one else knows the product and the target audience as much as you. **You need to handle the responsibility of creating, editing, positioning, marketing, and selling your creation**.



Creation takes place over long periods of time and require dozens of iterations to polish. Don’t fall for the myth that great works are done spontaneously in one sitting.

  * Get an editor who can give objective critiques. It’s very rare for someone to create a brilliant work in her own mind.



When creating and marketing, **define your audience and purpose carefully. “This is a****that does**** for ____ (target user).**”

  * Be OK with polarizing the population. You want a fraction of the audience to love your work (and a fraction to hate it), not the whole audience to be blase.
  * Think about one specific person you’re creating this for. This will help you target your work.



(Shortform note: _Perennial Seller_ is light on how to actually do the core thing of creating a good product. This is likely too domain-specific and taste-based to really codify into rules.)

### Marketing

Marketing is then about finding your target users and ways to reach them.

  * The purpose of creating buzz at launch is to increase the pool of people who will refer your product to their friends. The product does the heavy lifting of marketing afterward. A product with a big launch but doesn’t sustain word-of-mouth referrals after is not going to endure.



**Every new user has an activation barrier to trying your product** \- money, time, energy, mental, opportunity, social cost. **Your goal is to lower this barrier as much as possible** , so they try your product and have a chance to see the value.

  * Consider lowering the price of your product or making it free somehow.
  * Convey the benefits and social signaling to reduce the barrier further.



**Assume: “Nobody cares about what I’ve made.** They don’t know what it is. They can easily do without my work.” Humility works harder than ego.

When trying to reach users/influencers/journalists, always think, “what’s in it for them?”

  * Journalists are dying for a scoop on a unique story.
  * Influencers want to be seen as tastemakers and will promote products that their audience will love.



### Keep Creating

Once you create one great work, what do you do? **Create another**.

  * Each additional great work lifts all the other work you’ve created. People who liked your first work have more to enjoy; people who discover you anew can enjoy your back catalog.
  * Would the Hobbit films be as famous without Lord of the Rings? Would we care about Shakespeare’s sonnets were it not for his plays?



The ideal situation to have is a **loyal following of people who love your work and will buy every single thing you produce**.

  * A platform is the combination of tools, relationships, access, and audience to spread your creative work repeatedly over the course of a career. 
  * Ideally, you have a direct relationship with your followers, **through a medium you control**. Ryan Holiday recommends an email list above all, because of its longevity.
