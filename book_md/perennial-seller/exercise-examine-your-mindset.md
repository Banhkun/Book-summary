## Exercise: Examine Your Mindset

Think about why you create.

* * *

What is your reason for creating? What do you want to achieve at the end of it? What would you do if you weren’t creating?

Think about one specific person you’re trying to please. Who is it?

What sets your work apart that makes it new and important? What will make users who use competing products to switch over to yours?
