## 1-Page Summary

In _The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness_ , Stephen R. Covey adds a habit to the original seven described in his best seller, _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_. Covey’s 8th habit is to determine your unique contribution and help others do the same. This is the habit of leadership. According to Covey, great leaders work on themselves first, making sure they’re balanced, well-rounded human beings before they try to influence others.

Covey, who died in 2012, was a business and leadership consultant and an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Most of Covey’s work reconfigures religious advice on meaningful, productive living for a secular audience. His most famous book, _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ (1989), focused on the importance of character development in professional productivity, successfully merging the business and self-help genres. In _First Things First _(1994), he extended _7 Habits_ by providing more concrete advice on time management.

_The 8th Habit_ , published in 2004, marked a shift in Covey’s focus from the individual level to the bigger picture of organizations and leadership. Covey argues that to meet the needs of modern staff in contemporary workplaces, leaders need to revolutionize the way they lead. Instead of focusing primarily on processes and products, **the best leaders of the future will focus on individual people, and on helping them fulfill their potential** by identifying their “voice”—their unique contributions—and sharing them with the world.

Covey’s concept of **“voice”** **encompasses all parts of the human being (body, mind, heart, and spirit)**. He examines how to identify this unique contribution at several levels: as individuals (Part 1 of this guide); organizations (Part 2); and leaders, who serve as the bridge between individuals and organizations (Part 3).

#### The Stages of Human Social Development

To add historical context to his discussion of leadership and organizations, Covey steps back and examines the progress of human civilization to date. He states that**we’ve advanced through four broad stages** :

  1. The Hunter/Gatherer Age
  2. The Agricultural Age
  3. The Industrial Age
  4. The Information Age



Moving between these stages has involved massive upheavals in how we understand the concept of work.

> **Ecological-Evolutionary Theory and Human Social Development**
> 
> The classification system that Covey uses is based on the work of sociologist Gerhard Lenski, who began publishing on “ecological-evolutionary theory” in the 1960s. Lenski categorized human societies according to two factors: their environment, and their technological capabilities. His classification system listed seven types of societies: hunters and gatherers, horticulturalists, fishing societies, herding societies, maritime societies, agricultural societies, and industrial societies. While Lenski’s ideas are often used to argue that more complex societies are morally superior, this wasn’t his intention—rather, he argued that societies that develop new technologies quickly tend to outcompete societies that are slower to do this.

Covey refers to **the transition points between these four stages as** **paradigm shifts**. We use paradigms—sets of beliefs and attitudes that shape how we look at the world—to explain complex problems to ourselves and each other. For example, a key paradigm shift in astronomy was the Copernican Revolution—when scientists moved from a geocentric understanding of the solar system (Earth as the center of the universe) to a heliocentric one (the sun as the center).

(Shortform note: Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn discussed paradigm shifts in his book _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ , popularizing the term. Kuhn pointed out that while paradigms help scientists solve certain kinds of problems, they also trap scientific thinking inside a particular framework, meaning that solutions to other problems remain out of reach. This also applies to Covey’s discussion of workplace and management paradigms.)

Each of the paradigm shifts between these four stages forced workers to discard outmoded beliefs and practices to make way for the new ideas of the incoming stage. **People had to learn to deploy completely new skill sets, and those who didn’t were left behind.** For example, at the beginning of the Information Age, many people who had previously spent their work day doing manual tasks found that they were now sitting in front of a computer and answering emails or manipulating spreadsheets.

(Shortform note: The shift between the Industrial and Information Ages was partly due to the increasing automation of manual tasks. While this shift led to large-scale job losses in manual labor, it also paved the way for the rise of the service economy and the increasing integration of products with services.)

Covey points out that**many current management practices are hand-me-downs from the Industrial Age** , when the goal was to be productive.**** Too many companies treat people as objects, slot them into rigid hierarchies, and squelch their natural leadership capabilities.

**In** the great cultural and material shift of **the Information Age** , **we’re aiming for more than productivity alone: We’re pursuing greatness and personal meaning.** We’re trying to create the conditions that will unlock our individual and collective brilliance.

(Shortform note: Author and business professor Gary Hamel says that while Industrial Age leaders were focused on the challenges of efficiency and scale, Information Age leaders need to prioritize innovation, adaptability, and resilience.)

According to Covey, we’re about to enter a fifth age: the Age of Wisdom, in which we’ll be primarily guided by our moral principles and our wish to serve others. Exercising the 8th habit is the key to entering the Age of Wisdom—as individuals, organizations, and leaders.

(Shortform note: Covey’s optimism about what will follow the Information Age isn’t shared by all commentators. Other authors have suggested that it’ll be the age of dealing with information overload, the Experience Age, or even the Age of Reckoning, in which we’ll finally have to solve all of the problems created by our behavior in the previous stages.)

#### Management vs. Leadership

Covey asserts that a change in leadership is the key to organizational success amid these paradigm shifts. He notes that **management and leadership are distinct skills**. Management, an Industrial Age skill, deals with objects; leadership, an Information Age skill, inspires people. Both management and leadership are crucial if an organization is to function well. But Covey sees most organizations today as suffering from a lack of leadership and an excess of management.

**An important function of modern leadership is building and supporting strong teams** : teams that are made up of people with complementary strengths. In strong teams, members willingly contribute from their strengths and actively compensate for the weaknesses of other team members. This is why Covey insists that great leaders must help others identify and use their unique contributions, as we’ll discuss in Part 3: The Leader.

> **Management vs. Leadership: Alternative Views**
> 
> Covey sees the difference between management and leadership as focusing on things vs. people. Other authors also distinguish between management and leadership but use different criteria: For example, John Maxwell argues in _5 Levels of Leadership _that management is maintaining the status quo, while leadership is creating change. CEO and author Vineet Nayar proposes three differences between leaders and managers: counting value vs. creating value (a manager supervises; a leader delegates), circles of power vs. circles of influence (a manager gives orders to direct reports; a leader gives advice to people who come to seek it), and managing work vs. leading people (echoing Covey’s key distinction).
> 
> In _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , venture capital firm co-founder Ben Horowitz formulates a similar divide, but he frames it as distinguishing two different types of managers: “Ones,” who are big-picture, strategic thinkers (Covey’s leaders), and “Twos,” who are more focused on processes and goals (Covey’s managers). Horowitz suggests that all leaders are some combination of One and Two. In his opinion, the best CEOs are primarily Ones but have a healthy dose of “Two thinking” that keeps the organization from becoming chaotic.

#### What Does Covey Mean by “Voice”?

**Your voice** , according to Covey, **is** **your unique personal contribution.** It’s the point where your gifts, your passion, and your moral compass overlap. Identifying and sharing this contribution is your chance to move from treading water to swimming strongly in your personal and professional life. Moving forward, we’ll refer to Covey’s idea of “voice” as “contribution.”

(Shortform note: Covey’s concept of “voice” echoes the Japanese concept of _ikigai_. Your _ikigai_ , or life purpose, sits at the intersection of your talents, your passions, what the world needs, and what you can be paid to do.)

Covey comments that children contribute freely and confidently—they do what they love, they work together and share with others, and they speak up when they don’t like something. As we grow, however, **oppressive or overly competitive systems** at school (and later at work) **squelch our individuality and stifle our expression**.

(Shortform note: UK Educator Sir Ken Robinson dedicated much of his career to pointing out how standardized education systems kill children’s creativity. In his 2006 TED Talk on this topic, he argues that giving children diverse educational experiences helps them become more creative and well-rounded adults.)

### Part 1: The Individual

Covey first explores how to apply the 8th habit on an individual level. He suggests that we replace old work paradigms with a **“whole-person paradigm.”** Under this paradigm, people aren’t only bodies (as in the Industrial Age) or only minds (as in the Information Age). Instead, they’re **complete individuals with physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs.** (Shortform note: Covey first introduced this way of thinking about human needs in _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , which was published 15 years before _The 8th Habit._)

Covey sees individuals as made up of four parts. Healthy people consciously develop the capacities of all four parts, and their contribution springs from the unique way in which they combine and express them. Each of the parts corresponds with a basic human need, as well as with a specific type of intelligence:

  * The **body** is associated with our **need for survival**. Covey calls body-based intelligence “discipline”—we’ll call it **“self-control.”** Self-control is the ability to see things as they really are and to work to bring goals and ideas to fruition, rather than building castles in the air.
  * The **mind** is associated with our **need for learning**. Covey calls mental intelligence “vision”—we’ll call it **“focus.”** Focus is considering as many options as possible and synthesizing these options into a small number of high-quality solutions.
  * The **heart** is associated with our **need for connection**. Covey calls emotional intelligence “passion”—we’ll call it **“dedication.”** Dedication is what drives you to exercise self-control and maintain focus in the service of a larger goal.
  * The **spirit** is associated with our **need to give back**. Covey calls spiritual intelligence “conscience”—we’ll call it **“integrity.”** Integrity refers to your ethical principles and your ability to differentiate right from wrong in complex situations. 



Covey says that **developing self-control, focus, dedication, and integrity will transform you into an exceptional leader.** Of all of these forms of intelligence, Covey sees integrity as the key: Integrity functions as your moral compass, determining the direction in which you’ll apply all of your other abilities.

> **Comparing Covey’s Model With Other Models of Human Needs and Intelligences**
> 
> Covey’s model of the human being as consisting of mind, body, heart, and spirit (each of these with corresponding needs and intelligences) is likely drawn from his religious background. This model overlaps with well-known models of needs and intelligences in some ways and diverges from them in others:
> 
>   * Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a broad-based triangle with five levels: physiological needs, need for safety, need for love and belonging, need for esteem, and need for self-actualization. Covey’s __ proposed needs for “survival” and “connection” are good matches with Maslow’s model, but his need for learning and the need to give back are grouped together in Maslow’s “self-actualization” category.
> 
>   * Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences describes nine types of intelligence: verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial-visual, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist, and existential. Covey’s “conscience” and “passion” fit within Gardner’s conception of intrapersonal intelligence. However, for the others, Covey’s conception of human intelligence is more metaphorical than Gardner’s. Covey’s “discipline” refers to more than just the physical body, while his “vision” refers to a generalized problem-solving capability.
> 
> 


### Part 2: The Organization

Next, Covey addresses how organizations can use the 8th habit to thrive. He sees organizations as consisting of four main components that align with the individual’s body, mind, heart, and spirit.

#### The Four Components of Organizations

Covey maps his model of individual human beings onto organizations as follows:

  * The _body_ of an organization consists of its physical and economic components: its buildings and physical environments, cash inflows and outflows, raw materials, and products.
  * The _mind_ of an organization is its ability to strategize and set a path for the future.
  * The _heart_ of an organization is the people and human relationships within it.
  * The _spirit_ of an organization is its moral compass and internal accountability structures, including its mission and the way it allocates responsibilities across teams and individuals.



By looking at each of these components separately, Covey says we can diagnose and treat many of the common problems that organizations face. For example, a lack of enthusiasm and emotional investment from employees is caused by neglecting the heart of the organization and can be remedied through empowering leadership (the role of The Advocate, below). The lack of a mission statement—or, conversely, having an overly idealistic or hollow mission statement—is caused by neglecting the mind of the organization and can be remedied by assuming the leadership role of The Navigator.

> **Alternate Metaphors for How Organizations Work**
> 
> Covey’s human being metaphor for organizations isn’t an unusual approach—in fact, in many countries the law treats corporations as a kind of person.
> 
> However, a variety of metaphorical options are available. In _Images of Organization_ , economist Gareth Morgan describes eight metaphors that we commonly use to talk about organizations: machine, organism, brain, cultural system, political system, psychic prison, instrument of domination, and flux and transformation. Each metaphor has different implications for how we understand leadership, organizational change, and our work inside organizations, so it’s important that we choose our words carefully.

#### The Four (Plus One) Components of Strong Relationships

For Covey, organizations are made up of one thing: relationships. He defines organizations as **networks of relationships with a shared purpose**. **Strong, healthy relationships mean a strong, healthy organization.**

You can strengthen relationships by applying the intelligences of your body, mind, heart, and spirit:

  1. Apply the intelligence of the body through**engagement** , the desire to improve things in a meaningful way.**** Show engagement by dedicating time and effort to achieving improvements.
  2. Apply the intelligence of the mind through **independence** , which is**** exercising your freedom to choose. Build independence by taking the initiative to do something as part of a long-term plan.
  3. Apply the intelligence of the heart through **selflessness** , which is the ability to deprioritize your own opinions and needs.**** Practice selflessness by putting the needs of someone else above your own.
  4. Apply the intelligence of the spirit through **honesty** , which is a conscious commitment to truth and transparency.**** Practice honesty by frequently revisiting your principles and questioning whether you’re truly upholding them.



**Together, these components foster trust.** According to Covey, trust isn’t an individual quality—instead, he sees it as the nurturing environment needed for a relationship to flourish.

> **Additional Advice on Building Strong Relationships**
> 
> Covey’s advice for strengthening relationships is fairly abstract. In practice, how can you build strong relationships day to day? In _The Power of Moments_ , Chip and Dan Heath suggest that you strengthen your relationships by focusing on moments of connection with others. They offer the following three-step process:
> 
>   * **Create a shared moment.** Invite people with a shared goal to spend time together.
> 
>   * **Allow for voluntary struggle.** People who choose to experience hardship together form tighter bonds.
> 
>   * **Reconnect with the meaning of the work.** Show people how what they’re doing fits into the bigger picture.
> 
> 

> 
> The Heaths don’t mention trust, which is central for Covey, though he doesn’t go into great detail about what it means. In _The Culture Map_ , business professor Erin Meyer fills in some of the gaps: Meyer explains that there are two basic types of trust, and that the type you prioritize at work depends on your culture.
> 
>   * In cultures in which trust is primarily **_task-based_** , such as Denmark and the United States, **people who work competently and consistently are trustworthy**. To build task-based trust, demonstrate to others that you’re efficient and professional. Leaders in these cultures should show that they care about their staff’s professional needs.
> 
>   * In cultures in which trust is **_relationship-based_** , such as Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, **trustworthy people are those whom you’ve spent a lot of time with or know well**. To build relationship-based trust, colleagues should spend time getting to know each other, while leaders should create opportunities for staff to spend time together socially.
> 
> 


### Part 3: The Leader

Finally, Covey focuses on how the 8th habit applies to leaders, who serve as the bridge between individuals and organizations. According to Covey, **leaders in the Age of Wisdom should focus on cultivating self-control, focus, dedication, and integrity** **within their organizations.** Instead of issuing orders from above, they should**** encourage team members to develop these four intelligences within themselves, thereby nurturing the team members’ own unique contributions.

(Shortform note: This focus on self-work is typical of Covey, who espouses an approach to leadership based on character rather than personality. This approach has gained popularity since Covey’s death, with research increasingly focusing on “self-leadership” or “worthy leadership.” The Worthy Leadership model, for example, has three main facets: capacity, commitment, and character.)

To do this effectively, leaders also need to develop these qualities in themselves. Covey maps the four types of intelligence onto**four different roles that a leader should be able to step into as needed: the Auditor, the Navigator, the Advocate, and the Captain**. The relationships between the different layers of Covey’s model (parts of the human being, types of intelligence, key components of relationships, and leadership roles) are summarized below:

**Parts of the human being** | **Body** | **Mind** | **Heart** | **Spirit**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Type of intelligence** | Self-Control  | Focus  | Dedication  | Integrity   
**Key components of relationships** | Engagement  | Independence  | Selflessness  | Honesty   
**Leadership roles** | The Auditor  | The Navigator  | The Advocate  | The Captain   
  
This section discusses each of these leadership roles individually. We describe the role, give an example, and discuss one specific technique that leaders can use to improve their performance in this role.

#### Leadership Role 1: The Auditor

##### Description

The Auditor role, which Covey calls “aligning,” relates to the _body_ of the organization and involves implementing _self-control_ on an organizational scale. **Auditors** **ensure that an organization’s institutions and processes are linked to the realities of the organization and the desired results**. In the Auditor role, leaders ask: Do our current systems line up with our mission and strategic priorities? If not, what needs to be done to bring them in line?

(Shortform note: Higher education expert Laura Montgomery adds that reconciling strategy and reality involves three key capabilities: clear communication from senior executives, openness and trust between departments, and agile responses to changes in the external environment.)

##### Example

Many firms preach collaboration but have financial bonus systems that reward people who work alone. Instead, aim to build a structure that rewards interdependence. One way to do this is to allocate bonuses to the group first, based on the overall performance of the team. The bonus could then be divided among team members according to their individual contributions.

(Shortform note: Author and FutureThink founder Lisa Bodell suggests a number of other ways in which organizations can encourage collaboration. For example, DigitalOcean incentivizes collaboration by distributing gifts such as Kindles to teams that collaborate well, and PepsiCo allocates 40% of the end-of-year bonus for staff that have helped the careers of other staff members.)

##### Technique: Implement 360° Feedback Systems

Most people evaluate their performance based on the information that’s right in front of them. Instead of doing this, try to fill in your blind spots by seeking feedback from all directions (all 360° of the circle around you). On an **individual level** , this means including the evaluations of direct reports and peers as well as managers in performance evaluations. On an **organizational level** , this means evaluating a firm’s performance by combining information from internal financial indicators, consultations with external partners and clients, and comparisons with world-class performers.

> **360° Feedback: Problems and Possible Solutions**
> 
> The 360° feedback approach that Covey recommends emerged and became popular in the 1990s, with a 1994 article in _Fortune_ magazine proclaiming that it can “change your life.” However, researchers became increasingly skeptical about its effectiveness, even questioning whether it had “gone amok.” In practice, 360° feedback can also lead to feedback overload, in which people receive so much conflicting feedback that they end up disregarding all of it.
> 
> Patrick Lencioni argues in _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ that 360° feedback should only be used as a tool for personal career development, separate from the formalized performance evaluation process. Another possible solution is to keep the peer performance reviews but simplify them. At Google, for example, only a small number of peers give feedback, and their feedback is limited to the employee’s strengths, weaknesses, and specific contributions. At Netflix, peer feedback is limited to what the employee should start, stop, and continue doing.

#### Leadership Role 2: The Navigator

##### Description

The Navigator role, which Covey calls “pathfinding,”**** relates to the _mind_ of the organization and involves implementing _focus_ on an organizational scale. **In the Navigator role, leaders consult others about the future of the organization and plot a course forward**.

The skills of Navigating include listening, distilling common values and strategic policies, and using conflict as a springboard to create new, synergistic solutions. Covey sees this as the most challenging role for many leaders.

(Shortform note: Although experts agree with Covey that listening is a core leadership skill, some researchers have also pointed out that leaders may think they’re better at listening than they actually are. This notion supports Covey’s observation that many leaders find the Navigator role to be the most difficult.)

##### Example

Acting as a Navigator, leaders create two types of documents that serve complementary purposes. The **mission statement** **should answer the “why” question** : It should describe the company’s vision, values, and purpose. The **strategic plan outlines _how_ the mission will be transformed into reality**. The strategic plan should be time-bound and strongly grounded in stakeholder realities.

(Shortform note: A popular approach to linking these two documents is the strategic planning pyramid. At the top of the pyramid is the “why” of the organization: its vision, mission, and values. The middle of the pyramid is the “how”: the organization’s goals and high-level strategies. The bottom of the pyramid is the “what”: a plan of action for the immediate future.)

##### Technique: Encourage Listening by Using a “Talking Stick” Approach

To determine the best path forward, you need to know which options are available, and to determine all the available options you need to be able to listen well. To do this, Covey suggests implementing the principles of the “talking stick” in important meetings: When you’re holding the stick, you can say what you think and nobody can interrupt you.

Covey suggests that in meetings you either use a designated object for this purpose or you implement the principle with no physical object. If you’re not using an object, one strategy is to have all attendees agree from the beginning that _before_ they state their own ideas, they must summarize the argument of the person who spoke before them. This forces everyone to pay attention and to respect perspectives that conflict with theirs.

> **Encourage Listening in Meetings: Advice From _Radical Candor_**
> 
> While Covey’s talking stick approach encourages good listening, it may be time-consuming if implemented fully. In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott offers the following alternative advice to ensure that all meeting attendees have a chance to speak:
> 
>   * Go around the table to elicit opinions from everyone on important topics.
> 
>   * Politely but firmly cut off people who are monopolizing the floor.
> 
>   * Meet with attendees ahead of time to encourage the quiet team members to speak up and the louder ones to talk less.
> 
> 


#### Leadership Role 3: The Advocate

##### Description

The Advocate role, which Covey calls “empowering,”**** relates to the _heart_ of the organization and involves implementing _dedication_ on an organizational scale. **Advocates encourage independence in members of the organization** : They communicate the desired results and then trust people to develop the methods that work best to get them there. Employees who are empowered by Advocates are happier, less likely to leave the company, and more likely to use their unique gifts to come up with innovative solutions.

##### (Shortform note: Empowering leadership behavior has real effects on employees’ psychological well-being, creativity, and work performance. It can even improve workplace safety. The benefits may, however, vary from person to person: For example, employees with a strong desire for autonomy benefit more from empowering leadership, while employees who are under significant psychological strain may benefit less than their more relaxed counterparts.)

##### Example

To help people develop independence, give them the tools to self-manage and trust them to look after themselves. For example, consider giving staff more freedom to manage their own schedules, deadlines, and work processes. This can be difficult for some managers, as they think it means relinquishing control. But if you look at the whole picture, control isn’t lost—it’s simply redistributed. External control becomes self-control.

(Shortform note: In _No Rules Rules_ , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings says that empowering employees by eliminating controls helped establish a culture that allowed the company to innovate and thrive in a rapidly changing industry. One way he did this was by eliminating the vacation leave policy: Instead of allotting staff a set number of vacation days, Netflix allows unlimited vacation days while prioritizing clear communication about the needs of the team. For example, a manager might request that team members avoid taking time off close to an important deadline, or might ask employees with similar responsibilities to make sure they won’t be away at the same time.)

##### Technique: Flipped Performance Evaluations

Covey suggests that managers can advocate for employees by asking direct reports to evaluate _them_ , instead of the other way around. In addition to the flipped performance evaluation, he recommends asking questions such as:

  * Are you happy? Why/Why not?
  * What would you like to do next?
  * What do you need?



> **Shake Up the Performance Review Process**
> 
> Research shows that nearly everyone hates performance reviews—even people who are strongly motivated to improve. And they may not be useful for organizations, either: Performance reviews can be expensive, unnecessarily antagonistic processes that leave employees _and_ managers feeling bad.
> 
> Covey’s suggestion to flip performance evaluations isn’t the only option: Leaders could also consider moving toward a broader “culture of compassionate evaluation,” in which employees receive gentle feedback on an ongoing basis. Another option is to invert the typical structure of review meetings by asking employees to provide a self-assessment at the beginning of the meeting.

#### Leadership Role 4: The Captain

##### Description

The Captain role, which Covey calls “modeling,” relates to the _spirit_ of the organization and involves implementing _integrity_ on an organizational scale. **In the Captain role, leaders** **set an example that others can identify with and be inspired by**. Captains need to demonstrate versatility by showing their staff how they inhabit the other three leadership roles.

**Setting an example is at the center of all leadership.** If people identify with you, your vision, and the way you do things, they’ll become involved of their own volition.

(Shortform note: In _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ , leadership expert John Maxwell argues that modeling desirable behaviors is much more effective than talking about them. Followers find it easy to copy leaders but often struggle to keep an abstract vision for the future in mind. Maxwell adds that leading by example is especially important in times of uncertainty.)

##### Example

Covey suggests that you choose a tiny part of your job and resolve to do it in an extraordinary way. What happens if you introduce a “wow factor” into something mundane?

(Shortform note: One way to add extra spark to everyday tasks is gamification. Turning parts of your job into a game—or, if you’re the head of a team, adapting parts of others’ jobs into games—increases motivation, builds healthy ambition, and makes negative feedback feel less personal.)

##### Technique: Encourage Individual Initiative

Covey recommends that leaders govern with a light touch, encouraging their team members to practice stepping into all four leadership roles. As an example, he describes **seven possible levels of initiative** that each team member can take. The most appropriate level depends on their position, the work environment, and the task at hand.

  1. **Obey instructions.** This is the most passive level. It applies when you’re considering a certain action, but it isn’t officially your job and you don’t want to ruffle any feathers.
  2. **Show curiosity.** A well-considered question can show others that you understand the issue without putting undue pressure on them.
  3. **Make a suggestion.** To avoid wasting managers’ time, it’s important that the suggestion is as complete and well-considered as possible. Covey suggests the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work, a set of guidelines used in the military, as an example of taking initiative on this level.
  4. **Communicate an intention**. This applies when you have the resources to generate a solution but lack the power to authorize it.
  5. **Act independently and inform others straight away.** This applies when you’re authorized to take a particular action and the action directly affects others.
  6. **Act independently and inform others as needed.** This level applies when something is within your job description and is relevant to others but doesn’t directly affect them.
  7. **Get on with it.** This level applies when something is your job and doesn’t affect others in a meaningful way.



> **The Benefits of Distributed Leadership in Military Contexts**
> 
> Covey developed his hierarchy of initiative (especially level #4) from his experience on the submarine of L. David Marquet, a captain in the US Navy. Marquet trained his staff to independently analyze a situation, develop a solution, prepare to implement the solution themselves, and then approach him and state “I intend to…” Marquet would either approve the action or ask questions to trace the officer’s thought process. Marquet describes this “leader-leader model” in his book _Turn the Ship Around! _By training his overly passive staff to think for themselves, Marquet turned the worst-performing submarine in the Navy into one of the best-performing within a year.
> 
> The benefits of distributed leadership and the disadvantages of centralized command and control are also apparent in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Russia’s military failures occurred in part because of the highly centralized, hierarchical nature of the Russian military. The Russians’ centralized systems were pitted against the Ukrainian military’s “mission-style” command and control, in which individual soldiers are empowered to make decisions on the fly. As former Ukrainian Minister of Defense Andriy Zagorodnyuk remarks, when centralized control goes wrong, soldiers can’t adapt to unexpected situations, “and you get things like 40-mile-long traffic jams outside of Kyiv.”

### Conclusion: Service Leadership

Covey emphasizes that **Habit 8 is underpinned by the idea of service**. When practicing Habit 8, **you serve others through _your_ unique contribution and by helping others make _theirs_**. On an individual level, personal growth and a service orientation create a virtuous cycle: Character-oriented personal growth naturally leads to an increased focus on service, while a service mindset cultivates humility and personal growth. On an interpersonal level, a service mindset improves and strengthens relationships. And on a collective level, the purpose of all organizations is to serve the community in some way.

In the Age of Wisdom, business organizations and their leaders will be guided by **the principle of “service above self.”** In doing this, they’ll assume an increasing amount of social responsibility. Wise leaders understand that mature freedom isn’t freedom _from_ something—instead, it’s the freedom to serve the community and the members of your organization, express yourself with integrity, and offer your unique contribution to the world.

> **The Origins and Benefits of Service Leadership**
> 
> The service leadership orientation dovetails with Covey’s personal belief system: Service leadership, also known as “servant leadership,” underpins many cultural and religious leadership traditions. This style of leadership, in which the leader sees their most important function as serving others, entered the formal leadership literature in 1970 with Robert Greenleaf’s essay _The Servant as Leader_.
> 
> Service leadership has a range of benefits, including improved individual and team performance, especially in creativity and innovation; more altruistic and proactive employee behavior; increased collaboration and knowledge sharing; greater employee job satisfaction and psychological well-being; better customer service; and an increased sense of corporate social responsibility. Service leadership also increases employees’ trust in a leader, which (in Covey’s view) is the basis for all relationships in the organization.
